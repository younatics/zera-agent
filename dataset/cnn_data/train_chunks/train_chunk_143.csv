"(CNN) -- Film composer John Barry has died after an award-winning career spent writing the score for many movies, including 11 James Bond films, a friend said. Barry won Academy Awards for his work on ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990 and ""Out of Africa"" in 1985. He also won for ""The Lion in Winter"" in 1968 and ""Born Free"" in 1966, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was nominated in 1992 for his work on ""Chaplin"" and in 1971 for his work on ""Mary, Queen of Scots."" He also wrote the theme songs to 11 James Bond movies, according to United Agents, the agency that represented him. ""There was something elegantly effortless about the way John created seemingly simple tunes that were in fact very complex,"" said David Arnold, a friend and fellow Bond composer. ""The fact that these tunes went straight to your heart is just more evidence of the man's genius."" CNN's David Wilkinson contributed to this report .","Barry worked on the score to 11 James Bond films .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities announced charges Wednesday against 99 members of a transnational organized crime group in southern California called the Armenian Power, whose enterprise allegedly collected $20 million through kidnapping, extortion, bank fraud and narcotics trafficking. About 800 law enforcement officers on Wednesday arrested 74 of the 99 members and associates of the Armenian Power, which allegedly has ties to high-level crime figures in Armenia, Russia and Georgia, authorities said. The remainder are being sought, authorities said. In all, the crime group is believed to have more than 200 members, authorities said. ""This is a significant step in disrupting this organization,"" U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los Angeles said during a press conference. The charges came after a two-year investigation into the organization, according to local and federal authorities in the joint Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force. Two federal indictments unsealed Wednesday named 88 defendants linked to Armenian Power, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney has charged 11 more gang members in seven cases, authorities said. The Armenian Power also allegedly engaged in more than 400 acts of identity theft, credit card skimming, manufacturing counterfeit checks, bank fraud, health care fraud, marijuana distribution and illegal gambling, authorities said. Birotte said the group's crime schemes caused losses of $10 million in Orange County, California, and another $10 million in Los Angeles. Among the alleged conspiracies, Armenian Power members allegedly defrauded hundreds of customers of 99 Cents Only Stores when they secretly installed ""skimming"" devices to steal customer account information at cash registers and then used the information to make counterfeit debit and credit cards, authorities said. Managers at the 99 Cents Only Stores contacted authorities when they learned of the scheme, Birotte said. The fraud netted $2 million for the gang, authorities said. In the Orange County case, which names 20 defendants, Armenian Power members allegedly targeted elderly people in a bank fraud scheme, and members also worked with African-American street gangs and allegedly bribed bank insiders to gather information that allowed them to take over bank accounts, authorities said. Members of Armenian Power have a heritage going back to Armenia and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the crime group started as a street gang in East Hollywood, California, in the 1980s, authorities said. Members identify themselves with tattoos, graffiti and gang clothing, but the organization is more concerned with racketeering than controlling ""turf,"" authorities said. Armenian Power, also known as AP-13, has close ties with the prison gang Mexican Mafia, which controls much of the narcotics distribution in California's prisons, and maintains connections with Russian and Armenian crime figures known as ""Thieves-in-Law,"" authorities said. ""The indictments that target the Armenian Power organized crime enterprise provide a window into a group that appears willing to do anything and everything illegal to make a profit,"" Birotte said. ""These types of criminal organizations -- through the use of extortions, kidnappings and other violent acts -- have demonstrated a willingness to prey upon members of their own community."" In separate actions brought by federal authorities in Miami and Denver, and announced along with the Los Angeles indictments by the Department of Justice, 14 additional defendants, some of whom are linked to Armenian Power, were charged Wednesday with extortion, money laundering and fraud offenses, among other crimes, authorities said. ""The common denominator among these defendants and their criminal enterprises is their willingness to commit any crime for profit, and to use any means of violence and intimidation to further their goals,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said at a press conference held in the police department of Glendale, California, home to a large Armenian community. ""In less than one month, however, the department has undertaken the largest one-day takedown of La Cosa Nostra; a coordinated national effort against street gangs; and today, taken action against Armenian Power and others with ties to international organized crime,"" Breuer said, reading from a prepared statement. In one alleged kidnapping, several Armenian Power members forced a man to pay ransom by taking him to an auto body shop belonging to a group member and then threatening him with violence, authorities said. In an alleged extortion scheme lasting months, the victim and his family were forced to make repeated payments under threats, authorities said.","The Armenian Power has ties to Armenia, Russia and Georgia crime figures .

"(CNN) -- One returned to her Haitian roots, to give voice to women, honor their stories and shape their futures. Another urged women to pack a courtroom in Haiti, where she succeeded in getting a guilty verdict against a man who battered his wife. A third joined the others and helped change the law to make rape, long a political weapon in Haiti, a punishable crime. Myriam Merlet, Magalie Marcelin and Anne Marie Coriolan, founders of three of the country's most important advocacy organizations working on behalf of women and girls, are confirmed dead -- victims of last week's 7.0 earthquake. Remembering the victims of the Haiti earthquake . And their deaths have left members of the women's movement, Haitian and otherwise, reeling. ""Words are missing for me. I lost a large chunk of my personal, political and social life,"" Carolle Charles wrote in an e-mail to colleagues. The Haitian-born sociology professor at Baruch College in New York is chair of Dwa Fanm (meaning ""Women's Rights"" in Creole), a Brooklyn-based advocacy group. These women ""were my friends, my colleagues and my associates. I cannot envision going to Haiti without seeing them."" Myriam Merlet was until recently the chief of staff of Haiti's Ministry for Gender and the Rights of Women, established in 1995, and still served as a top adviser. She died after being trapped beneath her collapsed Port-au-Prince home, Charles said. She was 53. iReport: A tribute to Merlet . Merlet, an author as well as an activist, fled Haiti in the 1970s. She studied in Canada, steeping herself in economics, women's issues, feminist theory and political sociology. In the mid-1980s, she returned to her homeland. In ""Walking on Fire: Haitian Women's Stories of Survival and Resistance,"" published in 2001, she contributed an essay, ""The More People Dream,"" in which she described what brought her back. ""While I was abroad I felt the need to find out who I was and where my soul was. I chose to be a Haitian woman,"" she wrote. ""We're a country in which three-fourths of the people can't read and don't eat properly. I'm an integral part of the situation. I am not in Canada in a black ghetto, or an extraterrestrial from outer space. I am a Haitian woman. I don't mean to say that I am responsible for the problems. But still, as a Haitian woman, I must make an effort so that all together we can extricate ourselves from them."" She was a founder of Enfofamn, an organization that raises awareness about women through media, collects stories and works to honor their names. Among her efforts, she set out to get streets named after Haitian women who came before her, Charles said. Dubbed a ""Vagina Warrior,"" she was remembered Tuesday by her friend Eve Ensler, the award-winning playwright and force behind V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girls. ""She was very bold,"" said Ensler, who at Merlet's insistence brought her play ""The Vagina Monologues"" to Haiti and helped establish safe houses for women in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien. ""She had an incredible vision of what was possible for Haitian women, and she lifted their spirits. ... And we had such a wonderful time. I remember her dancing in the streets of New Orleans and just being so alive."" Magalie Marcelin, a lawyer and actress who appeared in films and on stage, established Kay Fanm, a women's rights organization that deals with domestic violence, offers services and shelter to women and makes microcredits, or loans, available to women working in markets, said Charles, the chair of Dwa Fanm. Charles remembered a visit to Haiti about two years ago when Marcelin, believed to be in her mid-50s, called seeking help. Hoping to deflect the political clout of a defendant in court, she asked for women to come out in droves and pack the courtroom. Charles watched as the man on trial was convicted for battering his wife. Her death has been reported through various media outlets, and was confirmed to CNN by Carribbean Radio Television based in Port-au-Prince. Her own daughter helped dig her body out from rubble in the aftermath of the quake, Charles said she learned when she got the call from Marcelin's cousin. In an interview last year with the Haitian Times, Marcelin spoke of the image of a drum that adorned public awareness stickers. ""It's very symbolic in the Haitian cultural imagination,"" Marcelin said, according to the Haitian Times report. ""The sound of the drum is the sound of freedom, it's the sound of slaves breaking with slavery."" With Merlet, Anne Marie Coriolan, 53, served as a top adviser to the women's rights ministry. Coriolan, who died when her boyfriend's home collapsed, was the founder of Solidarite Fanm Ayisyen (Solidarity with Haitian Women, or SOFA), which Charles described as an advocacy and services organization. Her daughter, Wani Thelusmon Coriolan, said in Haiti children bear only their father's surname, but her mother insisted on keeping her maiden name and making sure her two children shared it, too. ""She said my dad was not the only one who created me. She was involved, too,"" her 24-year-old daughter, who lives and is studying in Montreal, Quebec, said with a laugh. Even though Wani and her brother no longer live in Haiti (he is in Paris, France), she said her mother was determined to make sure they were proud of their homeland. ""She loved her country. She never stopped believing in Haiti. She said that when you have a dream you have to fight for it,"" Wani said. ""She wanted women to have equal rights. She wanted women to hold their heads high."" Coriolan was a political organizer who helped bring rape -- ""an instrument of terror and war,"" Charles said -- to the forefront of Haitian courts. Before 2005, rapes in Haiti were treated as nothing more than ""crimes of passion,"" Charles explained. That changed because of the collective efforts of these women activists -- and others they inspired. With the three leaders gone, there is concern about the future of Haiti's women and girls. Even with all that's been achieved, the struggle for equality and against violence remains enormous. The chaos that's taken over the devastated nation heightens those worries, said Taina Bien-Aimé, the executive director of Equality Now, a human rights organization dedicated to women. Before the disaster struck last week, a survey of Haitian women and girls showed an estimated 72 percent had been raped, according to study done by Kay Fanm. And at least 40 percent of the women surveyed were victims of domestic violence, Bien-Aimé said. And humanitarian emergencies have been linked to increased violence and exploitation in the past, she said. ""From where we stand,"" Bien-Aimé wrote in an e-mail, ""the most critical and urgent issue is what, if any, contingencies the relief/humanitarian agencies are putting in place not only to ensure that women have easy access to food, water and medical care, but to guarantee their protection."" Concerned women in the New York area plan to gather Wednesday to strategize their next steps, Ensler said. And while they will certainly keep mourning, she and the others are hopeful that Haitian women, inspired by these fallen heros and leaders, will forge ahead -- keeping their fight and legacies alive.","Three leaders in the Haitian women's movement are confirmed dead, victims of quake .

"Washington (CNN) -- Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta, the nation's only living Medal of Honor recipient for the current wars, is leaving the U.S. Army and will focus on his education, a spokesman said. Giunta will leave in mid-June of this year. He and his wife are planning to move to Fort Collins, Colorado, where he will continue his education using the GI Bill, said Todd Oliver, a spokesman for Giunta's unit in Italy. ""Those that know him are not surprised by this,"" said Lt. Col. Greg Hapgood of the Iowa National Guard. Giunta is an Iowa native and Hapgood acted as the family's point of contact during the media frenzy surrounding his medal. Giunta was awarded the Medal of Honor in November for his deeds in a fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan in October 2007. Giunta ""killed one of the guys who was dragging my team leader away, Sgt. (Josh) Brennan,"" Sgt. Franklin Eckrode, who was in the same squad, told CNN in November. ""Wounded another one. Recovered Sgt. Brennan. Brought him back to an area where we could secure him and continue the fight. Started the aid on him."" Every member of that platoon was struck by enemy fire that night. The medic, Spc. Hugo Mendoza of El Paso, Texas, was killed. Giunta was hit twice by bullets: One hit his armored vest, the other hit a weapon on his back. Neither caused serious injuries. Giunta went back to work with his unit moments after the attack ended. He served two tours in Afghanistan over seven years. Giunta has been honored a number of times since President Barack Obama awarded him the nation's highest award for valor, most recently at Sunday's Super Bowl in Texas. Giunta joined the Army in 2003 while working at a neighborhood fast-food shop. He went into an Army recruiting station to get a free T-shirt and decided to enlist. Giunta was a specialist serving with the Airborne 503rd Infantry Regiment when his unit was attacked on the night of October 25, 2007, by Taliban fighters who barraged the Americans with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades and Soviet-era large machine guns. According to Defense Department documents, Giunta saw several of his fellow soldiers go down. He ran forward, throwing grenades and returning enemy fire, to help one soldier who had been shot but was still fighting, the documents say. Then he noticed one of the wounded soldiers was missing. Searching for his wounded friend, Brennan, Giunta ran over a hill where, moments before, Taliban fighters had been shooting at him. He was alone, out of sight of his fellow soldiers, in an area that the Taliban had controlled just moments before. Two Taliban fighters were dragging Brennan away. Giunta ran after them, killing one and wounding the other, who ran off. Giunta instantly started providing first aid to Brennan, who later died of his wounds. Giunta's action, however, meant that Brennan was not at the mercy of the Taliban, and his parents would be able to give him a proper burial instead of wondering what became of him. Even though he's leaving the Army, Giunta is entitled to a number of special benefits reserved for Medal of Honor recipients, including a monthly Veterans Affairs pension of more than $1,100 a month for life as well as an invitation to every presidential inauguration and inauguration party.","Sgt.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A winter storm spread snow across the Southeast and the Tennessee Valley for the second time in two weeks early Thursday, dumping more than 6 inches in parts of the region. The National Weather Service had warned that snow accumulation in some areas, combined with freezing temperatures, could lead to hazardous driving conditions. The system was dropping sleet and rain in addition to snow. By late Thursday morning, winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories that had been in effect in 10 states had largely expired, remaining in effect only in eastern North Carolina. Hard freeze warnings had stretched from Texas' border with Mexico into Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Mississippi. Even as those alerts expired, the Weather Service put new hard freeze warnings in place for Friday morning in central Mississippi, southeast Louisiana and southern Texas. The agency had warned that snow accumulation in some areas, combined with freezing temperatures, could lead to hazardous driving conditions late Wednesday and into Thursday morning. The system was dropping sleet and rain in addition to snow. ""I've been here a long time and I've never seen anything like it,"" said Sharon Hickman, who manages Back Yard Burgers in Tupelo, Mississippi. Nearly a half foot of snow fell in Tupelo. Freezing temperatures Thursday morning made Hickman's commute to work ""scary."" ""There was a lot of slipping and sliding and cars in ditches,"" said Mischel Wright, who manages Log Cabin Family Restaurant in Rogers, Arkansas. ""My grandchildren love it. Me, there's nothing I can do about it. It's all God. You just have to deal with it."" In Atlanta, however, drivers were relieved to find the metropolitan area received only a dusting of snow and the roads were mostly clear Thursday morning as the temperature hovered around freezing. About a half-inch had fallen in the city, with up to an inch elsewhere and up to 2 inches in the northern part of the state. Accumulation was mainly restricted to grassy areas. Nearly the entire northern half of Alabama had received snow by 11 p.m. Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate WBRC. Snowfalls of at least an inch were reported, with the heaviest snowfall in west Alabama. Many offices and schools across the South delayed opening or were to remain closed Thursday. The weather system dumped significant levels of snow and ice on Missouri and Oklahoma, along with parts of Kentucky, Arkansas and the panhandle of Texas on Wednesday. In Arkansas, youngsters got a chance to work on their sledding skills Wednesday, because schools were closed in advance of the approaching system. The snow fell for nine hours in Hot Springs, according to CNN affiliate KATV. Some sections of the state got up to 2 feet of snow, the Weather Service said. Wright and her husband checked into a motel in Rogers before the storm so she could make it to work at the Log Cabin Family Restaurant. ""We can't go home because we can't navigate the hills,"" Wright said Thursday morning. Neither could those customers who live too far away from the restaurant to walk. ""Yesterday afternoon we did have two or three families with kids that were going nuts,"" Wright said. ""I don't know what today's going to be like."" In parts of Kansas and Kentucky, road crews hustled to clear snow from interstates and highways Wednesday. Snow fell furiously; wind pushed it sideways and at times the sky took on the look of a white-out. This forced travelers to slow their pace to a crawl. Dangerous conditions near Newton, Kentucky, prevented vehicles from getting traction on hills and sent some sliding off roads and into gullies and ravines. Snow closed schools in parts of Missouri as well. About 2 inches of snow fell in Kansas City, Missouri, but it was enough to cause several accidents and cover roads in the southeast part of the state. Parts of Oklahoma received up to 12 inches of snow, according to the state Department of Emergency Management. The National Weather Service reported up to 2 feet of snow in remote areas. O.D. Powell, owner of OD's Fastop in Claremont, Oklahoma, said Thursday the beer delivery truck is now 10 days behind schedule. ""I have a grocery delivery that comes out of Texas,"" Powell said. ""The driver called yesterday from Oklahoma City and said he couldn't make it . As the snow fell in the heartland Wednesday, wind chills were 10 to 30 degrees below zero in some areas, and authorities urged people to stay off the roads. Not all travelers were able to heed that warning, and traffic inched slowly along icy interstates. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol worked in conjunction with the National Guard to rescue stranded motorists using heavy Humvees, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. Wind chills across the northern and central Plains were well below freezing early Thursday. At least two people were killed near Miami, Oklahoma, which is close to Oklahoma City. A truck plunged 80 feet off a bridge along Interstate 44. Police told KOCO that the driver lost control on an icy bridge, flipped over the railing and landed upright on the riverbed below. At least five survivors were able to climb out of the sun roof and wait for rescue on top of the vehicle. Earlier, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said 80 people in Oklahoma had been injured as a result of the storm. That total included 63 falls, one carbon monoxide poisoning, 14 injuries in traffic accidents and two ""cut/pierce injuries."" Dallas-area volunteers for Meals on Wheels, an aid organization that delivers prepared food to housebound people, worked nonstop to get extra meals ready before snow and icy conditions closed roads, according to CNN affiliate KTVT. The weather system that closed Dallas last week left the group unable to reach its customers for four days. Tom Hauser, with the Collin County Committee on Aging, which runs the Meals on Wheels program, told KTVT Wednesday. ""We've already delivered over 2,500 meals in the last two days that are nutritious meals."" The latest storm came barely a week after another record-setting weather system pummeled the Plains and Midwest. Last week's historic storm left its mark on at least 30 states, dumping about 2 feet of snow on the Chicago area and prompting Oklahoma's governor to declare a state of emergency. Another winter system at the end of the week left central and southern Texas a mess. Hundreds of flights were canceled as the winter weather threatened the plans of Super Bowl enthusiasts headed for the game last Sunday in Arlington, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.","Several inches of snow fall in some areas of the South .

"(CNN) -- Boarding teams from the British Navy frigate HMS Cornwall rescued five Yemeni fishermen and captured 17 Somali pirates last week during a rescue operation the Gulf of Aden, the Royal Navy confirmed Tuesday. The hostages were the original crew of a fishing dhow who had been held hostage aboard their Yemeni-flagged vessel for 92 days, the Royal Navy said in a statement. Since taking the dhow on November 11, 2010, the pirates used it as a ""mother ship"" for raiding operations, equipping three skiffs with powerful outboard motors, ladders and other paraphernalia, according to the statement. The rescue operation was carried out Thursday by boarding teams from the Cornwall, supported by Lynx helicopters, according to the statement. The frigate had received a distress call from a South Korean merchant vessel in the area, whose crew had become suspicious of the dhow's actions. After rescuing the fishing crew and apprehending their captors, the Cornwall restored the vessel to its rightful Yemeni owners, the Royal Navy said. Cmdr. David Wilkinson of the Cornwall described the action as a ""very slick boarding operation which has ensured that this pirate vessel is no longer able to operate"" and restored the crew to their families. The Cornwall is part of the Combined Maritime Forces, a multinational naval partnership operating in the Gulf of Aden under U.N. Security Council resolutions ""to disrupt piracy and armed robbery at sea,"" and to assist regional partners in developing the capabilities to protect shipping in waters beset by pirates in recent years, the Royal Navy said.","17 pirates were apprehended, five fishermen freed after 3 months' captiviity .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, stock car racing's last great roughneck hit the wall and the wall won.  Dale Earnhardt would not grow old and slow, clogging up life's left lane. He would not gracefully slide into a senior citizenship of driving to the Wal-Mart in a Grand Marquis with plastic flowers waving from the antenna. He would die a legend's death at the age of 49, on the last turn of the last lap of the greatest race his kind knows. He died running, as he used to put it, WFO -- Wide (Bleeping) Open. In third place of the 2001 Daytona 500, shielding the two cars ahead of him -- both owned by him, and one driven by his namesake son -- Earnhardt yielded not an inch of asphalt. Sterling Marlin bumped him ever so slightly from the rear, and in the ensuing chain reaction of bumper cars at 160 mph, Earnhardt's famous black No. 3 Chevy was sent up the track and nose-first into the wall. The sport had seen a thousand worse-looking wrecks in which everyone walked away angry but unmarked. Something was bad wrong with this one, though. Witnesses knew it immediately after the driver was lifted from the wreckage and rushed to the hospital, when workers draped a tarp over Earnhardt's car like cops covering a body at a crime scene. Two hours later, NASCAR President Mike Helton faced the world and announced, ""We've lost Dale Earnhardt."" At the 10-year mark of the death of a seven-time Sprint Cup (formerly Winston Cup) champion, there will be many tributes laid at the feet of Earnhardt's memory. Some will come from the television booth on February 20 at the next running of the Daytona 500. NASCAR's tribute to Earnhardt . ""Dale Earnhardt was to NASCAR what Elvis Presley was to rock-and-roll,"" said Larry McReynolds, Earnhardt's crew chief when he won his only Daytona 500 in 1998, and currently a racing broadcaster with Fox. ""When Elvis passed, rock-and-roll didn't stop, but it was different. After Dale died, racing didn't stop. We trudged on to Rockingham five days later. But it was different. It's still different today."" This morbid anniversary also is a milepost at which to slow for just a moment and consider how Earnhardt's sport has radically changed in the decade since his death. In doing that, those who came to racing with him may well find themselves missing Earnhardt all over again. One positive consequence: The sport is definitely safer. Earnhardt's was the fourth death suffered on a NASCAR track in nine months. There have been no on-track deaths in NASCAR's three major series in the 10 years since his death.  Losing Earnhardt this way was to NASCAR what losing Michael Jordan to a heart attack in mid-dunk would have been to the NBA. The soul-search that followed the death of racing's biggest star resulted in extensive revisions in NASCAR's safety practices. Mandatory now is a head and neck restraint system that might have saved Earnhardt from his fatal basilar skull fracture. And the pace quickened on installing so-called ""soft wall"" technology at tracks, barriers that absorb more of the force of a collision. Over that same period, NASCAR has seen its popularity seemingly peak. Once the hottest growth property on the sporting landscape, it has faced a steady erosion in television ratings and track attendance. In the four years since NASCAR signed a multibillion-dollar media deal, average race viewership has fallen from 7.85 million at its height to 5.99 million last year, according to the Sports Business Journal. In a time of tight money, there were more gaps apparent in the circuit's grandstands in 2010. The attendance still can be huge, and television viewership is surpassed only by the NFL, but the drops are noticeable. With 140,000 at last year's Brickyard 400, that throng still was roughly half that of the 2007 race. No one has pinned the slump on Earnhardt's death. Rather, that tragedy is coincidental to a general loss of connection between the old-school, rank-and-file fan and a sport that had seemed to homogenize both its cars and its drivers. What died February 18, 2001, was an important bit of racing's soul. ""Dale Earnhardt's story is really the story of so many of the great drivers in NASCAR history, someone who came up really tough,"" said Daniel Pierce, head of the history department at the University of North Carolina-Asheville and author of ""Real NASCAR: White Lightning, Red Clay and Big Bill France."" Earnhardt, the son of dirt track campaigner Ralph Earnhardt, was a ninth-grade dropout, divorced twice before he was 30, a subsistence racer early in his career who took mill work and cleaned industrial boilers to keep himself fed. ""There were times,"" Earnhardt once told an interviewer, ""we probably should have been on welfare."" He'd become fabulously wealthy, a shrewd capitalist who, as McReynolds said, ""proved to drivers that it was a business, too."" He was the Bill Gates of personal branding. Still, many of those in the infield continued to see themselves in him. ""Here's a guy who really lived a classic country music song, Pierce said. ""His whole persona early on was very rough around the edges. For a lot of people -- particularly the traditional NASCAR fans, the people who really grew up with it -- it was really something visceral with them. This was more than just a pastime; it was a metaphor for life. And here's someone who lived this very rough existence, who was on the fringes of society, who succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams."" Earnhardt drove as if his next meal depended on being out front, even when it didn't. He was one hard-charging SOB, a signature moment coming in 1999 when he spun-out Terry Labonte on the final lap to win at Bristol. ""I wasn't trying to wreck him, I just wanted to rattle his cage,"" The Intimidator said then in one of his classic utterances. Back when they both were racing, Darrell Waltrip once declared, ""With Earnhardt, every lap is a controlled crash."" The face of NASCAR used to have the sharp features of a bird of prey, possessing also this moustache-thatched smirk that told media he was not a man for idle chatter and warned other drivers not to get too comfortable when he put that big black car six inches off their rear quarterpanel. Now that face belongs to the impeccable Jimmie Johnson, no less driven to win, a Sprint Cup champion five years running, but as buttoned down as a Savile Row suit. Like a good many of his generation of drivers, Johnson came up on the sunnier side of the middle class, a kid who cut his teeth on speed by racing motorcycles in the California desert with the support of hard-working parents. Where Earnhardt would spar with media and NASCAR officials alike, Johnson's public presence is seamless. He has done well for himself off the track as well, marrying a former Wilhelmina model six years ago. The couple had their first child last year. For those who would draw too stark a contrast between Johnson and Earnhardt, McReynolds cautions, ""Fans see (Johnson's) beautiful wife, his beautiful child, the big motorcoach, the jet airplane. They don't realize his mom drove a school bus and his dad worked on heavy machinery to take him motocross racing. ""We have to put it on our (the broadcasters') shoulders to help bring back the personalities of who these drivers are."" Earnhardt's was a two-sided mystique. His ability to polarize a grandstand is unmatched today. What is forgotten in the lionization that naturally follows death is the counter-Earnhardt culture that drove much of NASCAR's passion. After Earnhardt's death, fans paid homage to his No. 3 by standing and holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every race. Pierce fondly recalls the first race he went to -- Bristol, 1994 -- and one particular nearby fan who rose every time Earnhardt drove past. And this man required only one finger to salute the driver. ""There were a number of fans who would pull for anybody who would beat Earnhardt,"" McReynolds said. The history prof and race fan says there are a couple drivers who could fit the role of black hat in today's weekly on-track dramas: Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski, both known to get sideways with the spectators. Tony Stewart also can rouse some rabble. Still, there is no one who can fan the flames of partisanship like Earnhardt did. And Dale Jr., well, he has yet to fill his father's firesuit. His inherited popularity has not translated to great performance. The last of his 18 Sprint Cup victories came 93 races ago (2008) and he has missed the series' season-ending chase for the championship the last two years. His father's death ""is part of a process that NASCAR is really suffering from now,"" Pierce said. ""They may have appealed to some new fans but I think those people's commitment is very shallow. There are people the sport has lost who once felt racing was akin to religion. ""I've been to (Kentucky's) Rupp Arena, to (North Carolina's) Carmichael Auditorium. I went to Alabama and have seen Alabama-Auburn football. I've seen people passionate about their sports. But the thing that caught my eye when I first went to races was how that was even more characteristic of NASCAR. ""I don't quite see that as much anymore."" They can hang luxury condos from the rim of the tracks. They can expand beyond racing's motherland of the old South, introduce a new playoff-like format and even bring Toyota into the all-American mix. But while the sport gets all clean and corporate, the traditional race fans just want to find that one good ol' driver who can make them care. That one personality who will inspire them to carve out a few precious days off, pack up the truck with beer and barbeque and blow the budget to watch the cars go fast ... turn left ... and repeat.","Stock car racing legend Dale Earnhardt died February 18, 2001 .

"(CNN) -- Accused Tucson gunman Jared Lee Loughner has been indicted on 49 counts including murder and attempted murder that stem from a shooting that left six people dead and critically wounded Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. A grand jury had indicted Loughner, 22, on three counts of attempted murder, including one alleging that he tried to kill Giffords with a Glock semiautomatic handgun during an event for constituents at a Tucson grocery store in January. Giffords is currently undergoing rehabilitation at a medical facility in Houston, Texas. The new indictment, returned by a federal grand jury Thursday, includes those three charges and adds murder charges connected to the deaths of John M. Roll, a federal district judge, and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords. He also faces charges in the deaths of Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and a child, referred to in the indictment as C-T G. Nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green was among those killed in the shooting. A charge of attempted assassination of a member of Congress also is among the 49 counts. ""The deceased are not the only ones whose rights are being defended,"" U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke said in a news release. ""Those citizens who were peaceably assembled to speak to their member of Congress are also named victims in this indictment."" The indictment carries a potential death sentence if convicted, Burke added, although prosecutors have not said yet whether they will seek the death penalty. ""We will seek justice for the federal officials, Judge Roll and Gabriel M. Zimmerman, and for Dorothy J. Morris, Phyllis C. Schneck, Dorwan C. Stoddard, and C-T G,"" Burke said. The alleged gunman previously had faced two murder charges in the deaths of Roll and Zimmerman, but in a procedural maneuver, prosecutors had temporarily dropped those charges, bringing them back under the superseding indictment. Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, is expected to be arraigned on the new charges March 9 in Tucson, the district attorney's office said. Also Friday, Giffords' office released a picture of her taken the morning of the shooting. The congresswoman is seen standing in front of the grocery store, talking to constituents identified by her office as Jim and Doris Tucker. Jim Tucker was shot twice, once in his calf and once in his collarbone, according to CNN affiliate KOLD. His wife escaped unharmed. ""I've wondered since the very beginning, 'Why wasn't I shot?' but I just take it as a miracle from God that I wasn't, for some purpose,"" Doris Tucker has told the network.","NEW: Rep.

"(CNN) -- In the heart of the bustling capital of Cairo, Egypt, a lone female taxi driver navigates her bright yellow cab through the unforgiving traffic. ""I wanted to take this adventure, as I consider it an adventure, rather than an experience. Thank God, I believe it is a nice adventure so far and I feel happy with it,"" Inas Hassan Ali says. Ali is one of only eight female cab drivers in a city where the profession is dominated by men. ""For me, it's a very normal job, and there is nothing wrong for women to try to join a field of work that we deem as male-dominated. I see nothing wrong with that if the woman has the required skills and abilities,"" Ali says. Female cab drivers started appearing in Cairo's streets only earlier this year. While some welcome the transition, Ali is facing many challenges. ""Still the society is not used to such an idea -- that a woman joins a field of work that was only limited to men. And still there are some people who see it as strange. On the other hand, others get curious and wonder: how did you enter this area of work and why?"" Ali says. One factor that makes it difficult for women to break into a male-dominated profession is the high rate of sexual harassment in the country. In a recent report, the Egyptian Centre for Women's Right (ECWR) concluded that 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign women in Egypt have experienced sexual harassment in some way or another. ""It's usual here in Egypt that women get subject to some minor acts when they drive a car. ... Some encourage and show support for me. Others act by trying to block my way to show they are more skillful drivers and to prove that it's a male-dominated job,"" Ali says. However for an enthusiastic Ali, the rewards of her profession move beyond gender politics. ""I am most interested in making my clients best satisfied at the end of the trip, regardless of their gender, as the common impression is that women are bad drivers,"" she says. ""To have both men and women as my clients and make them feel comfortable is the greatest success for me.""","Inas Hassan Ali is one of only eight female cab drivers in Cairo .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least 17 artifacts from the Egyptian Museum of Cairo are missing following a break-in, the country's minister of antiquities said Sunday. The missing objects include a gilded wood statue of King Tutankhamun being carried by a goddess; parts of a gilded wood statue of Tutankhamun harpooning; a limestone statue of Akhenaten; a statue of Nefertiti making offerings; a sandstone head of an Amarna princess; a stone statuette of a scribe from Amarna; 11 wooden shabti statuettes of Yuya; and a heart scarab of Yuya. The discovery that the ancient treasures are missing came after museum staff took an inventory, Zahi Hawass said in a statement. The police and army plan to question people who are already in custody, Hawass said. Hawass earlier told CNN that ""criminals"" had broken into the museum on the night of January 28, not long after protests against President Hosni Mubarak began in Cairo and other major Egyptian cities. Mubarak resigned on Friday. Hawass said January 31 the intruders had vandalized statues and display cases and stolen jewelry from the museum gift shop. A number of suspects were apprehended shortly after the break-in, some of them with antiquities in their possession, Hawass said. The army and private citizens fanned out to protect Egypt's museums as the unrest spread. ""The Egyptian people are absolutely wonderful,"" said Jan Summers Duffy, an Egyptologist at the College of Idaho and curator at the Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History. She said when the break-in was announced that she believed they can be counted on to defend museums and archaeological sites. Another expert said that given the widespread poverty in a country home to so many priceless treasures, it was little surprise that there was some looting. ""With 80 million people in a country that suffers from poverty and rising food prices ... you have to expect that some people are going to be desperate and look for any means necessary to try to improve their lot,"" said Kara Cooney, assistant professor of Egyptian art and architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, and host of the Discovery Channel's ""Out of Egypt."" But, she said, for every one of those, there are a thousand Egyptians who will defend ancient treasures. ""The people who are best able to protect these monuments are already there on the ground,"" she said. ""... I just have to hope and trust that they're able to do what they can."" CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","At least 17 artifacts are missing from the Egypt Museum, Zahi Hawass says .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptians on Saturday cleared burned cars, garbage and debris that accumulated over 18 days at Tahrir Square, a sign that Cairo and the rest of the country were ready to rebuild and get back to work while the country formulates a plan for governance. A day after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, employees and businesses readied themselves for Sunday, the traditional start of the work week. The country's stock market is expected to reopen Wednesday. Wael Ghonim, a cyberactivist who is a Google executive on leave, wrote Friday on his Twitter account, ""Dear Egyptians, Go back to your work on Sunday, work like never before and help Egypt become a developed country."" Volunteers repainted black-and-white-striped street curbs around a monument by the Egyptian Museum, which had been on the front line in street battles between Mubarak's foes and supporters. Police were starting to move barricades and trying to restore vehicle traffic at Tahrir Square, where many protesters vowed to remain. ""It's time to start rebuilding the country,"" protester Yehya Kheireldin said, pointing to the hundreds of volunteers armed with brooms who are sweeping away the debris left by the sit-in. In the immediate future, the military -- largely respected by Egyptians -- will have to grapple with guiding the country of more than 80 million people through the transition amid massive problems of unemployment and considerable economic underdevelopment, said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman, who is based in Cairo. Former Egyptian Trade Minister Rachid Mohammed Rachid recently told CNN that the new government must show it is business-friendly. The African nation virtually shut down during the unrest, losing vital tourism dollars as well. CNN's Nic Robertson reported Saturday that citizens who make their living off foreign tourists are angry. ""Young boys 17 years old and 18 years old, they want to say, 'We are hungry, we want to eat, we want to work,' "" said businessman Ayman el Myonir. Businessmen near the famed Pyramids say about 50,000 people are employed in the tourism industry, Robertson reported. ""We try to help each other. We would like to put our hands together, and to help each other,"" said el Myonir. As thousands reveled in their improbable revolution, the nation's newly appointed military caretakers laid out priorities Saturday geared at establishing stability, though they revealed little to elucidate the future. The Armed Forces Supreme Council said it was committed to a democratic process resulting in civilian rule, but urged respect for the reviled police forces that had brutally clashed with protesters in the early days of the uprising. ""The armed forces council calls on the people to cooperate with the policemen,"" Lt. Gen. Sami Anan, who some see as a potential presidential candidate, said on state television. ""We ask our policemen to adhere to their slogan: Police is at the people's service."" It was unclear whether the statement signaled a return of the police security apparatus, noticeably absent from the streets after the violent clashes and the deployment of the army. CNN's Arwa Damon visited a coffee shop in central Cairo, where patrons said they now feel free to speak honestly about Egypt's political problems. ""I am happy and sad,"" said Fateh, a customer. ""I am sad because this is the president who carried us through wars and tough times."" He said the turning point came when Mubarak supporters rode horses and camels into the Tahrir Square crowd. The military, meanwhile, announced measures geared toward establishing stability after the abrupt death of a 30-year dictatorship in the Arab world's most populous nation. Anan, the armed forces chief of staff, said Egypt would still honor international treaties and commitments, a statement perhaps aimed at calming a jittery Israel that has quietly watched dramatic change unfold in its Arab ally. ""Egypt is a country of institutions and it honors its legal obligations,"" Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian ambassador to the United States, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Saturday. The revolution is something ""all Egyptians are proud of,"" the diplomat said . Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979. The Israelis on Saturday welcomed the Egyptian statement and Defense Minister Ehud Barak spoke on the phone with his Egyptian counterpart Hussein Tantawi, who heads the supreme council, the Israeli Defense Ministry said. ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is confident in Egypt's potential, institutions and people to successfully go through these difficult times,"" Anan said. But as thousands of people still celebrated on the streets, the army's first statement since Mubarak's departure did little to spell out how long Egypt would remain under military rule. ""They want to see structural change,"" Parag Khanna of the Global Governance Initiative told CNN Saturday. ""They want to see a change in the Constitution. They want to see democracy. That speech did not tell them any of those things."" Thousands of Egyptians were in a still electric Tahrir Square Saturday, vowing to stay there until, as one protester put it, ""Egypt is ruled by a civil government, not a military one."" A marble memorial was going up to remember those who died in the 18-day uprising. Human Rights Watch has documented 302 deaths, a number the monitoring group called conservative. Kheireldin said an ""unspoken plan"" had been reached between the military and a group of protest organizers to take down barricades and tents in Tahrir Square, even though some people wanted to hold out longer. Tantawi, the head of the military's supreme council, has a controversial reputation among the armed forces and had been derided by midlevel officers as ""Mubarak's poodle"" for his fawning over the now-ousted president, according to U.S. diplomatic cables sent from the Cairo embassy in 2008 and published by WikiLeaks. The Constitution allows for only two scenarios for a head of state to relinquish power. The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily, the vice president steps into the top role. That is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday. If the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled, the Constitution states that the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held. Those elections, in turn, must occur within 60 days. In opting for a third way, which put all power in the hands of the military, the Mubarak regime in effect rendered the Constitution inoperable. Shawee El-Sayed, an independent member of Egypt's parliament and an expert on the country's Constitution, said Mubarak's move to transfer power to the military left Suleiman without an official role. ""The next step the council must (decide) is whether or not to validate the Constitution -- otherwise there will be a constitutional vacuum,"" he said. Saturday, Anan, the supreme council's spokesman, said the current government would remain in place until a new one could be formed. State television reported, citing a judiciary source, that several high-ranking government officials, including the former prime minister and interior minister, were facing lawsuits and were barred from traveling out of the country. U.S. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition as it attempted to better gauge the unfolding situation. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, plans to visit key U.S. allies Israel and Jordan this weekend, a Pentagon official told CNN Saturday. Under Secretary of State Bill Burns was already in Jordan meeting with King Abdullah, the State Department said. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke with Tantawi on Saturday, the sixth phone conversation with the minister since the start of the Egypt uprising, a Defense Department spokesman said. It was the first call since Mubarak stepped down. Among other things, Egyptian authorities need to set about ""protecting the rights of Egypt's citizens, lifting the emergency law, revising the Constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible, and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free,"" Obama said. But some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military, which has suddenly become accountable for the nation. Analysts with Stratfor, a global intelligence company, said Egypt had essentially experienced a coup. ""Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers,"" the Stratfor statement said. ""The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts."" But even as officials hash out the details of Egypt's murky political future, its people power rippled throughout the region. In the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, protesters chanted: ""Yesterday Tunisia, today Egypt, tomorrow Yemen will open the prison."" And in restive Algeria, anti-government protesters chanted ""Change the power."" Security forces clashed with the crowds. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN that the country's ""democraticization procession is well on track."" King Abdullah II swore in a new government Wednesday.

"(Mashable)  -- The next generation of the iPhone and iPad will sport a new version of Apple's A4 chip with a dual-core graphics processing unit that should enable even higher resolutions on these devices, as well as support for HD (1080p) video playback, AppleInsider reports citing sources familiar with the matter. More precisely, the chip in question should be a dual-core SGX543 GPU from Imagination Technologies.

"(Mashable) -- Nintendo could be revealing a HD successor to the Wii console this summer, according to new reports. There hasn't been a new gaming console since the launch of the Wii and PlayStation 3 in November 2006. However, Microsoft has breathed new life into its console, the Xbox 360, thanks to the Kinect. The Wii, which has been best the best-selling console for years, is about to lose its first place position. While Nintendo intends to respond to the Xbox threat by cutting the Wii's price next month, it looks like the gaming company has another trick up its sleeve: a brand new HD console. According to Game Informer's sources, Nintendo plans to unveil a new console at the E3 conference in Los Angeles in June or potentially sooner. Very little is known about the rumored console, not even the name (Wii 2? Wii HD? Wii 360?), but it's likely to be more powerful than the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3, according to Kotaku. Nintendo has apparently been showing off the system to third-party developers so they can prepare titles for the console's eventual launch in late 2012. The Wii captured the hearts and minds of casual gamers with its innovative controller system and its lower price point, but the specs and visuals of its rival consoles are far stronger, giving them greater longevity. Microsoft has also mitigated the Wii's advantage with causal gamers, thanks to Kinect. Perhaps that's what is driving Nintendo's rumored decision to be first on the market with a new console. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A mother died trying to protect her daughter when a tornado hit her home, a Louisiana mayor said, one of at least two twisters tied to a weather system that's caused major damage in the state and wreaked havoc on Mardi Gras festivities. Rayne, Louisiana, Mayor James ""Jimbo"" Petitjean told reporters that the 21-year-old woman, who was not identified, was killed when a tree fell on her house. Her daughter is ""doing fine, from what we heard,"" he said. ""It's unfortunate, and that's where we really need your prayers,"" Petijean said. The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes hit that city, about 80 miles west of Baton Rouge, and the nearby city of Crowley on Saturday morning. In addition to the mother who died, at least 11 were hurt when the twister struck Rayne at about 10 a.m., according to Police Chief Carroll Stelly. Packing winds between 111 and 135 mph, the tornado was 300 yards wide and produced damage over a 5-mile stretch, according to the weather service. The northwest section of Rayne was especially hard hit, with video from CNN affiliate KATC showing several buildings leveled, lots reduced to rubble and large trees knocked down. Petijean said the city's electricity infrastructure was badly damaged, with power going out for all its 10,000 residents soon after the tornado came through. The mayor said he hoped electricity could be restored to 80% of the city by day's end, as utility workers try to rework the grid to maximize access. In addition, several houses were knocked off their foundations and there were reports of gas leaks, which led to mandatory evacuations of about 1,500 residents in the city's northwest, Petijean said. Emergency personnel went door-to-door to make sure everyone had left their homes, state police Trooper Stephen Hammons said. The mayor said a curfew is being imposed in part of the city, with people asked to stay indoors until 6 a.m. Sunday while authorities check to ensure all is safe. Some of those evacuated are being cared for by the Red Cross. The impact zone is an area about one to two square miles, said Rayne police dispatcher Whitney Thibodaux. Among the buildings affected were a public housing units and Rayne High School, with damage to the computer room, library and gym. Three people, meanwhile, suffered injuries when the twister hit Crowley, according to the National Weather Service. Debris was reported along a 2-mile-long damage path on Interstate 10, and there was damage to a Waffle House, car wash and several residences. About 150 miles to the east, meanwhile, revelers and residents of New Orleans were soaked much of Saturday as steady rains fell on the city. This weekend -- the last one before Ash Wednesday -- is traditionally one of the busiest in The Big Easy, with people partying and enjoying Mardi Gras festivities. The inclement weather forced several changes to the Mardi Gras schedule, including the delay of the Krewe of Endymion parade from Saturday to Sunday, according to a release from the New Orleans Police Department. Other parade-related festivities were pushed up to start earlier Saturday, given the rain-soaked forecast for Saturday afternoon and beyond. The rain stopped later Saturday in New Orleans and the weather service's forecast called for sunny conditions Sunday, with high temperatures in the lower 60s. A flood advisory remains in effect through Monday morning for numerous communities along the Mississippi River, including parts of Chicot and Desha counties in Arkansas; Adams, Bolivar, Isaquena, Washington, Madison and Wilkinson counties in Mississippi; and Claiborne, East Caroll, Jefferson, Tensas and Warren parishes in Louisiana. There were also flood warnings in effect for the Atchafalaya River at Morgan City, Louisiana, through Sunday afternoon;  the Tchefuncte River in Covington, Louisiana, through Monday at noon; and the Bogue Falaya River at Camp Covington, Louisiana, through Tuesday morning.

"(CNN) -- Around 1,000 people accused of being witches in Gambia have been locked up in secret detention centers and forced to drink a dangerous hallucinogenic potion, according to human rights organization Amnesty International. Amnesty claims Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, pictured in 2006, invited ""witch doctors"" to the West African nation. At least two people have died after drinking the liquid while many more have suffered serious kidney problems. Others suffered injuries as a result of being severely beaten, Amnesty said Wednesday as it called on authorities to ""put an immediate stop to the witch-hunting campaign."" Amnesty claimed Gambian President Yahya Jammeh had invited ""witch doctors"" -- believed to be from neighboring Guinea -- to the West African nation  following the death of his aunt. Jammeh, a former soldier who has ruled Gambia since leading a military coup in 1994, is reported to believe that witchcraft was involved in her death, according to Amnesty. CNN contacted State House, the presidential residence in the Gambian capital, Banjul, but no-one was available to comment. ""I have no information,"" a woman told CNN. Victims and their relatives tell Amnesty that ""witch doctors"" accompanied by police, soldiers and security forces have been visiting villages and seizing people accused of being witches by force and at gunpoint. Members of Jammeh's personal guard, known as ""green boys,"" are also alleged to have taken part in the campaign. In the most recent incident on March 9, 300 people from the village of Sintet were forced to go to a farm owned by Jammehk, Amnesty said. One of those seized said he had been held for five days and forced to drink ""dirty water"" containing poisonous herbs which caused instant diarrhoea and vomiting. ""I experienced and witnessed such abuse and humiliation. I cannot believe that this type of treatment is taking place in Gambia. It is from the dark ages,"" the victim told Amnesty. Hundreds of Gambians have also fled to neighboring Senegal following attacks on their villages, according to Amnesty. It also said it was concerned that a prominent opposition lawmaker, Halifa Sallah, who was arrested earlier this month after investigating the witchcraft claims for a newspaper, could be at risk of being tortured while in custody. Halifa, a former presidential candidate, heads the People's Democratic Organization of Independence and Socialism and is minority leader in Gambia's national assembly.","Amnesty International: 1,000 seized in Gambia in ""witch-hunt"" campaign .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the high-profile suicide of a gay Rutgers University student last fall, the New Jersey college will implement gender-neutral housing in an attempt to make the university more inclusive. Twenty to 30 students will participate in a pilot program during the 2011-12 school year, which will allow students to choose their roommates regardless of gender. Three dormitories in New Brunswick, New Jersey, will be part of the pilot program, a Rutgers spokesman said. Students must apply to live in the gender-neutral rooms, which will be reserved for sophomores, juniors and seniors. ""This has been under discussion for a long time,"" university officials said in a statement. ""In the aftermath of the Clementi tragedy, members of the university's LGBTQ community told the administration that gender-neutral housing would help create an even more inclusive environment. Since then, the university has been exploring this in greater detail."" Tyler Clementi, 18, jumped from the George Washington Bridge in September after two other Rutgers students allegedly videotaped a sexual encounter between him and another man and posted the video online. ""Maybe the outcome would have been different if he had been able to choose his own roommate,"" said Yousef Saleh, 22, president of the Rutgers University Student Assembly. ""At least now there's an option."" Rutgers junior Ryan Harrington, 21, said the student body has been pushing for gender-neutral housing for years and most students are happy with the university's decision. ""It gives people more options and it makes people feel safe in their own living environment,"" he said, adding that the issue is especially important for transgender students. Rutgers' pilot program is a part of a national trend for colleges, said Jeffrey Chang, the co-founder of the National Student Genderblind Campaign, a nonprofit organization that works with college students to develop LGBT policies. Chang estimates that there are 55 universities across the United States that have implemented gender-neutral rooming initiatives. ""I think there definitely has been a really accelerated growth,"" said Chang, who is also a law student at Rutgers. ""Just within the past year, we've seen 10 schools with gender-neutral housing."" Several schools, including Ohio University, Emory University and Columbia University will begin allowing co-ed rooming in the fall as well. George Washington University in Washington, D.C., is another addition to the list of schools that permit gender-neutral housing. Senior Michael Komo, 22, helped lead the campaign at his school, which will allow students to choose their roommates in all but three all-girls residence halls during the 2011-12 school year. ""These issues have always been there, but they're finally getting the attention they need and deserve,"" said Komo, who is president of Allied in Pride, a LGBT student organization on campus.","University wants to be more inclusive .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's embattled president has accepted opposition demands for constitutional reforms and holding parliamentary elections by the end of the year, according to a statement issued by his office. The statement said President Ali Abdullah Saleh was ""committed to undertaking all possible initiatives to reach a settlement"" with the opposition JMP bloc and ""prevent any future bloodshed of the Yemeni people."" According to the statement, Saleh ""has accepted the five points submitted by the JMP, including formation of a government of national unity and a national committee to draft a new constitution, drafting a new electoral law, and holding a constitutional referendum, parliamentary elections and a presidential vote by the end of the year. ""These accepted proposals have been submitted to the mediating party on the basis that this would end the current state of political turmoil facing the nation and paving the way for a smooth, peaceful and democratic transition,"" the statement from Saleh's office said. There was no immediate reaction from the opposition, which previously has demanded Saleh's immediate resignation. On Tuesday, a JMP spokesman rejected a report that Saleh was offering to step down by early 2012. ""Any offer that does not include the president's immediate resignation is rejected,"" JMP spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said. Saleh's statement came on the same day that Yemen's parliament approved a 30-day extension of emergency powers he declared last week in response to the protests. The emergency law expands the government's powers of arrest, detention, and censorship. The president's standing has weakened after some government officials and military officers declared their support for the opposition Monday in the wake of a crackdown on protesters that left 52 people dead last week. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Wednesday for full political dialogue in Yemen involving all players to find a peaceful solution. Saleh, who has been in power for 32 years, has been a U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist network based in Yemen. ""The people of Yemen have the same rights as people anywhere, and we support dialogue as a path to a peaceful solution,"" Clinton said in Washington. Asked about putting any pressure on Saleh, Clinton said: ""We are certainly making our views known on both a regular and consistent basis, both publicly and privately."" Yemen's army repelled an attack Tuesday on a military position by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, killing 12 militants and wounding five, a Yemeni official said, citing sources at the Interior Ministry in Sanaa. The official, who spoke on condition of not being named because he is not authorized to talk to the media, said the attack occurred east of the city of Lawdar, in Abyan province in southwest Yemen. The violence against opposition demonstrators last week drew international condemnation. Rupert Colville of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Tuesday that the agency deplored the reported killings of protesters, including allegations of snipers shooting from rooftops. ""All such violations of human rights must indeed be investigated by independent and impartial mechanisms,"" Colville said in Geneva. Saleh and Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar on Monday discussed a deal for a peaceful transition of power that would allow Saleh to stay in place for the rest of the year, a Yemeni official and senior U.S. official said. Then on Tuesday, Saleh appeared to criticize the powerful general and other officers who declared their support for the opposition on Monday, saying, ""Any division in the military will have negative impacts on the whole country."" A government official said the speech was a warning to those who broke ranks. ""Saleh was sending a message to the generals who defected yesterday, telling them, you know you're going to come back, so why not come back now rather than trying to do so later?"" said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive situation. Al-Ahmar, who belongs to an important tribe whose backing is significant for Saleh, said Monday he would order his troops to protect civilians demonstrating against the president. Other officials who announced their support for the opposition Monday included Yemen's ambassador to Britain and the embassy's entire diplomatic staff, as well as Yemen's ambassador to the European Union, Mohamed Jaffer. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Tuesday the United States was ""obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen. We consider al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is largely located in Yemen, to be perhaps the most dangerous of all the franchises of al Qaeda right now."" Radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is believed to be hiding in the country. The cleric has been linked to terror plots including the attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009, and he corresponded separately with a British Airways employee about trying to smuggle explosives onto planes. Top American officials, including U.S. President Barack Obama's counter-terrorism chief, have traveled to Yemen to meet with Saleh. Leaked diplomatic cables suggest Saleh's government helped disguise strikes by U.S. unmanned drones on terror targets in Yemen by calling them Yemeni actions.

"London (CNN)  -- A group of elderly Kenyans who say they were tortured under British colonial rule are seeking compensation at London's High Court in a case that could expose the UK to thousands of claims from across its former territories. Four Kenyans, aged in their 70s and 80s, have traveled from their homes in rural Kenya to press their claim that Britain is liable for the abuse they suffered during the Mau Mau uprising -- during which hundreds of ordinary Kenyans, including Barack Obama's grandfather, were arrested. Lawyers for the four say they suffered extreme acts of torture -- including castration and sexual assault -- at the hands of British administration officials in detainment camps during the uprising between 1952 and 1961. But Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office denies all liability and wants the judge to throw out the case on the grounds that all liability transferred to the Kenyan Republic when the country gained independence in 1963. The case, which could set a precedent allowing thousands of former British subjects to claim compensation, has thrown new light on the country's colonial past after a huge cache of secret files relating to British administration in 37 colonies was uncovered. The Foreign Office has been ordered to produce all evidence relevant to the Kenya case, including hundreds of boxes of files, secretly smuggled out of the country ahead of independence. These are said to contain graphic accounts of prisoner abuse. CNN's Nima Elbagir, reporting from the High Court, said the files contained ""pretty horrific detail."" Despite the British government's efforts to derail the case, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, one of the victims pursuing the claim, said he expected a ruling that would allow him to find closure. ""I am confident the British government has elders who believe in justice and doing the right thing, they will listen to us and give us something that will help us in the remaining part of our lives,"" he told CNN. During the uprising, as many as 150,000 Kenyans were incarcerated in what was then British East Africa, accused of being members of the resistance movement started by marginalized tribes. Among them were many ordinary citizens, including U.S. President Obama's grandfather. Obama referred to his grandfather's incarceration in his memoir ""Dreams from My Father,"" writing that Hussein Onyango Obama, who fought with the British Army during World War II, was held for six months but found innocent. Nyingi, who is 83 this year, says he was detained without charge for nine years, beaten with sticks and forced into labor. He says he survived a massacre at one British-run camp after which he lay unconscious for three days alongside 11 people who were killed. ""I suffered physical violence on my head, on my legs, I still have the scars today because of the beatings from the colonial administrators,"" he told AFP. ""I am here to get justice for the many of my colleagues who have since died, and others who are still alive but living in abject poverty because of the injustices that were committed by the British colonial government. ""It's their responsibility to own up and pay us back now, compensate us, so that when I die, I do not have to keep telling my grandchildren of the injustices that were done."" In a statement, the Foreign Office said it welcomed debate Kenya's colonial past, but it intended to defend the case. ""We understand the strong feelings that the Mau Mau issue still creates in Kenya and elsewhere. It remains a deeply divisive issue within Kenya and one on which historians continue to debate,"" it said.","Four elderly Kenyans are seeking compensation for torture experienced during the Mau Mau uprising .

"(CNN) -- This week's bitter budget showdown in Wisconsin isn't the first time state legislators have fled a state, left a building or refused to show when votes were called. The ""Killer Ds"" and the ""Texas 11,"" for example, skedaddled from Texas in 2003 to prevent consideration of a redistricting bill. In 1839, a young Abraham Lincoln, serving as a Whig in the Illinois House, jumped out of the building in a futile bid to prevent Democrats from getting a quorum to vote on a banks bill. Members of the 1891 Florida Senate went to Georgia in a bid to prevent a quorum for the election of a U.S. senator. And in 1994, Republican members of the California Assembly refused to show up for floor sessions in an effort to prevent Democrats from electing Willie Brown as speaker with less than a majority vote. The walkout by Democratic senators in Wisconsin, preventing a vote quorum on the contentious budget bill, can be added to a string of what might appear to be extreme actions to make a point. ""We have a very diverse society,"" said Karl Kurtz, director of the Trust for Representative Democracy at the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""Legislatures are where public policies are fought out. By nature, it is a messy process."" Kurtz, who posted an item Friday about walkouts on the conference's Thicket blog, told CNN that ""most states have rules to compel attendance of members."" Republican Gov. Scott Walker said he is trying to address a $137 million shortfall in the state budget. He wants public employees to pay more for their benefits, and he wants to eliminate most of their collective bargaining rights. Walker called on 14 Democratic lawmakers to return to the state Capitol to vote on the measure Friday. Most or all of them traveled to neighboring Illinois. ""You can't operate a democracy if people don't show up,"" he said. Republican lawmakers asked the governor to send state troopers to look for Democratic Senate leader Mark Miller, but he was not found, CNN affiliate WISC reported Friday. Although he might have the votes to pass the bill in the legislature, the problem for Walker is getting a quorum in the Senate. The defecting lawmakers say they won't return until Walker agrees to negotiate with a teachers union on the governor's proposals to reduce the state's budget deficit by cutting benefits for its members. They also want language removed from the bill that critics say threatens the existence of all public employee unions in the state. Senate Rule 16 states that ""members of the senate may not be absent from the daily session during the entire day without first obtaining a leave of absence. The leave may be granted at any time by a majority vote of the senate."" It's hardly new for members of minority parties to find ways to stymie legislation. ""The rules and procedures generally provide that the majority rules, but [also] protect minority rights,"" said Kurtz, whose duties include public education and outreach. Lawmakers can filibuster in some, but not all, states. They can also utilize certain bill passage requirements and a governor's veto, said Kurtz, who took no stance on the Wisconsin situation. In most state legislatures, a quorum to do business constitutes a simple majority of the members, Kurtz wrote. But in Indiana, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas, two-thirds of the members make up a quorum, and in Wisconsin, three-fifths of the members are required to act on budget and tax bills, making it easier to thwart a bill. The most famous recent walkout was by Texas Democrats in 2003, who as the ""Killer Ds"" and ""Texas 11"" fled to Oklahoma and New Mexico to deny a quorum on a redistricting measure pushed by Republicans. Bryan Kennedy, president of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, called the lawmakers' decision to skip town ""courageous."" ""The same could be said of the U.S. Senate,"" Kennedy told CNN. ""A small minority continues to constantly filibuster every piece of legislation and bring that body to standstill. We don't have a filibuster here in Wisconsin. ""The only thing these brave senators could do was to leave the state so that they could not be forced or compelled to bring a quorum to the body,"" Kennedy said. ""They stood up for worker rights."" But Walker called on the absent lawmakers to return ""out of respect for the institution of the legislature and the democratic process."" Kurtz says the conference helps to make legislators and legislatures share ideas and be more effective. ""The public looks at legislatures, and all they see is bickering, which has a negative connotation,"" he said. ""Negotiation and compromise are essential in a democratic society.""","Governor can't get a quorum in Wisconsin Senate to vote on a budget bill .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Manhattan nightclub bouncer was found guilty of murder Wednesday in the slaying of a 24-year-old graduate student from Boston, Massachusetts, the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office said. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison for the death of a grad student in 2006. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the death of Imette St. Guillen, a criminology student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Sentencing is scheduled for July 8. ""We're going to appeal,"" Littlejohn's lawyer, Joyce David, told CNN after the conviction. ""We're disappointed. I'm hoping this gives the family of the victim some closure. But I think that the wrong man was convicted."" The verdict came several hours into the first day of deliberations by the jury. Before the verdict, David stressed to CNN that she believed in the innocence of her client, saying that Littlejohn was framed and that another person was a likely suspect. ""He was a convenient scapegoat who has a long criminal record,"" David said. During the trial, witnesses said they saw Littlejohn and St. Guillen leaving The Falls bar in lower Manhattan together early on February 25, 2006. Hours later, St. Guillen's nude body was found in an isolated lot in Brooklyn. Her face was covered with strips of packing tape, and a sock was stuffed in her throat. She died of asphyxiation. Investigators determined she had been raped. Littlejohn was charged with murder after investigators linked his DNA to blood found on plastic ties used to bind St. Guillen's hands behind her back. Littlejohn is already serving a term of 25 years to life for the October 2005 kidnapping of a 19-year-old college student in Queens. CNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","Darryl Littlejohn, 44, could be sentenced to life without parole .

"(CNN) -- At least three protesters were killed Sunday when security forces and secret police raided the town of Jableh on Syria's western coast and fired at demonstrators without warning, according to an eyewitness and demonstrator. Security forces surrounded a mosque that was being used to treat the wounded, preventing 18 seriously wounded people from being taken to a hospital, according to a doctor inside. Snipers posted on the rooftops fired rifles indiscriminately around the mosque, causing the hundred demonstrators and medical personnel inside to fear they would be shot in the dark, the doctor said. The doctor, who asked not to be identified, said he believes the Syrian regime is now targeting him because ""they heard my voice on Al Jazeera and they know me now and anytime the Syrian regime finds out about someone they do their best to make them disappear."" The makeshift hospital inside the mosque has no supplies to treat wounds other than cotton balls and gauze, he said. Security forces did allow one gravely wounded patient to be taken away to a hospital, but the doctor said the man was ""passing towards death."" Small groups were beginning to gather in the streets when security forces began firing at them, the eyewitness said. The witness said he saw one man shot to death, and that he was one of several men who carried the man's body away from the scene. After hearing news of the incident, hundreds of people gathered on the streets chanting anti-government slogans, but before they could mass into one large crowd, security forces moved to break up the groups, the eyewitness said. ""They attacked us and showered us with live ammunition,"" he said. ""We all began fleeing and ran back into our homes."" Many people were injured in the crackdown, and one additional demonstrator was killed, the eyewitness said. Security forces were patrolling the streets as snipers perched on the roofs of buildings continued to fire sporadically into the deserted town, the eyewitness said. Water and electricity to homes was turned off, and people were scared to raise their voices inside their homes for fear of attracting the snipers' attention. ""I am not afraid, but I have children and I cannot risk attracting attention to my home,"" the eyewitness said. The city was shut down, with all businesses closed. The country's interior ministry said Sunday that dozens of Syrian police officers have been injured in the anti-government protests. On Saturday, witnesses also reported that security forces opened fire on people mourning slain protesters. At least 10 people died Saturday after Syrian security forces opened fire on mourners at funeral processions in the Damascus suburb of Douma and the southern town of Izraa, according to witness accounts, adding to a rapidly growing death toll. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Sunday that seven people were killed ""by the armed criminal groups"" on Saturday in the town of Nawa, citing an official military source. In addition, two security personnel were killed in al-Muadamiya and Homs, SANA said. The news agency also reported 38 police officers were injured in the clashes, citing the nation's interior ministry. The accusations come amid heightened tensions between troops and protesters as public discontent with President Bashar al-Assad's regime grows. Syrians have staged anti-government protests for weeks, demanding the immediate release of political prisoners, lifting of emergency and martial law, and withdrawal of intelligence forces from Syrian cities. Residents of Zamalka on Sunday buried four protesters killed in recent demonstrations, according to an eyewitness in the town. Hundreds gathered for the funeral procession and chanted anti-government protests as they marched toward the burial grounds. Community leaders set up a large tent with loudspeakers in the center of Zamalka to stage a large anti-government rally, the eyewitness said. Hundreds of people were in attendance, with more expected after prayers were held in honor of those killed in the unrest. There was a heavy security presence Sunday in the city of Harasta, just northeast of Damascus, which was preventing people from gathering for demonstrations, according to an eyewitness and activist. City entrances were blocked with security checkpoints, making it hard to enter or exit, the eyewitness said. Most businesses were closed. The activist said he has heard reports that several homes were raided Saturday night by security forces. In Douma, meanwhile, several small demonstrations were taking place with several hundred people each, according to the eyewitness. The protests were peaceful. There were no security personnel inside Douma, but forces were stationed on its borders. The eyewitness and activist said he was told by a doctor in the Damascus suburb of Barzah that three people were killed in Saturday's demonstrations. On Thursday, al-Assad lifted the country's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court, both of which were key demands of the demonstrators. But anti-government protests have continued, with dozens reported killed Friday. The brazen Friday killings rippled through the Syrian political establishment.  Syrian parliament member Khalil Al Rifai announced his resignation Saturday in a television interview, saying security forces had opened fire even though al-Assad promised not to use force against protesters. Protests continued early Sunday morning in a suburb outside Syria's capital, with people waving candles and chanting, ""the people want to topple the regime,"" activist Wissam Tarif said. Tarif, who is not in Syria but remains in contact with activists across the country, said he was told Saturday that forces were firing in the air and at random targets as more than 10,000 protesters took to the streets. Witnesses in Izraa said tens of thousands of people gathered for a funeral procession, when, one witness said, ""suddenly they opened fire on us and it was raining bullets. We were chanting peacefully, peacefully and they fired at us."" As thousands of people marched from the burial grounds toward Douma's main hospital Saturday, security forces on the rooftops of government buildings fired shots, a witness said. ""We were chanting, 'With our bloods, with our souls we will sacrifice for you, martyrs.' And all of sudden and without warning, they fired indiscriminately into the crowd,"" the witness said. Tarif said activists have confirmed at least 84 deaths from Friday's confrontations between protesters and security forces. Amnesty International reported at least 75 deaths on Friday. ""The Syrian authorities have again responded to peaceful calls for change with bullets and batons,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. The protests began last month in the southern city of Daraa after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti. The tough crackdown in Daraa spurred more protest. As peaceful demonstrations spread to other regions, such as Latakia, Banias and the Damascus suburbs, the protests were met with force that emboldened the protesters' resolve. The government made some efforts at reform, include the lifting of the country's emergency law, the abolition of a special court that tried regime opponents, the establishment of a new cabinet, and the granting of citizenship to stateless people in the country's northeastern Kurdish region. But activists think the violent crackdown Friday undermines the lifting of the emergency law. They also have other complaints with the government, such as immunity for its security officers and the incarceration of political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests. They want the easing of the ruling Baath Party's power and a law that would permit the establishment of independent political parties.","Security forces wage a violent crackdown on massing protesters .

"Ramtha, Jordan (CNN) -- Syrian forces waged a brutal crackdown Friday on demonstrators, with witnesses saying dozens of people have died in the latest in a series of military actions aimed at suppressing civilian dissent that has been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups. The violence occurred as thousands of villagers across Syria rallied to show support for residents of the southern border city of Daraa who have been living under siege since government forces attacked earlier this week. The Syrian unrest, which began in Daraa in March after teens were arrested for scribbling anti-government graffiti, escalated in recent days after demonstrators emboldened by weeks of protests called for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. The human rights group Syrian Human Rights Information Link said 64 demonstrators were killed Friday by Syrian forces in violence across the country, while witnesses told CNN more than two dozen people were killed Friday in clashes. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts. CNN has spoken with witnesses, some of whom have also reported what they see via social networking sites and posted homemade videos. Reports also have been compiled by human rights organizations. Nineteen people, including four soldiers, were reported killed and more than 50 were wounded in Daraa when government forces opened fire on protesters from neighboring villages who tried to enter the city near the Jordanian-Syrian border, according to witnesses who spoke with CNN. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, SANA, said four soldiers were killed and two others were kidnapped when ""an armed terrorist group raided a military point in Daraa"" on Friday. Security forces would not allow residents in Daraa to attend prayers and snipers were stationed on rooftops, according to witnesses. Bloated bodies remained uncollected in the streets, their relatives afraid to retrieve them, they said. Shortages of water, power, electricity and food were common complaints. A resident of Daraa, arriving in the Jordanian city of Ramtha about 10 minutes away, said people there were praying inside their homes. A group of about 500 would-be protesters who had set out after noon prayers to demonstrate against the government dispersed when army soldiers shot into the air, he said. Before Friday's violence, the military crackdown in Daraa that began Monday had already left 50 people dead and the humanitarian situation was worsening, he said. Six people were killed in clashes near the western Syria city of Homs, a doctor at the Hospital of Welfare and Social Services told CNN. Among the dead was an 11-year-old boy who had been shot in the head, the doctor said. About 150 people formed a human chain around the Homs hospital to try to protect it, the doctor said. In other parts of Syria, witnesses reported that two tanks had opened fire on demonstrators in the al-Khalidiya and heavy gunfire was heard in Talbeesa. SANA, the Syrian news agency, said army units were trying to restore calm to the city by ""hunting and confronting"" extremist terrorist groups. SANA accused international and Arabic-language television networks of broadcasting ""poisonous propaganda"" regarding the number of deaths, which they put at 70 civilians and 78 army and police. Among the videos posted online Friday was a grainy, shaky one that purports to show bodies piled into a vegetable refrigerator in Daraa. People can be heard trying to identify bodies -- at one point someone is heard asking in Arabic: ""Who is he?"" And in the background, people can be heard praying. It is impossible to tell how many bodies are in the room, or the cause of death -- but several appear to be young males. CNN is unable to verify that the video was shot in Daraa Friday, . The Syrian government has come under intense criticism by from Western governments, the United Nations and human rights group for its violent crackdowns. Syrian and international human rights organizations have put the toll at more than 450 people dead and about 1,800 wounded since the crackdowns began. On Friday, the United States imposed sanctions against top members and elements of the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad responsible for overseeing the recent violence against protesters. The United Nations Human Rights Council also convened a special session in Geneva, Switzerland, to address the violence. The session was convened at the request of the United States and was backed by 15 other member countries. The council's deputy high commissioner said the recent violence has painted ""a disturbing picture"" of Syria. Since mid-March, that picture has included ""the widespread use of live fire against protesters; the arrest, detention and disappearance of demonstrators, human rights defenders, and journalists; the torture and ill-treatment of detainees,"" Kyung-wha Kang, deputy high commissioner, said in a statement of minutes released by the UNCHR. Kang said additionally there have been reports of ""the sharp repression of press freedoms and other means of communication; and attacks against medical personnel, facilities and patients."" She said that ""any official ordering or undertaking of attacks against the civilian population can be held criminally accountable"" and that widespread or systematic attacks ""may amount to crimes against humanity."" But Faysal Khabbas Hamou, Syria's representative to the UN's Human Rights Council, said he was astonished at the convening of a special session of the council. According to the minutes of the session, Hamou said Syrian security forces ""had maximized the use of self restraint"" and made moves toward reform, including abolishing the decades-old state of emergency. He blamed ""vandals"" for the violence, saying they had been engaged in acts of violence and that 60 officers and enlisted personnel had been killed. ""What would the countries that had convened this special session have done if such acts occurred in their own countries?"" he asked. The Russian Federation's representative at the special session, Mikhail Lebedev, predicted that the human rights situation in Syria would improve. He said the crisis must be resolved internally.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Amid reports that pro-government forces have withdrawn from the besieged Libyan port city of Misrata, at least 16 people were killed and 71 were wounded there Sunday, a doctor at a local hospital said early Monday. An eyewitness said pro-Gadhafi forces randomly and extensively shelled the city Sunday. The witness asked that his name not be used because of fears for his security. ""There are explosions every five minutes,"" the witness said. The doctor, who also asked that his name not be used because of fears for his safety, said NATO fighter jets had begun hitting targets in Misrata early Monday. The witness said he feels safe every time he hears the NATO jets overhead, because whenever they're not present, pro-Gadhafi forces shell the city. Also early Monday, loud explosions and jets were heard in the capital, Tripoli. Anti-aircraft fire was both seen and heard. A banner on Libyan state television cited a military source saying that the ""crusaders' airstrikes"" were targeting both civilian and military targets, resulting in casualties and damage. Earlier, a source in Misrata described clashes with remnants of pro-government forces. The source declined to be named because of fear of reprisal. A Libyan government spokesman explained the army came under rebel attack as it withdrew from Misrata, and so the army simply fought back as it continued withdrawing. ""Our army will always attack back if it is attacked,"" said the spokesman, Musa Ibrahim. ""We cannot just ask them to die and not fight back."" Ibrahim said the army's withdrawal was continuing. Misrata, a rebel stronghold in western Libya, has been the scene of some of the most prolonged fighting in the current conflict. Rebels ""liberated"" the main market in the city and the central hospital, the local resident said, but the city remained unsafe and not under complete rebel control. Ibrahim said tribal chiefs are moving to Misrata's outskirts and negotiating peace with the rebels and city inhabitants, but an opposition leader denied those claims. ""There are no tribes and there are no negotiations. It's only Libyan people fighting against Gadhafi's forces,"" said Col. Ahmad Bani, a rebel military spokesman. Ruler Moammar Gadhafi is ""lying to say to the world that he's looking to find a solution,"" Bani said. ""These are Gadhafi dreams and they will never happen."" The regime had earlier said it was calling on the tribes to deal with the rebels in Misrata, whether by negotiation or force. Ibrahim said the tribes are armed and ""prepared to defend their land."" He said, ""The rebels have two options: either to escape the country and leave Misrata and go somewhere else, or to give up their arms. And as we have promised before, a general pardon will be issued for everyone."" The rebels, under the umbrella of the Transitional National Council, received a pledge Sunday from Kuwait for about $180 million. The announcement came during council chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil's visit to Kuwait, Kuwaiti state-run television reported. Ibrahim responded to that report by questioning why Kuwait was seeking to help one side rather than seeking to resolve the conflict. ""We know that some countries are not interested in Libyan peace, democracy, and the future of this country,"" Ibrahim said. ""Why is it that some governments jump on the opportunity to make the Libyan crisis even worse ... instead of helping all parties establish peace?"" Hundreds have been killed in the battle for Misrata, under a bloody siege from Gadhafi's forces for seven weeks. It is the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as the rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi, who has been in power for 42 years. Human Rights Watch has said Gadhafi was using internationally banned cluster bombs and other lethal munitions indiscriminately to kill civilians. The United States conducted its first Predator drone airstrikes Saturday afternoon, Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Darryn James said. Keeping with U.S. practice not to comment on drone strikes, the Pentagon offered no other information. CNN's Kamal Ghattas, Kareem Khadder, Hamdi Alkshali, Reza Sayah, Saad Abedine, Frederik Pleitgen and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Loud explosions are heard in Tripoli on Monday .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the ""Arab Spring"" revolutions dominate the news, Kyrgyzstan is marking the one-year anniversary of another uprising. That one overthrew the authoritarian regime of President Kurmanbek Bakiev, who resigned last April. Now, the woman who replaced him, Rosa Otunbayeva, follows developments in the Mideast and North Africa as she grapples with the aftermath of revolution in her own country. ""It's quite a difficult, thorny road,"" she told CNN during a visit to Washington, to accept a ""Women of Courage"" award from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The non-stop media coverage of the Arab revolutions is a sharp contrast to the limited news of last year's uprising in Kyrgyzstan. Otunbayeva is disappointed that the violence in Kyrgyzstan did not spark the international outrage that violence in Mideast countries has. ""On April 7th (of last year) a crowd of people came to the central square in front of our White House,"" she says. ""They were shot straight from the roof. Eighty-seven people died, hundreds were wounded. Yet nobody defined this as unacceptable or outrageous."" In July of last year, after Bakiev fled the country, Otunbayeva was sworn in. Acting as interim leader, she pledged to serve for 18 months until new elections. And she made history, becoming Central Asia's first female head of state and head of government in a traditional, majority-Muslim country. But making history has not solved the mountain of problems she faces. The Kyrgyz government is faltering. There are other major challenges, Otunbayeva says, including sharp increases in food prices and a budget shortfall. There are security problems: the central Asian nation borders Tajikistan, a neighbor of Afghanistan. One of the first tasks Otunbayeva and her fellow opposition leaders worked on, after years of presidential rule, was introducing a new constitution with a parliamentary system. ""As head of provisional government, I was everything: speaker, head of the government, interim president. We steadily reached what we had promised. And today power is not any more in the hands of any one person."" Asked what is the biggest danger for a country after a revolution, she points out that the Kyrgyz revolution was led by young people, just as the uprisings in many of the Arab and North African countries have been. ""They said enough is enough, all this bribery and corruption."" But the Kyrgyz revolution was followed by violent ethnic fighting in the south of Kyrgyzstan. ""We lost people there, a lot of victims,"" Otunbayeva recalls. The uprsising in Kyrgyzstan came after unrest in that country in 2005 that has come to be called the ""Tulip Revolution,"" which led to the ouster of then-President Askar Akaev. In any country undergoing revolution it's critically important, she says, that whoever ends up holding power be very attentive to long-standing issues like ethnic rivalries. ""You should have an exact plan of action, how you'll fix it,"" she says. ""Otherwise it will put you in danger."" Kyrgyzstan had some advantages over a few Mideast and North African nations: after the fall of the Soviet Union it introduced freedom of speech and assembly. It has a strong civil society and trade unions. Many young Kyrgyz study in the United States. Otunbayeva says events of last year were some of the toughest and most dramatic in Kyrgyz history. It wasn't just an issue of survival, she says, but an issue ""of sovereignty, of independence, of unity of the nation."" ""We are an ancient nation in Central Asia on the Silk Road, quite famous. We have a rich history and traditions,"" she says. It was a test for her country, and for herself. Otunbayeva says it's important to be a role model for young women. ""The situation is not as good as it was before,"" she says. Fundamentalist religion, she says, is on the rise and, as a result, the situation of women has deteriorated in her region. ""In such a circumstances, to be a leader of the nation, this is really, I guess, a good impetus for thousands and thousands of women to be in the forefront of the nation. And I hope I will be a really good example."" Receiving the Women of Courage award from Hillary Clinton, Otunbayeva was cited for ""courageous leadership...binding together a historically fractious opposition into a provisional government structure able to check the struggles for power from stirring up wider divisions in society."" Central Asia expert Martha Brill Olcott of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says: ""That's really a very conscious goal of hers, to be this example of the first woman in office in the region. ""She has a strong sense of historic mission about what she's doing. She wants to make a revolution that's successful, that makes Kyrgyzstan a sustainable democracy, and even more than being the first woman, she really wants to be the first person who leaves (office)...She sees it not only as making a revolution but creating a model that somebody could walk out the door."" Otunbayeva explains it this way: ""As it happened, I was the person around whom other parties, political leaders, rallied. I'm one of many millions of women in my country. And I'm proud to say that we've done this job. We didn't lose our sovereignty. We did it."" Smiling broadly, she says: ""So, women can do something in Kyrgyzstan.""","Kyrgyzstan's president received a ""Women of Courage"" award in Washington .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Rescuers overnight recovered four bodies from a coal mine in northern Mexico that suffered an explosion last week, making a total of 11 bodies that have been extracted so far, the country's labor secretary said Saturday. Javier Lozano says at this point -- more than four days after the blast -- there is no hope of finding alive the remaining miners trapped inside. Three more miners remain inside the shaft. The mine had been operating for only 20 days and had 25 workers who were not unionized, Lozano said. He described such small, makeshift coal mines as ""unsafe places,"" calling them ""irregular, deadly traps, as we are seeing."" The owner of the mine is a company known as Binsa, the statement from the attorney general's office said. The mine contains a shaft that is 60 meters (197 feet) deep, Sabinas Mayor Jesus Montemayor Garza said. Sabinas is in the coal production center of Mexico and has a museum dedicated to the history of coal mining. Several chapters of that history, however, have been tragic. In 2006, in the nearby town of San Juan de Sabinas, 65 miners perished after an explosion in the mine where they were working. Explosive gas inside the mine hindered the rescue of the miners at the Pasta de Conchos mine, which the government eventually abandoned. An organization representing family members of the victims of that accident said Tuesday's blast was a tragic reminder that the federal government must do more to regulate mines. One activist from the organization said there had been more than 40 people killed in local coal mines since the 2006 accident. ""How long will it take to recognize that there is a very serious crisis in coal mining (in the Mexican state of) Coahuila, in which the workers and their families are those who must endure the worst, with dead, widows and orphans?"" a statement from the organization said.","Eleven bodies have been recovered and rescuers are looking for three more .
Lozano says crews are close to reaching those .
He says there is no hope of finding the miners alive ."
"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A vicious turf war between drug cartels and Mexican authorities that has left as many as 4,300 dead so far this year may have caused a breach in the internal security systems of Interpol, the international police organization. A member of the Federal Investigative Agency participates in an narcotics operation. Interpol, which is based in France, announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases are not being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes. The prospect was raised after the arrest of the top official working with the agency in the country. Ricardo Gutierrez Vargas, director for International Police Affairs at Mexico's Federal Investigative Agency and the head of Mexico's Interpol office, was placed under house arrest Sunday, the attorney general's office said Tuesday. More than 30 officials have been arrested since July in connection with the anti-corruption Operation Limpieza, an ongoing investigation into information leaks by law enforcement officials to drug traffickers, said Niverda Amado, a government press secretary in Mexico City. Gutierrez can be held for up to 40 days while authorities ""obtain sufficient evidence to determine his probable responsibility,"" the attorney general's office said in a news release. Rodolfo de la Guardia Garcia, a former top official at the Federal Investigative Agency, also is under 40-day house arrest. He was arrested October 29. Mexico's Interpol office, or National Central Bureau, is staffed and run by the Federal Investigative Agency. Mexican officials did not offer specifics on their investigation other than to say that Operation Limpieza, which means ""Operation Cleanup,"" is aimed ""against public servants who give reserved information to people not authorized to have it."" Interpol said in a news release Wednesday it needs to make sure the agency's information remains secure. ""As Mexico's attorney general's office has a duty to ensure that Interpol's communications system and databases are being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes and in compliance with Interpol's rules, Interpol is immediately dispatching a team of general secretariat staff to Mexico,"" Interpol said. ""The purpose of their mission is to meet with relevant Mexican authorities in order to establish if there are any allegations of improper use of Interpol's systems by any Mexican law enforcement official."" After the investigation, Interpol said, the agency will determine whether proper security steps have been taken. ""An assessment can then be made of the procedures put in place by the attorney general's office, which is responsible for the Interpol office in Mexico, to ensure that Interpol's rules and regulations are being followed,"" the agency said. The arrests came amid ""a war of master proportions"" between authorities and narcotics traffickers that has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year, according to the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, an independent research and information organization. By comparison, the council said in a report Tuesday, there were 2,700 drug-related deaths in 2007. ""Homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state,"" the council says about what it calls ""narco-fueled crime."" Mexican leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money-laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers. It may not be enough. ""Due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the Mexican government, and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel, an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain,"" the Hemispheric Council concludes. Drug trafficking in Mexico is a $20 billion- to $50 billion-a-year industry, as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from Mexicans living in the United States, said Robert Pastor, a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington. He has been studying Latin America for more than four decades. ""This is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country. And they're doing both right now,"" said Pastor, also a former director of the Carter Center's Latin American and Caribbean Program. The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $150,000 to $450,000 a month, authorities have said. The payment is far beyond the per capita income of $12,500 a year in Mexico, where one of every seven Mexicans lives in poverty, according to the CIA World Factbook. Pastor believes that Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who took office in December 2006, made a correct assessment that he needs to fight the drug cartels as hard as he can. ""You have to obviously escalate the cost of violating the law,"" he said. The United States also could help more, he said. ""There are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the Mexican border, and they're selling primarily to drug lords,"" Pastor said. ""We are part of this problem and we haven't been significantly supportive."" And while the war may never be completely won, the government can make vast gains, as happened in Colombia, he said. Pastor was in Mexico giving a speech last week when Colombian President Alvaro Uribe met with Mexico's Calderon. Mexicans were quite taken with Uribe's message on how to fight drug traffickers, Pastor said. The first step that Uribe took, he said, was to take the fight to the paramilitary forces, the drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas known as FARC, who often work in collaboration with the traffickers. Also, Pastor said, Colombian officials ""used money the same way that the narcotraffickers do -- to bribe people. And there's a lot more security on the streets and everywhere else, so people feel safer."" Despite the gains, he said, the ultimate answer may have to come from the political arena, not from law enforcement. ""There's no easy solution to it unless you put an end to the criminalization drugs, and that's not going to happen,"" Pastor said. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","NEW: Interpol sending team to Mexico to check if sensitive info compromised .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Suzanne Mubarak, wife of toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, is expected to undergo open-heart surgery Sunday night, the manager of the Sharm el-Sheikh Hospital said. Egypt's former first lady suffered a heart attack Friday after being questioned in a corruption investigation, Mohamed Fatah Allah said. She has been treated in the intensive care unit. The incident came shortly after Suzanne Mubarak was ordered detained for 15 days in a corruption case, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. Assem al-Gohary, the assistant justice minister for the Illicit Gains Authority, ordered her detained for ""obtaining illegal wealth using her husband's position and political authority."" A team of investigators from the authority, a separate investigative unit under the Ministry of Justice, had questioned the former president in the same hospital for three hours Thursday regarding ""using his political position as president to acquire illegal wealth."" ""Hosni Mubarak was also questioned about his luxury mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh,"" al-Gohary said. Last month, the former president suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges, Egyptian state television reported. But the head doctor from a Ministry of Justice team assisting with the questioning disputed the diagnosis, saying later that the former leader had heart palpitations and was able to walk with assistance. He was deemed stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital, according to the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. Mubarak has said the inquiry is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. The former first lady had been scheduled for questioning Thursday, but investigators postponed the interrogation until Friday morning. She was asked about the origin of 20 million Egyptian pounds ($3.4 million) deposited in her name in a local bank account, al-Gohary said. Both Mubaraks were questioned about accounts in Al Ahly Bank, containing $147 million under their authority, he said. The Mubaraks signed affidavits allowing investigators to further inquire into their bank accounts and wealth inside and outside Egypt. Suzanne Mubarak, 70, was treated successfully for leukemia 10 years ago, said Hanaa Gohar, the former first lady's former press contact. ""She was very healthy and very active"" before the revolution, Gohar said. Hosni Mubarak, a U.S. ally and former military commander, resigned in February after nearly three decades in power amid massive demonstrations calling for him to step down. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this story.","A manager of the hospital in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh said she suffered a heart attack .

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and at least 20 homes destroyed after a weekend tornado that struck a town in eastern Kansas, state officials said. The storm also damaged another 200 homes around Reading, about 100 miles southwest of Kansas City, said Sharon Watson of the Kansas Division of Emergency Management. She said the agency received a report of a tornado touching down at 9:15 p.m. Saturday. Strong line of storms pummels Midwest; Missouri hard-hit . The agency said five others were injured in addition to the fatality, and power was knocked out to much of the town of about 250. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback issued a disaster declaration for 16 counties on Sunday, a step toward getting state and federal aid for the affected areas. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim and everyone impacted by this storm,"" Brownback said in a statement issuing the declaration. The National Weather Service said the storm was caused by an EF-1 tornado, which packs winds of 86-110 mph. It was among several storms that hit the area between 6 p.m. to midnight Saturday, authorities said. ""The first significant calls of damage came in about 6:30 p.m. local in Shawnee County,"" Watson said. ""There was significant damage caused by large hail, which broke windows and broke tree limbs."" In Jefferson County, a mobile home was destroyed and an elderly couple was trapped inside, Watson said. She said first responders cleared the debris and rescued the couple, who was not hurt.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- With an unexpectedly big gross of $24.6 million, according to Sunday's early estimates, Liam Neeson's kidnapping thriller ""Taken"" was the easy victor at the box office on this Super Bowl weekend. Liam Neeson stars in 20th Century Fox's ""Taken,"" which debuted at No. 1 this weekend. That's a particularly impressive feat for a male-baiting film whose key audience has had plenty of distractions during this national football holiday frame. To be sure, the movie drew an A- CinemaScore review from a crowd that was nearly three-fifths men and 70 percent over the age of 25 -- an almost exact mirror of the big game's core demographic. For Neeson, who hasn't starred in a major Hollywood release since 2005's ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (to which he lent his voice), this is a nice turn of events, indeed: The $24.6 million premiere is the fifth best of his career, and, really, the top debut ever for a flick featuring him as a solo lead star. Certainly, ""Taken's"" weekend sum could decrease slightly after the Super Bowl is played tonight and the actual final Friday-to-Sunday box office figures are calculated, but the film has no chance of falling out of first place. That's because its next closest competitor was two-time champ ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop,"" which brought in $14 million and fell to No. 2. With $83.4 million in the bank to date, the Kevin James comedy is basically assured of becoming the first 2009 release to gross $100 million. ""The Uninvited"" (No. 3) was next, with a decent $10.5 million -- exactly the kind of first-weekend number that all Asian horror remakes seem to get these days. ""Hotel for Dogs"" (No. 4 with $8.7 million) and ""Gran Torino"" (No. 5 with $8.6 million) rounded out the top five. (At $110.5 million and counting, ""Gran Torino"" is now the top-grossing movie of Clint Eastwood's career.) And the other big new release, the Renee Zellweger comedy ""New in Town"" -- the kind of female-friendly counterprogramming that studio bigwigs typically expect to do well on weekends like this -- got little love at No. 8, earning just $6.8 million. Among Best Picture nominees, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" once again fared best, banking $7.7 million at No. 6, while all the others fell outside of the top 10 (i.e. they all banked less than about $3.7 million a piece). That result is a tad disappointing for ""The Reader"" and ""Milk,"" as both movies expanded somewhat wide this weekend (they grossed $2.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively). Overall, the cumulative box office was essentially flat with the same frame a year ago, when the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus concert film came out of nowhere to be the big winner.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome! Just like the students and teachers at Ron Clark Academy, where I had the privilege of speaking yesterday. I'm Carl Azuz, bringing you 10 minutes of headlines, leaving out the commercials. Let's go ahead and get started. First Up: Crisis Avoidable . AZUZ: The financial crisis -- the one that sent a shockwave through the U.S. economy and led to the Great Recession -- it could have been avoided. That's what the final report from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission says. This group was put together by Congress in 2009 to try to figure out the causes of the crisis. It held hearings, it interviewed hundreds of people, and released its findings yesterday. The main conclusion: the crisis was avoidable. Some political and financial leaders have argued that there was no way to see this crisis coming. But the commission says there were warning signs and those warnings were ignored or underestimated. The report puts part of the blame on major corporations, saying they didn't run themselves properly or take into account the risks of some of their business plans. It also blames government policies under both President Bush and President Obama, and some of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve as well. These conclusions come from the majority of the commission. Three members wrote a dissenting, or opposing report, though. They say the majority report doesn't study the causes of the crisis, that it's just a list of things that went wrong. The dissenting report also argues that even if the government had gotten involved sooner, it might not have prevented the crisis because it was a global problem. Northeastern Winter Storm . AZUZ: Some of you who live in Florida or California might wish you could see snow more often. Some of you live in Florida or California because you don't want to see snow more often, and we're guessing that a lot of people in the U.S. Northeast are sick of it. That region is dealing with yet another strong winter storm. Dangerous traffic conditions, canceled flights, closed schools. Sandra Endo reports on just how much snow is falling and just how bad everything has gotten. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Paralyzing roads and bringing bone-chilling winds, another winter storm has dumped more than a foot of snow in New York's Central Park. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: When the snow stopped falling at about 4 a.m., the official reading in Central Park was 19 inches, breaking a record last set in 1925. ENDO: In Massachusetts, the weight of the snow caused a partial roof collapse at this garage. JUDITH KENNEDY, LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS MAYOR: There were about 15 people inside the structure when it collapsed. Most of them have made it out under their own power. Thank God everybody seems to be OK. ENDO: Officials say there was three feet of snow on top off the roof. JAMES MCDONALD, DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF, LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS: We've had a lot of snow and we're gonna get more. Buildings like this don't get shoveled off, and we are just at the mercy of the construction of the buildings that people are working in. ENDO: Airports across the Northeast are still trying to get back up to speed after hundreds of flights were cancelled. Airports were shut down for hours while crews worked to clear runways Thursday. And with schools closing in D.C., Maryland, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston, this storm pushed snow removal budgets over the limit. Reporting from Washington, I'm Sandra Endo for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Vernon's social studies class at Margaret Pollard Middle School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina! This man is the leader of what African country? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it: A) Egypt, B) Sudan, C) Libya or D) South Africa? You've got three seconds -- GO! This is Hosni Mubarak, the president of Egypt. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Unrest in Egypt . AZUZ: President Mubarak is the leader of a country that's in the middle of a political uprising. Protests against the government have been going on all across Egypt, and experts think there could be a lot more demonstrations starting today. The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest group of protesters, is speaking out against President Mubarak's government. It's telling its followers to protest in the streets after today's weekly Muslim prayers end. In some cases, protesters have fought with police officers. They've thrown things at the security forces. And those forces have used tear gas to try to break up the crowds. At least three protesters and one police officer have been killed this week. Social networking is playing a role in all of this, too. A lot of the protests are being organized on blogs and sites like Twitter and Facebook. This Day in History . AZUZ: Focusing on a single event in our ""This Day in History"" segment. On January 28th, 1986 -- exactly 25 years ago today -- the space shuttle Challenger exploded less than two minutes after liftoff, killing all seven people on board. Legacy of Learning . AZUZ: One of those seven people was Christa McAuliffe. She wasn't an official government employee, like most other astronauts. She was a teacher. And she was picked from a group of more than 11,000 people in the field of education to journey into space. John Zarrella shows us how, 25 years after McAuliffe's tragic death, she's still inspiring young people. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: The fifth graders at Francis Scott Key Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia know quite a bit about space. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: I want to be able to drive rovers on Mars. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: I just recently learned from my brother that the constellations have moved, which is very interesting! ZARRELLA: There's a good reason. A picture of Christa McAuliffe, the first teacher in space, sits on a cabinet in the classroom. The kids know who she is not so much from history books, but from their teacher. MICAELA POND, TEACHER: The woman moaned. This tooth must come out. ZARRELLA: You see, their teacher Micaela Pond is connected to McAuliffe in a way that simply cannot fade over time. POND: I feel very lucky to have known her, and I try very much to inspire my students. Whatever your dream may be, it's possible. ZARRELLA: A quarter century ago, Pond babysat Christa's kids and knew McAuliffe from Sunday school. A junior at Concord High in New Hampshire where McAuliffe taught, she sat in the auditorium with other students that January morning. POND: And then we heard, ""Roger, go with throttle up."" NASA ANNOUNCER: Challenger, go with throttle up. POND: And that phrase, ""obviously there's been a major malfunction."" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation, obviously a major malfunction. POND: I think the realization hit us quite quickly that this isn't good. ZARRELLA: Seventy-three seconds into the flight, McAuliffe and the six other astronauts perished when Challenger exploded. The accident was caused by bitter cold combined with a faulty rocket booster seal. But the tears that fell that day soon turned to a river of inspiration, leading Pond and many others to follow Christa's path. POND: I think Christa would be very proud of the legacy she's left. I think she would be ecstatic to know that her students went on to be teachers and were inspired by her. ZARRELLA: McAuliffe called her flight the ultimate field trip. CHRISTA MCAULIFFE, TEACHER-ASTRONAUT: I don't think any teacher has ever been more ready. ZARRELLA: She never got to teach her lessons from space. But today, Pond is one of so many who teach because of Christa McAuliffe. John Zarrella, CNN, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: Excellent and very inspiring story. Well, I thought most of you would've been against the idea of making it illegal to text while walking. And many of you were: just under 70 percent. But almost a third said this isn't such a bad idea. On our blog, Victoria wrote, ""there should be a law because if you're walking across the street and not paying attention, someone could pull out and hit you."" But from Jeremy: ""Really, it's the fault of the driver. Drivers should keep their eyes on the road to see hazards like pedestrians."" Shawn said, ""it's a good idea to have in bigger cities, but not for smaller towns, where there are few people and less drivers."" And over at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews, Brekiaa thinks ""the idea of pedestrians not being able to text is crazy. People are responsible for their actions and should be prepared for any consequence."" And Maria writes, ""I believe the proposal is fair. Maybe instead of a law, there should be a three-count rule. Get caught three times, then you get a ticket."" Before We Go . AZUZ: Okay, remember that mysterious island piano in yesterday's before we go segment? Let's play it again, sand.

He claims it was an art project for his future college applications. One man's trash is another man's art. In this case, it just happens to be the same man. Goodbye .

"Miami (CNN) -- Two South Florida imams and a third family member were arrested Saturday on charges of providing support to the Pakistani Taliban, the Justice Department said. In addition, three others in Pakistan were also indicted on the same charges. FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan in South Florida, the department said. They are expected to make their initial court appearance in federal court Monday. Another of Hafiz Khan's sons, Irfan Khan, was arrested in Los Angeles and will appear in court there. Also charged are three Pakistani residents: Ali Rehman, Alam Zeb and Amina Khan. Amina Khan is Hafiz Khan's daughter, and Zeb is his grandson. The four-count indictment alleges that all six defendants conspired to provide material support to a conspiracy to kill, injure and kidnap people abroad, and that they provided support to the Pakistani Taliban. Hafiz Khan is the imam at Flagler Mosque in Miami. Izhar Khan is an imam at the Jamaat Al-Mu'mineen Mosque in Margate, Florida. The indictment and arrests were not linked to the May 2 killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, two U.S. officials said. The charges relate to alleged crimes committed between 2008 and 2010. ""Despite being an imam, or spiritual leader, Hafiz Khan was by no means a man of peace. Instead, as today's charges show, he acted with others to support terrorists to further acts of murder, kidnapping and maiming,"" U.S. Attorney Wilfredo A. Ferrer said. ""But for law enforcement intervention, these defendants would have continued to transfer funds to Pakistan to finance the Pakistani Taliban, including its purchase of guns."" The charges were the result of a three-and-a-half-year investigation, and federal authorities became suspicious by the number of financial transactions between the United States and Pakistan, authorities said. ""They went out of their way to disguise their transactions,"" Ferrer said. Authorities said their investigation focused on the mosque leadership. The indictment describes a number of occasions where Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan, and where money was withdrawn once there. ""Khan solicited and distributed funds for the Pakistani Taliban, both personally and on behalf of others, and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the Pakistani Taliban's jihad,"" the indictment states. The court documents also list several conversations between Hafiz Khan and the other defendants where he calls for attacks against the Pakistani government and inquires whether money had been delivered to the Pakistani Taliban. The elder Khan also built a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for the terrorist group, the indictment states. ""The main defendant Khan operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the Pakistan Taliban and to train children to become military fighters for the mujahideen,"" Ferrer said. He said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the United States and Pakistan. ""You can purchase in Pakistan a gun for as little as $10. He had money coming from all sources,"" Ferrer said. ""More evidence will come forth as the investigation continues."" Yazid Ali, president of the Jamaat Al-Mu'mineen Mosque in Margate, Florida, said his worshippers were shocked by the news. They are cooperating with authorities, he said. ""I would like everyone to know that Masjid Jamaat Al-Mu'mineen does not support terrorism, for this is forbidden in Islam. The Quran clearly tells us do not spread corruption on earth,"" Ali said. Masjid is Arabic for mosque. He added that the mosque has received threats, prompting a police car to be stationed in the parking lot. Nezar Hamze, executive director of Florida's Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN that he is concerned about possible fears the charges might stir in the community, even though authorities emphasized their investigation had nothing to do with Islam or the mosques themselves. ""The teaching of Islam in any way shape or form does not financially support terrorism,"" Hamze said. ""These allegations would be completely against Islam."" He said he has been to the two mosques in question and that he's listened to the imams at the services. ""You never hear anything being preached like what's being reflected in these charges,"" Hamze told CNN. Outside Khan's Miami mosque on Saturday, one worshipper, Obeid Akhtar, expressed suprised to hear the news of the indictment. ""We never heard anything about this,"" he told CNN. ""We are shocked."" The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. Those fighters attack targets in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is different from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, he said.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- By now, Christmas merrymakers have packed away the decorations and may even have paid off their holiday shopping sprees. But while the rest of us have moved on to Valentine's Day, Cin Davidsen is still surrounded by glittery Christmas ornaments. Since the end of September, Davidsen said, the showroom she manages has been a veritable glitter explosion. She works at North Star by Premier, a wholesale showroom in Atlanta's AmericasMart, and last month she presided over the store's 2011 debut of over 7,000 holiday decorations. Every January, retailers from all over the world flock to AmericasMart for the eight-day holiday shopping frenzy called the Atlanta International Gift & Home Furnishings Market. More than 4,500 exhibiting wholesalers within AmericasMart's three city blocks show off their wares to visiting shop owners. It's the kickoff to a year's worth of holiday shopping for boutiques, gift stores, florists, interior decorators and chain stores. So what can consumers expect to finally see in local shops, many months from now? ""There's a real trend towards vintage ornaments this year,"" said Justin Spath, a buyer for the Santa Claus Christmas Store in Santa Claus, Indiana. ""We're seeing a lot of retro ones, back to Victorian and even 1950s and '60s. There's a lot of people going back to the traditional Christmas look (more) than they have the past few years."" ""The trends that I'm seeing for this year that are different are the mixed colors,"" said Kim Casto, owner and buyer for GeNell's Flowers in Piqua, Ohio. ""Like, really bright. I think people want to be festive and happy. They want that bright colorfulness (to) bring into their home."" Whimsical Christmas ornaments have been popular at Joseph Warren Miller, said the wholesale store's owner, Margaret Hooper. ""It's traditional red and white with hints of lime green. That lime green has really become one of the traditional colors for Christmas. It just pops. Everything that it's on, it just pops."" Nickie Sfamenos, the showroom manager for wholesaler Regency International, said their line of peacockish blues and greens was a particular favorite of stores in New Orleans. She said icicles and anything with a snowy look were popular with wedding planners for winter nuptials. East Coast area stores and large aquariums will likely carry some of North Star by Premier's ""Under the Sea"" line, which features whimsical fish and bright Caribbean colors, said Davidsen. Another of the company's lines, ""Calypso,"" is popular in the Deep South and South America, she said. Wholesalers like Neal Goldman, the president of North Star by Premier, recently finished a year's worth of work designing ornaments, overseeing the manufacturing process and fulfilling clients' orders. And now they're starting all over again. ""Most of our product is hand-produced,"" Goldman said, noting that all the company's glass ornaments are blown by artisans, not machine-made. All the glitter on the ornaments is painted on by hand, added Davidsen. ""The production times are significant. So by taking orders in January, we ship (the holiday merchandise) in proper time for the retailers to get it in time to show for Christmas,"" Goldman said. Like many wholesale companies, North Star by Premier goes overseas to design its decor lines and have the ornaments manufactured, Alice Goldman said. Her husband, Dan, and son Neal run their 62-year-old family business. ""It's a long trip"" to design the ornaments with the factories, she said. ""They work seven days a week, and they're gone for five weeks and change."" Once the designing and manufacturing is done, the merchandise has to travel back to the United States by boat, she said. ""We start delivering in May and June. People want their orders from May through November, because they have to get the merchandise into their stores, into their stockrooms."" And while all that work is happening for the current year's holiday shipments, wholesalers are already thinking a year ahead. ""Right now we're already thinking about items for Christmas 2012,"" said Danny McDonald, the vice president of Regency International. ""We've just gotten through the big shows, and we see the trends and we see what people are asking for, and we actually start thinking about it and putting our basic thoughts down right now."" They send the next year's artwork and manufacturing directions to factories starting in June, McDonald said. In July and August, his company will send people overseas to start working with the factories, finalizing their 2012 ornaments and decorations in September and October. It usually takes between 90 and 120 days to manufacture a wholesaler's line of products, McDonald said. Many wholesalers choose to go to Chinese factories to manufacture their ornament lines. Those 90 to 120 days encompass gathering raw materials and wooing a skilled workforce away from steadier jobs in computer manufacturing, he said. Once the merchandise is made, the wholesalers send sample ornaments to their showrooms, which, by October, are being decorated for the next Gift & Home Furnishings Market. It often takes three months to completely decorate a showroom. By comparison, it's relatively easy for the average consumer to choose from a dizzying array of shiny ornaments in a store. According to Hooper, shoppers did so with enough verve last holiday season to deplete a lot of the inventory that boutiques had been holding on to. Hooper said for the last two years, many of the retailers visiting her store have been nervous about the economy. Instead of buying a lot of new merchandise at AmericasMart, they've been stocking shelves with ornaments left over from previous years. ""A lot of our customers, whether small or large, indicated that the fourth quarter Christmas sales were outstanding, so they were able to deplete a lot of that inventory,"" she said. And now those boutiques and specialty stores are ready to replenish their stock. ""Generally, my budget is several thousand dollars for each showroom, and so far I've been doing my job,"" said Casto, the Ohio flower shop owner, as she looked around the Gift & Home Furnishings Market. ""For us, we usually spend around $20,000 every time we come in January, and about $15,000 when we come back in July."" Casto said this was her 16th year coming to the market. ""I'm wearing very comfortable shoes, because it's like a marathon,"" said Spath, the buyer for the Indiana Christmas store.","Retailers buy Christmas ornaments 11 months in advance .
Wholesalers create the ornaments 2 years in advance .
The Atlanta International Gift & Home Furnishings Market is ""like a marathon"" for buyers .
Christmas 2011 will bring vintage-feeling ornaments as well as bright, whimsical colors ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department called on the government of Iran Wednesday to investigate the death of a human rights activist this week, reportedly after security forces got into a confrontation with mourners at her father's funeral. Haleh Sahabi, an opposition activist and women's rights advocate, was arrested during Iran's 2009 post-election crackdown and was given a two-year jail sentence. She was allowed out of prison to attend the funeral of her father, noted Iranian dissident Ezatollah Sahabi. According to opposition websites, Sahabi was pushed to the ground during a scuffle between mourners and security forces and died of cardiac arrest. She was in her mid-50s. The opposition web site Kaleme said that security forces tried to interfere with the carrying of the body, confronting Sahabi and other mourners. She was clutching a photo of her father to her chest and fell when the security forces tried to take it from her, Kaleme reported. Another opposition site, Sahamnews, said one of the security forces punched her in the abdomen. ""Both Haleh and her father suffered in life for their political activism including imprisonment,"" deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""We call on the Iranian government to investigate the circumstances of her death. If reports are accurate that government security forces contributed to her death, this would demonstrate a deplorable disregard for human dignity and respect on the part of the Iranian authorities."" Toner questioned the presence of security forces at the funeral and said the initial reports that Sahabi's death was related to the scuffle between the mourners and the security forces need explaining. ""Why Iranian security forces would have been at this event is question number one, and question number two is whether there was some kind of physical altercation that caused her to suffer,"" he said. Semi-official news agencies like Mehr and Fars said that Sahabi had not died at the hands of security forces, but rather due to a pre-existing heart condition. Sahabi's death comes just two weeks before the June 12 anniversary of the 2009 Iranian election, in which the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad angered supporters of Iran's opposition movement and sparked massive protests that were followed by a crackdown by the Iranian government. The Obama administration has increased pressure on the Iranian regime over alleged human rights violations, imposing sanctions recently on individuals believed to be responsible for violence against the opposition.","Women's rights advocate Ezatollah Sahabi dies at her father's funeral .

"New York (CNN) -- A Broadway actor who fell more than 20 feet during an aerial stunt in the musical ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,"" will attend Friday's 8 p.m. performance as a spectator, according to show spokesman Sam Corbett. Christopher Tierney, 31, was released from New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine on Wednesday, after suffering four broken ribs; a hairline skull fracture; a broken shoulder blade; a bruised lung; three cracked vertebrae,and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, according to his father. ""He is up,"" Tim Tierney said of his son, discharged from New York's Bellevue Hospital on December 28. ""He is walking and just doing very well."" Several of the performances were canceled following the December 20 incident, as new safety measures were put in place following a meeting with officials from the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The behind-the-scenes drama at the $65 million production ­-- including a series of mishaps resulting in actor injuries -- has continued to raise questions over its safety record. The younger Tierney said Tuesday he was looking forward to returning to the show and not concerned about his safety. ""I'm not worried about it,"" he said. ""They've got it well taken care of."" Another actor in the show, Patrick Page, said the new measures have increased communication between actors and safety personnel.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two detainees released from the U.S. military's prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have been transferred to Kuwait and Belgium, the Department of Justice announced Friday. A detainee inside the Guantanamo Bay prison is shown in May 2009. It only identified Khalid Abdullah Mishal al-Mutairi, a Kuwaiti native, who was transferred to his home country. Belgium's government asked Washington not to reveal the identity of the detainee it has accepted. Al-Mutairi was released on Thursday after spending nearly eight years in Guantanamo, according to the Kuwaiti Family Committee, an advocacy group for Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo. It is unclear when the second detainee was transferred to Belgium. Al-Mutairi's release follows a federal court ruling on July 29 as well as pressure from Kuwait's government, the group said. Al-Mutairi will be housed in a rehabilitation center in Kuwait, recently built by the government to provide the detainees with ""education, medical care, group discussions and physical exercise to help them recover from their long ordeal in Guantanamo,"" the Kuwaiti Family Committee said. The center was modeled after a similar program in Saudi Arabia. The recently released detainees join more than 550 from Guantanamo who have been transferred to 32 countries. More than 220 detainees remain at Guantanamo. The House of Representatives recently voted overwhelmingly not to allow detainees to be brought to the United States for trials or to be housed as prisoners. Attorney General Eric Holder has expressed frustration with congressional curbs on bringing the detainees to the United States, but said he thinks he can turn Congress around on the issue. ""I think we ultimately will be in a position to convince a majority of the members of Congress that that restriction should be removed,"" Holder said this month. Holder acknowledged the administration's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison continue to run into delays, and that President Obama's January deadline for closing it will likely have to be delayed. Holder has personally vowed to lobby to change minds on Capitol Hill. But he also acknowledged there are other sticking points. ""One of the things that we're going to have to do to (is) come up with a facility in the United States to house people that are brought for trial here. That's something we're in the process of working on,"" he said. The countries that have agreed to house Guantanamo detainees include Albania, Algeria, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belgium, Bermuda, Chad, Denmark, Egypt, France, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda, United Kingdom and Yemen.","More than 550 Guantanamo detainees have been transferred to 32 countries .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish court on Tuesday approved the extradition of former Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Vielmann to his homeland to face 10 murder charges stemming from incidents at two prisons there. Vielmann, who holds dual Guatemalan and Spanish citizenship, has the option to appeal the ruling. The final decision on extradition lies with the Spanish government. What the court found Tuesday was that the Guatemalan request for extradition to face murder charges was approved under an extradition treaty between the two countries. In addition to the murder charges, the Guatemalan government cited charges of illicit association and extrajudicial killings as reasons for extradition, but the Spanish court found that those charges were not covered by the treaty. Vielmann faces charges in both Spain and Guatemala stemming from the same incident, a 2006 uprising at the El Pavon prison in Guatemala where seven inmates were killed. The Interior Ministry and police said at the time that the prisoners were killed during a violent confrontation with prison authorities. However, a report by the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office concluded the prisoners had been executed. Vielmann is wanted in Guatemala in connection with the seven killings. He also has been accused of ordering the killings of three inmates who escaped from El Infiernito prison in 2005. He was arrested in Spain in October 2010, and has been on provisional release since November. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","Carlos Vielmann faces murder charges in Guatemala .

"(CNN) -- Election night could be a long one. Many of the polls continue to show a tight race with the candidates remaining in a dead heat in the swing states. Whoever wins the election, it might not be by much. Close elections have produced challenges for the victor once he starts his term in the White House. If voters don't provide a clear mandate, presidents often find that they have added challenges when dealing with Congress, as legislators have far less fear about the commander in chief. In 1916, for example, President Woodrow Wilson won reelection against former Supreme Court Justice Charles Evan Hughes by 23 electoral votes and 3.1 percent of the popular vote. The victory, which depended on Wilson's assurances to keep the U.S. out of war, hardened the lines of partisan battle. Republicans returned to Washington angry about how he had used the potential for war against them, even as he ushered the nation into World War I soon after the election. During the war, and especially during the fight over the peace treaty that followed, Wilson found little cooperation from Republicans who felt confident that they could take him on in the home front. Opinion: Media's pointless speculation over election outcome . When Massachusetts Sen. John F. Kennedy defeated Vice President Richard Nixon in 1960 by 84 electoral votes and only 0.2 percent of the popular vote, the conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans in Congress read the close outcome as evidence that the young senator did not have a popular mandate. The fact that Democrats didn't enjoy any coattails from his victory even made liberals and moderates nervous about going out too far on a limb for the president. On domestic policy, Kennedy found most of his legislation stifled in congressional committees through the time of his assassination. Opinion: Both parties have a huge race problem . When former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter squeaked out victory against President Gerald Ford in 1976, the same pattern recurred. Though Carter had excited many Democrats during the primary by promising voters that they could trust him in the aftermath of Watergate, he won by only 2.1 percent of the popular vote and 57 electoral votes. The nation was ""hopeful, sort of,"" quipped Time. During his first two years, Carter struggled to win support from his own party on issues like energy conservation, while Republicans such as Ronald Reagan felt emboldened to take him on over issues such as tax cuts and foreign policy. From the moment he entered office, the fragility of his election victory motivated Democratic and Republican opponents, who both played a role in his defeat in 1980. Texas Gov. George W. Bush came under fire in 2000 when the Supreme Court ordered an end to a recount in Florida, resulting in his winning the presidency against Vice President Al Gore by five electoral votes. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore by 0.5 percent. Many Democrats felt that the election had been stolen from them. Bush was not deterred and governed as if he had a mandate, pushing through a massive tax cut in 2001. His political standing was helped by the fact that the attacks of September 11, 2001, created a sense of national emergency and inspired a ""rally around the leader"" effect. But stalemate soon set in, as Democrats had little appetite to help him. Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012 . The 2004 election, which Bush won by 35 electoral votes and 2.4 percent of the popular vote, also generated controversy as some Democrats felt that there had been voter suppression and rigged voting machines in the crucial state of Ohio by Republican-supporting groups. Republicans claimed there had been voter fraud in other states, like Pennsylvania. Bush never received the political capital he expected from his reelection victory and saw most of his domestic legislative proposals languish. Opinion: Cool Obama vs. square Romney . In today's political era, every president -- even those who enjoy landslide victories -- faces immense challenges working in the current congressional environment. Partisan polarization, interest-group politics and the 24-hour media make legislating difficult. But narrow elections only make things worse, and this would be the case for either a second term for President Barack Obama or a first term for Mitt Romney. The situation would be even worse if certain states are contested, as occurred in 2000, and if the chaos from Hurricane Sandy results in logistical problems in parts of the East Coast. The winner would walk into a toxic Washington environment with the perception that their mandate is thin. Added to all of this is the fact that the winner of the electoral college vote might not be the winner of the popular vote, as has occurred a handful of other times in U.S. history. Of course, the polls could be off and we might be heading to another Truman defeats Dewey moment, such as occurred in 1948 when the president proved the pollsters wrong and enjoyed a comfortable reelection victory. But since that's probably not the case, we'll be heading toward some rough times on Capitol Hill in the years ahead. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Close elections often produce challenges for presidents, says Julian Zelizer .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Hina Khan used to take her life in her hands every morning just to get to school. Hina Khan, 14, fled to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, to escape the Taliban. When she stepped outside her door, the 14-year-old knew that ahead could be suicide bombings, gunfights, kidnappings and beheadings. Death threats were made against her, other students and teachers every day simply because they went to a girls' school in Pakistan targeted by Taliban militants. ""They said don't send your girls to school,"" Hina told CNN. She used to live in the Swat Valley, a scenic mountainous region once popular with tourists and dubbed ""Pakistan's Switzerland."" But those were the days before militants moved in, ""striking the fear of God"" into residents with violence as they pushed for compliance with stricter moral and religious standards -- so-called Talibanization. Now she is safer, 100 miles away in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, but her thoughts are often with her friends in Swat, near the border with Afghanistan. They do not even go to school now, as authorities gave in to militant demands to shut all girls' schools. As many as 200 schools, mostly for girls, have been destroyed since November 2007 when the Taliban began their campaign to take control of the Swat Valley and surrounding areas. ""They have problems there,"" Hina said of those left behind.  Watch how the Taliban's power has changed the valley » . ""How can they leave their land, their home? Why come here? Here it's expensive, and they are all poor. They can't come here. And I feel really bad. All my friends are there. There is no one here."" The targeting of girls' schools shows an anti-women bias by the militants, who advocate an extreme following of a version of Islamic law, according to Islamabad-based human rights activist Tahira Abdullah. She adds it's almost as if the Taliban does not want women to exist. ""And if they do exist, they need to be within the four walls of their house compound; they need to be veiled,"" she said. Abdullah is blunt in her assessment of the situation. ""Right now, [Swat Valley] is under the control of the Taliban,"" she said. ""They are knocking on the doors of Peshawar, and I have no doubt they will be knocking on the doors of Islamabad [if] the government continues the complacency they are showing right now."" But the accusation of complacency is rejected by Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, spokesman for the Pakistan military. ""There is success,"" Abbas said of operations against anti-government forces in the tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan. ""The success rate of the army's operation is pretty good in these areas."" He attacked critics of the military operation for failing to recognize the sacrifices of the armed forces. About 1,300 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in operations against militants since 9/11, he said. And he said the fight was made harder because the army lacked modern equipment such as night-vision goggles and unmanned drones. But the military's continuing fight to secure the area is alienating those it is supposed to help. Some residents said the government is doing more damage than the Taliban ever did. ""If the government doesn't stop this cruelty, finally we will be forced to come here, and this parliament, we will set it on fire, too,"" said Israr Ali, standing outside the parliament building in Islamabad recently. Ali had traveled there with hundreds of others from the tribal regions for a protest organized by an Islamic political party in the federal capital. He said army operations have turned his home into a war zone and that shelling from army helicopters has destroyed buildings and killed his friends and neighbors. The Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies reported that in 2008 at least 7,997 people were killed in terrorist attacks, clashes between security forces and militants, military operations, incidents of political violence, sectarian strife between tribes and border clashes. More than 230,000 people have fled their homes as a result of fighting in the tribal areas and the Swat Valley, according to a report last month by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Those people include Hina, who fled with her parents and four younger siblings so that they could continue their education. Hina said she is still scared of the Taliban. But she also is focused on school and her dream to become a doctor. And when she does that, she has another goal -- to help her country ""fix problems.""","As many as 200 schools destroyed under Taliban pressure in Pakistan's Swat Valley .

"(CNN) -- Burt Reinhardt, a television pioneer who helped lead the evolution of 24-hour news coverage as president of CNN, died Tuesday at 91, according to family members. Reinhardt died in Georgia, according to his daughter, Cheryl Reinhardt. She said he had been suffering complications following a series of strokes earlier this year. Cable News Network founder Ted Turner remembered Reinhardt, who stayed away from the limelight, as an influential, if taciturn, executive. ""We both wanted to run a great news organization,"" Turner said. ""He just did a masterful job. He got the stories covered, but he did it within the budget."" After a stint as a vice president, Reinhardt served as CNN president from 1983 to 1990. He later was vice chairman of the organization until his retirement in 2000. Former CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Reinhardt was a leader who made the trains run on time. ""He had a steely demeanor, but had a heart of gold,"" said Amanpour, who said Reinhardt hired her as a producer-reporter in New York after she pleaded her case. ""I'm not sure CNN would be here without him,"" said Turner, who launched CNN in 1980. His colleague was an ""integral part of getting the whole operation going and keeping it going. He ran it close to 20 years."" A native of New York, Reinhardt filmed U.S. Army Signal Corps combat footage during World War II, including Gen. Douglas MacArthur's historic return to the Philippines. Reinhardt later served as news editor for Fox Movietone News, according to his daughter. He also was vice president for United Press International Television News and executive vice president at Paramount Pictures, where he nurtured the development of home video. ""I tell people that in my opinion, he's probably the most important and powerful news executive you've never heard of,"" said nephew Harlan Reinhardt. Amanpour said Reinhardt's past as a World War II photographer helped. ""I realized there and then that this wasn't just an executive in a suit. It's a man who's been there. This is a man who's one of us. This is a man who was in the field who covered the wars and so he knew what it took to run a news operation like CNN and keep it afloat when everybody was digging its grave."" Reese Schoenfeld, who was the first president of CNN and was replaced by Reinhardt, said Reinhardt's work was pivotal to the growth of the network. ""He was a person of integrity and a great newsman,"" said Schoenfeld. ""I'm not sure that I would've had the financial discipline or the capability of doing that nearly as well as Burt did and it really saved the company -- it's the only reason CNN exists today."" Tom Johnson, who replaced Reinhardt as CNN's third president, said he developed an unusual relationship with him over the years. ""I will never forget that after Ted Turner and I reached an agreement that I would become the new president of CNN in 1990, I asked Ted, could I retain Burt Reinhardt as vice chairman of the company,"" Johnson said. ""Most new CEO's coming in do not wish to have the former CEO around. But I just felt I needed - I needed Burt."" Johnson also credited Reinhardt for steering the news organization through trying financial times. ""I'm sure a lot of people will talk about Burt's fiscal responsibility. but I think what set Burt apart from everyone else who has been at CNN was that he was quietly strong,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""And behind the scenes, this man has integrity and he's very competitive, but he wants to do things the right way. He's fair, but firm and he treated everyone with respect."" Reinhardt helped solidify the CNN logo as a strong symbol. The logo, now commonly known as a ""bug"" in broadcast jargon, is almost always on the television screen during CNN's news coverage. This idea was the brainchild of Reinhardt. Reinhardt, who grew up in the Bronx, is survived by his wife, Diana Shaw; children, Cheryl Reinhardt of Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Gary Reinhardt of Provincetown, Massachusetts; and one grandchild. He was predeceased by son, Barry, and his identical twin, Sheldon. CNN's Richard Roth, Katie Silver and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","Burt Reinhardt was a key CNN executive during the network's crucial early years .

"Vilseck, Germany (CNN) -- The military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned. ""In most cases, if we don't have anything, eventually they'll be released,"" said Brig. Gen. David Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq. Quantock said ""many cases are driven purely on intelligence."" ""Intelligence does not win a fight in a courtroom. It doesn't win the fight in a courtroom in the United States. It doesn't win in Iraq."" According to the U.S. military, 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the Iraq war. A CNN investigation found that frustration over the Army's policy on detainees may have led to the 2007 killings of four Iraqi men by three decorated Army sergeants at a Baghdad canal. Former 1st Sgt. John Hatley, who led the mission that day, told CNN in a letter that the detainee policy has ""extensive flaws"" that repeatedly frustrated soldiers. On Army interrogation tapes obtained by CNN, other soldiers complained about the Army rules for evidence gathering. Despite the high release rate, Quantock said he has confidence soldiers can take basic evidence from a crime scene in Iraq. ""We're asking them to take basic evidence, which they've been trained to do,"" said Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq. ""We've got the greatest soldiers in the world. And I don't accept that they can't take basic evidence off of a crime scene."" CNN asked Quantock to explain why, if it were so easy to collect evidence, so many detainees have been released. ""It took us a while to realize, it goes back to my point of we were trying to make the fight fit the Army as opposed to have the Army fit the fight,"" Quantock said. ""I think a lot of times we thought the insurgency would dissipate, we were working closely with the government of Iraq, we were trying to improve the Iraqi security forces, but at the end of the day, it didn't work out very well. We had to get better at taking evidence off the crime scene."" A January 9, 2005, memo imposed detailed standards of evidence soldiers needed before taking in suspected insurgents in Iraq. Quantock told CNN the rules detailed in the memo were in effect through the end of 2008. The memo spells out that evidence of criminal activity should include photos of ""physical evidence,"" ""the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture,"" as well as photos ""of the detainee next to the evidence."" Other evidence should include ""statements written by first-hand witnesses to the criminal activity,"" the memo states. At the start of this year, the rules got even stricter.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Yingluck Shinawatra was poised to become Thailand's first female prime minister Sunday after her party won a majority of parliamentary seats in the nation's general elections. The official tally had not yet been completed, but with more than 90 percent of votes counted Sunday night, Yingluck's Pheu Thai party had won 262 seats in the country's 500-seat parliament. ""The first thing I want to do is help people on their economic situation,"" she said earlier Sunday, refusing to declare victory until the official count was over. Minutes before, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva conceded that she had won. Yingluck is the younger sister of one of Thailand's most polarizing political figures, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. Two years later, he left the country after being convicted on conflict of interest charges -- accusations that he still denies. Flags with his image waved in the sticky night air outside the Pheu Thai headquarters. A child wearing a shirt with his sister Yingluck's picture on it walked past them, trying to get closer to the celebration outside. Yingluck's critics worry she will simply do her brother's bidding -- something she has denied. Before she even gave her victory speech, her brother shared his comments from exile in Dubai. ""Well, I would tell them that I really want to go back, but I will wait for the right moment and the right situation,"" Thaksin told reporters. The Pheu Thai party remains fiercely behind Thaksin and wants him to return. The so-called ""Yellow Shirts,"" a group that formed to oust Thaksin from power, will do whatever they can to stop that from happening. What does his sister say about all this? CNN asked her three days before the election. ""I can't do anything special for my brother so as long as if my brother will be every process we will follow by the rule of law,"" Yingluck said. With about 47 million eligible voters in Thailand, Sunday's balloting was held to decide Thailand's first general election since 2007, an election that many hope will bring an end to years of unrest between two political factions that climaxed last year with protests that turned deadly. ""There is a lot more hard work to do in the future for the well-being of our sisters and brothers, the people of Thailand,"" Yingluck said Sunday. ""There are many things to accomplish to make reconciliation possible, paving the way for a solid foundation for a flourishing nation."" Tensions between the Democratic Party and the Pheu Thai party, which reflect deep divisions within Thai society, erupted last year, with protests against Abhisit's government leading to a military crackdown. More than 90 people were killed and hundreds were injured. After the riots, the Thai government pledged to work toward a process of national reconciliation to heal class and political divisions, though the divide between the two groups remains wide. But average Thai voters were more concerned with economic issues, wanting their leaders to shrink the gap between what they earn and the skyrocketing cost of living. Thai election makes history but can winners keep promises? ""Free education is good, care for elderly is also good. In fact every parties' policies are all good, the question is if they would ever implement them."" Banorn Achriyawatkul said as she worked outside a polling station. After being laid off from her job as a secretary, the mother of four is now a food vendor in the streets, trying to make ends meet. Despite the animosity between them, the two major parties have made very similar promises to the people: a better economy, free education, and a major increase in the minimum wage -- exactly what many voters wanted to hear. But analysts say the extravagant programs will cost more than Thailand can afford. Supong Limtanakool of Bangkok University's Center for Strategic Studies said both parties made big promises they just can't keep. ""It will be something that we have to spend somewhere between an additional 1.5 trillion baht to 7.5 trillion baht (49 billion dollars to 244 billion dollars) with all the extravagant programs, which is five times the national budget. ... I mean, we'll be broke in one year,"" he said. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Benjamin Gottlieb contributed to this report.","The Pheu Thai party has won at least 262 seats in the 500-seat parliament .

"(CNN) -- U.S. officials have recommended immunity for a former Mexican president implicated in a U.S. federal court case over his alleged role in a 1997 massacre. Survivors of the attack and heirs of the 45 villagers killed in the massacre filed a civil lawsuit last year, accusing former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo of crimes against humanity. A court filing from the U.S. government Friday supported Zedillo's argument that he should be immune from prosecution. Lawyers for plaintiffs in responded Saturday by stating they understand the former president now has immunity as a result, thereby preventing them from proceeding with their case against him. ""The alleged actions as set forth in the complaint are predicated on former President Zedillo's actions as president of Mexico, thus involving the exercise of his powers of office,"" the U.S. government court filing said. The filing concluded by saying ""the United States has determined that former President Zedillo enjoys immunity from this lawsuit."" Arguments that Zedillo ""should be held liable for lower level officials' tortious conduct simply by virtue of his position as president at the time"" were not enough to change the U.S. State Department's assessment, officials said in the filing. Zedillo claims immunity . The lead attorneys representing plaintiffs in the case said they were ""deeply disappointed by the U.S. State Department's decision,"" which they said will ""prevent us from ... presenting proof of (Zedillo's) responsibility for the 1997 Acteal Massacre."" ""Based on the substantial testimony and documentation that we have collected, we are extremely confident that the highest levels of Mr. Zedillo's government had advance knowledge of and directly participated in the conspiracy that led to Acteal Massacre and its cover-up,"" Florida-based lawyers Roger Kobert and Marc Pugliese said, according to a statement released Saturday. The attorneys also criticized the U.S. government for basing its decision ""on communications between Mr. Zedillo, the current Mexican government and the U.S. government"" that were not related to the plaintiff's lawyers or the general public. Zedillo himself did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case has been closely watched on both sides of the border, particularly as the six-year term of current Mexican President Felipe Calderon -- whose administration has been accused by some of human rights abuses in the nation's drug war -- nears its end. Zedillo was Mexico's president from 1994 to 2000. The civil case against him was filed nearly a year ago in Connecticut, where Zedillo resides while he teaches at Yale University. It accuses him of being responsible for the killings of 45 villagers in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, and afterward conspiring to cover it up. Ten anonymous plaintiffs were seeking about $50 million in damages against him, according to court documents. Although the killings happened in Mexico, the lawsuit argued that a long list of U.S. laws and international treaties -- including the Alien Tort Claims Act and Torture Victim Protection Act -- give the American federal court jurisdiction to try the case. The killings occurred on December 22, 1997, and are considered among the more brutal incidents during an armed conflict that began three years earlier in southern Mexico after Zapatista rebels pushed for more rights for indigenous people. Zedillo has denied allegations that his office was somehow responsible for the deaths. ""These anonymous accusations that President Zedillo was somehow complicit in the events in Acteal are baseless and outrageous,"" he said in a January court filing. ""The December 1997 attack in Acteal was an appalling tragedy. But that tragedy was not the result of an elaborate conspiracy by the Mexican federal government, masterminded by President Zedillo."" CNN's David Ariosto and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","NEW: Plaintiff's lawyers criticize Zedillo being granted immunity, say he knew about the killings .

"Washington (CNN) -- New documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union show ""unjustified homicide"" of detainees and concerns about the condition of confinement in U.S.-run prisons in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, according to the ACLU. Thousands of documents detailing the deaths of 190 U.S. detainees were released by the ACLU on Friday. The U.S. military gave the ACLU the documents earlier in the week as a result of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by the rights group. Among the documents are autopsy reports and military investigations, including 25 to 30 cases the ACLU says it believes are ""unjustified homicide."" Some of the homicides in the documents are widely known and have been reported in the media, such as the case of four Iraqi detainees executed by a group of U.S. soldiers and then pushed into a Baghdad canal in 2007. Others are thought by the ACLU to be new. In one such case, a detainee was killed by an unnamed sergeant who walked into a room where the detainee was lying wounded ""and assaulted him ... then shot him twice thus killing him,"" one of the investigating documents says. The sergeant than instructed the other soldiers present to lie about the incident. Later, the document says an unnamed corporal then shot the deceased detainee in the head after finding his corpse. In another example, documents note a soldier ""committed the offense of murder when he shot and killed an unarmed Afghan male."" But, according to the ACLU, the individual was found not guilty of murder by general court-martial. ""So far, the documents released by the government raise more questions than they answer, but they do confirm one troubling fact: that no senior officials have been held to account for the widespread abuse of detainees. Without real accountability for these abuses, we risk inviting more abuse in the future,"" the ACLU said in a statement. The Defense Department disputes the allegations, saying it takes detainee treatment seriously. ""DoD policy requires the immediate reporting of detainee deaths to appropriate DoD criminal investigative agencies regardless of the circumstances at the time of death,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Tanya Bradsher. ""Indeed, the fact that so many autopsies and investigative reports exist indicates the seriousness with which the Department takes its responsibilities regarding detainee treatment and accountability."" Of the investigations in the documents, 43 had U.S. soldiers or personnel as potential suspects, according to Lt. Col. David H. Patterson, an Army spokesman. Probable cause for murder was found in 13 of those investigations, resulting in 19 separate convictions, Patterson said, many of which carried significant sentences, with some soldiers receiving 20 years or more. ""It's important to remember that the majority of these detainee deaths were due to reasons not directly involving U.S. personnel. For example, a number were the result of detainee-on-detainee violence,"" Patterson said. ""Although there have been cases of individuals involved in misconduct, there is no evidence of systematic abuse by the United States military,"" said Bradsher. ""The (Defense) Department has detained more than 100,000 individuals in Iraq and Afghanistan, many with pre-existing medical conditions or battlefield wounds. Detainees in DoD custody have died from a number of causes including enemy attacks, detainee-on-detainee violence, battlefield injuries, and natural causes."" One concern noted by the ACLU is the amount of deaths that involved cardiac problems: over 25%. The group says it is looking into this finding. ""This could potentially raise serious questions about the conditions of confinement or interrogation of the detainees,"" the ACLU said. The ACLU obtained the 2,624 pages of documents through a Freedom of Information Act request filed with the government in 2009. The package included about 124 autopsy and 133 investigation reports.","Documents show ""unjustified homicide"" of detainees, ACLU says .

"New York (CNN) -- As news of his admission and apology reverberated Tuesday throughout the country and in the halls of Congress, those who hold Rep. Anthony Weiner's political future in their hands debated whether the scandal will be his downfall. Some voters in Weiner's district said he should ""never resign,"" while others called for his immediate ouster. While Weiner -- first elected to Congress in 1998 -- has generally enjoyed strong backing in New York's 9th District, his confession Monday that he has sent lewd photos of himself to women, had inappropriate relationships, and lied to the media unleashed a series of questions about his political future. What do you think about Rep. Weiner's confession? ""It's scary that, you know, a political person that we elected would be able to do something like that,"" said Ally Nekta, a voter in Weiner's New York district. ""He should resign,"" said fellow voter Berta Nektalov. Weiner has said he will not give up his seat. Perhaps Weiner's troubles are best summarized by a handwritten note posted outside his district office in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York: ""Resign, Pervert Weiner."" Eva Slomobits, 82, has lived in Sheepshead Bay for 50 years. When asked Tuesday whether Weiner should resign, the lifelong Democrat -- who campaigned for him -- said, ""Yes. I definitely won't vote for him, I think of him as a different person."" ""He betrayed his wife,"" Slomobits added. ""You have to think before you make a mistake."" Others took the opposite position. ""Actually, I'm glad he's not resigning,"" Patrick Riley said. ""What he does on his personal time is his business."" Jenny McCourt, a registered Republican who has lived in the district 40 years, said Weiner should ""definitely not"" resign. ""He's a human being,"" McCourt said. ""He made a mistake."" ""I think he's one of the most effective, decent congressman out there,"" said Brooklyn native Richard Elliott. Weiner's behavior was ""stupid,"" Elliott said, but not something to resign over. He also said, ""I find it ridiculous that that would be the news"" when so much else is going on in the world. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced that she would call for an ethics committee investigation ""to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred."" Weiner insists no government resources were used. He issued a statement saying he would ""welcome and fully cooperate"" with the probe, which other Democratic leaders also rallied behind. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, when asked about the controversy Tuesday, said, ""I've known Congressman Weiner. I wish there was some way I could defend him, but I can't."" Later, when asked what he would do if Weiner called him for advice, Reid replied, ""I'd tell him to call someone else."" If Weiner were to resign or be compelled to leave office, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, would determine the timing of a special election to replace him. Whether or not he holds onto his congressional seat, many analysts believe he will pay a tremendous political price: losing his spot as a frontrunner in New York's 2013 mayoral election. ""He would have had my vote. Not now,"" said Ralph Polese, 55, a retired school custodian. Polese also said Weiner should resign from Congress ""because of the way he disgraced his family."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Tuesday, ""It's hard to believe, given the coverage that all of the press has given this situation, that any voters in his district aren't familiar with the situation, what happened, whatever, and they will have an opportunity to express themselves in one year and four months from now. In the meantime, you know, I keep saying, this country has lots of very big problems that maybe we should all focus on and Congress should certainly get back to work and focus on."" Republicans have jumped on the situation, targeting Democrats who have accepted financial donations from Weiner over the years. The National Republican Congressional Committee sent out news releases focusing on at least 18 districts across the country, asking whether Democratic lawmakers will ""return embattled Congressman Weiner's tainted cash."" The news releases don't suggest Weiner collected money inappropriately, but they refer to him as ""ethically troubled"" and call on the lawmakers to return his money and ""condemn Weiner's outrageous behavior."" One focusing on Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, notes that he has received a total of $3,000 from Weiner in the past. Weiner's admission Monday came a week after he claimed a hacker had posted a lewd photo to his Twitter account. Speaking at a news conference Monday, he said he had carried on inappropriate relationships with several women he had met online. Weiner said he is not planning on separating from his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He said he took ""full responsibility"" for his actions -- both the relationships and for lying about sending the photo last month of his bulging underwear on his Twitter account. ""To be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it. I'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife, and our family, my constituents, my friends, my supporters and my staff,"" he said, claiming he meant to send the photo as a direct message -- which is private -- as a ""joke"" and then ""panicked"" after he realized he had tweeted it, which anyone can see. ""I lied because I was ashamed at what I had done, and I didn't want to get caught,"" he said. An emotional Weiner described his actions as ""dumb,"" ""destructive"" and ""deeply, deeply hurtful"" -- both for his admitted cover-up and for repeatedly engaging in ""inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, Facebook, e-mail and occasionally on the phone"" with women he'd met online, mostly via Facebook. The congressman claimed that he never met any of the women in person, and that his wife learned he'd been lying about the Twitter picture on Monday morning. The admission came hours after images were published on BigGovernment.com, a conservative website run by Andrew Breitbart, that apparently show Weiner shirtless. ""I have made terrible mistakes,"" Weiner told reporters. ""I have not been honest with myself or my family. ... I should not have done this, and I should not have done this particularly when I was married."" Weiner said he ""exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years."" Some of those relationships began before his 2010 marriage; some continued -- and others began-- afterward, he said. During his news conference, Weiner apologized ""to everyone that I misled in the media"" -- including Breitbart -- but most of all to his wife. ""This was me doing a dumb thing, and doing it repeatedly, then lying about it,"" Weiner said. Breitbart's website was the first to publish an incriminating photo, sent May 27 via Twitter from Weiner's account of a man in his underwear. Weiner initially released written statements claiming that he was the victim of a hacker and a prank. Then, during a testy press conference, he dodged questions about whether the photo was of him and why he hadn't asked law enforcement to investigate if his account had been compromised. The following day, in a series of interviews, he said he could not say with ""certitude"" if the photograph was of him. He also deflected recent questions from CNN, saying he had hired an attorney at the firm of Baker Hostetler to look into the matter. The woman who received the Twitter photo in late May, Gennette Cordova, denied on her own account that she was one of the women with whom Weiner admitted having an ""inappropriate relationship."" ABC News reports that Meagan Broussard, a 26-year-old single mother from Texas, provided them with dozens of photos, e-mails, Facebook messages and cell phone call logs related to her relationship with Weiner. In a posting on BigGovernment.com, Broussard said she was a U.S. Army veteran and full-time college student who, on April 20, went to Weiner's Facebook page and commented that the congressman was ""hot"" on one of his videos. She said the two began corresponding ""within an hour,"" adding that she didn't know if he is a ""horrible person"" but decided to speak out after hearing he'd ""hired an investigative firm to go through all of his files."" Many Democrats first rallied around the liberal congressman. But members of the House Democratic leadership have talked repeatedly in recent days to try to get him to end what has become, to them, an unwelcome political distraction, a member of the party's leadership told CNN before Weiner's press conference Monday. ""It's frustrating because we'll talk to him and say clean it up, and then he goes out and does stuff,"" said the member of the House Democratic leadership, who declined to speak on the record about private discussions with Weiner. ""He's got to put the period at the end of the sentence,"" the Democratic source said before Weiner's confession. ""It's painful.""

"Berlin (CNN) -- Sprouts grown in Germany are the likely source for an E. coli outbreak that has killed 22 people, officials said Sunday. Gert Lindemann, agricultural minister of Lower Saxony, said there is a ""direct link"" between a company in the town of Bienenbuettel and ""these people getting sick."" The firm has been shut down and its products have been recalled, Lindemann said. It is not immediately clear how the E. coli strain may have gotten into the sprouts, officials said. Sprouts are bred in large drums. No E. coli has been found in the company. Authorities say the infection may have taken place too long ago to be found at the company itself. But several restaurants and cafeterias linked to the outbreak got sprouts from the company, officials said. Two workers at the agricultural company, which was not identified, have come down with severe cases of diarrhea; in at least one of those cases, E. coli was the cause, Lindemann said. Bienenbuettel is in the district of Uelzen in north-central Germany. The outbreak of a virulent strain of E. coli has infected more than 2,200 people in at least 12 countries, European health authorities said on Sunday. All but one of the 22 fatalities were reported in Germany, where officials say it's too early to determine whether the peak of the outbreak has passed. One person in Sweden also died after visiting Germany. Last week, Spain vehemently rejected suggestions that its cucumbers could be blamed, after the European Food Safety Alert Network said E. coli was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. In Germany, there have been 627 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure -- in the current European outbreak, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. That's more cases of HUS than in any other recorded outbreak, worldwide. Fifteen patients in Germany have died of HUS, according to the center, while six died of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, a strain that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines and can result in abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. Reports indicate that an estimated 1,605 people have that E. coli strain so far but do not have HUS, according to the center. Infections have also been identified in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the organization. Two women and a man who traveled last month to northern Germany remain hospitalized in the United States with HUS, Chris Braden of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. A fourth person developed bloody diarrhea, but was not hospitalized, he added. Two U.S. service members in Germany also developed diarrhea, Braden said. ""We have no expectation that this will spread in our country,"" he added. The U.S. government website foodsafety.gov says that since 1996, ""there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of food-borne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts. Most of these outbreaks were caused by Salmonella and E. coli."" The World Health Organization says that in Japan in 1996, ""an outbreak linked to contaminated radish sprouts in school lunches caused 9,451 cases"" of E. coli. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: There have been 30 outbreaks of food-borne illness from sprouts since 1996, the U.S. says .

"Minot, North Dakota (CNN) -- Waters rushed into an overflowing lake near Minot, North Dakota, faster and in greater amounts than expected Thursday, officials said, exacerbating the region's flood concerns. But Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman said Thursday that no new evacuations had been ordered, even though ""the flows coming into Lake Darling are reaching the lake quicker and at a greater volume than predicted."" ""Due to this, Lake Darling has increased its outflow,"" the mayor added -- increasing flooding in the flood-plain, though not to a point that it yet changes the ""inundation zone."" Evacuations stand at about 12,000, according to Minot Fire Department Capt. Dean Lenertz.  The mayor of Minot and the state's governor congratulated citizens on an organized and efficient evacuation thus far, with Gov. Jack Dalrymple saying it had ""gone extremely well."" Sirens sounded in Minot early Wednesday afternoon, urging residents to abandon their homes in the face of major flooding.  Water is already overtopping the city's dikes, which are leaking in some places. Populated areas are seeing a couple inches of water on the ground at this time, and there is significant concern about dikes eroding, Lenertz said. Dalrymple said that ""all agencies are engaged"" statewide in addressing the issue. He noted, for example, that workers with North Dakota's transportation department are moving 100,000 sandbags from Bismarck to the Minot area, and there are about 500 National Guard personnel on site. The National Weather Service predicted record flooding as heavy rains and dam releases cause the river to swell at Minot. The Souris River is expected to crest on Monday, two to three days earlier than had been forecast. Zimbelman said the river is expected to rise to a level five feet higher than any previously recorded. Minot got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world. Actor Josh Duhamel, in Moscow for the ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" premiere, asked for donations to the local Red Cross. ""My heart goes out to all the incredible people of Minot & surrounding areas,"" Duhamel said on his Twitter account. The Souris River, which locals call ""The Mouse"" after the French translation of its name, flows through the center of town, and there are several homes and businesses along its low-lying banks. Fearing the main levees would not hold back the water, emergency workers have been constructing local levees around a school and the Broadway Street Bridge, a main thoroughfare. At least one of those had to be pushed back Thursday, said Zimbelman, eliminating Third street as a north-south access point through the city. Residents appear to be heeding evacuation warnings.  The evacuations zones are ""pretty bare,"" Lenertz said. In a sign they're taking the flooding seriously, some residents were pulling up carpets because they are easier to remove now than after their homes have been inundated with water. Not everyone, however, was planning to evacuate. Troy Erickson, 44, lives across the street from the perimeter of the evacuation zone and said he plans to ride out the flood. His neighbor has a bucket loader and they have distributed several loads of sand and gravel around four houses, which are home to 13 people, he said. They have ""lowered a couple hundred sandbags"" on top of the mixture, he said. ""We've got more sandbags coming to have just in case we need to build it higher,"" said Erickson, a lifelong North Dakotan. ""It if happens, it happens."" He said he is ""a little bit"" frightened because he's never been in this situation, though he was a toddler during the flood of 1969. At the nearby Minot Air Force Base, about 1,000 members of the military and their families have been displaced by the rising waters in the city, according to Capt. Genieve David, a base spokeswoman.  An emergency shelter has been set up on the base, with 50 people staying their overnight, the mayor said. An additional 221 people stayed at shelters run by the Red Cross. Minot, in the north central part of the state, is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota. The evacuation order covers a third of its population, Fong said. The river at Minot, which stood 1,555.6 feet above sea level early Thursday, is forecast to top the 1881 record of 1,558 feet early Friday and peak at 1562.5 feet early Monday. The Souris River looks like a ""U."" It swoops in and out of North Dakota from Canada.

"(CNN) -- As one of the right-hand men to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef was one of the first Taliban leaders arrested when the United States began military operations in Afghanistan. Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, who was Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan, says U.S. war efforts are ""failing."" As a detainee, he was held both at Afghanistan's Bagram Air Base and at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba -- spending more than three years in Guantanamo before he was released in 2006. Now free, Zaeef -- who claims he is no longer a Taliban member -- alleges the military engaged in abusive treatment both at Bagram and Guantanamo.  He says he is still bitter about his time there. Closing Guantanamo Bay, he told CNN, is only part of the justice those detained there deserve. ""It was a bad stain on American history,"" he said. ""If they are closing Guantanamo for justice, they have to bring the people who are torturing people, who abuse people, to justice."" The military has classified those like Zaeef as ""enemy combatants,"" although the Justice Department in March said it would dispose of that classification. The U.S. military in Afghanistan said it was not authorized to comment on Zaeef's or any other individual case. ""I didn't see a worse situation in my life than Bagram,"" recalled Zaeef. ""They were beating me, they put me in the snow, in the cold, until I was unconscious.""  Watch Zaeef describe ""no rules"" at Gitmo » . More than 600 prisoners have been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a controversial facility where prisoners are held for years without criminal charges and, critics allege, without access to legal representatives. The Red Cross has said conditions there are ""harsh."" Currently, 240 detainees remain at the facility. President Obama has announced plans to close the military detention center, saying it has made the United States less safe and set back the country's ""moral authority."" His plans, however, have met with opposition as determinations are made on where to send the detainees housed there. In Guantanamo, Zaeef recalled, ""there was no rule, no regulation for [treatment of] the detainees."" Sayed Sharif Yousofy, who works to get prisoners released from Bagram, said he would like to see both facilities closed. ""Some prisoners are released after four years without any conviction of a crime, which is not fair,"" he said. ""These prisoners are not treated according to the convention of human rights, either in Guantanamo or Bagram."" Preliminary intelligence assessments show more than 14 percent of detainees released from Guantanamo either returned or are suspected of returning to terrorism, the Pentagon said earlier this week. Zaeef -- who was Afghanistan's ambassador to Pakistan under the Taliban regime at the time of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States -- said he believes the statistics, as detainees are often angry when released. ""Anyone in the world, to be deprived of any kind of human rights, any kind of justice -- he becomes angry, so he will try to get revenge,"" he said. While detained, he said, detainees sometimes lose everything -- homes, property, money -- and ""they have nothing after that."" While he claims to no longer be a Taliban member, he said he supports the insurgents and believes the United States will never be victorious in Afghanistan. ""There is no choice"" for the Taliban except to fight, he said. ""There is no other way for them."" ""Ideologically, they [the U.S.] are failing"" in Afghanistan, he said. ""I think they are not able to win the war.""","Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef says detainee treatment ""bad stain"" on U.S. history .

A video released Thursday by activists includes a woman wailing as a body is unwrapped at the hospital in Daraa. ""My son, it's my son,"" the voice cries out. ""This scar here, I swear its my son, I stitched this cut on him when he was little."" The boy was identified as Tamer Mohammed al Sharey, 15, who disappeared after an April 29 demonstration. He was from the same village as Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, 13. Hamza's killing has enraged, mobilized and emboldened the country's opposition movement. Tamer was at the same demonstration Hamza attended, according to activists. Tamer's body was one of 14, including those of other children, that arrived at the hospital. In the video, voices curse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. As several men clean Tamer's thin frame, a bullet wound beneath the knee is clearly visible. As the camera moves to his head, a voice says, ""look at the signs of torture."" The teen's face appears dark and discolored. An activist from Daraa told of marks on the boy's body. He said he believes Tamer was tortured, possibly electrocuted. Children led Tamer's funeral procession carrying banners reading, ""Tamer the martyred ... detained alive ... martyred after torture."" CNN cannot independently verify what happened to Hamza or Tamer, or verify the authenticity of videos allegedly showing their remains. On a video posted on YouTube, the narrator points out multiple visible gunshots wounds to Hamza Ali al-Khateeb's torso. His head appears bloated and purple, and the voice says the teen's genitals were mutilated. Family members say Hamza got separated from his father in the chaos during demonstrations around Daraa, when protesters marched on the city to break the Syrian military siege and force the delivery of important supplies, such as medicine and milk for babies. Eyewitnesses at the time said that security forces indiscriminately opened fire on demonstrators. Dozens were killed and wounded, countless others detained, among them children. Several weeks ago, the family received Hamza's body. Razan Zaitouneh, a prominent activist in hiding in Syria who CNN reached via Skype, said she has no doubt that the YouTube video of Hamza is real. And she believes that the regime had a message in releasing the boy's body. ""They want the people to see this, they want the people to get scared,"" Zaitouneh said. ""They want the people to know that there is no red line and anything, no matter how awful it is, could happen to their family members if they continue to participate in this revolution."" Syrian state TV recently ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body's injuries were sustained when Hamza was alive, but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture, violence or retaliation. Syria TV also said al-Assad met with members of Hamza's family. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Activists say second Syrian teenager has been tortured and killed .

"(CNN) -- The tiny principality of Monaco celebrated Friday the beginning of festivities for ruler Prince Albert, who wed his South African fiancee Charlene Wittstock, a former Olympic swimmer. The pair married in a civil ceremony at the palace Friday afternoon, which was followed by a picnic outside the palace and a concert by musician Jean Michel Jarre. A religious ceremony will take place Saturday, with an official dinner and a fireworks display lined up for later in the evening. The guest list for the wedding includes heads of state and the rich and famous, including French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British model Naomi Campbell, fashion designer Giorgio Armani and British business mogul Richard Branson. However, the United Kingdom's royal newlyweds -- Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- missed it as they are on an official tour of Canada. Preparations for the lavish event have been overshadowed this week by a report in the French news magazine L'Express that Wittstock was getting cold feet about the wedding after finding her fiance's private life was ""not as exemplary as she imagined."" The paper's claims were strongly denied by the palace as ""false allegations"", intended only ""to seriously damage the image of the Sovereign, as a result of damaging that of Miss Wittstock, and bear down on this happy event."" Albert's adviser, Christiane Stahl, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that the two were ""completely disappointed"" by the story. The couple announced their engagement last summer, having first met at a swimming event in Monaco in 2000. The 53-year-old prince and ruler of Monaco, the only son of Princess Grace and the late Prince Rainier, has never married before. Like his 33-year-old fiancee, Albert is also an Olympian, having competed in five Olympic Winter Games -- from Calgary in 1988 to Salt Lake City in 2002 -- in bobsledding. She swam in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In 2005, Albert publicly acknowledged he had fathered a son with a flight attendant, and he has also acknowledged a daughter, now in her late teens. He formally became Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005 and has two sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie. Monaco, a sovereign principality, is one of the smallest countries in the world, measuring just under 2 square miles. It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France. It has a population of about 33,000.","NEW: Prince Albert and Charlene Wittstock are wed in a civil ceremony at the palace .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Grammy-winning music producer Phil Spector, 69, has been moved to a California prison to serve his sentence of 19 years to life for killing actress Lana Clarkson, corrections officials said. Phil Spector will serve time at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison. Spector, who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced last month in Clarkson's 2003 shooting death, will be housed at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran. However, ""he is not in any of the therapy or treatment facilities at the prison,"" said Terri Thornton, a California Department of Corrections spokeswoman. Spector is housed in a ""sensitive-needs yard"" at the prison -- the largest prison by area in the state. It functions like a general population yard, Thornton said, ""but it is for inmates with safety concerns, such as celebrities, gang dropouts or those whose crimes make them a target of other prisoners."" Spector's accommodations are standard, with the exception that the cells are slightly larger to accommodate wheelchairs should inmates need them, which he does not, prison spokesman Steven Smith said. There are several therapy and education programs for inmates, but Thornton said she is not sure whether Spector will participate in them. Inmates who do can work toward a modest reduction of their sentences. Spector is not the first celebrity to serve a sentence at the facility south of Fresno; actor Robert Downey Jr. served time there in 1999 for probation violation of a drug charge. The California Substance Abuse and Treatment Facility and State Prison houses 6,919 inmates. Although it is in Corcoran, it is a separate facility from Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson is serving his life sentence.","Music producer was sentenced to 19 years to life in actress' death .

"East Hampton, NY (CNN) -- In three debates by the presidential candidates and one by the vice-presidential hopefuls, no one could bring himself to utter the words ""climate change."" Hurricane Sandy said what all four White House contenders were afraid to say. I've heard that some voters are undecided. Watching the debates, I became undecided over what's worse: Republicans, who not only don't acknowledge reality, but who genuinely seem not to believe reality. Or Democrats, cowed into silence on issues of enormous importance like climate change and its solution: clean renewable energy. Sandy said things no candidate in America could voice without blowing away their own political career. She said: ""Enough! Wake up. Take a reality check. And if you don't get it, it will get you; then you'll get it."" Now, we got it. Sandy is probably the first storm to change an ongoing presidential campaign. Katrina changed the shape of a campaign to come, contributing significantly to George W. Bush's unpopularity and tarnishing his legacy (""Heckuva job, Brownie"") with lingering images of unpreparedness. But unpreparedness requires, one might say, quite a lot of preparation. We build in places prone to flooding. We do that largely because subsidies encourage it. Federal flood insurance is a way the entire country subsidizes building and rebuilding in places destined for repeated hits. We rely on overhead lines to bring electricity, lines vulnerable to falling trees. And when they fall, we put them right back. Underground lines are more expensive. But if you have to keep repairing the overhead lines... News: Marshes and malls -- Migration to U.S. coast heightens impact of storms . We've created coastal bowling-pin communities; we set 'em up and the weather takes 'em down. I live in one. I'm guilty. In my defense, I'll claim entrapment, because I have federal flood insurance. You made me do it. So I just want to take this opportunity to thank you. But I'd like to also tell you, it's OK with me if you withdraw your generosity. In fact it would be better if you did. You help make us lazy. And by us, I mean millions of people living along the coast, whistling in the dark. And you help our politicians look away from the oncoming truth. Sea levels are rising. They've been rising since the last ice age and that rise has been accelerating since the Industrial Revolution. We've had fair and continual and increasing warning. And yet, small coastal communities and cities as large as New York have done essentially nothing to prepare. Over decades, we filled many wetlands that are the natural buffers to floods. Shrinking the area of our wetlands has left adjacent areas more prone to flooding. As the world continues warming, the warming tends to intensify storms. New York has been hit with two hurricanes in two years. That's unusual. And since at least Katrina, scientists have warned that hurricanes take their strength from the heat of the ocean's surface. Opinion: Climate change is real . Hurricane Sandyâ€”and being an independentâ€”has given New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg the political cover to simply repeat what Sandy herself has so loudly said: ""global warming."" Now Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy is joining in, too, telling NPR's ""Science Friday"" host Ira Flatow on November 2 that, ""I've been talking about global warming for years."" But was Sandy just a hurricane, or an angrier child spawned of unusually warm ocean waters? In one sense, it doesn't quite matter. David Roberts cast it colorfully in his Grist column, saying, ""When the public asks, 'Did climate change cause this?' they are asking a confused question. It's like asking, 'Did steroids cause the home run Barry Bonds hit on May 12, 2006?' There's no way to know whether Bonds would have hit the home run without steroids. But who cares? Steroids mean more home runs. That's what matters."" These questions remain: Will the storms that come our way get stronger, more damaging? Will we experience more frequent damage from storms? We'd better prepare ourselves for the answers to be yes. That's because, even if the answer is no, this storm, like last year's, exposed the Northeast's soft underbelly and our recklessly erected vulnerability. The world is warming. Warming intensifies storms. Warming raises sea levels. You tell me what we can expect. News: Experts warn of superstorm era to come . So, was the storm caused by global warming? Soon we'll have a more interesting question: Was the outcome of the presidential election caused by global warming? Did global warming affect the course of human events enough to make a difference in what we say, in what we think, in how we free our politicians to decide what they can do next? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Safina.","Carl Safina: Presidential candidates afraid to talk of impact of climate change .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- At least 64 people were killed after a train carrying them jumped tracks in northern India on Sunday, a local official said. The wreck in Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh state involved 13 cars of the Kalka Mail, Indian railway spokesman Anil Kumar Saxena said. Senior district official Ramchandra confirmed 64 deaths from the derailment. The official, who has only one name, said a Swedish national is among the dead, and another Swedish man is among the injured. Ramchandra said the death toll could increase as workers sift through the wreckage. Television footage showed giant blue carriages toppled on their sides and on top of each other at the scene of the crash. Local people were seen stretchering injured people off in bed sheets. Residents were shown breaking windowpanes of wrecked compartments and lifting trapped passengers down by hand. Authorities said they had rushed emergency crews and medical aid to the site. India's massive rail network, used by hundreds of thousands of passengers daily, has a poor safety record. On Thursday, more than 30 people were killed when a train collided with a bus trying to cross an unguarded railroad, also in Uttar Pradesh. The victims were all bus passengers. Official figures show 100 train accidents occurred in India in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 115 in 2008-09. Meanwhile Sunday, an explosion on tracks in Assam derailed another train, causing minor injuries to more than a dozen people, but no fatalities, according to railway officials. The explosion occurred near Guwahati in Assam, part of India's remote, troubled northeastern region that is home to numerous rebel groups.","NEW: The number of dead rises to 64, a local official says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Before departing the White House early Monday for a farewell tour of Europe, President Bush stole a page from his predecessor and suggested he feels American consumers' pain. Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to address the rising gas prices. ""A lot of Americans are concerned about our economy,"" Bush said. ""I can understand why. Gasoline prices are high, energy prices are high. I do remind them that we have put a stimulus package forward that is expected to help boost the economy. And of course, we'll be monitoring the situation."" Americans are looking for more action, though, than monitoring the situation. But while gas prices keep soaring, the chances of Washington finding a solution keep dropping because Democrats and Republicans are deadlocked over how to fix the problem. Bush talks mostly about increasing supply through more oil drilling in places like Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ""I've proposed to the Congress that they open up ANWR, open up the Continental Shelf, and give this country a chance to help us through this difficult period by finding more supplies of crude oil, which will take the pressure off the price of gasoline,"" Bush said Monday.  Watch how Congress could affect gas prices » . But Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are vehemently opposed to increasing production on environmental grounds, so the president's plan has virtually no chance of passage in the current Congress. In turn, Democrats talk mostly about lowering demand for gasoline through research into alternative fuels -- something the president talks about too -- and more funds for mass transit. ""It's got to involve investing in alternative fuels, so that we can have some alternatives to gas and significant investment in public transit,"" Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, a key supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid, said Sunday. These types of plans will take a long time to implement, so no quick fix there either. And with the federal government now more than $9 trillion in debt, where would Congress find the money to pour into public transit and research into alternative fuels? With the parties deeply divided on solutions, it's not surprising that last week a Senate bill requiring major cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions failed. Only 48 of 100 senators voted for it amid charges by White House press secretary Dana Perino that the bill would have a devastating impact on the economy and thus might not really help cut the price in gasoline. But six absent senators, including Obama and Republican John McCain, said they would have voted yes to end debate and move forward on the bill. That led some in Congress to declare that Congress will have the momentum to take action next year on reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. All that means, however, is that there's optimism the next president might be able to find an energy compromise in 2009. In other words, don't expect any help from Washington any time soon.","Bush has proposed increasing the supply; Dems propose reducing demand .

"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) -- Most businesses would hate to see their customers running out their doors, but in one suburban strip mall near Denver, Colorado, they are chasing the customers away -- with a chainsaw. ""We're 'hauntrepreneurs,' we like to do things that are just a little bit different,"" says KathE Walker, who owns four haunted houses in the Denver area. ""It's really exciting because you know you've done a good job,"" Walker says. ""If they are running out screaming, then the actors have done their jobs, everybody has had a good time because they want to be scared. That's why they come. ""If they're not scared, they won't come back."" KathE Walker -- the capital E isn't a typo, ""it's a '60s thing,"" she says -- laughs a lot for a woman in the business of scaring her customers. Walker, 59, runs her haunts with her husband and two grown sons. They spend the rest of the year making props for other haunted houses around the country and they throw a big science fiction convention each spring. Despite the tough economy, Walker says, business is good. She anticipates a total of 40,000-50,000 visitors, each paying $14.95 to get scared. She employs about 175 people for the Halloween season. Three of her haunts are in unused storefronts in suburban strip malls and a fourth operates out of trailers in a field near a state park. Visitors are also asked to contribute a can of food for a local food bank. Larry Kirchner, president of the Haunted House Association, says business is booming across the country for seasonal frightfests. The association says there are 2,000 for-profit haunts across the country, plus another 1,000 houses run for charity. Around 20 million fright-seekers will pay an average of $15 a visit this Halloween season, according to the group. That's a surprising figure to some in these lean economic times. ""We feel very fortunate,"" Walker says. ""I know that the economy is very scary for a lot of people. The people that we aim the haunted houses at are kids in high school and college, kids that have a lot more disposable income. They're still living with their parents. ""We don't draw a lot of people that are desperate to make their mortgages. ... It's great date-night stuff. Guys love bringing their girlfriends here, they're holding onto them. It's fun."" It's fun for Walker, too. While giving a tour of Slaughterhouse Gulch, which features a series of movie monsters, she giggles as a cluster of date-night teenagers scream and run from Leatherface, the villain from the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films. ""You make some money, obviously that's why you keep doing it,"" she says. ""But for the most part we put a lot of money back into the haunted house so we can keep making them bigger and better. ... It can be kind of expensive. You cross your fingers each year hoping people will come."" Walker says she loves the challenge of scaring people. ""Some people come in and they say 'Oh you can't scare me,' "" she says. ""And they all end up running out of here, just terrified."" So what scares Walker? ""Clowns. I hate clowns. It took me a long time to finally let clowns be in the haunted house."" 'Scaring people is really fun' Walker staffs her haunted houses with teens and 20-somethings who seem to have as much fun as the patrons. In the makeup room, Chris Parish is getting ready for his first day on the job. He'll be playing the guy chained in the bathtub from the movie ""Saw."" ""Today is my first day scheduled, so I actually get to get paid for scaring people,"" he says. ""Scaring people is really fun and it's something that I love to do."" Halloween is makeup artist Michael Garvin's favorite time of year. He was laid off in July and hasn't been able to find another job, but during October he works days at a costume shop and nights making up the 35-40 actors who fill two of Walker's haunts. ""When I was really young I fell in love with Halloween and then horror movies,"" he said. ""I love this. I'd do this just for the fun of it, but the paycheck at the end of the month is a good thing."" Caity Strother is 18 and has had trouble finding a job. It's her second year working in Slaughterhouse Gulch, where she specializes in portraying an undead ghoul. ""I've filled out probably 50 applications in the last two months and gotten maybe four calls back,"" she said. Years of Catholic school have given Strother a skill that prospective employers have not been impressed by, but she puts it to good use in the haunted house. ""I get to yell at people in Latin,"" she says.","Denver-area ""hauntrepreneur"" runs four haunted houses with husband, two adult sons .

"(CNN) -- Stuxnet is viewed as potentially the most dangerous piece of computer malware discovered. It's been developed on an unprecedented scale and has the ability to target and control specified industrial machinery. Trying to explain how this works is a bit like trying to trace the origin of this nasty little piece of work. It's a bit all over the place so bear with me on this one. It's an attack that goes straight after the PLC (programmable logic control) software of an industrial machine, which is effectively the brain of the unit. It uses four zero-day exploits in one package, with a zero-day exploit being an undiscovered flaw in a piece of software; it's the time between the hackers finding a hole in the system and when the developers patch it. And in this case there are four of these exploits, meaning that they've already exponentially increased the chances of finding a way into the system in case any of the holes happened to already be plugged. Once the malware infects the system it can spread to other computers on the local intranet. It is not an internet-based piece of malware; it can spread through indirect internet usage, but that's not how it sets about its business. Its main course of action is to look for a specific type of machinery, then report back to a central control server located hundreds of miles away, from where the commands will again be relayed off into the maze of servers set up to make tracing near impossible. And it is through the trail of servers around the world that the data generated by the PLC software is manipulated and the changes in the running of the machines are made. So theoretically, a group of people located on one side of the planet could control a machine in a nuclear power plant on the other. Scary stuff. When I spoke to Liam O'Murchu, manager of security response operations for Symantec North America, he didn't want to speculate about what kind of physical results we could expect from the malware in an industrial setting. He commented that Symantec's people are more concerned with the technical side of the bug and concentrate on their analysis on it. This doesn't mean that others won't speculate, and one website that's caught a lot of attention is that of a German IACS security researcher, Ralph Langner, where he says the target may be Iran's Bushehr nuclear facility, which is in a region where a large number of the infected computers are found. He suggests the facility could be infected through the USB drive of a Russian contractor using an ""abandoned"" drive. O'Murchu agreed that it is not unheard of for abandoned drives to carry harmful code on them, but he wouldn't go as far as to agree that such was the case in this instance. He did say, however, that the majority of the infections have occurred in Iran. Symantec has estimated that 60 percent of the infected computers are located in Iran. That claim is refuted in an extract from the Iranian Student News Agency that states, ""Deputy minister of industries and mines denies the 60 percent contamination of Iran's computers by the spy worm Stuxnet."" Despite that denial, O'Murchu stands by Symantec's numbers and explained that the figures came straight from the logged traffic on one of the Stuxnet control servers that Symantec took control of. Symantec said it managed to find that the two control servers are located in Malaysia and Denmark, but when asked who the hosting company is, the company did not comment. The big question remains as to who made this malware, O'Murchu suggested that it would have to be ""a well-funded private group or a government. It would need to be someone who has an interest in what they're targeting."" O'Murchu went on to say, ""We've not seen something on this scale before"" and offered a conservative estimate that it would take five to 10 people about six months to put together this piece of malware. It is the level of preparation that really impressed O'Murchu. He hypothesized that the team would needed inside men, test runs, and even their own piece of machinery to develop the code on. The level of coding is like nothing he's seen before, with everything incredibly well-written and in different languages. The only mistake O'Murchu could identify is that we're talking about it now. When Symantec's researchers tested the malware on a USB key, they discovered that it deleted itself after three infections. ""These are the kind of guys that are not happy with their exposure,"" he said. He went on to say that this is the kind of operation in which the developers would have hoped to get the infection planted, let the malware do its work and never hear from it again. O'Murchu says that there is a ""very slim chance of finding them. They're untraceable and covered their steps."" More than that, he doubts that this group of people was put in place for just one project. Now that this group has shown what is possible, he expects others to imitate it, resulting in a growth in this area of malware. Fortunately, this code won't have a major effect on home computers and if some do become infected, it is likely that Symantec will get in touch with the owners. But O'Murchu warned that a multi-layered approach to defense is the best bet to stay clear from the nasty things out there. But now more than ever, you need to be careful about what USB drives you put in your computer, especially if you work with industrial machinery.","Stuxnet, a new piece of computer malware, has unprecedented potential .

"(CNN) -- The former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq who retired over the Abu Ghraib prison scandal is calling for a truth commission to investigate Bush-era policies behind the abuse and controversial interrogations of detainees. Retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez commanded U.S. forces in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib scandal. ""The mechanisms that are responsible for establishing accountability have lost their credibility within the country, and there's a lack of trust in them,"" retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said in an interview on CNN's ""Newsroom"" Tuesday. ""A truth commission, I believe, is the only way for us to regain that."" The Iraq war, he said, was plagued by ""institutional and individual failures"" -- both in the execution of the conflict and the interrogation tactics, and in the policies from Washington that were implemented in the field. Sanchez, in charge of combat operations from 2003 into 2004, has been a harsh critic of the war in Iraq, calling it in 2007 a ""nightmare with no end in sight."" His leadership has been criticized because the mistreatment of prisoners at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison happened during his command. Pictures of detainees caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004 -- photos showing naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution. Critics say such tactics amount to torture. Two officers -- Army Col. Janis Karpinski, then a brigadier general and commander of Abu Ghraib, and Col. Thomas Pappas, the commander of the military intelligence unit assigned to Abu Ghraib -- were punished over the aggressive interrogations. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz as ""bad apples"" -- were disciplined. Karpinski in April told CNN she was ordered by Sanchez not to discuss the photographs or the subsequent investigation with anybody. A federal investigation cleared four other senior officers in 2005, including Sanchez. But the scandal was hard to shake off, and he retired the following year after more than three decades of Army service. ""You know, I can't get away from this,"" Sanchez told CNN Tuesday. ""The fact is that I am associated, and will always be associated, with Abu Ghraib. ... It doesn't bother me. I think it's something I've learned to live with. But I also live with the fact, as I've stated before, that I've never compromised my integrity or my honor in the course of this ordeal."" Recently released Bush administration Justice Department memos condone the use of such tactics as keeping a detainee naked and in some cases in a diaper, and putting detainees on a liquid diet. One memo said aggressive techniques such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and slapping did not violate laws against torture absent the intent to cause severe pain. A Senate Armed Forces Committee report released in April, when the memos surfaced, found that senior Bush administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists, despite concerns expressed by military psychologists and attorneys. The report points to then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's approval of such techniques -- including stress positions, removal of clothing, use of phobias (such as fear of dogs), and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli -- in December 2002 for detainees at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His OK prompted interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq to adopt the aggressive techniques. ""We had different departments that faltered in developing the guidance for executing those policies,"" Sanchez said. ""And then I think we also had a dereliction of duty at those levels when we were faced with the reality and the facts that abuses were occurring on the ground as early as 2002 and we refused to do anything about it."" He said the lack of oversight and guidance from Washington and top brass left his troops ""abandoned on the battlefield."" Last year he published his memoirs titled, ""Wiser in Battle: A Soldier's Story,"" and he has continued to be a vocal critic of the war. ""Until America can really understand what has happened and look at it objectively and truthfully, we will still continue to be mired in the past,"" Sanchez said. ""We've got to learn the lessons and never go this way again."" CNN's Rick Sanchez contributed to this report.","Retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez retired over the Abu Ghraib prison scandal .

"Moscow (CNN) -- At least 55 people are now known to have died when a ship sank with more than 200 people aboard on Russia's Volga River, state-run media reported Monday, citing the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. Dozens of people are still missing after the ship ""Bulgaria"" went down on Sunday, the ministry said. Divers have been unable to reach parts of the boat where the largest number of people had congregated shortly before the accident, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Many children are reported to have been aboard the pleasure cruise when the ship sank in the Russian republic of Tatarstan. At least 79 people have been rescued, some of whom have been released from hospitals after receiving medical treatment, according to government agencies. The ship did not have a license to transport passengers, it was overloaded, and was last repaired more than 30 years ago, the Russian Prosecutor's Office said Monday. Prosecutors also established that the left engine of the ship was damaged, they said on their website. Russian state TV reported the vessel had an operational limit of about 150 passengers, citing a top government official on the accident site. State TV also reported, citing law enforcement officials, that there were life vests on board for only 156 people. Russian Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said that according to the latest information, there were 208 people aboard the ship, of whom 25 passengers were not officially registered and didn't have tickets. President Dmitry Medvedev is declaring Tuesday a day of national mourning for the victims, he said in an emergency government meeting Monday. The president appointed Transport Minister Igor Levitin to head a special government commission to investigate the case. ""It is clear that such an accident couldn't have taken place if safety rules were followed, even despite the difficult weather situation,"" Medvedev said. ""We have to establish why the owner of the ship operated a ship that was in such a poor technical condition."" He also called for ""a total inspection of all public carriers in Russia,"" he said, adding that it is ""obvious that this ship was not the only one with issues. ""The number of old tubs that are now in use (in Russia) is just staggering,"" he said. ""We can see from the information we have that the vessel was not in the appropriate condition,"" Medvedev said of the Bulgaria. He instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to investigate everyone involved in the Bulgaria cruise, including ""ship-owners, those who issued the navigation permit and those who were involved in organizing that boat tour, especially given the large number of children aboard."" Officials are making arrangements to lift the ship from the river bed, he said, saying that planning for the project will be completed later on Monday. More than 80 scuba divers are now working on the site of the accident, with more arriving by the end of the day, the ministry said. The search-and rescue operation is expected to be completed by Monday evening, the Emergency Situations Ministry regional office said on its website. It is not clear how many people are still missing. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that some passengers could have survived by swimming to the bank or one of the islands in the Volga. Survivors told Russian state TV that there were many children on board the ship. The ferry was built in 1955 in the then-Czechoslovakia, according to Russian law enforcement officials. RIA Novosti said the double-deck cruise ship went down near the village of Syukeyevo in Tatarstan, about 50 miles south of the city of Kazan. Kazan is about 450 miles east of Moscow. Svetlana Alekseeva, a crew member of the ship Arabella, which picked up many of the survivors, spoke to the Russian news agency Interfax after the accident. ""It all happened so fast. The crew did not have time to pull out the lifeboats and were able to lower only two inflatable rafts. Many passengers simply jumped into the water. Few escaped from the chaos in the water, I'm afraid,"" said Alekseeva, Interfax reported. CNN's Arkady Irshenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Divers have not yet reached area of the boat where people had gathered .

"(EW.com) -- While broadcast shows at 10 p.m. on Tuesday are struggling to stay above a 2.0 in the adults 18-49 demo this fall, the biker drama ""Sons of Anarchy"" cleared that hurdle with ease once again. All told, 4.6 million viewers tuned in and the show pulled a 2.4 in the demo, up 14 percent from last week and ranking as the fifth season's best rating since last month's premiere.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to saving money on travel, we all know to check discount sites, follow our favorite airlines on social media and monitor our frequent flier points. But did you know that you can save big bucks just by opening your mouth? It turns out that some honest-to-goodness human-to-human interaction can help you win discounts on hotel, cruise and flight bookings. We asked four travel experts -- Matt Kepnes of NomadicMatt.com; George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com; Jaime Freedman of Travelzoo.com; and Clem Bason, president of Hotwire.com -- for simple questions every traveler should be asking to save money. Their answers, er, questions, are below. 7 gross wonders across America . Is there an upgrade available? Though it may not be in our nature as Americans to haggle or barter for a deal, never feel too shy to request upgrades at airports and hotels. ""Just ask all the time,"" says Clem Bason, president of Hotwire.com. ""Ninety-eight percent of people simply don't ask. The worst answer you'll get back is no."" Jaime Freedman of Travelzoo.com says, ""I've seen instances where at the very last second they had business class available, so they offered it as an up-sell incredibly inexpensively."" Budget Travel: Top 10 most-visited cities in the world . George Hobica, founder of AirfareWatchdog.com, notes that airlines would rather up-sell you a seat in business or first class at a fraction of the cost than be forced to give away those expensive seats for free to members of loyalty programs. US Airways, for example, runs a last-minute program called GoUpgrades; beginning 24 hours before your flight, unsold first-class seats can be purchased for Â¬between $50 and $500 depending on the length of the flight. When it comes to hotels, the same policy applies: Ask and you (may) receive. ""Always say what you're celebrating,"" says Freedman. ""Drop that it's your honeymoon, your birthday. You just never know what kind of little special things a hotel has in store."" If you have kids, she says, ask about a suite upgrade. And if you're a member of a hotel chain's loyalty program, Bason recommends asking for waived fees, free parking, kids' meals, breakfast or Wi-Fi. Travel snapshots: Autumn color around the world . Has the price changed for my seat/room? ""Most people don't realize that there's a pretty good chance that a hotel booking is going to go down in price between the time you book it and the time you arrive,"" says AirfareWatchdog's George Hobica. Hotel rooms and airline seats fluctuate in price, so once you've booked, it (literally) pays to check the price for a ticket or room every day until your vacation. If you see that the price has gone down, call the airline or hotel directly to see what they can do for you. In many cases, you may be able to cancel your reservation and rebook at a lower price. According to a 2011 post by Hobica on AirfareWatchdog.com, airlines like JetBlue, Southwest and Alaska Airlines may offer you a travel voucher for the difference in price. Others, depending on policy, might simply allow you to cancel your flight and rebook at the lower rate. But buyer beware: Change fees can apply to rebooked flights, so be sure your discount is worth it. Budget Travel: 10 places you'd rather be on a Wednesday . Are you running any local deals? Being savvy with social media can obviously pay off when traveling. Restaurants, spas and museums may use local deal sites -- like Groupon or LivingSocial -- to offer discounts on admission or services. It's always a good bet to sign up in advance for such websites to begin tracking where deals are occurring in your vacation destination. ""Go where the deal is,"" says Freedman. ""More and more companies are starting [to offer local deals] as the competition increases."" Don't know where to start? Ask your friendly neighborhood concierge, says Bason. This especially applies at resort hotels, he says, where the concierge is likely to have or know about promotions and specials that might not be otherwise advertised. The added benefit is that you get to experience your destination like a local. ""When [deals] are sourced locally, it means you're going to places that aren't designed for tourists,"" says Freedman, and are consequently less expensive. Hey, why should locals have all the fun? Budget Travel: 30 irresistible photos of fall . What's the resident rate? What you don't know about booking a cruise can cost you. One hidden savings gem: the resident rate. You may be able to cruise for less if you're willing to depart from a port in your own state. And with ports of departure now in over a dozen states, you have a better chance than ever before of being able to leave from your home state. If you live reasonably near a cruise port, ask your agent about the rate for in-state residents, which Freedman says cruises offer at a deep discount to increase sales. ""It's wonderful when you can cruise from home. Basically you're going on a Caribbean vacation with no airfare."" Freedman notes that while discounts for residents can vary, in-staters may be able to save up to 25 percent on a cruise. In addition, when it comes to cruises, negotiate with your travel agent when you cruise, says Hobica. Agents are offered incentives from the cruise line and can pass that along to you. Don't be afraid to ask for perks like shipboard credits, which will help you save you on amenities. Is there a tourism card available? Matt Kepnes of NomadicMatt.com suggests always asking at the tourism office about a city pass. Popular destinations like Paris, London and New York offer passes that include admission to high-profile attractions. Some even include free public transportation or allow you to skip notoriously long lines at tourist hotspots. New York City offers several varieties of passes that allow you to tailor your experience. The CityPass ($89 for adults, $64 for children) gets you admission to six main attractions including the Empire State Building Observatory, the American Museum of Natural History, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island. You save 46 percent on combined admission -- that's $76 per adult! Where are you going tonight? Ok, that question may sound a little creepy. But don't let that stop you from asking tourism board or visitor center staffers for their own personal recommendations -- not where they send tourists, but where they go themselves. They'll know where to find the best off-the-beaten-path venues and cultural events, says Freedman, as well as which ones are running deals. When it comes to sustenance, chances are they won't point you in the direction of expensive tourist traps. As Kepnes says, ""You're not going to find New Yorkers eating in Times Square."" Eating at local restaurants or buying at markets the locals use will save you a huge mark-up and give you a more authentic taste of the area. What strategies do you use to trim costs on vacation?

"(CNN) -- The maid who accused former International Monetary Fund Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her in a New York City hotel room has ended her months-long silence and gone public. Nafissatou Diallo, whose credibility has been questioned by Strauss-Kahn's lawyers and prosecutors, spoke to Newsweek magazine for an article posted on its website Sunday. She also conducted an interview with Robin Roberts of ABC News, which is set to air Monday on ""Good Morning America."" CNN previously has not identified Diallo, given the network's policy against naming sexual assault victims. But it is now naming her, in light of her decision to make her case to the media. On May 14, Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn -- who besides being a global economic leader had been mentioned as a leading contender for the French presidency -- of assaulting her at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel, where she was an employee. He was charged in New York with sexual abuse and attempted rape, pleading not guilty on all counts. In an interview conducted at her lawyer's office in New York City, Diallo told Newsweek that Strauss-Kahn was naked when he slammed the door shut to his luxury hotel room, forced himself upon her and tried to make her perform oral sex on him. ""Because of him they call me a prostitute,"" Diallo said, referring to published reports she had sex for money. ""I want him to go to jail. I want him to know there are some places you cannot use your power, you cannot use your money."" The 32-year-old native of Guinea told the magazine she was ""nervous"" and ""scared"" when she eventually ran from the room, ending an incident that took about 15 minutes. Yet the fallout has been far more extensive, and continues. Strauss-Kahn was initially arrested at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport while on board a Paris-bound plane. His arrest created an international furor, prompting his resignation as IMF chief as New York Judge Michael Obus ordered him held under a $6 million bail. After posting bond, Strauss-Kahn had been confined to a luxury townhouse. But on July 1, the judge freed him from house arrest after prosecutors presented evidence showing that Diallo admitted she had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and, from her past, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms. But while the case took a dramatic turn, the charges against the 62-year-old have not been dismissed. And there have been more twists in recent weeks, including writer Tristane Banon's filing of a complaint accusing Strauss-Kahn of attempted rape in France, stemming from an alleged 2003 incident in Paris. A lawyer for Strauss-Kahn in France said he subsequently filed a counter-claim against Banon for false declarations. Still, most of the intrigue remains centered in the United States, where lawyers for the suspect and the defendant continue to go back and forth challenging each other's tactics. Diallo's interviews further stoked those fires, prompting strongly worded responses from both sides. On Sunday, Strauss-Kahn's U.S.-based attorneys William Taylor and Benjamin Brafman issued a statement chastising Diallo for talking with the media, claiming she is ""the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against a person from whom she wants money."" ""The number of rallies, press conferences and media events they have orchestrated is exceeded only by the number of lies and misstatements she has made to law enforcement, friends, medical professionals and reporters,"" the lawyers said, referring to her and her attorney's actions. ""It is time for this unseemly circus to stop."" Kenneth Thompson, Diallo's attorney, shot back accusing Strauss-Kahn's attorneys of conducting ""an unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual attack."" ""Because of those contemptible, baseless and anonymous attacks, Ms. Diallo was forced to come forward in order to put a face to the brutal crime,"" Thompson said in a statement. Strauss-Kahn's next court date is scheduled for August 1. The hearing had been pushed back from mid-July as prosecutors tried to determine whether to drop the charges or move forward in the case, said Erin Duggan, communications director for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. On Sunday, amid the fresh attention related to Diallo's interviews, Duggan refrained from comment on what she called the ""pending criminal case."" ""To protect the integrity of the criminal justice system, the rights of the victim, and the rights of the accused, we will not discuss the facts or evidence in what remains an ongoing investigation,"" she said in a statement. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: The DA declines to comment; the next NY court date is August 1 .

"New York (CNN)  -- When Republican presidential candidate and tea party favorite Michele Bachmann was recently asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace if she was ""a flake,"" the moment seemed like déjà vu all over again for some women active in politics. Bachmann's response -- she was ""insulted"" -- was stern, but it pointed to a larger bias many women perceive in presidential politics. ""Nobody in the GOP establishment is going to hand anything to Bachmann or (Sarah) Palin -- just like (Democrats) did not for Hillary (Clinton),"" said Amy Siskind, who supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid. ""And it takes a certain type of leader to go out there and have the courage and the guts to say 'I'm running (for president)' and I admire Bachmann for that."" After Clinton's failed Oval Office bid, Siskind and a small group of women who had supported Clinton decided the best way to break the glass ceiling in presidential politics was to put ideology and partisanship aside and support any woman seeking a top political office -- including Bachmann and Palin, two darlings of the tea party movement known for their conservative views on economic and social issues. But some Democratic leaders dismissed the idea, arguing the electorate is more sophisticated. ""Women don't support women candidates simply because of their status as women, simply because of their gender,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee. Siskind, who has voted Democrat in the past, helped found The New Agenda, a nonpartisan women's advocacy group that united many women who were disappointed after Clinton's defeat. ""We decided that in order to take women forward,"" said Siskind, ""we would have to be a voice for all women -- so put political party and the issue of abortion aside because those were the two issues that were dividing women in half."" ""So, for us it was a business model: How can you have a women's movement that excludes half the women?"" added Siskind. In the 2008 general election, women voted overwhelmingly for Democrat Barack Obama for president, picking him 56% to 43% over Republican John McCain, according to CNN exit polls. Going hard after Democrats . Before the new group even got formally off the ground in mid-2008, its nucleus of Hillary Clinton supporters was courted by John McCain's campaign, according to Siskind. ""McCain sent (former California Republican senatorial candidate) Carly Fiorina  to my home,"" said Siskind, who used to trade distressed debt on Wall Street, ""to meet with a lot of the women that then became The New Agenda to say: What would you want to get McCain's support?"" ""One of the things we asked for was to have a woman on the ticket,"" said Siskind, ""and Sarah Palin actually was on our short list (of six women). We did research and learned about her."" When then-Alaska Gov. Palin burst onto the national political stage soon after Clinton formally ended her presidential aspirations, Siskind and Lara Brown, another 2008 Clinton supporter, saw how Palin was falling victim to sexist treatment just as Clinton had. Brown is an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University whose research has focused on candidates for the presidency. She described Palin in 2008 as ""a completely different candidate (from Clinton)"" who got ""a completely different sexist barrage of commentary."" What was behind the treatment of both Clinton and Palin that at least some political observers viewed as sexist or misogynistic? ""The system that's the problem here, the system that's the barrier is, broadly, patriarchy,"" said Caroline Heldman, an associate professor at Occidental College. ""But, more specifically, when women run for public office, the press is more likely to talk about their dress and appearance, more likely to challenge their competency, more likely to talk about them in kind of 'first woman' terms or like they're oddities or benchwarmers instead of actual candidates."" Heldman noticed that both Clinton and Palin tried to project a public image during the 2008 race that was simultaneously masculine enough to justify being selected as the next president or vice president and feminine enough to satisfy traditional gender roles. ""(Clinton) wore pants suits with pearls. ... She was properly masculine and properly feminine,"" said Heldman. ""(Clinton) did this performance and it didn't quite work. And then Palin is doing this performance where she is taking the line between masculine and feminine and she takes a wide stance. She's hyper-masculine . . . and then she's also hyper-feminine. ... She was still beaten up. (Palin) provided kind of a different brand or approach than Hillary Clinton and it didn't matter."" Bachmann facing same stigma? Years after Clinton and Palin sought the White House, Bachmann is already starting to encounter some of the same challenges as a female candidate. ""It's already started with Bachmann,"" Heldman said, referencing treatment by the media that she considers sexist. ""The Chris Wallace question was insulting,"" said Bachmann campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart. ""Congresswoman Bachmann is a serious candidate. She's an extremely intelligent person. She's successful in her personal life. ... Professionally, she has been a successful tax attorney, been a successful member in state politics, and a successful member of Congress. She's a serious, very credible candidate for the president of the United States. (Wallace) apologized,  she accepted the apology and we've put that behind us."" But Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, was less diplomatic. ""I certainly couldn't have seen Chris Wallace asking Mitt Romney or Rick Perry or Tim Pawlenty or one of them, 'Are you a flake?' "" said Kremer. After a breakout performance at the recent CNN Republican debate in New Hampshire, Bachmann has been steadily rising in the polls, particularly with conservative likely GOP caucusgoers in all-important Iowa. The woman who had been brushed aside for a leadership role in the House Republican Caucus after the 2010 midterms now leads in three recent polls, ahead of all the men and in particular, Mitt Romney, who has been called the front-runner by many. Making too much of nothing . Have the candidacies of Clinton, Palin and now Bachmann ignited a spark among women across the political spectrum that national Democrats and the Obama re-election campaign should be worried about? No, said the Democratic National Committee. ""There was a lot made of Sarah Palin being chosen by John McCain and of there being a woman on (the Republican) ticket for the first time in the last election and how attractive that might be especially to Hillary Clinton supporters after the primary ended,"" said DNC chair Wasserman-Schultz. ""I thought that was not credible at the time and said so and it turned out not to be credible."" Wasserman-Schultz said women vote on the issues that matter to them and select the candidate who champions those issues. She pointed out that President Obama has signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, fought for passage of health care legislation that benefits women, has a number of women in his administration and has appointed two women to the U.S. Supreme Court. By contrast, the DNC head said that none of the contenders in the current GOP presidential field has Obama's track record when it comes to supporting women and working families and championing equal rights for women, both reproductive rights and rights in the workplace. Should Palin choose to run for president in this cycle, Wasserman-Schultz predicted that female voters will reject Palin just as they did in 2008. That same fate, she added, will befall Bachmann should she win the GOP nomination. No matter how Bachmann ultimately fares, her candidacy -- like Palin's before her -- seems to be energizing conservative women in particular. Teri Christoph is a co-founder of Smart Girl Politics Action, a group dedicated to getting more conservative women involved in politics and running for office. Christoph said the rise of conservative women on the national political scene in the past few years ""was just the beginning."" ""I think we'll learn a lot (by) having Michele Bachmann run (for president) about what kind of things conservative women need to be prepared for if they're going to enter the national spotlight,"" said Christoph.","Former Hillary Clinton supporters now impressed by Republican women .

"(CNN) -- Searchers in California say they have found and identified the wreck of a fighter jet that disappeared into the Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles International Airport nearly 54 years ago. Searchers found the wreckage of a T-33A jet on the Santa Monica Bay floor. The jet disappeared in 1955. The searchers were looking for another missing plane when they came upon the wreckage of a Lockheed T-33A jet trainer, said Pat Macha, an aircraft archeologist who has identified about 3,700 crash sites and visited more than 800. ""It's a funky thing,"" Macha said Tuesday. ""You're looking for one aircraft, and you find another."" The T-33 disappeared shortly after taking off on an early-morning training navigation flight October 15, 1955, an Air Force Aircraft Accident Report says. Two crewmen were aboard. The plane had been presumed lost at sea all these years. The discovery started this year near Austin, Texas, where computer expert Gary Fabian found ""what looked like a few little pixels"" on a high-definition U.S. Geological Survey image of the Santa Monica Bay ocean floor. Fabian is the founder of a group of unpaid sleuths who discovered a missing World War I German U-boat off the California coast in 2003. The group, known as UB88.org, has continued to search for other wrecks. Before moving to Texas, Fabian became interested in military aircraft wrecks and found Macha about five years ago in Huntington Beach, California. Macha told him about his search for the wreckage of a P-51D Mustang fighter flown by World War II Women's Air Force Service pilot Gertrude V. ""Tommy"" Tompkins Silver. The plane was presumed lost at sea in 1944. Of the 38 WASP pilots who lost their lives in World War II, Macha said, Silver's is the only wreckage that has not been found. Macha has been searching for the wreckage for 11 years. Silver's 100-year-old sister lives in Florida, Macha said, and he would like to find the wreckage so she can know what happened. From Texas, Fabian sent the map info to Ray Arntz, owner and operator of a southern California dive company and a fellow member of UB88.org. Arntz and some his employees set out to search three wrecks using side-scan sonar. Two turned out to be boats. They weren't sure about the third. ""I just grabbed a tank and went down to look at it,"" Arntz said. He saw a fairly compact debris field with a lot of aluminum, which indicated that it was an airplane. Then he saw landing gear. "" 'It's an airplane,' I said to myself. 'How do we go from here?' "" A manufacturer's number on a feed mechanism for a 50-caliber machine gun started him and the others toward piecing together what they had found. The engine appeared to be a jet, so he knew it wasn't the Mustang, which had a propeller motor. By that point, Arntz said, ""We know it's not what we're looking for."" The manufacturer's number indicated that it was a T-33 Shooting Star. Researching government documents, the searchers found that a T-33 had disappeared in the area. ""It just matched what we had,"" Arntz said. ""The T-33 was it."" That was about a month ago. The searchers kept quiet about their find until family members could be notified. Macha said he spoke with a relative of one of the two crew members a few days ago. The Air Force accident report identifies the pilots as Lt. Richard Martin Theiler and Lt. Paul Dale Smith. Theiler had 1,244 hours of flying experience, and Smith had 430. Another volunteer group called Missing Aircraft Search Team also helped find the wreckage. The searchers had another reason for initially keeping silent about their find. ""We're trying to quietly do this stuff and move on so the sites don't get ravaged,"" Arntz said. The group also found a B-36 Peacemaker bomber near San Diego last year. The plane disappeared in 1952. For the three searchers, finding wrecks is an unpaid passion. ""We do this fairly consistently,"" said Arntz, 61. ""As amateurs, this is our form of recreation."" Said Fabian with a laugh, ""It's an absolutely money-losing proposition."" Fabian, 46, is an ex-sports fisherman who says he has an ""obsession"" with the water and an ""interest in the maritime history of Southern California."" Macha, 64, says he got interested in aircraft wrecks in the 1960s when he found a crash site while working in a Boy Scout camp in the San Bernardino Mountains. There are 2,500 crash sites in California, he said, where all or parts of an airplane still remain. Some of them are chronicled on his Web site, aircraftwrecks.com.","Air Force jet that disappeared in 1955 found in Pacific Ocean near Los Angeles .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal air marshal fired after revealing the government was cutting back air marshal coverage at a time of heightened hijacking concern has lost a major battle in his fight to reclaim his job. A federal panel, upholding a decision by an administrative judge, said this week it has ruled the Transportation Security Administration's decision to fire Robert MacLean was legal and ""did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness."" The Merit System Protection Board said it accepted MacLean's statements he was motivated by a desire to protect the flying public, but said his leak ""could have created a significant security risk."" Further, it said, MacLean cannot claim whistle-blower protections because his disclosure ""was specifically prohibited by law."" MacLean said he will appeal the decision. The case began in July of 2003, when MacLean, an air marshal based in Las Vegas, Nevada, anonymously tipped off an MSNBC reporter that the TSA was temporarily suspending missions that would require marshals to stay in hotels -- basically taking them off coast-to-coast or overseas flights -- just days after air marshals were briefed about a new ""potential plot"" to hijack U.S. airliners. The agency planned the cutback because it was running out of money at the end of the fiscal year. The news caused an immediate uproar on Capitol Hill and the TSA retreated, withdrawing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect. A year later, MacLean appeared on ""NBC Nightly News"" -- in disguise and identified only as ""Air Marshal 'Mike'"" -- to criticize the agency's dress policy, which, he said, made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals. But someone from the TSA recognized MacLean's voice and the agency ordered an investigation into MacLean for an ""unauthorized media appearance."" During that investigation, MacLean admitted he leaked the information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long-distance flights. The agency fired MacLean, saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of ""sensitive security information,"" or SSI. MacLean's case has become celebrated by whistle-blower advocates and government watchdog groups. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, filed a brief on his behalf. Supporters argue MacLean brought to public light a TSA action that violated federal law, which mandates the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks, specifically mentioning ""nonstop, long-distance flights."" They say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy. In court filings, MacLean argued the information he disclosed was not protected. The TSA had sent the information to him as a text message on his cell phone, instead of as an encrypted message on his password-protected pager. And it was not labeled SSI. Indeed, it was three years later -- in August of 2006 -- that the TSA officially issued an order classifying the directive as ""sensitive security information."" MacLean argued his firing in retaliation for union activities, and the agency discriminated against him by imposing a harsher penalty than it imposed against others who had disclosed sensitive information. But the Merit System Protection Board said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled SSI, deployment information was ""within the definition of SSI."" MacLean ""admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about (air marshal) scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk,"" the board said. The board said there is ""no direct evidence"" the agency retaliated or discriminated against MacLean for his union activities. It confirmed the TSA treated other air marshals less harshly for disclosing information, but said the circumstances were different. The board notes that MacLean raised his concerns with his supervisor and with the agency's inspector general's office and was not satisfied with the response he received. But MacLean did not take his complaint to an authorized committee of Congress, nor to the Office of Special Counsel, and thereby was not entitled to whistle-blower protection, the board ruled. MacLean said the board ruling will have a chilling effect on whistle-blowers if it is allowed to stand. ""If front-line, non-intelligence government employees cannot disclose wrongdoing to the public that was never classified and then that information can be stamped years later with an unclassified TSA marking, the First Amendment is now meaningless,"" he said.","Air Marshal Robert MacLean tipped the media off to a cutback in schedules .

"(CNN) -- South Korean prime minister-designate Kim Tae-ho and two other nominees announced their resignations Sunday, amid corruption allegations that surfaced during their confirmation hearings, the state-run Yonhap news agency reported. The resignations are a blow to the cabinet re-organization efforts of President Lee Myung-bak. The cabinet re-shuffle was an attempt to refresh the government for the second half of his term. But Kim bowed to pressure from opposition parties and critics over discrepancies in his testimony during his confirmation hearing, and alleged shady relations with a convicted local businessman, Yonhap reported. Kim was accused of receiving tens of thousands of dollars in 2007 in illegal political funds from the businessman, the news agency said. Following Kim's announcement, the appointees to two other cabinet posts also resigned. The two nominees had been under scrutiny for unethical and alleged illegal activities, according to Yonhap. Kim, a former governor who just turned 48, would have become the country's first prime minister under age 50 in four decades. ""I feel really sorry for causing trouble to all the people with my own problems,"" Kim said in a nationally televised announcement. ""I'm resigning from the post today with the thought that I should no longer be an obstacle to President Lee Myung-bak in his carrying out of state affairs."" A presidential spokeman said the president will support Kim's decision, Yonhap reported. The opposition Democratic Party praised the announcement. Former Prime Minister Chung Un-chan resigned late last month after he failed to win parliamentary approval to stop relocation of government offices out of the capital, Seoul. The failure was a major setback to Lee's government and a sign that his party is losing clout.","Kim Tae-ho announced his resignation as prime minister-designate Sunday .
The decision is a blow to the efforts of President Lee Myung-bak .

"(CNN) -- Hero pilot Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger on Tuesday joined the opposition to heightened airport security procedures that critics have called invasive and intrusive. Sullenberger, who landed a crippled US Airways jet on the Hudson River last year, said the use of full-body pat-downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel ""just isn't an efficient use of our resources."" Federal transport authorities say the machines are both safe and a necessary security precaution, especially following recent airline terrorism attempts. Sullenberger argued that transport authorities should trust pilots and flight attendants because ""we're trusted partners"" who are already ""thoroughly screened."" ""We're among the most scrutinized professional groups in the country, even more than doctors,"" Sullenberger said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It's really not an efficient use of our resources to put us through this,"" he added, suggesting that flight crews should be allowed to bypass much of the pre-boarding security screening that is required of passengers. Transportation Security Administration officials are permitted to use ""professional discretion"" in determining if individuals should be subject to further screening, according to a TSA statement. In a letter to aviation authorities, Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, raised the idea of privatization at transport hubs, which he said could improve efficiency and enable airports to opt out of TSA safety regulations. ""It is both inappropriate and inefficient for the TSA to serve as the administrator, quality assurance regulator, operator and auditor of its own activities,"" Mica, currently the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in the letter. ""My aviation subcommittee staff would be pleased to assist you should you move forward with your decision to opt to have a certified private screening program at your airport,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization aligned with the Christian right, filed suit against Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and TSA Administrator John Pistole on behalf of two pilots who refused both the full body scan and the pat-down. ""TSA is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants,"" said Rutherford Institute President John Whitehead. It is not clear whether private screening is more efficient than TSA procedures or whether such screenings would meet federal safety standards. Earlier on Tuesday, a public interest research group said it is suing the Department of Homeland Security in a freedom of information lawsuit intended to obtain medical records and studies that it says the agency has relied upon for its use of body scanners. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has also asked authorities to suspend the use of advanced imaging technology and called for public hearings into its use, center spokesman Marc Rotenberg told reporters on Tuesday. Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader joined Rotenberg in the group's request for more information, calling the agency secretive and unresponsive. ""[Scanners] present hazards when they malfunction or when they function routinely,"" he said. Nader said radiation emitted by the machines was potentially hazardous to passengers, but acknowledged that most passengers in 2009 had actually favored the new measures. Transport authorities say advanced imaging technology meets national health and safety standards. ""These things ... have been examined six ways to Sunday,"" Napolitano said on Monday. ""The [Food and Drug Administration], Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. Science and Standards Association have all measured the radiation involved in an AIT,"" she said. ""It's almost immeasurable, it is so small."" In a report posted on the FDA website, scientists say full body X-ray scanners pose ""very low health risks."" The FDA evaluates radiation-emitting products as well as foods and medications. But a representative for Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory said the group did not evaluate the advanced imaging machines for passenger safety. ""That was not our role,"" said spokesperson Helen Worth. ""We measured the level of radiation, which was then evaluated by TSA."" CNN could not independently confirm whether scanners pose a risk to passenger health. Transport authorities say that passengers concerned about the technology can decline the full body scan and instead opt for manual hand-searches performed by TSA officials. But some passengers and pilots have expressed objections to TSA's too-close-for-comfort pat-downs. Over the weekend, a 31-year-old man refused a pat-down at a San Diego, California, airport. After arguing with a TSA agent, John Tyner left the airport facing a possible $11,000 fine, according to Michael Aguilar, the TSA's federal security director in San Diego. Anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties, according to a TSA statement, citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule. The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says ""requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post-9/11 world. Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by 'electing not to fly' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found."" Tyner called the incident ridiculous and said he will not fly ""until these machines go away."" The mood among security officials is ""anger over the way the media is playing this story,"" according to a senior Homeland Security official. ""You had a dutiful [transportation security officer], someone who works on the front lines to protect this country from a terrorist attack, someone who did everything by the book and according to his training, and he was accosted and verbally abused by a member of the traveling public,"" the official said. ""The fact that some in the media would hail the traveler as a kind of folk hero is shameful."" The incident sparked a debate over passenger safety and personal privacy that has remained headline news, just ahead of the holiday travel season. Pistole, addressing a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on air cargo safety, veered off topic to plead with the American public to see airport security ""as a partnership."" ""Those security officers there are there to work with you, to ensure that everybody on that flight has been properly screened,"" he said. ""Everybody wants that assurance, so just try to be patient, work with our folks. They are there to protect you and your loved ones, and let's make it a partnership."" Pistole also sent a memo to TSA staff praising the work of officers -- including those who met with Tyner in San Diego. ""Everyone involved with these latest incidents put into practice their training and experience, as you all do every day on the front lines to protect our country from terrorist attack,"" he wrote. ""They did their work with calm professionalism even as they were faced with a confrontational situation."" Watch American Morning weekdays 6am to 9am ET.

"(CNN) -- President Obama is immensely popular overseas and his re-election will be welcomed by many. But how will his second-term agenda differ from the first? And what will it mean for a global economy where growth in emerging markets is hesitant, and a massive sovereign debt crisis continues to brew in Europe? Read more: Five things Obama must do . One thing is certain. In the immediate aftermath of a grueling and divisive campaign, and confronted with a national emergency -- the fall off the ""fiscal cliff"" -- Obama's immediate priorities will be domestic, not international. Drawing on the authority conveyed by electoral victory, he will seek to establish a constructive dialogue with Republicans who continue to control the House of Representatives and who can filibuster his agenda in the Senate, just as before. Above all, he will seek to avoid large tax increases and expenditure cuts worth about 4% of GDP that will be triggered automatically on January 1 next year, should he fail to reach agreement on a long- term plan of fiscal consolidation worth some $3.5 trillion to $4 trillion over 10 years. Read more: World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . If the U.S. falls off this fiscal cliff into recession, the outlook for the world economy, already gloomy, will darken further. The task of keeping the eurozone afloat, amid scared investors and depression-level unemployment in Spain and Greece, will become even harder. The risk of a renewed global banking crisis triggered by sovereign defaults in Europe would escalate sharply. Nor could the U.S. or Europe deploy the policy arsenal they possessed in 2008 to right the ship -- their fiscal and monetary bullets have been spent. Confronted with this dire alternative, Obama will have to compromise by accepting a program of long-term cuts in social programs while Republicans accept phased tax increases -- both departing from their diametrically opposed electoral platforms. As a minimum, this compromise will include a claw back of the payroll tax reduction, and of extended unemployment benefits as well as some expenditure cuts, adding up to 1% to 2% of U.S. GDP in 2013. The likely effect will be that the recovery will remain sluggish, and the world's growth locomotives will again have to be found, if anywhere, in China and other emerging markets. Quest: Which way will economy go? The uncertainty surrounding the U.S. fiscal outlook is likely to persist for several months and if, as is possible, the only feasible compromise turns out to be temporary, new fiscal cliffs may loom in the future, extending the uncertainty over years to come. This outcome is possible because the election outcome has not fundamentally altered the balance of forces. An obvious implication is that the U.S. will remain fiscally bound as far as the eye can see. Europeans will have to rely on their own resource to deal with their dangerous crisis, with the U.S. urging action and support through IMF involvement, but without providing money for rescue programs either directly or indirectly through the IMF. Read more: Second Obama term would confront fiscal crisis before inauguration . Resources for international aid will remain scarce and may be cut along with other programs. With the Europeans and the Japanese also retrenching, international organizations will increasingly look to China and other emerging markets for additional funds and new initiatives, buttressing the influence of the rising powers in their deliberations. Perhaps fortified by weather events such as Hurricane Sandy, Obama's second term may bring renewed efforts to encourage control of carbon emissions through environmental regulation, which could yield some modest results. However, given the profound skepticism about climate change in many quarters, the array of special interests in favor of fossil fuels, and the simple fact that the median American family has seen its living standards decline over many years, the appetite for increased gasoline or other carbon taxes will be low. The new administration can be expected to pursue the development of shale natural gas (a clean alternative to coal) and reduced reliance on imported energy with alacrity. The positive effect on reduced gas prices in Europe and other regions of these new American technologies is already being felt. Read more: Fiscal cliff looms over campaign climax . Increased use of natural gas in lieu of other fuels, and the continued ""dematerialization"" of the American economy, will in any event help mitigate the nation's emissions for a long time to come. One arena where the new term may bring more daring initiatives is trade. This is ground where the administration and the Republicans in Congress may be able to join forces, perhaps as part of a broader bargain that would include tax reforms in support of business, and assistance for workers displaced by trade -- both of which Obama has also advocated. Trade measures will likely include implementation of recently ratified trade agreements, determined pursuit of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and may include a renewed effort to close on a low-ambition and partial Doha deal. Markets may breathe an immediate sigh of relief that the election did not end in a dead heat or require extensive recounts, or pitted Obama against a Republican senate. Stocks in healthcare and in alternative energy may be boosted more durably by his re-election. But until the deadlock over how, and how quickly, to effect fiscal consolidation is broken for good, and U.S. politics finds a way to address the nation's structural challenges -- including exploding healthcare costs and its chronically low savings rate -- there is little reason to expect a trend shift in equity prices. For the time being, the U.S. government continues to borrow at the most advantageous rates, in part for lack of better alternatives. Everyone knows this cannot last -- how long it will is anyone's guess. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Uri Dadush .","Uri Dadush says Obama will seek to avoid tax increases scheduled for January 2013 .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- It has been almost two weeks since Eman al-Obeidy burst into our hotel in Tripoli, desperate for the world to hear her story of rape and torture. We had been trying since then to interview her in person and were finally able to speak to her Wednesday, against the explicit wishes of the Libyan government. ""You should not be allowed to do this,"" government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told me. The interview with al-Obeidy was facilitated by Gadhafi's son Saadi and was subject to a government review. We asked al-Obeidy if she would be willing to come to Saadi Gadhafi's office. She agreed and Gadhafi sent a car to pick her up. She and Gadhafi met privately before our interview, the first time the two had met. Gadhafi appeared shocked afterward. He commented on her strong character and willingness to challenge him when they disagreed. He and his press assistant sat in on the 30-minute CNN meeting. Some of the time, we were alone with her. She came dressed in ornate black robes and with her head covered. She called herself an ordinary citizen, a good Muslim who is conservative in her social outlook. She spoke with clarity and exuded strength through the conversation, adamant about clearing her name she said Libyan state media had smeared. ""Everything they said about me is a lie,"" she said. ""I am well-educated unlike the way the Libyan TV portrayed me. I come from a good family, regardless of what they said, I am also not mentally challenged like they said. Just because I raised my voice and talked to the media they blamed me and questioned my sanity. Nonetheless, I want my rights, even without the media."" She spoke of her abduction, of how she was taken to one of the residences of Moammar Gadhafi's soldiers. They were drunk, she said. They tied her up, beat and raped her. Her bruises had faded, but I could still the see the evidence of her agony around her wrists. She said in the height of her trauma, she took pictures with the camera on her mobile phone, lest people should not believe her later. ""People have blamed me for showing my body,"" she said. ""I was depressed and there was no way to show people how I was tortured. I was brutally tortured to the point of them entering weapons inside me. They would also pour alcohol in my eyes."" She said the men who tortured her are still free, without punishment. Later Saadi Gadhafi told me: ""The people responsible for raping her should face charges. She is a strong woman."" Al-Obeidy, a law school graduate, spoke her mind in Gadhafi's presence and gave no indication that she was intimidated by him, even when she accused the Libyan authorities of lawlessness, brutality and lies. ""I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond,"" she said. That Saturday, when she tried to speak to journalists at the Rixos Hotel, she was dragged off the property. She was beaten and thrown in jail. Her phone was confiscated. At one point, al-Obeidy told her fellow citizens in eastern Libya and the besieged western city of Misrata to be strong. After the interview was over, Gadhafi objected to that line. Al-Obeidy agreed to Gadhafi's request that it be cut from the video, but only with full disclosure that those 10 seconds had been removed. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, reviewed my interview and objected to its tone, to the questions I asked and to the overall content. But Saadi Gadhafi overruled his objections. We were asked not to broadcast the interview until another government representative was able to look at it. At the insistence of the Libyan government, we delayed transmission of the video for 18 hours, waiting for word. But the review never came and in the end we were cleared to air almost all of al-Obeidy's words with the exception of the 10 seconds that she agreed to cut. She was thankful for Saadi Gadhafi's efforts to make the interview happen. ""He was a humble and understanding man, and he treated me well,"" she told me. ""He said that he will take my case and help me."" She had asked for three things -- that she be allowed to clear her name, that her abusers are prosecuted and that she be reunited with her family in the eastern city of Tobruk. Al-Obeidy took the first steps to getting one of her wishes. She is counting on Saadi Gadhafi to help her with the other two.","Saadi Gadhafi sent a car to bring Eman al-Obeidy to his office .

"(CNN) -- The Developing Communities Project is a faith-based, nonprofit organization formed when area churches wanted to help people hurt by the 1970s steel plant closings on the South Side of Chicago. It offers job training and literacy programs. It's working with Loyola University and area municipalities on an infrastructure project designed to address the region's growing population and create jobs. And its first executive director was Barack Obama. Obama: My vision for America . That's right, the man often accused of being a Muslim spent years working for a Christian organization. The man who supposedly only wants to give handouts to people spent years empowering them through education. The man Republicans accuse of only caring about himself spent his entire adult life helping those less fortunate. True, his first term as president has not come without its disappointments. He said he would cut the deficit -- he hasn't. He said his administration would not be politics as usual and then he played politics with immigration reform and gay rights. And Gitmo is still open. But before he was president or senator or even an Illinois state representative, Obama was a young man with a degree from Columbia University who could have done just about anything he wanted, and he chose to go back to his adopted home of Chicago and help poor people. Politics: If Obama wins... A politician's record is not confined to what he or she does in office. That's important, but it's an abbreviated version co-authored by consultants and edited by poll numbers. To really understand a candidate, voters have to look at the original, unabridged manuscript, the record he or she began writing before realizing someone else might read it. I didn't vote for Obama in 2008 because he wasn't George W. Bush. I didn't vote for him out of racial solidarity or because he gives pretty speeches. I voted for Obama in 2008 for the same reason why I voted for him in 2012 -- his record. And his time as a community organizer is part of that of record. Sure, I could rely on numbers to present a strong argument for a second term. About this time four years ago, the country lost 159,000 jobs, the country's ninth consecutive month of job loss. Last week we learned we created 171,000 jobs, the 25th consecutive month of job growth. Regardless of party, I would think that would be seen as a good thing. Our housing prices have rebounded to where they were nine years ago, and the Dow Jones Index recently closed at its highest mark in five years. I could also point to the death of Osama bin Laden or the currency collapse in Iran because of the sanctions that he's led. But to fully understand why I voted for Obama, one only needs to look at this quote from author H. Jackson Brown Jr.: ""Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking."" Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012 . When no one was looking, Obama was a humble community organizer fighting for poor Americans who had lost their jobs. Four years ago, his critics mocked him for that. Today, we see a lot has changed about him ... but not that. He is still fighting for those Americans who are hurting, and it gives me a measure of peace knowing that the person in charge of making tough budget cuts has a record of working with people who are hurting. I'm sure Mitt Romney is a decent man, and he's given millions to his church. But I can't shake the fact the self-proclaimed ""son of Detroit"" did not come around the city when it began to struggle in the 1980s. The great ""job creator"" did nothing for the city when it was hemorrhaging jobs in the 1990s and to this day he only seems to come around Detroit during election time. If this is how the ""son"" treats family, I can only imagine the disregard he holds for strangers. Actually I don't have to imagine. I watched the 47% video. The one that was taped when he thought no one outside of the room would be listening. This is why he's trailing in Michigan and Massachusetts, the two states to which he's most closely tied. It's not because he's Republican. The three Massachusetts governors before Romney were Republican, while four of the past six governors in Michigan were Republicans, including his father. He trails because the people there know him. They know his record. His real record. Not the manicured version he presents on the campaign trail, but the unabridged version he began writing before his life in politics began. The version all future politicians script with the decisions that they make. I'm not wearing blinders. I know Obama is just as flawed as Romney. He's a politician. How can he not be? But at the end of the day I'd rather have President Barack Obama in the White House, someone with a record of being about the work of helping others before he was in office, than Mitt Romney, someone who has a record of talking about it once he got there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: In Chicago, Obama directed faith-based group to help displaced workers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican leaders on Wednesday named fiscal conservatives for their six picks for a new congressional ""super committee"" charged with crafting a plan to reduce the country's mounting deficits. In separate announcements, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell filled the GOP spots on the 12-member bipartisan panel created in last week's debt ceiling deal, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama. Boehner, R-Ohio, chose Reps. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Dave Camp of Michigan and Fred Upton of Michigan, while McConnell, R-Kentucky, picked Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio. All six are known for conservative stances on economic issues. Hensarling is the Republican Conference chairman and will be co-chair of the panel with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, who was appointed Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""The debt crisis is a legitimate threat to our nation's future, and the American people cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Hensarling said in a statement after his appointment. ""Everyone can agree that we must stop spending money we don't have, and the time to act is now."" He added that the committee ""will not be able to solve the crisis in a matter of months, but we can work together to tackle these challenges in order to bring back jobs, hope and opportunity for the American people."" Toomey, despite his credentials of fiscal conservatism, noted Wednesday that he recently voted to eliminate the ethanol tax subsidy and believed there were other subsidies or loopholes that could be ended as part of broad tax reform. Many conservative Republicans oppose any moves that could increase tax revenue. ""The goal should be to broaden the base and lower rates so that we can create an environment that's more conducive to economic growth,"" he said. The committee will follow up on negotiations that started last year with the bipartisan debt commission appointed by Obama, then continued in Congress, including work by the so-called Gang of Six senators -- three Democrats and three Republicans. Both the debt commission and the other group recommended comprehensive packages that included tax reform, changes to politically sensitive entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and spending cuts. Obama will bring ""very specific ideas about"" how ""the committee could come together in a balanced way to significantly reduce the deficit,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Wednesday. Former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who co-chaired Obama's debt commission, told CNN on Wednesday that the new special committee has plenty of information to work with and shouldn't need a lot of time for further collecting or analyzing of issues. Committee members ""don't need to sit around here and gather more information,"" Simpson said, adding that the actual negotiating is ""going to be tough."" Among the choices announced Wednesday, Camp is the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, while Upton chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Upton has taken some moderate positions in the past, including attempts to decrease tax cuts in the George W. Bush administration that remain contentious today. In a statement Wednesday, Upton said that ""much more needs to be done to bring down health care costs, promote economic growth and begin to tame runaway government."" ""No one believes this is going to be easy,"" he added. On the Senate side, Kyl, the No. 2 Republican behind McConnell, is a staunch advocate for the military, which is targeted for deep spending cuts if the special committee fails to come up with an agreement that passes Congress by the end of the year. Portman is a former White House budget director in the Bush administration with a reputation for working with Democrats. His fellow Ohio senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown, said Wednesday that Portman ""has shown a willingness to find common ground by looking at both tax reform and spending cuts in order to reduce the deficit."" Toomey, elected to his first Senate term last year with the support of tea party conservatives, sits on the Senate Budget and Banking Committee. He told reporters Wednesday that he expected the special committee to begin its work soon, and that it would require Republicans working with Democrats to succeed. ""It has to be an exercise in finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats, but it also has to be constructive with respect to reducing our deficit and it has to be pro-growth as well,"" he said. A day earlier, Reid, D-Nevada, appointed Murray, Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts as his three Senate Democrat picks. Reid went with veteran legislators including a former Democratic presidential candidate in Kerry, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman and the more moderate Baucus, who chairs the Finance Committee and has fought Republican efforts to privatize Social Security. Reid named Murray, a war critic and champion of benefits for military veterans, the co-chair of the special committee. In a joint statement after their appointments, the three Democratic senators said that Americans want the committee to operate without ""the red-hot partisanship and brinkmanship of the last months."" ""This is not going to be easy. Our challenge is to find common ground without damaging anyone's principles. We believe we can get there. This committee was designed to require bipartisanship, and we are going to work hard with our Republican colleagues to attain it,"" their statement said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, has yet to announce her three House Democrat choices. She has until Tuesday to complete the committee that will have six Democrats and six Republicans, equally divided between the House and Senate. The committee will try to work out $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, after an initial round of more than $900 billion in spending cuts in the debt ceiling agreement. It is required to complete its work by November 23. Congress then has until December 23 to vote on the proposal, with no amendments permitted. A simple majority on the panel -- seven of 12 members -- is needed to approve whatever package it comes up with, meaning that it will take a lone member of either party to push something through by voting with the other side. The committee's proposal would then need a simple majority in each chamber of Congress to make it to Obama's desk. If the committee fails to reach agreement or Congress fails to pass whatever package it recommends, a trigger mechanism will enact further across-the-board cuts in government spending, including for the military. Carney said Wednesday that Obama continued to call for a balanced approach that includes increased tax revenue, entitlement reforms and spending cuts. ""And we are not alone,"" Carney said. ""The American people overwhelmingly support the balanced approach that the president supports."" According to a new CNN/ORC International Poll released Wednesday, 63% of respondents say the so-called super committee should recommend increased taxes on higher-income Americans and businesses, with 36% disagreeing. By a 57-40% margin, respondents say the committee's deficit reduction proposal should include major cuts in domestic spending. However, further cuts in defense spending get a mixed review, with 47% favoring them and 53% opposed. Nearly two-thirds of respondents oppose major changes to Social Security and Medicare, while nearly nine in 10 don't want any increase in taxes on middle-class and lower-income Americans. Months of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction have failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise revenue while cutting spending. Obama is pushing for a comprehensive plan that includes spending cuts, increased tax revenue and entitlement reforms, while Republicans seek to shrink government by proposing spending cuts and entitlement reforms without increased revenue. An impasse over the tax revenue issue led to the debt ceiling agreement, which imposed the initial round of spending cuts and set up the special committee to work out further deficit reduction. The agreement also enables the federal debt ceiling to be increased through 2012, allowing the government to borrow what it needs to meet its obligations. The brinkmanship of the negotiations, with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached, was one reason why Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ on Friday. One of the main Republican arguments against tax increases for the wealthy is that they would inhibit job creation. The poll results showed that only a third of respondents agree with that stance, while 62% say taxes on the wealthy should be high so the government can use the money for programs to help lower-income Americans. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from Friday through Sunday, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey was conducted both before and after Friday night's announcement of the S&P downgrade. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Late Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus slammed Reid's choice of Murray and asked the Senate leader to withdraw her appointment. ""Harry Reid's appointment of Patty Murray to co-chair the Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is absolute proof that Democrats are not serious about deficit reduction,"" Priebus said in a statement. ""As chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Murray is the Senate Democrats' fundraiser-in-chief. The Select Committee is no place for someone whose top priority is fundraising and politics.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Bethany Tuggle, Rachel Kurowski and 29 other North Carolina college students are going to be late for class. But it's all right with the professors. Bethany Tuggle said she had just two days off during the Games. She gets a rare break as Team USA plays. The University of North Carolina journalism students are in Beijing for a few more days, working as volunteers at the sports venues and the media compounds. Back in Chapel Hill, classes have already begun, so the students at the Olympics will have to play catch-up once they get back. There will be no time to sleep for a few days to get over the jet lag. It's straight back to class. Tuggle, a senior, has been in Beijing since July 6 as part of a group of international students who cover games and practices to get quotes for the Olympic News Service. The ONS translates the interviews into several different languages and sends out ""flash quote"" sheets soon after an event ends. Many of the 30,000 journalists covering the Games (including this one) use them in their reports. It is the first time that an Olympics committee has used ONS reporters from outside the Games' host country. Tuggle has worked at the basketball venue, which seems to be a natural fit for a UNC student. But she said she hasn't done any sports reporting in the past and really doesn't know much about basketball. So it was a steep learning curve, getting into the scrum with the other reporters, shouting questions to hulking figures, some of whom didn't always recognize the language of the question or pretended not to understand. ""I think the best thing I have gained through this experience is confidence,"" she said one day in the lobby of the students' hotel. ""It's really hard for me to approach people. Doing this has given me a lot of confidence to just go in there, be professional and do what I have to do."" Not all the students get to work as reporters. Kurowski, who is in her first year as a graduate student, has been volunteering as a rental space assistant in the main media center at the office of the French news agency Agence France-Presse. She had applied to be a sports reporter, but her language skills -- she is one of a few students fluent in French -- seemed to work against her, and she was assigned to the AFP newsroom. Kurowski has tried to keep a positive spin on the assignment, even though ""what I am actually doing is not the highlight of my trip."" She has used the day-to-day interaction with the AFP staff to meet reporters and talk to them about their jobs to learn more and help her confirm that she wants to work for an international news agency. ""I'm really happy to get to observe everything in the [Main Press Center],"" Kurowski said one day last week at the MPC cafeteria. ""And it's been amazing the access that I have had to the Olympics. The magnitude of everything here is amazing."" She said she signed up for the trip primarily to go to Beijing, which had been on her list of places to visit. The chance to see the Olympics was a close second. Neither she nor Tuggle had been to Asia before, so this trip was as much about seeing and learning about a new culture as it was about learning the nuances of sports reporting. There was a little culture shock, especially when it came to riding the city transportation to work. ""The Chinese don't have the same concept of personal space as Americans,"" Tuggle said. ""They're not trying to be rude; it's just their culture."" Kurowski echoed her classmate's comments about the crowded transportation and streets, and added there were some initial language barriers, particularly in cabs. Beijing officials made a big deal about how many drivers had learned English, but other than a warm greeting (""Welcome to China!"") there can be some difficulty getting where you want to go. Fortunately, there are some markets, restaurants and nightclubs nearby, including a pizza place run by a U.S. expatriate that feels like home. It serves good slices and cheap beer and is a favorite gathering spot for Americans. The Beijing Olympic Committee has organized cultural excursions, too. There were the requisite trips to the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. There was also a night of watching the national acrobatic company. But Kurowski said she also liked venturing out near the hotel to the hutongs -- neighborhoods characterized by narrow streets and alleys -- and witnessing the lives of the locals. However, when the Games started, life became dominated by work. The students, who paid $600 and airfare for the course, will leave China with memories they say have topped any experience they have had yet. What will they remember most, other that the work? The people, they said . ""They are very giving and kind people. They go completely out of their way to help you,"" Tuggle said.","31 UNC journalism students volunteer at Olympic sports venues, media compounds .

"Singapore (CNN) -- Singapore's presidential candidates may all share the same name -- the common Chinese surname of Tan -- but with four candidates now officially in the race, this presidential election is the most contested in Singapore's history. Singapore is a nation that's been ruled by one party since its independence in 1965. But the recent general election showed a growing interest by Singaporeans in politics and some point to a growing willingness of Singaporeans to speak out. According to presidential candidate Tan Jee Say, ""People are more open now in expressing their views against the government. In the past they were a bit apprehensive about being open. But now I think the election showed they are prepared to share their anger"" he said, over the government's economic policies. He said the Internet, and movements in other countries like the ""Arab spring"" has had an effect on Singaporeans too. While all candidates are officially non partisan, Tan Jee Say stands out as the most opposition candidate, having run in the recent general election with the Singapore Democratic Party. Another candidate Tony Tan has the closest links to the ruling party PAP and has been endorsed by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. While Singapore's presidency is a largely ceremonial role, the job has several important functions including the power to veto key government positions and to tap the government's financial reserves. The latter role came into the spotlight in early 2009 when current President SR Nathan gave approval for the government to draw S$4.9 billion ($4.1 billion USD) to combat the global downturn. Singapore's president also commands an eye popping salary -- now more than S$4 million (Singapore dollars) or $3.3 million USD. Singapore's top officials all draw some of the highest government salaries in the world, attributed by the government as a draw for top talent and considered by some a strategy to keep out corruption. The four candidates are Tan Kin Lian, a former executive of insurer NTUC Income, Tan Cheng Bock, a medical doctor, former member of Parliament and former chairman of a marine transport company, Tony Tan, a former deputy prime minister, a former defense minister and deputy chair of the government's sovereign investment fund, and Tan Jee Say, an investment adviser and former senior civil servant. Singapore's Presidential election is scheduled for August 27.","NEW:  Singapore's presidential election is August 27 .

"(CNN) -- Never one to miss a joke, even when it involves a threat on his life, David Letterman came armed with punchlines for Monday night's show, the first since a jihadist website urged its American followers to kill the comedian. ""Tonight, you people are ... more than an audience,"" Letterman said, as he opened his monologue. ""You're more like a human shield."" ""Backstage I was talking to the guy from CBS, we were going through the CBS life insurance policy to see if I was covered for jihad,"" Letterman deadpanned. Sticking with the theme, the comedian unveiled a ""Who hates Dave"" list, which starts with al Qaeda and Sarah Palin, but also includes Canadians, Dave's clergyman, cats, squirrels and walruses. The writer who posted the death threat last week was upset by Letterman jokes about Osama bin Laden and another al Qaeda leader killed in Pakistan, according to SITE intelligence group, which monitors and translates online terror activity. ""This despicable person mocked the leaders of the mujahideen,"" the post says. The death threat urges jihadist followers to cut off Letterman's tongue and ""shut it forever."" CNN could not independently confirm the message. A spokesman for the FBI said last week that the agency is looking into the death threats. ""In the post 9/11 world, we take all of these threats seriously,"" spokesman Peter Donald said. Just to show that he wasn't taking it too seriously, Letterman continued the theme into his nightly Top 10 list -- the ""Top 10 thoughts that went through my mind after hearing about the threat."" 10.

"Washington (CNN) -- Is Will Clark a villain or a hero? Was the off-duty federal agent brave and chivalrous, or did he overreact when he intervened in a heated domestic argument and shot a man five times, killing him? A U.S. Virgin Islands jury this week will hear the case for and against Clark, a nine-year veteran of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, now charged with second degree murder. The prosecution of Special Agent William G. Clark for the 2008 shooting death of Marcus Sukow has enraged many federal law enforcement officers, who say Clark was heroically coming to the defense of a battered woman. Federal authorities were so incensed by the Virgin Island's prosecution of Clark -- and so concerned other federal agents could similarly be prosecuted -- that they removed all ATF agents from the Virgin Islands in 2008, a policy that continues today, the agency said. The U.S. Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States, and as such has a unique legal relationship with the federal government. While the broad outline of the shooting is undisputed, two government investigations came to starkly different conclusions. A federal government multi-agency investigation of the 2008 incident unanimously concluded the shooting was justified. The ATF even returned Clark's gun and badge and put him back to work. But a Virgin Islands Police Department investigation prompted prosecutors to charge Clark with second degree murder. The incident occurred the morning of Sunday, September 7, 2008, outside a St. Thomas condo, where all of the main participants were neighbors. According to a police affidavit, Clark was leaving his condo when he encountered Sukow and his girlfriend, Marguerite Duncan. They had been drinking and were having a ""disagreement."" Duncan asked Clark for a ride to the guard gate and got in Clark's sports utility vehicle. Sukow approached Clark, who was sitting in the car with the driver's door open. One witness said he saw Sukow striking the driver's door with his flashlight, and saw Clark draw his weapon and tell Sukow to step back. ""Mr. Sukow stood there with his hands at his side when William Clarke [sic] discharged his firearm at him several times,"" the affidavit reads. Local prosecutors evidently were heavily influenced by two facts: First, the deceased, Marcus Sukow, was armed only with a flashlight; second, Clark shot him five times. ""These facts are undisputed and were the findings of the local police investigation,"" Gov. John de Jongh Jr. wrote in a letter justifying the prosecution. But a defense lawyer says the local police department's affidavit is inaccurate and its investigation grossly incomplete. Attorney Mark Schamel said Sukow weighed 260 pounds, had a history of violent assaults, and was acting violently at the time of the incident. When Clark first encountered the fighting couple, Sukow was naked, intoxicated and shouting threats at his girlfriend and racial slurs at a neighbor who had come out during the commotion. At one point, Sukow went into his condo and returned wearing gym shorts, and then pelted his girlfriend's car with landscaping stones. After Duncan sought refuge in Clark's car, Sukow charged at Clark's open driver door, the flashlight -- a heavy-duty, 18-inch metal one -- raised ""like a tomahawk,"" poised to strike Clark, Schamel said. Clark fired rapidly, as he was trained, Schamel said. Tests later showed that Sukow had a blood-alcohol content of 0.29 percent, and had barbiturates and morphine in his blood, the defense lawyer said. Schamel said the former head trainer for the Virgin Islands Police Department academy will testify as an expert witness that the shooting was justified. Schamel said he also has subpoenaed the Virgin Islands' governor and first lady to testify, because Duncan called them shortly after the shooting. He declined to say what he expected them to say. On Monday, ATF Deputy Director Kenneth Melson reiterated the agency's support for Clark. ""Special Agent Clark intervened in a domestic dispute in order to protect a woman that was endangered by her boyfriend. His actions were necessary to save a woman's life and his own life,"" Melson said. ""The ATF family supports Special Agent Clark and seeks an immediate, non-criminal resolution in this matter."" Clark's attorney fought to have the case transferred to federal court, saying Clark was acting as a federal agent and deserved federal protections. But a district court judge ruled against the motion, and a federal court has declined to halt the trial. ""William Clark is a federal ATF agent who does not have peace officer status under Virgin Islands law and therefore had no authority to enforce law including the domestic violence statutes,"" said Sara Lezama, a spokeswoman for the Virgin Islands Department of Justice. As a private citizen, Clark was authorized to carry a gun and use reasonable force to defend himself and others, Lezama said. But Sukow ""did not inflict bodily harm on anyone the morning he was shot,"" she said. ""That's the government's general position in this case. We believe that he used excessive force instead of reasonable force in this matter,"" Lezama said. Clark's advocates say the case has far-reaching ramifications. ""It is well recognized that federal law enforcement officers are immune from state criminal liability for actions that are taken within the scope of their employment as federal officers,"" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, wrote in a letter to Gov. de Jongh. ""That principle... applies with equal force in United States territories."" The Clark prosecution ""has the potential to create a chilling effect on the operation of federal law enforcement throughout the United States' territories,"" Schumer wrote. ""The American law enforcement community is outraged that the USVI prosecutor seems more intent on punishing American cops than woman beaters,"" Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said in a written statement. Adler and others are calling for an investigation into the prosecution, saying it is in retaliation for federal corruption investigation in the Virgin Islands. The spokeswoman for the Virgin Islands Department of Justice said a jury will determine the appropriateness of the shooting. That jury was being selected Monday, and the trial is expected to last seven days, she said.","NEW: ATF deputy director says the agency stands by Clark .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Three members of the family of a Mexican marine who died in a shootout last week were killed Tuesday in the southern state of Tabasco, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said. Marine 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedec Angulo Cordova was fatally shot during a gunbattle that resulted in the killing of Arturo Beltran Leyva, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords. The killing of his family members has raised speculation in Mexico that it was an act of retaliation by the Beltran Leyva's drug cartel, CNN en Español reported. Very early Tuesday, gunmen entered the family's home and opened fire, killing Angulo Cordova's mother, sister and a third relative, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Angulo Cordova's brother was injured in the shooting, the agency said. Angulo Cordova was the only military fatality in last week's operation against Beltran Leyva in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Six other drug cartel members also died in the confrontation. Beltran Leyva's death was a huge blow to one of Mexico's most violent groups, authorities said. The killings were ""a cowardly and contempible act,"" Calderon said in a speech Tuesday. ""These reprehensible acts demonstrate the unscrupulous way with which organized crime operates."" The cartel is based out of the Pacific state of Sinaloa. In another incident Tuesday, local media in Sinaloa reported that the state's director of tourism was gunned down, together with a bodyguard.","Three relatives of Mexican marine killed, President Felipe Calderon says .

"(CNN) -- Bolivia President Evo Morales declared a U.S. diplomat ""undesirable"" Monday amid allegations that the United States asked a visiting scholar and Peace Corps volunteers to keep tabs on Cubans and Venezuelans in Bolivia. Morales said a security assistant for the U.S. Embassy -- identified by the Bolivian Information Agency as Vincent Cooper -- violated the rights of Bolivian citizens and offended the country, the news agency reported Monday. U.S. officials admitted that someone at the embassy made an inappropriate suggestion, the information agency reported, but the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Philip S. Goldberg, denied Monday that the embassy asked anyone to spy. ""I respect the sovereignty and dignity of Bolivia, and I am ready to talk with Bolivian government representatives to clarify everything and present all the facts,"" the Bolivian Information Agency quoted the ambassador as saying. The scholar, John Alexander van Schaick, told ABC News that the request stunned him. ""My immediate thought was 'Oh my God. Somebody from the U.S. Embassy just asked me to basically spy,"" he said. ""I was in shock that something like that would happen to me -- just a humble Fulbright scholar who's here to do research."" In Washington, Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told reporters Monday that U.S. embassies are under instructions not to ask Fulbright scholars or Peace Corps volunteers to act ""in any way, shape or form"" on behalf of the U.S. government as intelligence agents. The controversy erupted after van Schaick said Cooper asked him in a November meeting at the U.S. Embassy in La Paz to report the names and addresses of Cuban and Venezuelans working in Bolivia, according to the Bolivian Information Agency. ""I smiled and just sat there because I did not want to show that it completely dismayed me to be asked such a thing,"" van Schaick said, according to the news agency. The U.S. Embassy in Bolivia said in a statement Monday that Peace Corps volunteers had been mistakenly given a security briefing in July meant for embassy staff asking them to report ""suspicious activities,"" The Associated Press reported, though Goldman said ""nobody at the embassy has ever asked American citizens to participate in intelligence activities here."" It was unclear Monday whether the Bolivian government would seek the expulsion of any U.S. Embassy employees in light of the president's declaration of Cooper as an ""undesirable"" person.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani intelligence service has arrested a senior al Qaeda leader who sought to attack targets in the United States, Europe and Australia, the Pakistani military said Monday. The intelligence service arrested Younis al-Mauretani and two al Qaeda associates in the suburbs of Quetta, Pakistan, the military said in a statement. Osama bin Laden had asked al-Mauretani ""to focus on hitting targets of economic importance in United States of America, Europe and Australia,"" with U.S. targets including gas and oil pipelines, dams and oil tankers, the statement said. Al-Mauretani was also involved in planning multiple attacks on European countries similar to those in Mumbai, India, in 2008, European intelligence officials told CNN last year. The man at the center of the alleged al Qaeda plot, Afghan German Ahmed Sidiqui, was detained in July 2010 and told interrogators that al-Mauretani helped with planning and coordination. White House spokesman Josh Earnest hailed the arrest. Arrest another big blow for al Qaeda . ""This is an example of the longstanding partnership between the U.S. and Pakistan in fighting terrorism, which has taken many terrorists off the battlefield over the past decade,"" Earnest said in a statement. A U.S. National Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, said the arrest dealt another blow to al Qaeda and added: ""We applaud the actions of Pakistan's intelligence and security services that led to the capture"" of a senior operative involved in planning attacks. News of the arrest comes six days before the 10th anniversary of al Qaeda's attack on the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people. It also comes as the United States and its allies have made major strides in its fight against al Qaeda. A secret U.S. military operation killed bin Laden on May 2. The following month, U.S. officials say, a drone attack in Pakistan killed Ilyas Kashmiri, a senior figure in al Qaeda described as the organization's ""military brain."" Kashmiri operated his own terrorist group, Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, or Movement for an Islamic Holy War. In August, an apparent U.S. drone strike killed al Qaeda's second-in-command, Atiya Abdul Rahman, officials said. He had been bin Laden's operations chief and was in charge of running daily operations for al Qaeda. However, the issue of combating terrorism also has strained U.S.-Pakistani relations over questions of autonomy and cooperation. In Pakistan, there is a backlash against the U.S. use of unmanned drones in attacks that have killed civilians, while U.S. officials complain of a lack of full support from the Pakistani government, particularly the intelligence service. They note that bin Laden had been living in Pakistan for years, purportedly undetected, before the U.S. mission that killed him. At the same time, the secret U.S. military raid deep inside Pakistan angered and embarrassed the Pakistani government. A senior U.S. counterterrorism official described al-Mauretani as a significant figure in the terror organization. ""This is one of al Qaeda's key operatives, and getting him off the streets has been a top priority,"" the official said. The official could not immediately confirm the arrest but said al-Mauretani has ""been active in planning attacks, and threats associated with him were partially responsible for the Europe travel alert that was issued last year. His capture would deal a major blow to the terrorist group's activities, and would be another in a string of recent wins against al Qaeda."" A senior Pakistani official said al-Mauretani ""did not have any particular position in the hierarchy of al Qaeda, but he was head of external operations and was planning attacks perhaps also in Germany."" U.S. intelligence agencies provided ""technical assistance"" in planning and conducting the operation, the Pakistani military statement said. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence has a ""strong, historic intelligence relationship"" with the U.S. agencies, it added, and the two nations continue to cooperate to enhance security. That cooperation has resulted in the prevention of a ""number of high-profile terrorist acts,"" not only in Pakistan and the United States but elsewhere in the world, the military statement said. While the U.S. provided ""technical leads,"" there were no American troops on the ground in the raid, which the Pakistani intelligence service conducted, the senior Pakistani official said. Al-Mauretani is in Pakistani custody, the official said, and may eventually be handed over to authorities in his native Mauritania. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the United States ""is within reach of strategically defeating al Qaeda."" ""I think we have them on the run. I think now is the moment, now is the moment following what happened with bin Laden to put maximum pressure on them because I do believe that if we continue this effect that we really can cripple al Qaeda as a threat to this country,"" Panetta said in July. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Paul Cruickshank and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: The White House and the National Security Council hail the arrest .

"Washington (CNN) -- For more than two centuries, it stood as a silent witness to history -- the ""Arlington Oak,"" a tree that sprouted on land once owned by Robert E. Lee, and later consecrated as part of Arlington National Cemetery. Last weekend, it fell -- one more casualty of the winds and heavy rains from Hurricane Irene. ""It is truly unfortunate to see it's now gone -- that tree had a significant legacy here at Arlington,"" said Steve Van Hoven, the cemetery's urban forester. The Arlington Oak, estimated to be 220 years old, stood by in stoic silence as a nation's history spread out nearby, as the acres filled with the graves of veterans, dignitaries, presidents and the fallen from war after war. For nearly half a century it shaded the area near the graves of members of the Kennedy family who were buried only yards below a slope that leads up to Lee's Arlington House mansion overlooking the Potomac River. According to Arlington National Cemetery, the oak was most known for the role it played in the selection of the grave site for President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is said to have visited Arlington House -- now a national memorial -- in the spring of 1963 and said the view was so magnificent that he could stay there forever. The Arlington Oak was part of that view. In addition to the Arlington Oak, five other large trees were lost to Irene, including a white oak estimated to be 240 years old, according to the cemetery. Crews have been working since the storm passed to clear debris left from broken branches and smaller trees that were uprooted. It took several days to cut and clean up the trunk and branches of the majestic oak, according to the cemetery.","The ""Arlington Oak"" was estimated to be 220 years old .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The father of Arizona massacre suspect Jared Lee Loughner had a front-yard argument with his son the morning of the killings and had told a neighbor the 22-year-old was ""out of control,"" according to neighbors and investigators. The shaven-headed youth had quit a community college in October after being suspended and had been warned not to come back without a mental health evaluation. Postings attributed to Loughner on websites including MySpace and YouTube show ""classic signs of psychosis,"" one expert told CNN. Loughner had complained for years about U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- the apparent target of Saturday's bloodbath, according to a law enforcement official. Loughner is now accused of killing six people and wounding 13, including Giffords, who remained in critical condition with a head wound Wednesday. Among the dead were Arizona's presiding federal district judge, a Giffords aide, a 9-year-old girl and three of constituents who had come out for Giffords' ""Congress on the Corner"" open house at a local Safeway supermarket. The morning of the shooting, he had argued with his father, Randy Loughner, in the front yard of their Tucson home, Richard Kastigar, the head of the Pima County Sheriff's Department's investigations bureau, told CNN's ""John King USA."" The younger Loughner was in the front yard with a bag, possibly a backpack, when his father asked him what he was doing with it, Kastigar said. ""Jared mumbled something back to his dad, and his dad said he didn't understand what was said. It was unintelligible,"" Kastigar said. ""And then Jared left. The father followed. The father got in his vehicle and tried to locate his son and followed the direction that he went and he could not locate his son."" Randy Loughner thought his son ""went into the desert some place,"" Kastigar said. But by Saturday afternoon, he and his wife returned home to find police waiting for them, neighbor Stephen Woods said. ""His hand went on his head. He seemed very upset. His wife was crying. I assume that's when they told him,"" Woods said. Randy Loughner ""was just holding his head, saying, 'No. No.' "" Woods said Randy Loughner had complained to another neighbor that his son was ""out of control."" Kastigar said the family is cooperating with investigators, and ""There's nothing that indicates to us that these were bad folks."" ""You know, this is a tragedy for them as well,"" he said. Loughner's parents said Tuesday they do not know why the shooting occurred and that they were ""very sorry"" for the loss felt by victims' families. ""It may not make any difference, but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss,"" they said in a written statement given to reporters gathered outside their home. Searches of their home after the killings turned up a 2007 letter from Giffords, thanking Jared Loughner for attending a 2007 event similar to Saturday's. An envelop in the same strongbox was scrawled with phrases like ""die bitch"" and ""assassination plans have been made,"" Kastigar said. A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity told CNN Loughner asked Giffords a question at the 2007 event and was unhappy with her response. ""He never let it go,"" the source said. ""It kept festering."" Online, Loughner ranted about poor grammar, illiteracy and ""mind control"" and argued that space shuttle missions were faked and that people could make their own currency. ""In conclusion, reading the second United States constitution I can't trust the current government because of the ratifications: the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar,"" he wrote in one piece posted to YouTube. ""No! I won't pay debt with a currency that's not backed by gold and silver! No! I won't trust in God!"" Alan Lipman, director of the Center of the Study of Violence at Georgetown University, said the postings show ""classic signs of psychosis."" ""People were looking for whether he was on the left or the right. He was neither,"" Lipman told CNN. ""He was incoherent. Those were signs, classic signs you'd see in a psychiatric unit of formal thought disorder."" And forensic psychologist Kathy Seifert called the postings ""absolutely psychotic."" Loughner should have been evaluated for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism or other mental illnesses, she said. ""I understand the thing about the grammar,"" Seifert said. ""There is a group, or a person, that talks about how the grammar is used to control the population, and so I hear that he's picking up that from someone else, too. So he's been influenced by other people."" Loughner dropped out of high school in 2006, after being taken to a hospital for alcohol poisoning near the end of his junior year, according to Sheriff's Department records released Wednesday. In 2007, he was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia, but the charge was dismissed after he completed a pretrial diversion program, according to court records. When he tried to enlist in the Army in 2008, the service rejected him for reasons it says it can't disclose due to privacy laws. But an administration official told CNN on Sunday that Loughner had failed a drug test. In October of that year, he approached sheriff's deputies with a complaint about identity theft. ""I noted that Jared was slow to respond to my questions."" The deputy who took his complaint noted. ""He often hesitated as if he was trying to think of an explanation."" Police were unable to contact him at the number he left for them, and the matter went no further, according to a sheriff's report. After dropping out of school, Loughner enrolled at Aztec Middle College, a partnership between Tucson schools and Pima Community College that helps high school dropouts transition to community colleges, PCC President Sylvia Lee told CNN. He took classes at the college until October 2010, when withdrew after five contacts with police and a suspension. Algebra instructor Ben McGahee said he had Loughner removed from his class in June after multiple disruptions in the first three weeks of the course. McGahee said Loughner sometimes shook, blurted things out in class and appeared to be under the influence of drugs at times. Another classmate, Steven Cates, told CNN that Loughner ""didn't interact socially like other people."" ""He would sit at his desk with that grin that you see in the mug shot that I've seen on the news,"" Cates said. ""He would sit at his desk with that grin, clenching his fists sitting at the desk."" Pima Community College told Loughner that he needed a letter from a mental health professional certifying that he posed no danger to himself or others before he would be allowed to return. Yet nothing in his record turned up in the background check carried out in November, when he bought the weapon police say was used in the killings. Kastigar said the investigation into Saturday's killings focuses less on who was responsible than why. But he cautioned, ""You can't really make reason out of something that is unreasonable."" ""Perhaps some psychologist or psychiatrist may opine at some point why they think this happened,"" he said. ""We can present the evidence, give it to experts, and somebody else might come up with why. But law enforcement at this point doesn't have it."" CNN's Drew Griffin, Randi Kaye and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","The Arizona massacre suspect showed ""classic signs of psychosis,"" an expert says .

"(CNN) -- Yemen's vice president called Saturday for presidential elections to be held in February, state media reported. Vice President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi issued a presidential decree for the vote to be held February 21, according to the state-run SABA news agency. The decree comes just days after President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule. He became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. The deal, brokered Wednesday by the Gulf Cooperation Council and signed in Saudi Arabia, allows Saleh to retain the title of president for three months until elections are held, but requires him to hand over executive powers to Yemen's vice president. The presidential decree issued by Hadi calls for the elections to be monitored by the Supreme Committee for Elections and Referendum, SABA reported. White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan spoke to Hadi on Saturday, congratulating the vice president and the people of Yemen on initiating a political transition. Brennan stressed the importance of the ruling party and the opposition working together, and the need for all parties to refrain from violence, according to a White House statement. ""The two agreed on the need to quickly implement the terms of the November 23 political settlement so that the legitimate and richly deserved aspirations of the Yemeni people can be realized,"" it read.","NEW: White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan urges unity and peace .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Twin suicide attacks in southern Yemen killed 12 tribesmen early Sunday morning, authorities said. The tribesmen are part of a small force fighting al Qaeda-affiliated militants in Abyan province . In one of the attacks, a suicide bomber approached a group of fighters, shook hands and sat with them before detonating explosives, tribal fighters said. The blast killed five people, in addition to the bomber. In the second attack, seven people were killed in addition to the suicide bomber, the fighters said. Clashes in Abyan have been ongoing since May, when suspected al Qaeda militants took over the province and declared it an Islamic emirate. The militants call themselves ""Ansar Sharia,"" and say that their mission is to spread Islamic law in Yemen. Government forces, with the help of local tribal fighters, have succeeded in retaking control of parts of the province.","The tribesmen are part of a small force fighting al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- At least 1,000 prisoners are on death row in Iraq, which now has one of the highest rates of execution in the world, the human rights group Amnesty International says in a report being released Tuesday. Samar Saed Abdullah is one of many facing execution in Iraq. She's accused of being an accessory to murders. The courts that sentence people to death do not meet international standards, the report charged, and Iraqi authorities ""provide very little information on executions, and some have been carried out secretly."" It criticizes the Central Criminal Court of Iraq and the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, which issue the majority of death sentences in the country. ""Defendants commonly complain that 'confessions' were extracted from them under torture,"" the report alleges. ""Defendants also complain that they are not able to choose their own defense lawyers"" when they appear before the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. But Iraqi Justice Minister Dara Noor al-Deen Bahaa al-Deen, who said he says he is in favor of abolishing the death penalty, defended the Iraqi justice system, saying it is fair. ""As a judge, I assert that these measures take place with every crime that occurs. Of course, every defendant claims innocence and that the trial is unfair, but I am certain and reassured that -- especially now -- that any defendant, no matter what the sentence is, receives a fair trial and is given enough time for his testimony, that of the witnesses,"" al-Deen said. ""Afterward, the court makes its ruling. If it finds that the evidence is sufficient that he/she committed the crime, it hands down the sentence he/she deserves.""  Watch more about Amnesty's report and a woman on Iraq's death row » . Trials at the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, which tries former Saddam Hussein-era officials charged with crimes against humanity and other major offenses, ""have been marred by political interference,"" Amnesty charges. The group says the trial of Hussein himself was subject to such interference, with the government dismissing a judge considered unlikely to support the death sentence against him. The former Iraqi leader was hanged in December 2006. The report says that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani opposes the death penalty but has refused to block executions. And it quotes Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as ""repeatedly"" defending the death penalty. Amnesty International opposes it ""in all cases without exception,"" the group says in its report. The report lists a wide variety of crimes that can result in the death penalty, including murder, crimes compromising state security, attempting to overthrow the government by violent means and damaging public property. When asked by CNN about pleas not to execute women on death row, many of them mothers, al-Deen said, ""For us, there is no difference between men and women who commit crimes. A person who commits a crime should be punished. In general, this can't happen now or in a year or two, but I hope in the future, the death penalty would be abolished, because I am personally in favor of life sentences rather than the death penalty."" Al-Deen said a request by him to waive the death penalty would have no effect. ""Even if I put in a request, this is a worthless request, because there is a law. As for abolishing the death sentence and replacing it with life imprisonment, that is an amendment of the law, and that has to happen through parliament. And parliament as the representative of the people decides if the punishment changes or doesn't,"" he said. Responding to a reference to ""hasty rulings,"" he said, ""I don't think the judiciary rushes to make a ruling, especially a death penalty for a convict. There are many severe sentences that were handed down, and when they reached the appeals court, they were returned back and changed."" Amnesty International provided CNN with a copy of the report ahead of its publication. The report appears to be based on media reports and information from the Iraqi Interior Ministry and Ministry of Human Rights. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Amnesty International says nation has one of world's highest execution rates .

"(CNN) -- Two prisoners have confessed to digging a tunnel that led to the escape of 63 inmates last week, Yemen's state-run SABA news agency reported Sunday. Dozens of suspected al Qaeda militants escaped Wednesday from a jail in the Yemeni city of Mukalla, a senior security official said. An Interior Ministry official said 63 members of al Qaeda had managed to break out of Almakla prison, according to SABA. He said three inmates were killed, another two were arrested, and a prison guard was killed. He asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Some of the escapees had already been convicted; others were awaiting trial, the official told SABA. They escaped through a 35-meter (115-foot) tunnel, he said. Witnesses said armed militants began attacking the prison at about 8 a.m. and fired heavy artillery before the escape. The prison warden, his deputy and a number of guards have been suspended for questioning, SABA said Sunday. Mohammed Qahtan, spokesman for Yemen's largest opposition bloc, Joint Meetings Parties, said he thinks security officials loyal to the ruling family are responsible for the escape and that the government would create chaos to stay in power. Yemen has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Saleh and other senior officials were wounded June 3 in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace and taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment. In recent days, the Yemeni government's control has been receding, said Christopher Boucek, an associate in the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""There are instances where you can say that the Yemeni government is instigating some of this chaos -- with the goal to demonstrate to the United States, Saudi Arabia and others that this regime -- the government of President Saleh -- is the best to fight al Qaeda."" Boucek said the Yemeni government is more concerned with protecting itself from the popular revolt than with going after al Qaeda. As a result, he said, the government has repositioned its counter-terrorism forces, retreating from areas such as Abyan province where it had lost ground and circling the wagons. However, a Yemeni official briefed on security operations rejected Boucek's conclusion. ""What about the blood of 66 soldiers?"" he said, citing the number of soldiers who he said have died in Abyan province alone in recent weeks. Another 291 soldiers have been wounded in operations there that killed six of the most wanted al Qaeda operatives and 40 other militants, he said. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Brian Todd contributed to this story.","Interior ministry official: 63 members of al Qaeda escaped last week, according to SABA .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former Major League Baseball star Lenny Dykstra was charged Thursday with two counts of indecent exposure for allegedly exposing himself to women he solicited on Craigslist. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office says the charges stem from multiple reports involving Dykstra dating back to 2009. The charges accuse Dykstra of ""placing ads on Craigslist requesting a personal assistant or housekeeping services. The victims allege when they arrive, they were informed that the job also requires massage service and then he (Dykstra) would disrobe and he would expose himself,"" said Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan. Dykstra, a three-time major league All-Star outfielder who played for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, is scheduled to be arraigned on September 7 in Los Angeles.","Lenny Dykstra charged Thursday with two counts of indecent exposure .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- When George Clinton enters the room, I wonder if I should salute him with an ""Atomic Dog"" bark or hug him. The 70-year-old architect of P-Funk doesn't look his age and today he's dressed in his signature hat, shades and jeans. He greets me with a warm smile. I return it. My mission is to learn the secret to his longevity. He's still performing and touring after all, something he's done since the 1950s. Initially his hoarse voice alarms me. I silently remind myself of his age. When I ask him, as I always do of my Red Chair guests, to introduce himself on camera, his voice transforms immediately. He barks loudly and deeply. You Parliament-Funkadelic fans know what I mean. When he relives some of his greatest hits -- ""I Wanna Testify,"" ""Maggot Brain,"" "" One Nation Under a Groove,"" ""Chocolate City,"" and ""Flash Light"" -- he is animated. His stories are so visual, I too can see the band and him onstage. ""Every 10 years, we had a big hit,"" he reflects. Clinton is known for rebranding. He would change the lead, the look and name of his bands with the times to great success. I ask what encouraged him between decades. He gives credit to his numerous band mates throughout the years. Bootsy Collins is among them. It is clear he still misses the band members who have died, too. He reminisces about the man known for wearing a diaper on stage, ""Diaperman"" Gary Shider. Clinton had known him since 1953. He died in June 2010. He and Eddie Hazel had been friends even longer, since 1950. He was the lead guitarist for Funkadelic. He died in 1992. Clinton also says his music and fans have kept him going. Although he used to straighten people's hair when he was a teenager, he cannot imagine a life doing anything else but music. Clinton's songs are among the most sampled. He tirelessly fights to protect artists' work. Piracy is the word he uses most often during our interview. He has advice for others wanting to get into the business. He says he would be hypocritical if he said to not abuse drugs. ""'No' is the greatest aphrodisiac in the world,"" he said. ""If you tell a kid to not do something, well, guess what he will do."" He acknowledges he, too, may have made better decisions if he had been on top of his game. ""It's hard for him to do [drugs] and pay attention to the money,"" he says. Clinton says he is healthy, has energy and hopes to do what he loves best for years to come.","CNN sits down with George Clinton for a Red Chair interview .

"Editor's note: Business Insider is contributing a series of columns to CNN.com that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world. (Business Insider)  -- Zynga's hit Facebook game ""FarmVille"" is arguably the most widely played video game in existence. What is especially impressive about that is that ""FarmVille"" isn't any fun. We aren't being snobs, saying people shouldn't like it because it isn't good. We're saying that people don't like it, but they play it anyway. Try explaining ""FarmVille"" to someone who has never played it, and watch their eyes glaze over. Ask your friends who fill your Facebook newsfeed with their ""FarmVille"" accomplishments, and you'll find that most of them are embarrassed. They think the game is stupid and boring, but they just can't stop playing. So why do so many people play ""FarmVille"" if it isn't fun? There are two main reasons: . The simplest reason is advertising. ""FarmVille"" is advertised like crazy all over Facebook, so it's always in everyone's face. This advertising is incredibly effective, because it is so immediate: You click on the ad, and you're playing the game. ""FarmVille's"" parent company, Zynga, isn't the only one advertising ""FarmVille,"" though. Users are constantly advertising the game to their friends, too, through ""viral"" channels on Facebook. As you play, the game periodically prompts you to post about your accomplishments on your Facebook wall. These posts, which are generated with a simple click from within the game, appear in all of your friends' news feeds. This encourages your friends to play. So Zynga gets free advertising. And because your name is attached to it, your friends think it's a word-of-mouth recommendation. The less obvious reason that millions of people are addicted to ""FarmVille"" is that there's a sense of social obligation to play. If you don't play ""FarmVille,"" your ""FarmVille"" friends suffer. Zynga makes it your duty to play. Getting ahead in the game depends on having plenty of Facebook friends who are also playing. If you know any dedicated ""FarmVille"" players, chances are you've seen messages from them about it: Their farms need help, and you are just the person! You are letting your friends down if you don't play. All of this puts ""FarmVille"" in your face, whether you want it there or not. This rubs a lot of people the wrong way, but it's essential to the game's success. Facebook recently cut back on game developers' ability to post updates to users' walls, because people were angry that their newsfeeds were filling up with ""FarmVille"" spam. Facebook games immediately began bleeding users. Because they aren't fun, they need a constant barrage of ads and viral endorsements to keep people engaged. Of course, none of these three forces compel the average Facebook user to play ""FarmVille."" But because the number of Facebook users is so huge -- over 500 million, at last count -- even a small percentage of Facebook users can make a game like ""FarmVille"" very popular. This formula doesn't lead to good games, but it does lead to consistent success. ""FarmVille"" is in a league of its own in terms of users, but as a game, it is almost identical to every other Zynga game and every game released by its competitors. The same game mechanics are copied and put in different contexts. Whether you're running a farm, heading up a mafia family or taking care of your fish, the game remains the same. Zynga doesn't even have to think up the contexts: Most of its games, including ""FarmVille,"" are nearly exact replicas of its competitors' offerings. All of this makes Facebook an extremely odd platform for games. On the one hand, it is incredibly successful, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for Zynga alone. On the other hand, it leads to games that couldn't work anywhere else. Zynga has made a lot of noise about establishing its own destination site, but none of these games has ever taken off elsewhere, because people won't play them without the ads, the viral reminders and the sense of obligation. That should be troubling for Zynga. For one thing, its business is at the mercy of Facebook's whim. For another, it raises an important question: What if someone finds a way to make fun games work on Facebook?

"(CNN) -- Oil companies evacuated workers from offshore wells, New Orleans prepared for possible flooding and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency as a tropical depression formed Thursday in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricance Center issued a tropical storm warning Thursday evening for an area stretching from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Sabine Pass, Texas. The hurricane center said tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. New Orleans -- much of which sits below sea level -- is likely to see 8 to 10 inches of rain in the next few days, Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters. ""What we do know is there's high wind, there is a lot of rain and it's going slow,"" Landrieu said. ""That's not a good prescription for the city of New Orleans should it come this way."" It was six years ago this week that Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast, devastating coastal Louisiana and Mississippi and inundating much of New Orleans. Landrieu urged residents to start collecting the items they might need in case of flooding or a hurricane, such as bottled water, batteries, nonperishable food, first-aid kits and family documents. They may not be needed this time, he said, ""But we seem to be entering the more active phase of the storm season. ""It is important for citizens to remember it is individual preparation at the end of the day that matters the most,"" he said. Firefighters had been battling a huge wildfire in a swamp on the city's east side for several days as the blaze spread smoke over much of the city. Landrieu quipped that city officials had hoped for rain, ""and it appears as though our prayers have been answered."" As of 7 p.m. Thursday, the tropical depression was centered about 225 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was moving northwesterly at about 6 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. In advance of the weather, BP and ExxonMobil ordered their Gulf rigs evacuated and have shut down their wells, spokesmen for those companies told CNN. Chevron, meanwhile, has ordered nonessential workers off the platforms, and Shell said it had begun taking some of its workers back to shore Thursday afternoon. ""Weather conditions are already impairing staff movement, but we are using all available resources to safely evacuate employees,"" Shell said in a written statement. ""The number of evacuated personnel will depend on weather conditions, and we will only transport personnel if safe to do so."" ""Interests along the entire northern Gulf of Mexico coast should monitor the progress of this disturbance,"" they noted. In the state of emergency declaration, Jindal authorized the state Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness director ""to undertake any activity authorized by law which he deems necessary and appropriate"" to prepare for the storm. CNN's Dave Alsup and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Storm warning stretches from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Sabine, Texas .

"(CNN) -- In a battle of underdogs Detroit and Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love came out on top. Philadelphia clearly won the popular vote in our unscientific poll, with 57% of the vote, compared with 43% for Detroit. Philly also won on Facebook with more than 1,750 ""recommends,"" compared with more than 1,575 for the Motor City. ""How can this even be close?"" asks iReporter and Philadelphian Peter DeCarlo. ""Philly beats Detroit on so many levels, just to name a few: food, education, sports, location."" His Philly suggestions include the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Schuylkill River Trail, people-watching in Rittenhouse Square and sales-tax-free clothes shopping on Walnut and Chestnut streets. ""Detroit is more than crime and urban decay,"" writes iReporter Barbara Smitter, who lives just outside the Michigan city. ""It is art and philanthropy and enterprise and community. I have made it a personal mission to get out of my comfy suburban existence and see more of what makes this city so great."" Philadelphia . Philadelphia's fans find plenty to celebrate beyond the Liberty Bell and running the ""Rocky"" steps up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her hometown takes the cake when it comes to food, according to iReporter Katie Eisele, a suburban Washingtonian who was raised in the Philadelphia suburbs and regularly visits her family there. ""If you're looking for a fancy, sit-down restaurant, any of the Stephen Starr restaurants are fantastic (like El Vez or Buddakan),"" Eisele writes. ""My parents also love Moshulu because it is on a beautiful ship right on the waterfront at Penn's Landing. Also, Bistro Romano in Society Hill is a romantic and quaint Italian restaurant, great for a date night out. But if you're looking for more of a grab-and-go type of meal ... Sarcone's Deli, Dalessandro's or Reading Terminal Market are great."" Speaking of Reading Terminal Market, that's where you must go ""if you're looking to try a lot of different types of food at once,"" writes iReporter Bob Malin, a lifelong resident. ""From the fresh fish brought in the early a.m., to the Amish making lean cuts of any of your favorite meats, to Bassett's famous ice cream and a number of candy shops, it's your one-stop-shop for all things edible."" You'll also find the best sports fans in the world, according to Malin. ""For a seat with a great view of the game, Citizens Bank Park is a great time,"" he writes. ""Or go to the Linc (Lincoln Financial Field) to see 'The Birds' take on the NFC East. And the Flyers and Sixers are always a good time. ... (H)ockey is a game that Philadelphians can relate to, working hard to succeed."" Philly also has world-class art, including ""the soon to be relocated Barnes (Foundation), which houses an unbelievable previously private collection of 19th-century impressionist art, the largest mural arts project in the country, and an incredible number of events throughout the summer,"" suggests commenter Beth Schade of Philadelphia. Coming soon: ""The Welcome America festival happens every year for the Fourth of July and is a massive free outdoor concert,"" Schade writes. ""Local favorite the Roots always show up. They are also known as Jimmy Fallon's house band. There are (also) free pop-up shows all over town all summer, featuring lots of local favorites."" One of iReporter Eisele's favorite things to do is hike in Fairmount Park, but she doesn't stop there. ""While there you can take a stroll along Boathouse Row and see early-morning rowers along the Schuylkill River,"" she writes. ""Visitors can also visit South Street and see the trash mural walls or see a concert at the Theatre of Living Arts. And if you have kids, the Please Touch Museum or the Franklin Institute are great places to keep them (and you) entertained."" Detroit . The Motor City is probably most famous for being home to the Motown sound and the top three American automakers. And visitors can still explore the Motown era at the Motown Historical Museum or visit the Henry Ford Museum in the suburbs. However, our Detroit iReporters suggested going beyond the easy mark to explore the soul of the city and its suburbs. Take a stroll through Hart Plaza with its many sculptures to see the city's heart, suggests iReporter Smitter. ""A short ride away and you can experience the sights, sounds and smells of Eastern Market and once again be bathed in the culture of this city,"" she writes. ""A jaunt around the corner and you reach the Heidelberg Project,"" a 26-year-old open air art project on the city's East Side that uses everyday, discarded objects. ""Take a bike ride on a Saturday around Belle Isle. And speaking of urban decay, just check out the Packard plant. It has become a haven of street art."" John McGraw, an iReporter who visits Detroit several times per month for work, said he loves the spirit of the Motor City as well as its food, sports and culture. ""The spirit of Detroit is tough; the city has been through a lot over the years, but there is a feel of determination in the air."" His recommendations: ""I really love Greektown and ... if you like Mexican food you should try Mexicantown; it's a little off the beaten path but well worth it. You can always hit a ballgame at Comerica Park, Ford Field or see the Red Wings at Joe Louis,"" he writes. ""I also like the Eastern Market, or head over to Slows for some (barbecue)."" In suburban Detroit, iReporter Cherl Addington adores ""being nestled against Lake St. Clair, the penultimate playground tucked in between the Detroit River and Lake Huron. ... It's like it's our own, smaller, personal backyard lake with Belle Isle tucked in at its tip. Belle Isle's designer, Frederick Law Olmsted, considered it his crowning achievement. ... To sit at the northern end of Belle Isle and look out at Lake St. Clair is to experience one of the most beautiful places on earth."" Don't judge a city by its hardest times, suggest our Detroit iReporters. ""When I moved to this area from the little city, I had all of the same misconceptions that you hear about,"" Smitter writes. ""Just give it a chance, and you'll find that the city has so much more to offer than crime and fear."" Is your hometown or the city where you live now misunderstood or unappreciated? Tell us where you live (or where you grew up) and why you love it so.","From Philly cheesesteak to fine dining, City of Brotherly Love offers many food options .

"(CNN) -- Syria smoldered on Saturday as soldiers executed dozens of defectors in Idlib province and shelling persisted in the besieged city of Homs, activists told CNN. More than 40 soldiers trying to defect from an army unit in Idlib province were executed by government troops, according to activists from the town of Binnish, the opposition Syrian Network for Human Rights, and the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The incident occurred at the Abu Athuhoor Military Airport when 50 soldiers attempted to defect, the network said. A captain loyal to the regime got wind of the plan and thwarted it, telling soldiers he would join them, but then informing a brigadier general about the attempt, the network said. The group said 44 were executed; their bodies were dumped in a lake. Six escaped, the network said. ""The Syrian Network for Human Rights places the responsibility of such criminal action on the commander in chief of army and armed forces (Syrian President) Bashar Al-Assad, the captain and the brigadier general. ""The SNHR demands an immediate international investigation for this massacre,"" it said. The LCC and the Binnish group said 47 soldiers were killed. There was no immediate comment from the government. Military defectors pose a threat to the Syrian regime. Many have left the army because they have refused to heed orders to fire on civilians. Last summer, the Free Syrian Army, a resistance force composed of defectors, emerged. The group has said soldiers are regularly switching sides for the FSA. As for Homs, the shelling and miserable conditions continued, opposition activists said. And in the Damascus suburbs, more than 100 people were arrested, the LCC said. The bodies of two journalists killed last week in Syrian shelling on the Baba Amr neighborhood in Homs were delivered to Western diplomats in Syria, Red Cross officials said. Reporter Marie Colvin's body was handed over to Polish diplomats representing U.S. interests in Syria. Photographer Remi Ochlik's body was transferred to the French. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the Syrian Arab Red Crescent delivered the bodies to the diplomats at al-Assad University Hospital in Damascus. Doctors there identified the bodies. Poland said it is engaged in efforts to transport Colvin's remains to the United States. France says it doesn't know when Ochlik's body can be taken to France. Their deaths and the ongoing Syrian military crackdown underscore the hardships and dangers civilians face across the country. ""Where is the free world?"" asked opposition activist Sami Ibrahim, describing a dire humanitarian crisis in the city of Homs and crying for international help. ""The situation is very bad."" Dima Moussa, spokeswoman for the opposition Revolutionary Council of Homs, called the government's relentless push to pacify Homs a ""suffocating siege."" She said there was shelling in the neighborhoods of Bab Tadmur and Jib al-Jandali, and mortars were targeting Ashira. Food is hard to get and electricity has been cut off, she said. There was no water in most areas and civilians were using melted snow and rain water for drinking. Snipers were blanketing the city and corridors in and out ""are nearly closed off completely,"" she said. ""The medical situation continues to deteriorate and is catastrophic, and all kinds of medicine have run out from field hospitals,"" Moussa said. The Syrian government has been seeking to shut down anti-government protests for nearly a year. It has directed its firepower lately on Homs, where many neighborhoods are bastions of the opposition. Much recent attention has focused on Baba Amr, a neighborhood of five square miles (eight square kilometers) that endured nearly a month of shelling before rebel forces announced a ""tactical retreat"" on Thursday. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been trying to enter the devastated neighborhood for days. On Thursday, Syrian authorities granted teams from the Red Cross and Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society permission to enter; but on Friday, the ambulances and aid workers carrying food and medical supplies were turned away. SANA reported Saturday that authorities had ""restored security and safety"" to Baba Amr after ousting ""armed terrorist groups who ran amok in it and committed murder and vandalism, turning the locals' life into a living hell."" State TV quoted a resident saying ""terrorists"" used rocket-propelled grenades and mortars and many of them were foreigners. ""There were Saudis, Qataris, Emiratis, Libyans and others. There were all kinds of nationalities, they didn't have mustaches, just long beards. They were masked. They blocked the streets, stopped us at checkpoints. It was true terror by all means. They had snipers all over. They destroyed the houses. The terrorists forced us to go out and joined their demos or they told us we will be shot if we don't,"" he said. But activists and independent observers reported callous government actions. British journalist Paul Conroy, who was wounded in his stomach and leg and then smuggled to Lebanon in a six-day journey from Baba Amr, called the government siege ""a medieval siege and slaughter."" ""I would say quite categorically that's the most ferocious, vicious, and unnecessary that I've seen,"" he said. ""And there are actually no military targets within Baba Amr. All of the intense shelling is directed at the civilian population."" The United Nations estimates more than 7,500 people have died since then, while the LCC says more than 9,000 people have died during the conflict. The Syrian government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence. Including the defector deaths, the LCC said at least 80 people had been killed Saturday nationwide. In Daraa, the southern city where the anti-government uprising began last year, at least three civilians were killed and 20 civilians and security personnel were wounded, SANA said. SANA said a ""terrorist suicide bomber"" blew up a car he was driving at al-Masri roundabout in Daraa's al-Balad area. The opposition Free Syrian Army said state security forces staged the bombing themselves. Car and suicide bombings, common militant tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been rare in the Syrian uprising. There have been a handful of suicide bombings in Damascus and Aleppo, the country's two largest cities. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group, said at least six Syrian soldiers were killed in clashes with defectors after forces loyal to President al-Assad stormed the city of Hirak northeast of Daraa. CNN cannot independently confirm reports across Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. Protests began last March, when townspeople in and around Daraa protested the arrest of school children for painting anti-government graffiti. The government's fierce crackdown on the protesters and the tenacity of the demonstrators emboldened protests in other cities.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Two passengers aboard a cruise ship were killed when 26-foot waves crashed into the vessel Wednesday off northeast Spain, officials said. Fourteen others were injured. The Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines ship was in the Mediterranean north of Barcelona when it was hit by three ""abnormal"" waves, each about 26 feet (9 meters) high, cruise line spokesman Michael Maratheftis said. As a result, five windows in public areas -- on the forward part, or bow, of the 14-deck ship -- were smashed, and two male passengers -- a German and an Italian -- were killed, he said. Fourteen others were treated aboard the ship for light injuries but were hospitalized as a precaution when the ship returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night, Maratheftis said. Spain's state news agency reported that two of the passengers had serious injuries, including a 62-year-old woman with fractures in both legs. Maratheftis would not provide specifics, but said there were no life-threatening injuries to the 14 wounded passengers. The vessel, the Louis Majesty, was sailing under a Maltese flag and traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Genoa, Italy, the Greek Public Ministry of the Mercantile Marine said. The incident occurred 24 miles off the coast of Cabo de San Sebastian near the Spanish town of Palafrugell, Maratheftis said . The ship had 1,350 passengers and 580 crew members, the Greek ministry said. The passengers, including three Americans, were from 27 nations, Maratheftis said in phone interviews from Cyprus. Buoy data off the French coast indicated that weather was the likely cause of the high waves. Winds were at 45 mph at that buoy. All of the passengers were to be flown home on Thursday from Barcelona at the expense of Louis Cruise Lines, Maratheftis said. ""The next cruise has been canceled,"" and the Louis Majesty will remain in Barcelona for repairs, Maratheftis said. The vessel is due to resume cruises on March 14, he said. CNN's Al Goodman, Stephanie Halasz, Ben Brumfield and Chad Myers contributed to this report.","26-foot waves hit ship with 1,350 passengers aboard .

"(CNN) -- At least 80 African migrants were feared drowned Monday after their boats capsized off the coast of Yemen, authorities there reported. The two boats sank in separate accidents. One boat, which carried 45 migrants mostly from Ethiopia, capsized in the Red Sea, according to Yemen's official news agency, SABA. Three people on that boat, believed to be from Somalia, survived and were found on Yemen's coast, the agency said. Between 35 and 40 migrants were on the second boat that capsized off the coast of Lahj province, SABA reported, citing the interior ministry. Many of the people on board were women and children, according to the official website of Yemen's ruling party. It said all of the migrants on the second boat were from Ethiopia. A search is under way to locate the missing. Yemen, seen as a gateway to other parts of the Middle East, is a common destination for African migrants fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity on the nearby Arabian Peninsula. Despite the dangers of the journey, thousands of people cross the Gulf of Aden each year, according to the United Nation's refugee agency.","Two boats capsize in separate incidents off the coast of Yemen; search under way .

"(CNN) -- Naoki Matsuda, a former Japan defender who played for his country when they co-hosted the 2002 World Cup, has died after suffering a suspected heart attack during a training session on Tuesday. The 34-year-old's death was confirmed by his club, third-tier side Matsumoto Yamaga, on Thursday after he had been rushed into hospital two days ago having collapsed. Matsuda, who also had a 15-year spell with Yokohama Marinos between 1995 and 2010, represented his country on 40 occasions and was part of the Blue Samurai squads which won the Asian Cup in 2000 and 2004. The right-back fell into a coma before being placed on life-support and did not regain consciousness after being taken ill on Tuesday. ""I can't believe it,"" said former teammate Shunsuke Nakamura, according to AFP. The 33-year-old former Celtic midfielder played alongside Matsuda with both Yokohama and the Japan national team. ""He was dynamic in every aspect and he was a kind of big brother for everyone in a positive sense,"" continued Nakamura. ""Matsuda was a kind of loyal soldier,"" remarked French coach Philippe Troussier, who was in charge of the Japan team which reached the second round of the 2002 World Cup. ""He listened attentively to what I said. He was polite and always a reliable key man in the team."" Japan Football Association technical director Hiromi Hara added: ""I have managed or coached teams playing against him many times and know what a big presence he had.""

"(CNN) -- We don't agree often. In fact, for most of our adult lives, we have worked on opposite ends of the political spectrum. One of us headed the fastest-growing union in North America, the other served as budget director for arguably the most important Republican president in the modern era, Ronald Reagan. But national crises make for strange bedfellows. That's why we are asking Democrats and Republicans to put aside their partisan interests to secure America's future by passing a deficit reduction plan of at least $4 trillion that includes both spending cuts and new revenues. Our debt crisis is so severe, so obvious, and the middle ground seemingly so apparent, even Odd Couple characters Oscar Madison and Felix Unger could agree on a solution. So why can't Congress and the president? If we can do it, so can they. We agree with Republicans who note that we have a serious spending problem. Health care costs are growing out of control and government wastes money on programs that duplicate other programs or are just unnecessary. In 2010, federal spending was nearly 24% of gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the economy. Only during World War II was federal spending a larger part of the economy. And we also agree with Democrats that taxes must be part of the plan. Tax revenues stood at 15% of GDP last year, the lowest level since 1950. And even when the economy finally turns around, by 2025 the federal government will have only enough revenue to finance interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Our tax system is broken. We simply don't raise enough revenue to pay the bills for the level of government that an overwhelming bipartisan majority has consistently supported. This country needs a deal. We need to fix our busted budget system, revamp our broken tax code and reform our Social Security and health care programs so that citizens who depend on them can count on them. We also need to ensure our country is safe and secure, but at a significantly lower cost than today's bloated defense budget. We can only do that by passing a comprehensive fiscal plan, like those put forward by the Fiscal Commission and the Gang of Six, which phases in the changes, contains real cuts that fix our mounting national debt problem and erases the uncertainty that afflicts businesses and other governments who hold our debt. This last point cannot be emphasized enough. Businesses know that spending cuts and tax increases are coming, but they do not know how, when or even why. Without a concrete fiscal game plan that provides some measure of certainty, confidence will remain weak and economic recovery tepid. Worse still, if we simply continue to kick the can down the road, we are running the risk of a jarring financial market crisis that will make it even harder to reach consensus and the ultimate tax and spending changes even more draconian. A deal can happen only if both sides put everything on the table. That means Democrats have to agree to entitlement reform and cuts to domestic programs, and Republicans have to accept more revenue and defense cuts. Odd couples, strange bedfellows, whatever the terminology, agreeing on budget issues should not be this difficult. The two of us have come together despite our wide philosophical differences because we agree on one fundamental point: The fiscal crisis is so urgent that everything must be on the table. We need to act now. If the president and Congress embrace that principle, we can finally make some progress in getting our fiscal house in order and our national economy back on track. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers differ widely in politics; one headed a union, the other was Reagan's budget director .
But they agree Congress must put aside differences, pass deficit reduction plan of $4 trillion .
They say budget must contain domestic program and defense cuts, new revenue .

"(CNN) -- Public schools in Tucson, Arizona, face millions of dollars in penalties after a ruling that the district's Mexican-American studies program violates state law. An administrative law judge found the program's curriculum was teaching Latino history and culture ""in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner,"" and upheld state officials' findings that it violated a state law passed in 2010. The Tucson Unified School District had appealed a decision by the law's principal backer, then-state schools superintendent Tom Horne, to shut down the program. Horne left office at the end of 2010, but his successor, John Huppenthal, backed Horne's ruling in June. Huppenthal said Tuesday's ruling shows ""that it was the right decision."" ""In the end, I made a decision based on the totality of the information and facts gathered during my investigation -- a decision that I felt was best for all students in the Tucson Unified School District,"" he said in a written statement. Under the law, the state can withhold 10% of its funding for the school district -- about $15 million a year -- until the district changes the course. In a written statement, Tucson Superintendent John Pedicone said the school board's lawyers are reviewing the ruling, and board members will discuss it at their January 3 meeting. During their appeal, district officials pointed out that an audit commissioned by Huppenthal praised the program and found ""no observable evidence"" that the classes violated state law. A witness for the school system argued that teaching students ""historical facts of oppression and racism"" was less likely to promote ""racial resentment"" -- something specifically banned by the 2010 law -- than ignoring that history. In Tuesday's ruling, administrative law judge Lewis Kowal said the auditors observed only a limited number of classes. He added, ""Teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner."" ""Teaching in such a manner promotes social or political activism against the white people, promotes racial resentment, and advocates ethnic solidarity, instead of treating pupils as individuals,"" Kowal wrote. He cited a lesson that taught students that the historic treatment of Mexican-Americans was ""marked by the use of force, fraud and exploitation,"" and a parent's complaint that one of her daughters, who was white, was shunned by Latino classmates after a government course was taught ""in an extremely biased manner."" The 2010 law also bans courses that ""promote the overthrow of the United States government,"" are ""designed for a specific ethnic group"" or advocate ""ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals."" It was passed in the same session of the state legislature that produced Arizona's controversial law cracking down on illegal immigration. A group of teachers has asked a federal court to throw out the restrictions, arguing they passed as ""a result of racial bias and anti-Hispanic beliefs and sentiments."" Richard Martinez, the lawyer who represents the teachers in that case, said the decision was expected ""under the circumstances."" ""The law was written in a way that allows the superintendent of public instruction to control the outcome,"" Martinez told CNN. And Kowal noted that he was working under the assumption that the law is constitutional, ""ignoring any questions raised"" to the contrary, Martinez said.","Courses were ""biased, political, and emotionally charged,"" a state official rules .
The finding could cost Tucson schools $15 million a year .
A 2010 Arizona law bars classes that promote ""racial resentment"" or ""ethnic solidarity""
An earlier audit found the classes didn't violate that law ."
"(CNN) -- China, South Korea and Japan dramatically cut their oil imports from Iran in February following intense US efforts to persuade Asian buyers to comply with Washington sanctions on Iran's central bank. Asian countries are collectively the biggest buyers of Iranian crude oil, accounting for about 65 per cent of Tehran's sales, but their responses to Washington's sanctions campaign have been mixed. China and India have both resisted the US and EU sanctions on Iran, whereas Japan and Korea have broadly committed to follow the US lead. Pressure on China, South Korea and India to further reduce their imports of Iranian oil intensified this week when Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, announced that Japan and ten European countries had qualified for exemptions from US penalties on institutions that deal with Iran's central bank. These 11 countries had ""significantly reduced"" the volume of crude they purchased from Iran, according to Mrs Clinton's statement. Although China and South Korea were left off the exemption list, the trade data suggest that both countries are on track to qualify for exemptions in coming months, according to analysts. The drop in February imports comes after several Asian countries, including China and Japan, cut their imports of Iranian crude in January. China, the biggest buyer of Iranian crude, usually accounts for one-fifth of Iran's crude exports but in February China's purchases plummeted to 290,000 barrels a day, a 40 per cent drop from the previous year. South Korea's imports of Iranian oil fell 16 per cent in February from the previous month to 5.9m barrels, a slight increase from the same month a year earlier but below monthly averages in 2011. South Korea's monthly import data tends to be highly volatile. The value of Japan's total imports from Iran fell 34 per cent in February from the previous year. Crude oil makes up the great majority of Japan's imports from Iran, although Japan does not specifically disclose its oil purchases from Iran. Iran oil production has fallen to a 10-year low and could drop further as sanctions over its nuclear programme disrupt an industry already suffering from years of under-investment. Tehran produced 3.38m b/d in February, according to the International Energy Agency, the lowest level since late 2002. Despite China's obvious drop in Iranian oil purchases, Beijing is officially firmly opposed to the US and European Union sanctions. ""The market perception is that the drop in crude imports from Iran is not a signal that China is following US/EU sanctions, but more related to pricing issues that were being worked out at the time,"" said Soozhana Choi, head of Asia commodities research at Deutsche Bank. ""It is likely that we will see a rebound in Iranian oil supply to China in subsequent months."" According to a senior academic, China does not want to give the impression that it is caving in to US pressure. Li Weijian, a Middle East specialist at the Shanghai Institute for International Strategic Studies, said: ""The reason China cut imports from Iran is not because of the sanctions. We hope the US doesn't see this as a result of their pressure and try to use this in future."" Nevertheless analysts say China's cut in imports put it in line to receive a waiver from the US, similar to the one announced this week for Japan. South Korea is in ongoing talks with the US about cutting its oil purchases from Iran and receiving a waiver, but has not committed to a specific reduction target. India, which accounts for about 12 per cent of Iranian crude sales, has not yet disclosed its February purchases of Iranian crude. In January India's imports of Iranian crude rose 19 per cent from the previous year. Before the threat of sanctions, Showa Shell Sekiyu was Japan's largest importer of oil from Iran, with about 100,000 b/d from Iran. A spokesman said he could not disclose any details on the renewal of annual contracts with Iranian suppliers, but that Showa Shell would ""reduce import volumes, according to the agreement between the Japanese and the US government."" China's two biggest importers of Iranian crude are Sinopec and Zhuhai Zhenrong, which are both state-owned. Sinopec could not be reached for comment. Zhuhai Zhenrong declined to comment.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- More than 250 inmates were injured in a riot that erupted overnight at the California Institution for Men in Chino, a spokesman said Sunday. Flames leap from a housing unit at a prison in Chino, California, on Saturday night. Fifty-five inmates were taken to area hospitals with serious injuries, said Lt. Mark Hargrove, prison spokesman. None of the facility's employees was hurt in the melee, which broke out at about 8:20 p.m. Saturday at the Reception Center West facility, Hargrove said. Guards used pepper spray, ""less lethal force, and lethal force options"" to regain control by 7 a.m. Sunday, he said. The scene of the violence was the medium-security housing facility with seven units, each of which houses about 200 inmates, he said. Some 80 officers responded to the riot, during which a housing unit was heavily damaged by fire, he said. The institution was placed on lockdown pending an investigation into the cause of the fighting, and visiting privileges were suspended. Hargrove said several other prisons in southern California were placed on lockdown as a result of the riot at the Chino facility and the possible need of reallocating prison staff to Chino. Aref Fakhoury, acting warden for the California Institution for Men, said police departments from the cities of Chino, Chino Hills and Ontario, and the Chino Valley Independent Fire District aided in quelling the violence. The inmates' injuries ranged from stab wounds and slashes to head trauma, Hargrove said. Some were considered life-threatening. Hargrove said inmates used ""weapons of opportunity,"" such as broken glass during the riot. Images taken from the scene showed flames coming from the building as a helicopter hovered overhead. A similar riot broke out in December of 2006, Hargrove said. Chino is located about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. CNN's Jackie Castillo contributed to this report.","No employees at California Institution for Men in Chino were injured .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- At least two sailors died and 23 were missing Sunday when five ships sank in storms in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea, the official Russia Today Web site said. One of several ships that were in distress near Russia that spilled fuel into a crucial waterway. The strong winds and high surf caused the Volgoneft-139 to split in two, spilling up 560,000 gallons of fuel oil, an official from Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN. That is approximately 1,000 tons. In addition to the five ships that sank, many others were grounded, Russia Today reported. The weather was hampering efforts to control the spill, which occurred in the Kerch Strait, the official said. The channel separates the Black Sea from the Sea of Azov. The spill was moving toward the Ukrainian coast and Russia and Ukraine have set up a joint crisis center to deal with the disaster, the official said.  Watch enormous waves rock ships » . The Volnogorsk and the Nakhichevan -- each carrying about 2,000 tons of sulfur -- also broke apart as a result of the high waves and strong winds, a local transport official told RIA Novosti news agency. And a third sulfur-transporting vessel, the Kovel, went down later after striking the Volnogorsk, the agency reported. A spokesman for the federal agency for sea and inland water transport, Aleksandr Davydenko, said conditions in the Kerch Strait were worsening. Twenty-foot waves and winds gusting to 78 mph were making the rescuers' task difficult, Davydenko said. Emergencies Ministry spokesman Viktor Beltsov says the Volganeft-139 was anchored near the port of Kavkaz. ""At the moment specialists are trying to work out the size of the oil spill and the direction it's heading,"" he said. ""We will alert the respective Ukrainian services if the spill moves in their direction."" Near the city of Sevastopol on the Black Sea, the storm wrecked a freighter carrying scrap metal. Two of its crew members were found alive, but 15 others were missing. Another cargo ship was in distress. Russia and Ukraine were working together to deal with the accidents, but according to news reports, strong winds had caused several more dry-cargo ships to run aground. Among them were Turkish vessels, a Georgian and a Greek ship. Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of Russia's environmental watchdog and a member of the United Nations International Panel for Sustainable Resource Management, said the fuel oil spill could lead to long-term contamination. ""My forecast is that the coastline of the Kerch Strait and the strait itself will need deep re-cultivation"" lasting 10 to 15 years, he said. The storm's effects extended to Crimea, where power cuts led to suspension of heating and water supplies on parts of the peninsula. ""This is a major ecological catastrophe,"" said Vladimir Slivyak, head of Ekozashchita, or Ecodefense, a Russian environmental group, according to Interfax news agency. The Kerch Strait is a key waterway for transporting fuel oil from the Caspian Sea onto tankers waiting in the Black Sea. The Volgoneft-139 was carrying fuel oil from the southern Russian city of Samara on the Volga River to an oil terminal in Ukraine, according to Interfax. Previous fuel spills have been smaller than Sunday's disaster. In November 2002, the Liberian oil tanker Prestige broke up and sank, spewing 64,000 tons of fuel oil into the waters and polluting thousands of miles along the Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Portugal.

"(CNN) -- The oohs and aahs of the Independence Day holiday will be more subdued this year in Texas, where months of severe drought have led to restrictions on fireworks across much of the state. Not only are dozens of counties imposing restrictions on small-bore pyrotechnics like firecrackers and bottle rockets, but cities such as San Antonio, Austin, Amarillo and Lubbock have canceled municipal Fourth of July displays because of the tinderbox conditions. ""Temperatures are in the triple digits, and we're not seeing any relief,"" Chris Angerer, deputy chief of operations for the Lubbock fire department, said Thursday. Wildfires have already reached into the city limits and destroyed three homes, and months without significant rain have left grasslands brown and dry, looking ""like the dead of winter."" Canceling the fireworks shows is ""causing a little bit of a stir,"" said fire engineer Deborah Foster, a San Antonio fire spokeswoman. ""But it's for the protection of the people of San Antonio. One errant spark and we could have a major grass fire."" Why there's no messing with Texas . Wildfires have scorched nearly 3.3 million acres of Texas since November, setting ablaze an area larger than Connecticut. Authorities have banned outdoor fires in 235 of the state's 254 counties, a figure the Texas Forest Service called record-setting. Firefighters battle to contain Texas wildfires . Texas is the worst-hit of several states in a band of severe drought that stretches from Arizona to Florida. More than 90% of the state is suffering from ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. The ""exceptional"" category -- the most severe -- covers 72% of the state, according to figures published Thursday. Only a small patch of northeast Texas, from roughly Fort Worth to the Oklahoma state line, has seen anything close to normal rainfall, the Nebraska service reports. On Louis Grissom's farm in the Panhandle town of Seminole, the cotton is stunted and the peanut plants are undersized. Grissom and his fellow farmers are bracing for losses and making preparations to sell off livestock. ""Miles of pasture"" where cattle used to graze has been scorched, and one fire in early June left more than 300 cows dead, he said. ""Our cotton, we can't even water it,"" Grissom said. ""Our money crop is peanuts. It's taking all the water we can pump just to irrigate our peanut crop, and our peanut crop is not even growing as fast as normal."" At the beginning of the planting season, ""the water just wouldn't wet the ground, it was so dry."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday declared disasters in 213 Texas counties due to the drought, along with seven parishes in neighboring Louisiana. The move comes after a loss of pasture, grain and forage crops of more than 30% in the affected district and opens the door to federal support for farmers. The Texas agricultural extension service estimates that state farmers have suffered $62 million in losses, including buildings, crops, livestock -- even more than 4,100 miles of fences, which can cost $10,000 per mile to build, lost to fires. Authorities in Arizona and New Mexico have also been battling extensive wildfires, including one near Los Alamos, New Mexico, home to one of the U.S. nuclear laboratories that produced the atomic bomb. That fire has scorched more than 70,000 acres of land, but firefighters reported some success in limiting its spread Wednesday night. Firefighters scramble to contain blaze near nuclear lab . In the West Texas oil towns of Midland and Odessa, water is getting to be as valuable as crude oil. Reservoirs managed by the Colorado River Municipal Water District are running dry, forcing the cities to impose new restrictions on water use. The district has cut Midland's water allocation by 20% this year, and the city's biggest water source, the O.H. Ivie Reservoir, is projected to run dry by December 2012 if current conditions continue, municipal spokeswoman Tasa Watts said. ""At this point, that's the hand we've been dealt,"" Watts told CNN. Effective Friday, residents can water lawns only twice a week, between dusk and midmorning. About 60% of Midland's water use goes to outdoor irrigation, Watts said. Violations carry a fine of up to $500. In addition, residents are barred from refilling swimming pools, and restaurants will serve water to customers only upon request, she said. This year's drought is part of a long-term trend dating back to the mid-1990s, but 2011 ""has been one of the worst that we've had in this period,"" said Tom Spencer, head of the Predictive Services Department of the Texas Forest Service. The period from October 2010 through May is one of the three driest since 1895, he said. ""Any rain would be good for temporary relief,"" Spencer said. ""But right now, we need a weather pattern change or some tropical storms or tropical events to break this drought. More than likely it's not going to happen until after the summer."" In April, Gov. Rick Perry called on ""Texans of all faiths and traditions"" to pray for rain. But the state remains parched -- and though Tropical Storm Arlene came ashore in eastern Mexico on Thursday, the storm is unlikely to help, Spencer said. ""There's a high-pressure system on top of us, steering rain events around the state,"" Spencer said. For Grissom, that means cotton yields of maybe one-fifth what he grew a few years ago and not enough hay for his cows. With harvest time barely three months away, he and his fellow farmers are running out of time. ""God's in control. I hope that he'll see fit that we get some rain,"" he said.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Somalis are so desperate to survive that attacks on merchant shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean will not stop, a pirate leader promises. A French warship keeps guard over commerical vessels in the Gulf of Aden last week. ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. ""Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything."" The interview with the pirate was conducted in late August by journalists employed by the Somali news organization Garowe Online. The complete interview was provided to CNN last week and provides a glimpse of why piracy has been so hard to control in the region. Recorded on grainy video, the interview took place in the Somali port city of Eyl, now a center of pirate operations. Eyl is on the east coast of Somalia in the autonomous territory of Puntland. It is a largely lawless zone, considered extremely dangerous for Westerners to enter. The Puntland government said two unidentified Western journalists were taken hostage Wednesday as they attempted to report on pirate activity. Boyah said that the piracy began because traditional coastal fishing became difficult after foreign fishing trawlers depleted local fish stocks. Traditional fishermen started attacking the trawlers until the trawler crews fought back with heavy weapons. The fishermen then turned to softer targets.  Watch why fishermen turned to piracy » . ""We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships,"" Boyah said. ""For the past three years, we have not operated near the Somali coast. We have operated at least 80 miles [out], in international waters."" When merchant shipping started avoiding the Somali coast, Boyah said, ""we went to ships traveling other routes."" Over the past year, the number of pirate attacks has increased dramatically. The International Maritime Bureau cites more than 90 pirate attacks off East Africa so far in 2008. When attacks are successful, the hijacked ships are taken to Somali waters, where the ships and crew are held until a ransom is paid.  See how pirate attacks have increased » . Ships recently captured include a massive Saudi supertanker laden with crude oil valued at more than $100 million and a freighter carrying Russian-built tanks. The hijackings have been profitable. Kenya's foreign minister, Moses Wetangula, estimates the pirates have been paid more than $150 million during the past year. One pirate gang wants $2 million dollars to release a Yemeni freighter and crew seized last week. Facing increasing disruptions through one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, several countries have sent warships to patrol the area. There have been reports of skirmishes between pirates and naval forces, but the military presence does not concern pirate leader Boyah.

""A ship can see 80 miles or so [on radar]. It cannot see us at all. No one can do anything about it."" Boyah said it is unlikely the Puntland regional government would ever crack down on piracy because government officials are involved in financing the piracy and collect a cut of the ransoms. ""They motivate us. It's their money and their weapons,"" Boyah said. ""Thirty percent belongs to them."" The Puntland foreign minister, Ali Abdi Aware, denied government involvement with the pirates, including taking bribes. The minister cited the arrest of six pirates earlier this year as evidence it is acting to stop piracy. Pirate Boyah said he is unimpressed with the arrests by Puntland authorities. ""The pirates are at sea and Puntland does not approach them. The pirates are on land and Puntland does not approach them,"" Boyah said. ""They arrest some small people and tell the world that they captured pirates, but they are liars."" While Boyah may have been outspoken about the government's ineffectiveness, he did not allow interviewers to show his face, an indication that even in this lawless country, pirates still have some fear.","Piracy a life or death choice, Somali pirate says .

"London (CNN) -- Does part of social media's future lie in the past? It's a question that's nagging some of the biggest names in the industry as they turn their attention to the swelling digital archives many of us have created online. One of Facebook's recent overhauls saw the addition of a timeline to help users build a chronological narrative of their lives. Kevin Systrom, co-founder of photo sharing site Instagram, said this week he wants to give his users better access to their older images. But as we increasingly rely on digital services as a repository for our life stories, is there any guarantee that we will be able to access them in years to come? Multibillion dollar businesses such as Facebook and Google might seem like rock solid cornerstones of the Internet at the moment, but fortunes change and leviathans can and do go out of business. And a scroll through the fine print of most social media sites' terms reveals no mention of an obligation to safeguard our data. With such a large question mark hanging over the tech industry, it was only a matter of time before someone smelled a business opportunity. One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data. Libin made headlines at tech conference LeWeb London this week when he revealed that Evernote has 34 million users, of whom 1.4 million are paying customers -- up sharply from the 25 million users and 1 million paying customers he had announced in May. Three-quarters of these new users are coming from mobile devices, he said. Already sitting on a $1 billion valuation, Libin's site -- often described as an ""external brain"" -- doesn't look like it has any immediate worries for the future. There's even talk of an Evernote IPO in the next few years. But Libin believes that he can encourage even more people to park their data with Evernote if he can remove any question of doubt about his company's long-term destiny. To this end, he plans to later this year introduce a legally binding promise that guarantees users 100 years of access to their files -- not that his customers will be around that long. This involves setting up a protected fund that, in the event of Evernote being taken over or shut down, will pay to maintain its data banks. ""We want people to have to believe that Evernote will be around for 100 years,"" Libin told CNN. ""As soon as 10 years go by when it hasn't been in anyone's economic interest to keep your data, you can almost be guaranteed you won't be able to get it back. But as long as it's economical viable, it'll remain alive."" Eliminating this doubt makes smart business sense. Some data services have endured a rocky ride because of fluctuating faith in their prospects. In 2010, social bookmarking service Delicious experienced a sharp user exodus after Yahoo announced it was selling off the site. Delicious still exists today and may continue to thrive long into the future. But online-archiving services must establish trust with their users to endure, said Maciej Ceglowski, founder of rival bookmarker Pinboard. ""An archive needs to have a credible plan for offering the same basic feature set over a time scale of decades,"" Ceglowski told the Personal Digital Archiving conference in San Francisco earlier this year. In a world where computers and storage solutions are constantly evolving, such plans face hurdles. ""The main technology challenge is what format will be available in 100 years?"" says Libin. ""It's like people who had eight-track tapes of their favorite music from 30 years ago. Who's going to know how to play a CD in 10 or 20 years? ""There's no magical technology solution -- it's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years,"" he added. ""So we have to make it worth someone's time to convert the data into whatever the newest format is."" Libin says his company is taking cues from the Long Now Foundation, a private organization that is examining ways to preserve data for centuries as part of its broader efforts to promote debate over humankind's distant legacy. ""They're planning for thousands of years,"" he said. Of course, no one knows exactly what the Internet will look like a century from now. But Libin, and Evernote, are trying.","Services such as Evernote allow users to archive images, documents and other data .

"New York (CNN) -- A small group of 9/11 victims' families is contesting the 9/11 memorial's decision to bar politicians from speaking at this year's commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks. The group, led by retired Fire Department of New York Deputy Chief Jim Riches, called the National September 11 Memorial and Museum ""totally hypocritical because banning the governors (of New York and New Jersey) from speaking is the ultimate political decision."" ""No one individual or group should unilaterally make this decision not allowing Gov. (Andrew) Cuomo and Gov. (Chris) Christie to speak on 9/11,"" it added. But the statements didn't seem to reflect the general opinion of most family members. ""They speak for themselves, and certainly not for me. And not for any of the family members I've spoken to,"" Charles Wolf, who lost his wife in the attacks, said in response to the family group's statements. Riches, who lost his son on 9/11, said his group represents about 50 families. Another 9/11 victim's family member, Debra Burlingame, said, ""Families never wanted the deaths of 3,000 people politicized. I doubt very seriously that these few people out of thousands will get support for what they're saying."" Officials representing the memorial declined to comment Monday. Joe Daniels, president of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, said last week the foundation ""is focused on honoring the victims and their families in a way free of politics, and this ensures that continues."" In a letter sent to victims' families Wednesday, Daniels said that the reading of victims' names by family members will be ""the exclusive focus of the program"" during this year's ceremony. ""Ground zero"" has a history of politicians speaking at anniversary ceremonies, with speakers such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Mayor Michael Bloomberg is chairman of the memorial foundation's board of directors. Christie and Cuomo are among politicians who are honorary trustees. ""The decision is the memorial's to make and we are supportive of it,"" said Cuomo's spokesman, Josh Vlato. At last year's ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the attacks that brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center, President Barack Obama read a psalm. It's been a tradition for victims' family members to lead a solemn reading of the names of their lost ones during commemorations at the memorial site. The reading of the names ""individualizes the masses of people who were killed. Those people were individuals who had individual lives,"" said Wolf, whose wife, Katherine, was working at the World Trade Center that day. But Bloomberg had publicly considered ending the tradition. ""Some people have said change is good, and the subject's come up a couple times, and I think we've said the foundation board will talk about this,"" he said during a radio show in August 2011. His comments brought much heat from some of the victims' families, who have blamed politicians for delays in construction of the memorial museum. The museum was originally scheduled to open this year, marking the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, but has been held up because of ""disagreements"" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bloomberg said in a news conference last year. More than 3 million people have visited the memorial since its opening on September 11 of last year. ""We're still dealing with this. Eleven years later, and we're still talking about it,"" Wolf said. The ceremony includes six moments of silence, representing crucial moments during the attacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, and the crash of United Flight 93 in rural Pennsylvania.","9/11 Memorial officials are barring politicians from speaking at this year's N.Y. ceremony .

"(CNN) -- The Indiana high school student who was in danger of missing her graduation ceremony because of a visa mix-up in Mexico returned home early Friday morning. The smiling teen was met at the Indianapolis International Airport by family members, balloons and signs. ""Now I can continue to pursue my dreams,"" Elizabeth Olivas, 17, told reporters. Her attorney, Sarah Moshe, had said the U.S. State Department approved a waiver, allowing Olivas to return home and deliver the salutatorian speech at Frankfort High School on Saturday. An undocumented immigrant who was brought to the United States by her parents when she was 4, Olivas traveled to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, last month to beat a deadline to apply for a visa. According to immigration laws, children of immigrant parents have until 180 days from their 18th birthday to leave the United States for their country of origin and apply for a visa. The consulate in Mexico granted Olivas an appointment for May 4. Moshe calculated on two different legal calendars that the 180th day would fall on April 17, so Olivas departed for Mexico that day. But at her May 4 appointment, Olivas was told she had left the United States on the 181st day. The calendars Moshe used did not account for the leap year. The mix-up could have meant Olivas would be banned from the United States for three years, living with her grandparents in Juarez until she could apply again. ""The waiver was approved, and we just finished issuing and printing her visa,"" read a statement from the U.S. State Department, according to Moshe. ""We gave her the visa packet and I assume she will be leaving the Consulate momentarily (visa in hand!). Congrats and best of luck to Elizabeth and her family! She is very lucky to have such a great team working on her behalf."" Olivas' father is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He filed an immigrant visa petition for his daughter to gain legal status. The petition process began years ago, but the process was slow, Olivas said. She said she had been ""essentially begging for an appointment."" ""The problem was we couldn't secure an appointment at the consulate,"" Moshe said. In the six weeks since Olivas' arrival in Mexico, she participated in classes remotely with her laptop and kept her grades up during the final weeks of school. Her only hope to return to Indiana quickly was a 400-page parental hardship waiver that she presented to U.S. consulate officials Thursday. Her appeal argued her diabetic father would suffer from being apart from his daughter. Now back in the United States she plans to apply for permanent resident status. Steve Edwards, principal at Frankfort High School, called Olivas a ""phenomenal kid."" ""She is a mentor to those younger than her,"" Edwards said. ""There is just not a bad thing to say about Elizabeth. She's an awesome girl."" Olivas' medal and diploma will be waiting for her on Saturday, he said. ""Regardless of this whole process, she's graduating on Saturday,"" Edwards said. ""We expect her to be at the graduation ceremony on Saturday. We expect her to be in front of the crowd and give her speech. We expect to see her at graduation.""","Olivas was granted a waiver Thursday .

"(CNN) -- This Christmas season the classic film most of us will watch on our televisions is Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life."" With good reason: It's the perfect feel-good Christmas movie. In celebrating the quiet good works that Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey has done in running his family's savings and loan bank for the benefit of the residents of Bedford Falls, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the story of American modesty at its best. But the movie we ought to be watching this Christmas season is another 1946 classic, William Wyler's ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" With a script by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, who also was a speechwriter for President Franklin Roosevelt, ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" tells the story of the difficulties three World War II veterans overcome on returning to their peacetime lives in the fictional Midwestern town of Boone City. What makes the Academy Award-winning ""Best Years of Our Lives"" so relevant are the problems today's veterans -- now coming home in increased numbers with the end of the Iraq war -- are having finding a place in civilian life. Veterans in the 20-24 age bracket have an unemployment rate of nearly 30%, more than double the 14.5% unemployment rate of nonveterans in the same age group, and veterans of all ages have an unemployment rate of 11.8% compared with the civilian unemployment rate of nearly 9%. Equally alarming are the mental health figures for today's returning vets. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, veterans account for about one in five of the more than 30,000 suicides committed annually in the United States, and the problem is only getting worse. This year 10,000 combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder entered Veterans Affairs hospitals every three months, pushing the number of vets ill with PTSD to 200,000, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" does not present us with a programmatic answer for how to help returning vets. Wyler does not even mention the GI Bill of Rights, which eventually made it possible for 4.3 million vets to purchase homes at low interest rates and for 2.2 million vets to attend college. But what ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" does emphasize is that for those who fight them, our wars continue long after they officially end. In ""the Best Years of Our Lives,"" Al Stephenson, a banker played by Fredric March, is the best off of the three vets, but only because of the patience of his wife can Al settle back into the routine of office work. Fred Derry, an Air Force bomber captain played by 1940s leading man Dana Andrews, discovers his wife has been unfaithful to him, and gets back on his feet only because he persuades a compassionate local businessman to give him a job turning old B-17 bombers into scrap that can be used for building houses. And Homer Parrish, a sailor played by real-life veteran Harold Russell, who lost both his hands in a World War II training accident, is able to accept the notion that he isn't a freak because the girl he left behind finally convinces him that his wounds don't repel her. The result is a series of bittersweet endings that are inseparable from the film's implicit belief that most vets can't succeed on their own when they return home. They need help. The release of ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" in November 1946 made it possible for Wyler to deliver his bittersweet message during America's second post-World War II Christmas season. The timing was perfect for a director whose three years of service in the U.S. Army Air Forces did not blind him to the harsh realities that followed even a ""good war."" The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Many will watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" this Christmas season, Nicolaus Mills says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who operated on Kanye West's mother a day before she died is in trouble with the Medical Board of California over several DUI cases and has had judgments against him in at least two malpractice cases, according to legal documents filed in California. Dr. Jan Adams has ""multiple convictions for alcohol-related offenses,"" medical board executive director David Thornton said in his complaint charging Adams with violating the Medical Practice Act. Adams has at least two convictions since 2003, when the doctor was put on probation and ordered to complete an alcohol counseling program, according to the complaint. The complaint, dated April 10, also cites the convictions as evidence for charges of unprofessional conduct and abuse of alcohol. It requests that the medical board revoke or suspend Adams' license.  Watch why Adams is under scrutiny » . Sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a settlement was reached regarding Adams' most recent DUI, in 2006, and the type of disciplinary action he should face from the medical board. The settlement was sent to the board on November 2, the sources said, but it will likely take a month for the board to finish its work. The sources also said the board probably will renew his license. Adams' medical license expires on April 30, 2008. Additionally, Adams has settled at least two malpractice suits, one for $250,000 and another for $217,000. Further details were not available. Adams has not responded to requests for comment about the medical board complaint or the malpractice suits. After telling TMZ.com that Donda West's death was an unforeseen circumstance unrelated to the surgery he performed, Adams released a statement refusing further comment about the death. TMZ.com, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office said that Adams performed surgery on West, 58, on Friday. She was found unresponsive and in respiratory arrest at her home the following day and was pronounced dead that evening after being rushed to a nearby hospital. An autopsy on West's body was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Tuesday. Adams is the host of Discovery Health's ""Plastic Surgery: Before and After"" and has appeared frequently on ""Oprah"" and other television shows. He is the author of two books, ""Everything Women of Color Should Know About Cosmetic Surgery"" and ""Health, Wellness and Cosmetic Surgery for the Woman of Color, Volume 2."" He also sells several lines of skin care products through his company Carswell Products, and another, called ""Rudalgo"" -- Adams' middle name -- through his company JRA Nutridermaceuticals. According to his Web site -- which has been taken down -- Adams graduated from Harvard university and the Ohio State University School of Medicine and studied plastic surgery at the University of Michigan.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Mobile, Alabama, are investigating why a University of South Alabama police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old freshman who they say was naked and acting erratically outside the campus police station early Saturday. The campus officer heard a loud banging noise on a window at the station at 1:23 a.m. CT (2:23 a.m. ET) Saturday, the university said in a statement. When he left the station to investigate, the school said, ""he was confronted by a muscular, nude man who was acting erratically."" The man, later identified as Gilbert Thomas Collar, of Wetumpka, Alabama, repeatedly rushed and verbally challenged the officer in a fighting stance, the school said. The officer, whose name hasn't been released, drew his weapon and ordered Collar to stop, the school said. The officer retreated several times to try to calm the situation. ""When the individual continued to rush toward the officer in a threatening manner and ignored the officer's repeated commands to stop, the officer fired one shot with his police sidearm, which struck the chest of the assailant,"" the school statement said. ""The individual fell to the ground, but he got up once more and continued to challenge the officer further before collapsing and expiring."" Campus police immediately contacted the district attorney's office to request an external investigation, and the Mobile County Sheriff's Department will assist, the school said. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of internal and external investigations, the school said. School spokesman Keith Ayers called it a ""campus tragedy"" for the university family but offered no other details, citing the active investigation. The University of South Alabama, located in Mobile, enrolls about 15,000 students.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British authorities told CNN Wednesday they are examining a home video that shows singer Amy Winehouse smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she is heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. The cover of British tabloid The Sun shows a video still of Amy Winehouse smoking a glass pipe. Scotland Yard said it had received the video from The Sun newspaper, which made it public Tuesday. A Grammy-nominated singer, Winehouse's alleged battle with drugs have garnered constant headlines. Her hit song ""Rehab"" describes her reluctance to enter a rehabilitation center, which she did last summer. The tabloid said the 19-minute video was shot Friday in Winehouse's East London home. The Sun posted an edited 2:12 portion of the video on its Web site. The Sun is Britain's best selling daily tabloid newspaper. In the video posted online, Winehouse walks around her home in a dark tank top, talks to a friend on her cell phone, and talks to the person shooting the video.  Watch CNN's report on the video » . At one point, Winehouse says, ""I just took about six Valium."" Sitting on her bed, she lights a glass pipe and inhales. It's not clear what's in the pipe. Her personal representatives referred CNN to her record company. Her UK label, Island Records, issued a statement saying, ""We are deeply disappointed and upset by these latest revelations and are doing everything we can to offer Amy our full support in dealing with her problems."" In October, Winehouse and her husband were arrested at a Norwegian hotel for marijuana possession, and soon after fans booed her on stage as she slurred and stumbled her way through her songs. In December, tabloids published pictures of Winehouse with a mystery white powder in her nose. She was also photographed wandering barefoot on a London street, wearing only jeans and a bra, and appearing disoriented. Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, is currently behind bars in London on charges of perverting the course of justice following a bar fight.

"(CNN) -- Not many people get a personal invitation to visit North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un. Kenji Fujimoto was the personal sushi chef of Kim's father, the late Kim Jong Il, before fleeing to his native Japan in 2001, fearing his life was in danger. More than a decade later, he returned to North Korea and described a warm reunion with the young Kim. ""I jumped up to hug him, shouting 'Comrade General' and instantly burst into tears ... He hugged me back, the first hug in 11 years. I said, 'Fujimoto the betrayer is back now,' and I apologized for all I did and all I disclosed about him. He said, 'OK, don't worry anymore.'"" Fujimoto has written a number of books about the Kim family since he left North Korea. The former chef says he often played with the young Kim before he escaped. During his recent two-week visit, he says Kim thanked him for playing with him and talked about their going horse-riding, jet-skiing; playing tennis, basketball; and rollerblading together. Fujimoto said of the young leader, ""I was surprised how gentle a person he is."" It is not clear why the younger Kim decided to invite Fujimoto back to North Korea, but it is clear that Fujimoto is unwilling to say anything negative about him or the country. Speaking of Pyongyang, he said, ""I went window shopping from the third day. There are plenty of goods in shops. That's already a big difference. There was nothing there 10 years ago ... I guess it changed drastically since the Kim Jong Un era started."" More: North Korea rebuffs aid from South . Pyongyang has improved over the past decade, but it is a city for the elite and chosen. In the countryside that few visitors are allowed to see, the situation is very different. Aid groups say food is scarce and malnutrition high. It may not surprise many that Fujimoto, with his glowing praise, sounds at times like a spokesman for the regime. His wife and children are still living in Pyongyang. Fujimoto claims they want to stay, but there is no way to know for sure. Spending every day with his family, he then stayed the night in a room in the Secretary's department, claiming he needed to for safety, as there are many who do not forgive him, as he says Kim has done. Fujimoto also met Kim's wife whom the world did not even know about a couple of weeks ago. Of Ri Sol-ju he said, ""She is just so charming. I cannot describe her voice, it's so soft... She said to me, 'Welcome to the republic. Our comrade the Supreme Commander missed you the most. He was always talking about you. Thank you for coming.' Kim organized a party in Fujimoto's honor, according to the chef. He says they talked about old times and did not mention the current situation of North Korea at all. He does admit forgetting how the party ended after he had a few drinks. ""When I regained consciousness, I was on a bed. I asked if I did anything disrespectful. No one said I did, so I felt relieved."" Fujimoto says Kim gave him a free pass to visit North Korea whenever he wanted, an invitation few have. The benefit of the visit for Kim's international reputation is not lost on Fujimoto. ""I said clearly that if I go back to Japan safely, the reputation of Supreme Commander 'Comrade General' would soar enormously,"" he said. Fujimoto is now willing to tell all who will listen about the virtues of the young North Korean leader.

"Monte Dinero, Argentina (CNN) -- When we landed in Rio Gallegos, Argentina it didn't take me long to spot Richard Fenton. He was the only six-foot tall bearded red-headed guy wearing an olive-green fatigue jacket and a wide-brimmed bush hat. When his hearty welcoming words: ""Hello, Brian, how are you?"" boomed out in English amongst the Spanish-speaking crowd at the arrival gate, I was certain we had located our host. We loaded our gear into his 4x4 truck and began the two-hour journey towards his home at the southernmost tip of continental South America. The Fenton family has always been a bit different than everyone else in this part of Patagonia -- and that is exactly why we came here. They are eco-pioneers in more ways than one. Richard's great-great grandfather, Arthur, came to Argentina from County Sligo, Ireland in 1885 to become Santa Cruz Province's first medical doctor. Arthur married a wealthy widow and began living on her homestead overlooking the rough seas at the mouth of the Strait of Magellan. The area had been christened Monte Dinero -- ""Money Mountain"" -- by gold prospectors -- and sheep were soon introduced. Five generations later, the Fentons are still tending sheep here, producing high-quality wool and meat that is in demand around the globe. A few years ago though, 40-year-old Richard began to have doubts about the farming methods that his forbearers had passed on to him. Traditionally, he tells me, sheep mostly stay put, continually grazing on the same pastures. A century's worth of this overgrazing had caused the desertification of much of the fragile grasslands at Monte Dinero. So Richard began to devise a method to change his sheep herding practices, and after research in Argentina, Australia and England, he introduced a new system that constantly rotates the sheep to different pastures, thus allowing the grass to regenerate. This holistic herding has had a tremendous effect on his land, and helped bring much of it back to life. ""What we are really trying to do here is imitate what Mother Nature used to do -- which is the natural herding of the wildlife,"" says Richard. Essentially, Richard has switched from being a sheep farmer that uses grass, to a grass farmer that uses sheep. But getting his stubborn fellow farmers to make the switch too was a challenge. But slowly his efforts have paid off, and now 120 farms in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are a part of the Ovis XXI -- a network which fosters innovation in sheep breeding and land management across South America. ""We use biological indicators to assess the health of ecosystem processes,"" says Pablo Borrelli, an Ovis XXI director. ""We disclose the land health status of every farmer to the customers. A farmer must have positive biological indicators. If he doesn't, he has to change his management and fix the problem."" As Richard and I walk through thick grass in a steady rain on Monte Dinero, the evidence is clear. He shows me areas where new green grass is now growing despite having been dry and dead just a few years earlier. Later, we drive past a neighboring farm that still does things the old-fashioned way and there was a distinct difference in the look and feel of the grasslands. The pioneering method employed by the Ovis XXI partners has now attracted the attention of conservation groups and clothing makers alike. The Nature Conservancy is providing technology like satellite mapping and its scientists are working with the farmers to continue the effort to regenerate the grasslands. And California-based clothing company, Patagonia, Inc., plans to use the wool in their upcoming clothing lines. ""Ovis XXI has an on-the-ground reach that is amazing, plus great respect from the ranchers they have been working with for a long time. This fact spoke volumes to our company; it isn't often we get to see that far back in the supply chain,"" says Jill Dumain, Patagonia, Inc.'s director of environmental strategy. This international recognition also bodes well for the Fenton's other business: agro-tourism. They were amongst the first in Argentina to open their estancia to curious travelers from around the globe to hear how an English-speaking Irish family has thrived in a remote part of Spanish-speaking Argentina. ""The people that make the effort to come here, they arrive and they say there's something special about this place. What it is, I don´t know. You have to see it with your own eyes,"" says Richard's mother, Peggy, as we sit in the cozy living room of their ranch house. That's not to say that living at the end of the earth is easy, for the sheep or their herders. I spent three days at Monte Dinero and I can attest to the challenges there: it is windy, cold and wet, and the sun is temperamental, at best. It is also breathtakingly beautiful.

"(CNN) -- The entertainment industry was not immune to the impact of the fires blazing across Southern California. At the Santa Clarita Studios in Valencia, California -- about 30 miles north of Los Angeles -- some staffers weren't able to get to work Monday, due to traffic on area roadways and concern about their homes, according to Variety. Interstate 5, a major north-south artery, runs directly through the area. Two CBS shows, ""NCIS"" and ""The Unit,"" have sets at Santa Clarita, but neither shut down shooting Monday, according to the industry trade paper. The Stevenson Ranch fire was near enough that ""NCIS"" staffers could see the smoke, according to The Hollywood Reporter, another trade paper. ""The Unit"" set was functioning normally Tuesday, said CBS spokesperson Susan Marks. ""We're fine,"" she told CNN. ""We've had no interruption to production."" Fox's ""24"" wasn't quite as lucky on Monday, The Hollywood Reporter reported. The show was shooting at a Marine Corps air station in Irvine, about 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and had to cancel filming at 7:30 a.m. at one of the base's hangars due to smoke from the Santiago fire. The show's producers decided to shoot other scenes on its stages elsewhere in Southern California.  Watch the fire at the Stevenson Ranch » . A handful of shows, including CBS' ""Cold Case"" and ABC's ""Big Shots,"" either scrapped shoots or changed locations due to the fires.

If production units and studios were scrambling, other businesses benefited from the disruption caused by the fires. A number of upscale Los Angeles-area lodgings, including the Peninsula and Four Seasons hotels in Beverly Hills, reported a flurry of bookings, according to Variety. At the Four Seasons, a front desk clerk confirmed the influx. ""We've had quite a few people come to stay with us,"" she told CNN. Sunday night saw a number of walk-in guests, mostly from Malibu, she added. Those guests might not be able to stay long, though: with a number of group bookings scheduled for later in the week, the walk-in guests may have to find other arrangements. Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott's newly renovated bed and breakfast, Chateau La Rue, in Fallbrook, California, about 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, was also affected. ""We don't know the extent of it,"" McDermott told People.com. ""There were guests on their way [to the B&B], but they were notified and sent back. The whole town of Fallbrook was evacuated."" The two were in Los Angeles to support Spelling's former ""Beverly Hills 90210"" castmate Jennie Garth on ""Dancing With the Stars."" Malibu, one of the areas most directly affected by the fires, is the home of a number of celebrities, including Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Mel Gibson, Jennifer Aniston, Victoria Principal and Sting. Gibson and Principal, who live in in different areas of Malibu, were both evacuated early Monday morning. They are both in undisclosed locations and their families and pets are OK, according to spokespeople. So far, their houses have been spared.

"London (CNN) -- American and British leadership of the world remains ""essential to the cause of human dignity,"" President Barack Obama said Wednesday, making a sweeping case for values including freedom and the free market in a speech to a joint session of the British Parliament. ""We must act, and lead, with confidence in our ideals, and an abiding faith in the character of our people,"" Obama said, even while adding they will ""proceed with humility, and the knowledge that we cannot dictate outcomes abroad."" He argued that ""the longing for freedom and human dignity"" is ""universal, and it beats in every heart."" And he linked this year's uprisings against regimes across the Middle East to the fall of Communism in Europe, of white minority rule in South Africa, and of dictatorships in Latin America and Southeast Asia, saying they reflect ""a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted at home."" Obama to Middle East: We'll show you the money . He also contended that the rise of China, India and Brazil was linked to their acceptance of free markets on the British and American models. Their ascendance does not mean that Western leadership is in decline, he insisted, saying: ""The time for our leadership is now."" His aides billed the address as the centerpiece of his six-day trip to Europe this week. British lawmakers greeted him with a standing ovation, and applauded his description of himself as the son of a Kenyan cook in the British army who had become president of the United States. The speech caps a two-day trip to Britain that mixed pomp with politics. Queen Elizabeth II hosted a state dinner for Obama Tuesday night, where he wore a white tie and tails, while a day later he and David Cameron rolled up shirtsleeves and served burgers and sausages to military service members and their families in the garden of 10 Downing Street. The president and prime minister turned up the heat on Moammar Gadhafi in a joint appearance Wednesday, with the president saying that ""ultimately"" the Libyan leader will go. The United Nations-endorsed mission to protect Libya's people from their leader means making sure Gadhafi ""doesn't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them,"" Obama said. ""I do think we have made enormous progress in Libya. We have saved lives. Gadhafi and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying,"" Obama said. But both he and Cameron said it will take time to reach a solution in Libya, which Gadhafi has ruled for 42 years. The nation seems to be grinding into a stalemated civil war. ""We may have to be more patient than people would like,"" Obama said. Cameron refused to answer a journalist's question about whether the United Kingdom would send attack helicopters to bolster the military mission in Libya, but said: ""We should be turning up the heat in Libya,"" and vowed to look at ""all the options"" for doing so. Obama and Cameron were speaking on a wide range of topics at a news conference in a sunlit garden in London. Before their meeting with journalists, the two leaders discussed policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Israel-Palestinian conflict, among other issues. Obama said America's relationship with Britain is ""the strongest it has ever been"" and said the two nations are committed to working together on global economic recovery and fighting the war on terror. Cameron said the U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was ""a strike right at the heart of international terrorism"" and that Britain and the United States must work closely with Pakistan in the future. ""We can defeat al Qaeda,"" Cameron said. Obama is in the middle of a six-day, four-nation trip to Europe that began in Ireland and will continue with stops in France and Poland. On Tuesday the president and first lady toured Buckingham Palace and visited Westminster Abbey, where crowds that had gathered along the roads outside cheered their arrival. Cameron talked up the two countries' closeness the night before the Obama visit officially began, calling the relationship ""essential"" and saying there is an ""incredible alignment of views"" between 10 Downing Street and the White House. On a less formal note, Obama also joined Cameron in playing table tennis against two students during a visit to a local school. No details on the final score were made public, but the students won handily. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","The United States and Britain will ""stand with those who struggle,"" Obama says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- As half of the famed hip-hop duo OutKast, Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton is known for his bass-booming, chart-topping smash hits. His recording studio in Atlanta is lined with plush velvet, stocked with Courvoisier and has a swing hanging from the ceiling -- a place to settle in and do his work. Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton will be performing live with the Atlanta Ballet beginning Thursday. As a choreographer for the Atlanta Ballet and a dancer for years, Lauri Stallings' world revolves around pirouettes, cou-de-pieds and battement tendus. The stage at Atlanta's Fox Theatre is her work home. His only experience with ballet was seeing the ""Nutcracker"" as a child. Her experience with hip-hop: ""None at all."" But the curtain will be rising Thursday in Atlanta -- a hip-hop mecca that is home to Jermaine Dupri, Ludacris, Young Jeezy and Lil Jon -- for the first of six performances of a collaboration between Big Boi and the Atlanta Ballet: a work called ""big.""  See Big Boi talk about the unconventional show » . On paper, Big Boi and Stallings couldn't be more different. But it is their two styles, from seemingly opposite ends of the artistic spectrum, that both say make the show so innovative. As bass boomed through the ornate, faux-Egyptian halls of the Fox Theatre as a ballet dancer was hoisted in the air, the point couldn't be any clearer.  See photos of dancers preparing for their ""big"" debut » . ""It's definitely one of the funkiest hybrids I've ever seen,"" Big Boi said. Big Boi's contemporary style may seem inherently different from the traditional and classical sounds that normally echo through an Atlanta Ballet performance. But, Stallings said, as a choreographer it's not a stretch to equate one of hip-hop's biggest names with some of the most venerated composers who are usually the backdrop for traditional ballets. ""For me [Big Boi's music] sounds like Shostakovich, Stravinsky a little ... just today's Stravinsky,"" Stallings said. ""Big"" came about almost matter-of-factly. In an interview at his studio, Big Boi -- whose unprepossessing size belies his energy -- said the Atlanta Ballet's artistic director, John McFall, approached him at a fundraising event and proposed a collaboration. Big Boi said he had a split-second of uncertainty about a ballet project, but was intrigued by the prospect and quickly immersed himself in the work. Stallings said the show is a dream marriage of artistic aesthetics that has been a long time coming -- and in this duality of differences, anything goes. Audience members will be pulled on stage. Dancers will weave their way through the audience. Big Boi and a live band will perform some of his greatest hip-hop collaborations. But the greatest collaborating may be the pairing created by Stallings and Big Boi when Giuseppe Verdi's ""La Traviata"" is intertwined with ""Morris Brown,"" a cut from OutKast's ""Idlewild"" soundtrack. Those contrasts -- ""physical but sublime, beautiful but ugly, loud but soft,"" in Stallings' words -- are exactly the feelings this fusion ballet is intended to evoke, both artists said.  Watch Stallings explain the fusion of hip-hop and ballet » . ""Its very moving, sophisticated, elegant but at the same time it will tear your back off,"" Big Boi said. Collaborations between ballet companies and pop artists are uncommon but not unheard of. The Joffrey Ballet performed a multimedia work with a rock score, ""Astarte,"" in 1967, an event so novel it made the cover of Time magazine. In recent years, ballets to the tunes of Prince, Elvis Costello and other artists have begun to pop up. The Joffrey opened the door for the ballet to use new techniques to reach those who may never have attended a ballet otherwise, said Christine Knoblauch-O'Neal, a professor of ballet and musical theater at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. ""Although it may seem off the traditional path, it's certainly in the realm of ballet collaborations,"" she said. ""I think it's always a wonderful moment when someone first experiences classical ballet within the context of their life ... and ['big'] seems like the ideal one to do that."" For some of the dancers of the Atlanta Ballet, the show is a chance to perform alongside one of their idols and deviate from their rigidly classical performances. ""A lot of the ballets in the past have been very structured and very classical,"" dancer Courtney Necessary said. ""I have a hard time even calling this a ballet -- it's mostly about movement and being very organic, and finding the beat in music and sometimes going against the beat. The stuff we are doing is nothing like what you would think of as classical ballet."" Big Boi hopes to hype the crowd by debuting his newest single, ""Sir Lucious Leftfoot Saves the Day,"" as the last song of the night. Stallings and Big Boi hope the show, which has received growing buzz in the ballet and hip-hop communities, will help bring together a hip-hop crowd that may not have ever chosen to go to a ballet and a classical crowd that might never have heard songs like ""Bombs Over Baghdad."" ""You [hope] to open up people's minds to different avenues that they might not think they can or cannot take,"" Big Boi said. ""Really the combinations are endless ... when you have creative minds and art forms coming together."" The joining of those forms is a risk Big Boi and Stallings hope will pay off and perhaps unleash a new wave of productions. ""We get to [take] a fresh look of the possibilities of tomorrow,"" Stallings said. ""You should leave with your senses so wide open that we're hoping that you experience your life a little different after it."" If ""big"" is successful, the show could tour, Big Boi said. But at the least, he said, he expects the audience to enjoy the work's energetic spirit. ""If you come in there with your tie on, you might have your bow tie leaning to one side when you leave,"" Big Boi said, ""because you're definitely going to move.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli military experts Sunday worked around the clock to examine the remains of a mysterious drone that was shot down after penetrating Israeli airspace from the Mediterranean Sea. The Israeli military announced Saturday that the unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down over the northern Negev Desert. They say the drone did not take off from Gaza, leading them to consider the possibility that it originated in Lebanon. Israeli security experts point the finger at Israel's longstanding rival Hezbollah, the Shiite militia based in southern Lebanon. ""We know it originated in Lebanon,"" said Ron Ben Yishai, an Israeli national security and defense commentator for Israeli news portal Ynet. ""It is entirely clear the UAV was sent by an Iranian proxy. The Iranians provided Hezbollah with their very first drones and they have also funded the organization."" Opinion: U.S. drone monopoly gone . While Israel has yet to officially announce who it sees as responsible for the penetration into its airspace, Lebanon's national news agency on Sunday reported that Israeli fighter jets have flown into Lebanese airspace, causing sonic booms in the area. Military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said Saturday that the drone did not carry any weapons or explosives. Leibovich would not discuss the drone's route or whether it had flown over military installations. If Hezbollah were responsible for the launch of the drone, flying it for more than 200 km (125 miles) down the Mediterranean and deep into Israel, that would represent a significant upgrade to its aerial capacities. But Ben Yishai said neither Hezbollah nor the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza have claimed responsibility for launching the drone. ""I can imagine they are quiet, concerned of the Israeli response to this operation, but it is not for me to say what Israel's reaction would be,"" he said. Iran, which supports Hezbollah, has had no comment. While the Israeli military has stated that the drone did not carry explosives, the objective of the flight was a mystery Sunday. ""The question is, what exactly did they look to achieve? Was it merely a demonstration of strength, or an operational mission for collecting intelligence?"" said Ben Yishai. One possible target for any of Israel's enemies is the secret nuclear plant at Dimona, in the Negev. Built with the help of the French government in the 1960s, the reactor stands several dozen miles from where the drone was shot down. Israel does not comment on whether it has nuclear weapons, but details leaked by a former technician at Dimona in the 1980s led international observers to conclude that it could have produced as many as 200 nuclear bombs. In December 2010, the Israeli military announced it had shot down an unidentified flying object over the nuclear plant. Ben Yishai said crashing a drone carrying explosives onto the plant would be considered a phenomenal achievement for Hezbollah, even though the aircraft can't carry a big enough bomb to inflict serious damage. Even photographs of the tightly guarded plant would be an intelligence prize, he said. The drone incident comes amid a tense international standoff over Iran's nuclear fuel program, which Israel fears is a cover for a nuclear weapons program. Iran has defied calls by the U.N. Security Council to halt its production of enriched uranium, insisting it has a right to make fuel for civilian power plants. But the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency says it can no longer verify that Iranian nuclear research is strictly peaceful. That's fueled talk of Israeli military action against Iran, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning the U.N. General Assembly in September that time for a diplomatic solution was running out. The United States, Israel's leading ally, says it won't tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran, but says diplomatic and economic sanctions are starting to take a deep bite out of Iran's economy. On Sunday, Leibovich, the Israeli military spokeswoman, said an Israeli warplane shot down the drone. Ben Yishai said small drones are difficult to spot on radar, and missiles aren't designed to hit such slow-moving targets. The decision to closely follow the drone for almost 30 minutes within Israeli airspace was a wise choice, Ben Yishai said. ""Having identified the drone flying over the Mediterranean, the Israeli air force could have chosen to shoot it down right away,"" he said. ""The ability to track the drone, take pictures of it from all directions and examine its capabilities serves as an outstanding resource for intelligence information.""

"(CNN) -- London Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis can crown a superb year by being named World Female Athlete of the Year for 2012. Ennis, the poster girl of the London Games, swept to victory in the grueling seven event discipline on the middle Saturday as hosts Britain enjoyed a gold rush. Her efforts and an earlier fine performance at the multi-events meeting in Gotzis, have seen the 26-year-old shortlisted for the top award by the IAAF. The world governing body has also nominated American sprinter Allyson Felix, who completed a superb 200m and 4x400m relay golden double in London. Shot putter Valerie Adams of New Zealand is the third athlete on the shortlist. 2008 Olympic champion Adams was awarded a second successive gold after Nadzeya Ostapchuk of the Belarus was stripped of the title following a failed drugs test. The men's shortlist, announced Monday, also has a star-studded parade of Olympic champions, led by Jamaica's Usain Bolt, who won three golds in London in the sprint events. He is joined by American hurdler Aries Merritt, the Olympic champion, who also smashed the world record during 2012. David Rudisha of Kenya, who set a new world record for the 800m on his way to London gold, completed the trio. The winners of both categories will be announced at the centenary gala dinner of the IAAF in Barcelona on November 24.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- ""My One and Only"" begins with Renee Zellweger, playing a woman based on George Hamilton's mother Anne, discovering her husband with another woman. Renee Zellweger plays a woman based on George Hamilton's mother in ""My One and Only."" Despite the initial heartbreak, Anne puts on a happy face, and Zellweger gives life to a character who's determined to make the rest of her years comfortable and adventurous. Her husband's indiscretion is the catalyst that sends Anne on a cross-country quest to find a new husband in 1953 America. She pulls her two sons out of school in New York City and the trio set off on an adventure by car. The tale has its roots in actor George Hamilton's young life. The film takes a look at gender roles of the time and how women were perceived. Much of the film gets colored in by the characters and their ever-present emotions (though Zellweger's fabulous frocks add plenty of color on their own). Zellweger, who won an Oscar for ""Cold Mountain,"" spoke with CNN about ""My One And Only,"" George Hamilton and the way she believes she is perceived.  Watch Zellweger talk about playing Hamilton's mother » . CNN: What do you think of George Hamilton as a person now, knowing what he went through in his youth? Renee Zellweger: I think it's so fascinating. It was probably my favorite part of this experience, discovering that this was actually his life story. I mean, who knew? You have an idea about who a person is based on their public persona and the work that they've done. He's a spectacular actor, and his collection of parts that he's played and work that he's done is unbelievable. ... But to get to know him, he's so interesting. He's so clever, and he's very kind. Very kind. CNN: You're playing Hamilton's mother. Did he fill you in on what she was like? Zellweger: No. You know, that's what's so interesting about it. [Despite] being such a personal ... project that he worked on so closely with Merv Griffin for over a decade ... he didn't. He had great faith and he just kind of let us go, which was sort of unbelievable when you look back on it. It was really clear to me from what was on the page who she was. CNN: Did you like her? Zellweger: Very much. She's kind of doing the best she can, and she thought, oh everything's kind of a lark ... and things work out without your having to put your hands on it and make it happen. But she learns a different way and a more satisfying way to be involved in her own life, which is wonderful. So she sort of discovered that she could and gave herself permission to be in charge of herself. It was kind of a wonderful journey to watch. CNN: She was judged on her looks many times in the film. Have you faced similar situations, being judged on your looks and people not taking you seriously? Zellweger: Not in such an overt way. I'm not an actress who made her way based on physicality -- I think quite the opposite, in fact. I sort of disappear a little bit, with respect to my looks. I'm lucky. I'm not a standout, kind of knockout kind of girl that, you know, it's all about my great hair or something. But, in subtle ways, maybe. I mean, people presume to know you for something and respond to you accordingly, I'm sure. CNN: How was it stepping into the era of old Hollywood? Did you enjoy wearing the clothes from the early '50s? Zellweger: I loved it. I loved it. I had such a great time with it, and I brought a lot of my own things, actually. Things that have been given to me, things that I just would find while I'm traveling on the road but have no opportunity to wear. You know, junk store finds that I think are spectacular. We brought them in, spruced them up and made them costumes. It was really exciting; it was fun. CNN: Do you think you would have liked to work in that era? Zellweger: Oh, yes and no. Yes because the glamour of it all or the -- it feels like play to me. It's like playing dress-up all the time. And no because of the responsibility of having to maintain that immaculate presentation all the time would be exhausting. I think back on Marilyn Monroe putting those lashes on everyday, and I can't imagine, as I tie up my sneakers to go for a run. I cannot imagine that you're supposed to simultaneously look beautiful while you're going out to buy groceries. I just don't know that it would fit well with my personality. I don't know that I would succeed (laughs).","Renee Zellweger plays character based on George Hamilton's mother in new film .

"Two of the off-season's longest-running transfer sagas were finally concluded when French international Samir Nasri signed for Manchester City, while winger Juan Mata agreed to leave Valencia for Chelsea. Nasri -- who signed for Arsenal in 2008 from Olympique Marseille -- signed a four-year deal, making him City's fourth big-money capture of the current transfer window following the arrivals of Gael Clichy, Sergio Aguero and Stefan Savic. ""I think he is a fantastic player because he has technique [and a good] mentality,"" Manchester City coach Roberto Mancini told the club's official web site. ""I know him from when he played for Marseille because I followed him when I was at Inter...but in the last four years in the Premier League he improved a lot and now I think he's a top player."" The move took place a few hours before an injury-hit Arsenal met Udinese in a crucial European Champions League second leg qualification match. The Gunners take a slender 1-0 lead to Italy. If Nasri had played he would have been ineligible to appear in Manchester City's own Champions League campaign, potentially jeopardizing the move. ""It's a big relief. It was a long, long negotiation,"" Nasri said in an interview, also with the club's official web site. ""Now I am City player which is what I wanted from the start."" ""I was a little frustrated, I told the [Arsenal] manager [Arsene Wenger] I wanted to leave... Today is a big day for me. It is a new start."" In west London, Chelsea announced that they too had signed one of Europe's most coveted wide players with the capture of Spanish international Juan Mata. The 23 year old -- who has already won 11 caps for the world champions -- trained with the squad and will be available for Saturday's English Premier League match against Norwich City.

"(CNN) -- Four soldiers may face a court-martial and charges of negligent homicide in the case of an Army private who apparently committed suicide in Afghanistan, U.S. Army officials said Tuesday. The case stems from the death of Pvt. Danny Chen, 19, whose body was found in October 2011 in a guard tower in Afghanistan. An Article 32 hearing was held this week to determine whether the four soldiers will face a court-martial. After testimony Monday, Army investigators recommended that the soldiers' charges be forwarded to a court-martial and the brigade commander will make the final determination if the case will continue, the Army said. An Army official has said the soldiers are accused of hazing and abusing Chen in the weeks before he died. Chen's family members also have said the young soldier was harassed by soldiers before he died. The Chen family told The New York Times in October that officials said Chen had suffered physical abuse and ethnic slurs by superiors, including an incident in which he was dragged out of bed and across the floor for failing to turn off a water heater after showering. At a vigil for Chen last year, his brother Banny Chen, read from a letter the soldier had sent to his family. ""They ask if I'm from China a few times a day. They also called out my name, 'Chen,' in a goat-like voice sometimes for no reason. No idea how it started, but it's just best to ignore it."" The soldiers were identified as Staff Sgt. Andrew J. Van Bockel, Sgt. Adam M. Holcomb, Sgt. Jeffrey T. Hurst and Spc. Thomas P. Curtis. Along with negligent homicide, all four face dereliction of duty, maltreatment, reckless endangerment, among other charges. In all, eight soldiers are facing charges related to Chen's death. One of the soldiers, Sgt. Travis Carden, will face a court-martial in April, an Army spokesman said. In a similar case last year, three Marines were charged with beating and hazing a fellow Marine, Lance Cpl. Harry Lew, after Lew fell asleep on watch duty. The Marine was beaten and forced to do exercises and dig a hole until the early morning. When the punishment was over, he climbed into the hole he had just dug and shot himself to death, said Rep. Judy Chu of California, Lew's aunt. One Marine has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and a reduction in rank and two others face a court-martial in that case.

"Paris (CNN) -- Former French justice minister Rachida Dati is launching a paternity suit Tuesday against a French businessman she claims is the father of her daughter, an attorney for the businessman confirmed. In the case filed at a Versailles court, Dati formally identifies Dominique Desseigne as the biological father of Zohra, who was born in 2009. But the 68-year-old president of the Lucien BarriÃ¨re casino group, which owns the luxurious Le Fouquet's hotel, refuses to take a paternity test to confirm or exclude him as the father, and alleges that he was not Dati's only lover in the year her daughter was conceived. Dati, 46, served as justice minister in former President Nicolas Sarkozy's government from 2007-2009. She is now a deputy of the European Parliament and mayor of Paris' posh 7th arrondissement. In a weekend interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Desseigne's lawyer, MichÃ¨le Cahen, alleges that Dati had up to eight lovers in the year Zohra was conceived. Cahen confirmed his comments to CNN Monday. The list allegedly includes Sarkozy's brother, a Qatari attorney-general, a television broadcaster and a former Spanish prime minister. ""I will not give in to this because I behaved correctly and I have nothing to be reproached for,"" the newspaper quoted Desseigne as telling friends, referring to his right to refuse a paternity test. Dati's attorneys did not immediately return calls for comment from CNN. Her pregnancy in 2008 was shrouded in deep mystery after she refused to reveal the father's identity, with whom she did not pursue a relationship. Last month, a French newspaper revealed that Dati would file a paternity case against Desseigne. In Le Monde's article, a friend of Desseigne explained that the businessman did not want a child with Dati and broke off the relationship in 2008, after which Dati allegedly sent him threatening letters and demanded money from him.

"London (CNN) -- An advertisement for Marc Jacobs perfume featuring teenage actor Dakota Fanning has been banned in Britain because it ""sexualized children."" The ad, for Marc Jacobs ""Oh, Lola!"" fragrance, featured Fanning, the child star of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""I am Sam"" wearing a short dress and holding an oversized bottle of the scent in her lap. Four readers complained that the photograph -- which appeared in two British magazines in August -- was ""offensive and irresponsible,"" for showing Fanning, 17, ""in a sexualized manner."" Britain's advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) agreed with the complaints, and has banned the picture from use in the UK. Coty UK, the perfume's manufacturer insisted that the ad ""did not show any private parts or sexual activity"" and said it was ""provoking, but not indecent."" But the ASA ruled that Fanning ""was holding up the perfume bottle... in her lap between her legs and we considered that its position was sexually provocative."" In a statement, it said that while it accepted that Fanning was 17, ""we considered she looked under the age of 16,"" and that her outfit and pose ""drew attention to her sexuality."" ""Because of that... we considered the ad could be seen to sexualize a child. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offense."" It is not the first time the ASA has banned advertisements featuring Hollywood stars -- in July, the watchdog ruled against a make-up ad starring Julia Roberts, on the grounds it had been airbrushed too heavily.","Ad for Marc Jacobs ""Oh, Lola!"" perfume banned in Britain .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia woman convicted on misdemeanor charges in the death of her son after he darted out into traffic will receive a new trial, a judge ruled. Raquel Nelson's trial is set to begin October 25, according to an order filed by Cobb County State Court Judge Kathryn Tanksley on Tuesday. Nelson's case had attracted national attention from parents, the NAACP and transportation advocates, who said Nelson, from the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, was being unfairly prosecuted because she chose to cross the road at the bus stop across from her apartment instead of traveling to the nearest crosswalk, three-tenths of a mile away. In April 2010, Nelson and her three children had just gotten off the bus across from their apartment building when her 4-year-old son, A.J., broke away from her and ran into the street. A car struck the boy, causing fatal injuries. Nelson and one of her two daughters also suffered minor injuries. Five weeks after the accident, investigators came to Nelson's home, said her aunt, Loretta Williams. Nelson was charged with three misdemeanors: second-degree vehicular homicide, failing to cross at a crosswalk and reckless conduct, according to court records. A jury convicted her this month. Although prosecutors did not recommend jail time, each count carried a potential sentence of one year in jail -- for a total of 36 months. She potentially faced more jail time than the man driving the car, Jerry Guy. Guy fled the scene after the accident but later admitted being involved, according to CNN affiliate WXIA-TV. He was sentenced to five years in prison but served only six months. He is serving the remainder of the sentence on probation. Nelson on Tuesday was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service, but Tanksley also gave her the option to seek a new trial. During the hearing Tuesday, Nelson's attorney, David Savoy, asked for mercy, saying his client had suffered enough. ""Don't think for one moment that this mother of three doesn't blame herself for what happened,"" he said. But, he said, the white stripes of a crosswalk are not ""impenetrable walls of steel"" that could have prevented a driver from striking someone crossing the street. Such accidents happen every day, he said. Assistant Solicitor General Jessica Moss said her office would accept whatever sentence the court suggested. ""These cases are inherently difficult because they are unintentional,"" she said during the hearing. ""I'm walking out of here,"" Nelson told reporters after her sentencing Tuesday. ""I don't think you could be more satisfied."" Nelson told NBC's ""Today"" on Monday that the jurors who convicted her probably couldn't relate to her because she is a single mother and they don't regularly use public transportation or need to walk on busy streets. Many members of the public, however, supported her. ""Your office's decision to prosecute Raquel Nelson for the death of her 4-year-old son on a vehicular homicide charge is disgusting and inhumane,"" one poster wrote on the Facebook page of the Cobb County Solicitor General's Office, which handled the case. More than 135,000 people signed an online petition calling for leniency. The NAACP had called the case against Nelson a ""grave miscarriage of justice when the mother who is still grieving is forced to fight harder for her freedom than the man who killed her son."" The case also attracted attention from transportation advocates, who said Nelson was treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads. ""Because she did as her fellow bus riders, who crossed at the same time and same place, and because she did what pedestrians will do every time -- take the shortest reasonable path -- she is guilty of vehicular homicide,"" Transportation for America communications director David Goldberg wrote on the advocacy organization's blog. CNN's Tristan Smith and In Session's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","Raquel Nelson's trial is set for October 25 .

"(CNN) -- Sakineh Mohammadie Ashtiani, a mother of two, is waiting to die in Iran by a method of execution described by her lawyer as ""barbaric"" -- stoning. She will be buried up to her chest, deeper than a man would be, and the stones that will be hurled at her will be large enough to cause pain but not so large as to kill her immediately, according to an Amnesty International report that cited the Iranian penal code. The 42-year-old woman from the northern city of Tabriz was convicted of adultery in 2006, and her execution is imminent, said prominent human rights lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei. Ashtiani was forced to confess after being subjected to 99 lashes, Mostafaei said Thursday in a telephone interview from Tehran. She later retracted that confession and has denied wrongdoing. Her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges, Mostafaei said. She has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency. Iran's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007. Mostafaei believes a language barrier prevented his client from fully comprehending court proceedings. Ashtiani is of Azerbaijani descent and speaks Turkish, not Farsi. The circumstances of Ashtiani's case make it not an exception but the rule in Iran, according to Amnesty International, which tracks death penalty cases around the world. ""The majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women, who suffer disproportionately from such punishment,"" the human rights group said in a 2008 report. On Wednesday, Amnesty made a new call to the Iranian government to immediately halt all executions and commute all death sentences. The group has recorded 126 executions in Iran from the start of this year to June 6. ""The organization is also urging the authorities to review and repeal death penalty laws, to disclose full details of all death sentences and executions and to join the growing international trend towards abolition,"" the statement said. In Washington, the State Department criticized the scheduled stoning, saying it raised serious concerns about human rights violations by the Iranian government. ""We have grave concerns that the punishment does not fit the alleged crime, "" Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Thursday. ""For a modern society such as Iran, we think this raises significant human rights concerns."" Calling Iran's judicial system ""disproportionate"" in its treatment of women, Crowley said, ""From the United States' standpoint, we don't think putting women to death for adultery is an appropriate punishment."" Human rights activists have been pushing the Islamic government to abolish stoning, arguing that women are not treated equally before the law in Iran and are especially vulnerable in the judicial system. A woman's testimony is worth half that of a man. Article 74 of the Iranian penal code requires at least four witnesses -- four men or three men and two women -- for an adulterer to receive a stoning sentence, said Mina Ahadi, coordinator for the International Committee Against Stoning. But there were no witnesses in Ashtiani's case. Often, said Ahadi, husbands turn wives in to get out of a marriage. Mostafaei said he could not understand how such a savage method of death could exist in the year 2010 or how an innocent woman could be taken from her son and daughter, who have written to the court pleading for their mother's life. The public won't be allowed to witness the stoning, Mostafaei said, for fear of condemnation of such a brutal method. He is hoping there won't be an execution. Mostafaei, who himself did jail time in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections in June 2009, said he realizes the risk of speaking out for Ashtiani, for fighting for human rights. But he doesn't let that deter him. He last saw Ashtiani five months ago behind bars in Tabriz. Since then, he said, he has been searching for a way to save her from the stones.

"(CNN) -- A riot at a Texas detention center was ended Sunday. One prison building was heavily damaged, and about 700 inmates were going to spend the night in tents, authorities said. The disturbance began Saturday at the Reeves County Detention Center near Pecos in west Texas, and hundreds of inmates continued rioting overnight in the second such incident at the facility in less than two months. April Orsoco with the Reeves County Sheriff's Office said the office was notified by the prison about 4 p.m. Sunday that ""they got it under control."" Orsoco did not have details on how the situation ended, but she said no injuries were reported as the incident ended. The office reported it had no explanation for the rioting. Three inmates were hospitalized Saturday after fighting began, one with a severed finger, according to the sheriff's office. In addition to prison personnel, sheriff's deputies and officers from several other agencies remained at the facility Sunday night. With one of three buildings at the detention center damaged extensively in the rioting, ""the warden is trying to figure out where [the prison] can house the inmates,"" Orsoco said. She said the tents were set up on prison grounds, and inmates would be transferred to other prison facilities on Monday so damage could be repaired. The prison is a 2,400-bed, low-security facility, operated by Geo Group Inc. It houses federal prisoners as well as inmates from other states. As many as 2,000 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the sheriff's office. The center is about 430 miles from Dallas, Texas. On December 12, inmates took two workers hostage and set fire to the recreation area. Those inmates surrendered later that night.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey is drawing up contingency plans with the NATO military alliance to fortify its border with Syria, and a Patriot missile deployment is one option on the table, Turkish officials say. Turkish President Abdullah Gul told reporters Thursday that due to the ongoing civil war in Syria and its possible repercussions for NATO-member Turkey, every measure was being considered to counter the risks. Discussions have been ongoing ""within NATO... in terms of defensive measures"" and many defensive scenarios are being looked at as a precaution, Gul said when asked whether Turkey was seeking to acquire Patriot missiles from NATO. Read more: Report: 33 Syrian army members defect to Turkey . International and Turkish media reported Wednesday that the government planned to ask NATO to station Patriot missiles along the border with Syria, but the prime minister denied the report. ""We have not made such a request. Let me be clear, we are not thinking about or in a position to buy Patriots at this time,"" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters during a visit to Bali Wednesday. He seemed angry about the media reports, insisting that the foreign ministry official said to be the source for the information had no right to make such a statement. Read more: Turkey strikes targets in Syria in retaliation for shelling deaths . Ankara has been careful to note that it does not plan to take offensive action and does not want a war with its southern neighbor, with which it shares a 822-kilometer (about 511-mile) border. ""It is out of the question that Turkey has any intention of going to war with Syria. I hope that it is also out of the question for Syria to engage in this kind of inconceivable action toward Turkey,"" said Gul. ""But when there are these types of last-minute developments, when these types of potential risks are present, undoubtedly all sorts of precautions are taken in these situations. One of these precautions is against ballistic missiles as well as mid-range and near-range missiles,"" he added. The U.S.-made Patriot missile system -- which became well-known during the first Gulf War, when it was used to protect American allies against Iraqi Scud missiles -- works well against short- and medium-range missiles. Read more: Turkey deploys troops, tanks to Syrian border . Two decades later, reports about the possible deployment of Patriots have emerged as tensions steadily escalate between two other Middle Eastern neighbors. Schools were closed in the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar Thursday as intense fighting raged in the area between loyalist Syrian forces and fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army. ""We can hear the sounds of fighting. The town is very quiet today, not a lot of stores opened up,"" said Mehmet Saitavci, a neighborhood mayor from Ceylanpinar. ""People here have a lot of relatives on the other side and they are coming up to the border and the Turkish military takes them and brings them into Turkey. We were told we can have our relatives be our guests for a few days by the municipal mayor,"" said Saitavci, who also reported that two Turks were injured, but not seriously, due to stray gunfire. Last month, Syrian artillery shells hit the Turkish border town of Akcakale, killing five Turkish citizens. Soon after, the Turkish parliament approved a resolution that would allow the military to carry out cross-border incursions. Since that deadly incident, Turkish officials have confirmed more than a dozen cross-border artillery strikes believed to have been carried out by the Syrian military. In each case, Turkish forces retaliated swiftly against Syria using artillery. Last June, Syrian anti-aircraft defenses shot down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, killing two pilots, after it briefly crossed into Syrian airspace in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Today, Turkey is adamant that its airspace not be used to supply the military of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. An Armenian plane headed for Syria landed in the Turkish city of Erzurum for a ""technical inspection"" Thursday. Read more: Al-Assad: I wish the Turkish jet shootdown didn't happen . ""We are allowing the humanitarian aid to go in Syria. So it was agreed beforehand. They knew and agreed to land,"" a Turkish foreign ministry official wrote to CNN, on condition of anonymity. A similar flight was also asked to land in Turkey for inspection of its cargo last month. In that case, Armenian officials confirmed that the Turkish search was part of a scheduled stop. But just a few days before the Armenian flight was stopped, a Syrian passenger plane from Russia was forced to land, with Turkish F-16s escorting it to a runway in the Turkish capital. Turkish authorities announced they suspected the aircraft of carrying military equipment to Damascus. Turkish authorities later confiscated military equipment from a Russian arms manufacturer that was addressed to the Syrian defense ministry. Once cozy relations between Syria and Turkey have all but collapsed since the Syrian uprising began more than 19 months ago. Turkey is officially hosting more than 111,000 refugees, but the Turkish government says tens of thousands of unofficial refugees also live in Turkish cities and towns near the Syrian border. Meanwhile, Damascus has repeatedly accused its former ally of meddling in internal Syrian affairs by funding and arming the Syrian opposition, as well as providing sanctuary and medical care to Syrian rebels. Turkish, American and British diplomats are attending a Syrian opposition conference in Qatar this week, part of a U.S.-backed initiative to reorganize and restructure the fractured opposition movement.","Turkey's president says defensive measures are being discussed .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's Coptic Christians picked a new leader Sunday, a process that involved a blindfolded boy choosing one of three names in a crystal chalice. Bishop Tawadros Theodorus II -- the nation's 118th Coptic Pope -- replaces the former leader who died in March. The death of Pope Shenouda III sparked anxiety in the embattled minority group in Egypt's Muslim majority. Thousands of people flooded into a Cairo Cathedral in March to bid farewell to the 88-year-old pope who led the nation's Coptic Christians for about four decades. Egypt's Christian minority has been the target of attacks in recent years. The bombing of a major church in Alexandria in January 2011 killed 21 people and sparked worldwide condemnation. Christians are a small minority in Egypt, although the Coptic Orthodox Church is the largest Christian church in the Middle East, according the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Stevenage, England. Estimates vary on the percentage of Coptic Christians in Egypt. U.S. officials estimate a 9% Coptic Christian population, but the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, which released a report on the global Christian population last year, says it is closer to 5%. The leader of the Coptic Christian community since 1971, Shenouda died of renal failure caused by diabetes. He also had lung cancer, which spread to the rest of his body. In addition to millions of followers in Egypt, the Coptic church has adherents in Europe, Canada, the United States, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.","A blindfolded boy chooses the name of the next pope .

"(CNN) -- Stewart Copeland and Sting get along great. Really. Stewart Copeland's background includes a wide range of musical influences, many of which emerged in the Police. OK, the Police's drummer and bassist may have argued from time to time. Perhaps even ferociously. And Copeland finds Sting's attempts to be a drum arranger annoying. OK, maybe infuriating. But, as he writes in his new book, ""Strange Things Happen"" (HarperStudio), ""We have discovered that we can be good friends -- as long as no one mentions music."" Besides, Copeland adds in an interview, both Sting and guitarist Andy Summers ""are crap at drums.""  Watch Copeland dish on the band » . Copeland may be best known for the hitmaking musical trio, but he hasn't let the Police define him. The son of a CIA officer, he grew up in the Middle East and has let his musical fascinations range widely. He's written operas and dozens of film and television scores and is currently working on a concerto for the Dallas Symphony. (He also plays polo.) Copeland took some time to talk about his relationship with the Police, the importance of percussion and the social niceties of West L.A. private schools. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: The pace of the book makes it seem like you've been living ""A Hard Day's Night"" for the last 30 or 35 years. Is it really that busy? Stewart Copeland: Oh, it's pretty busy, but if it wasn't busy, I'd be stressed and anxious. In fact, this week I've got some down time, and I'm looking at the walls. CNN: It's been inescapable that people are focusing on the part of the book involving you and your fellow Police members. You say that you have a great relationship with Sting until music gets involved. Copeland: We get along in every way until it comes to music. ... [But] both of them are crap at drums, so at least I don't have that to deal with. CNN: So Sting is not much of a drummer, despite the fact that he has all these ideas. Copeland: Actually, he can play a bit of drums, but he's much better arranging drums than playing them. And I think I'd rather have him as a drummer than as an arranger of drums, even though he's quite brilliant at [arranging]. CNN: Has there always been that friction in the band? Copeland: Yes. With Andy, there's no friction at all; we get along great. ... And by the way, he's not the man in the middle, either. He's not a mediator. He's his own little volcano. He's a very sharp point to the triangle. But this conflict ... when we did the reunion tour, it was like everything was different, but nothing had changed. From the first 16 bars, we were straight back into where we left off. CNN: With the Police, the friction seems -- for lack of a better term -- healthy. Copeland: Well, it's that musical dichotomy that makes the band what it is. If we didn't have those beautiful, sensitive songs, we'd be lost. Those beautiful, sensitive songs have an extra kick to them because there's a madman in the group. CNN: Does the madman change, or is it always Sting? Copeland: Actually, all three of us have our moments. CNN: You grew up in the Middle East. Do you see any reflections of that in the way you play the drums, in the way you feel the beat? Copeland: Absolutely. I grew up surrounded by Arabic music. The central element of Arabic music is the baladi rhythm, which is just Arabic for ""country."" And it has that drop on the three-beat. And it has that use of negative space. And it also has the very ornate use of the 16th notes, which are very expressive in Arabic music. And I suppose those are all factors that show up in the Police. CNN: You mentioned in the book that you put aside the sticks for many years until [Primus'] Les Claypool got you back into it. Copeland: Yes. The Police experience in the studio was so horrendous that my two colleagues actually managed temporarily to convince me that I had no talent and I was a menace to music. And I was distracted by composing. ... I wanted to play with all of those toys, and needed to shake off the rhythm label. And I think I was successful in doing that, to the detriment of my drumming career. CNN: Was picking up the sticks again like riding a bike? Copeland: Absolutely. The rhythm is still there. The pulse is still strong. The persnickety bits -- the finesse -- that took awhile to come back. CNN: You mention getting together with all-star bands with others -- Gene Simmons, Stephen Stills -- at your son's school. Is that common in L.A.? Copeland: Well, in Los Angeles in the west side here, there are three or four schools where all the alpha types send their kids. Between the three schools, we have all of the glitterati. CNN: Do you still find yourself a fan in those situations, seeing musicians you admire? Copeland: Not really. I'll get completely filled with fan fervor in listening to the music, but I've just learned so many times that the person is not the music. ... And also at these schools, everything is extremely downplayed. All of these alpha wives of these luminaries -- and the female luminaries themselves -- all go down to Gap especially to buy their school clothes. No bling, Gap clothing. It's all extremely dressed down and un-ostentatious. CNN: Is there a favorite or least favorite Police song you do? Do you get so that you think, ""If I have to play 'Roxanne' one more time ... "" Copeland: No, I still enjoy playing ""Roxanne."" ... Some songs are more of a mountain to climb physically, [like] ""When the World Is Running Down."" Andy takes a guitar solo that is so stratospheric, climbs so high and has such power, I get carried away. By the time he's finished, I am done. And I realize that I've just burnt every calorie, and I've got another 45 minutes of set to play. CNN: People don't realize how physically demanding it is. Copeland: But the thing is, when you're doing it, you're hardly aware of it as well, because you're sustained by 80,000 people freaking out. ... I don't want to get all metaphysical here or nothin', but something definitely happens. You are definitely empowered by the power of that huge audience. ... It pumps you up.","Stewart Copeland writes about his life in new book, ""Strange Things Happen""

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race. A crowd protests the court ruling upholding Proposition 8 in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies have asked a federal judge to block California from enforcing the ban, known as Proposition 8. ""We are two lawyers from opposite ends of the political spectrum who have come together to support one of the most important issues of our time,"" Olson told reporters. The case ""is not about liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican. We're here in part to symbolize that,"" he added. Wednesday's lawsuit was filed on behalf of two same-sex couples who have been denied marriage licenses under Proposition 8. A federal judge in San Francisco has set a July 2 hearing on the matter.  Watch the next fight about marriage » . ""Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law,"" Boies said. ""There is no right more fundamental than the right to marry the person you love and to raise a family.""  Watch more on the same-sex marriage battle in California » . Olson was the lead attorney for George W. Bush in the 2000 Florida recount. Boies, meanwhile, was the top legal strategist for former Vice President Al Gore, that year's Democratic presidential nominee. California's Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the marriage ban Tuesday, but left intact about 18,000 same-sex marriages conducted before voters approved the ban in November. The court rejected arguments that the measure improperly amended the state constitution. In another echo of past political battles, one of those who argued in favor of Proposition 8 was Kenneth Starr -- the special prosecutor who led the Whitewater investigation that led to the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The lawsuit is backed by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a newly formed organization based in Los Angeles.  See iReporter photos of protests, celebrities » . But a coalition of groups that fought the ban in California courts -- including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and the Lambda Legal Foundation -- urged supporters Wednesday to turn their energy toward winning in the political arena rather than the courts. ""Pushing the federal government with multiple lawsuits before we have a critical mass of states recognizing same-sex relationships or suing in states where the courts aren't ready is likely to lead to bad rulings,"" the coalition said. ""Bad rulings will make it much more difficult for us to win marriage, and will certainly make it take much longer."" Opponents of the ban are already planning to put a new initiative on California ballots in 2010 to repeal it. But Jim Garlow, senior pastor of Skyline Wesleyan Church in San Diego, said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that polls show same-sex marriage advocates losing ground. ""Right now, Californians support traditional, natural marriage 49 percent compared to 43 percent for same-sex marriage,"" said Garlow, who supported Proposition 8. ""That's a reversal. It has just switched in recent months. As people get more familiar with the reality, the sanctity of marriage, how special marriage is, why a child should have a mom and dad, they shift to the traditional marriage view."" The suit filed by Boies and Olson cites heavyweight Supreme Court precedents such as Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that banned segregation in public schools, and Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 ruling that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage. It also cited Romer v.

"(CNN) -- By night the skyline of Batumi shines with illuminated buildings, showing a side of the Georgian city it wishes the whole world to see. But the bright lights it hopes will attract international tourists are quite different from what the town was not long ago. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the city was ""one of the darkest places in the world"", according to Georgia's president Mikhail Saakashvili. ""(It was) one of the worst run, run by a local warlord... with all these SUVs and people running around with Kalashnikovs and dark glasses,"" he said. Now, rather than gunshots, a frenzy of construction echoes through the city with new hotels and apartment blocks rising up among the low-rise, old buildings. Donald Trump is one of the latest high-profile investors to back the rejuvenation of the city with plans for a new Trump residential tower. Batumi is the focus of Georgia's effort to attract 4 million visitors to the country this year, almost as many as the country's entire population. Send in your pictures from Georgia . For now it is mostly visitors from the Caucasus region and Turkey, though Russian tourists are returning since Georgia scrapped their visa requirement last year. Gambling is legal, which provides another lure to potential tourists. ""They come here to combine leisure and their holiday with gambling. So lots of Turkish, lots of Chinese come here not only during the summer but also the winter to just have fun,"" said Maia Sidamonidze, chairwoman of Georgia's Department of Tourism, who added she would like the city to aim high and become a Las Vegas of the Caucasus. Many residents in Batumi are thrilled at the new lease of life their city is getting and the new jobs the investment is bringing. But some of the city's older generation worry that the changes taking place in the city are not going to be for their benefit. ""The future and present of this country is for young people who studied, who know English; everything is for them"" said Nodar Khinigadze, who has been unable to find employment since losing his job in shipping years ago. ""It is good that they have jobs but for people like me who trained during Soviet times, it is hard to find our place.""

However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports.","Batumi is Georgian city on coast of the Black Sea .

"(EW.com) -- There were several jaw-dropping plot twists on the most recent season of ""Mad Men,"" but the one that arguably left fans dangling the most was the exit of Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) from Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Every other character on the show who has left Don Draper's ad agency has either never been heard from again, or revisited in a one-off episode and then rarely to never heard from again. Peggy, by contrast, had been such an integral part of the show's exploration of the 1960s that the thought of completely losing her â€” and the Emmy-nominated Moss â€” had some fans in a wee bit of a snit. (Of course, Moss' appearance in the final moments of the season finale certainly suggested that Peggy's story was not complete, but why let that get in the way of wild speculation?) Well, worry no more! In an interview with TV Line, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner makes clear that Peggy, and Moss, still have a future on the series. ""When people leave Sterling Cooper, sometimes it is the end for [the character],"" Weiner said. ""But I will spoil that one tiny piece of anticipation and tell people that Elisabeth will be showing up to work."" Weiner wasn't kidding, though, when he said he'd only spoil a tiny bit. He declined to illuminate how much Moss will be appearing in the show's sixth season, let alone in what capacity she would be on the show. (He was clear, though, that the show will have a sixth and seventh season.) So for now, we'll just have to let our own fertile imaginations conjure up where Peggy's upward mobility could take her.

"(CNN) -- Forget the extreme environmental campaigns involving chaining oneself to an oil refinery or egging local politicians. The next big thing of environmental campaigning? Aesthetics. A group of 20 artists decided to step away from slogans and campaigns and unveiled a sculpture exhibition designed to make suggestions, rather than demands. Called ""Pertaining to Things Natural"" the show at London's Chelsea Physic Garden puts together art pieces that respond to the environment and the current ecological debates. Cathy Ward and Eric Wright are among the artists involved in the show. Their sculpture ""Skyfield"" addresses the issue of sustainability. ""As populations expand, pressure increases to produce more food on the limited and shrinking land that is available for cultivation,"" Ward explains. ""Scientific advances in the genetics of plants as well as increased knowledge on the effects of diet on health are opening new and vital debates on our future,"" she says. Her bright pink, double deck structure might not convey that message straight away, but a closer look shows that the sculpture could be used as a corn grower, suggesting a solution to the lack of cultivated land. James P. Graham's ""Golden Cage"" is one of those more metaphoric pieces. The cage-like structure of volcanic rocks wrapped in gold wire symbolizes man's ""attempts to imprison and control nature,"" a much discussed theme within the environmental debate. The connection between art and environment is not a new one. From the pioneer Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who designed underground highways lined by trees and rooftop gardens, to sculptures made of recycled materials, creative souls have long tried to send out the environmental message. But this latest addition to the dialog between art and environment carries more subtle message. Sculptor Michael Shaw installed large inflatable balloons on trees. ""There is no 'Greenpeace message' in the piece,"" he says. ""But it relates to environment, it is responsive to it. Where the sculpture is depends on the wind."" The curator of the show, David Worthington, says this is the way art can add to the environmental debate -- even without straightforward messages. ""We can affect people's consciousness about environment on intellectual level, through campaigns and information,"" he says and points out environmental groups around the world. ""But we can also do it on emotional level through art and creativity,"" he says. ""The emotional level is more powerful.""","Sculpture show aims to make people engage with nature .
Curator David Worthington says art is capable of changing people's habits .

"(Departures) -- The English countryside -- still green, still rolling, still packed with charming eccentrics -- is more appealing than ever these days, as overwhelmed urbanites are flooding the area in search of a rural idyll. It's been more than 100 years since Oscar Wilde wrote, ""Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there."" These days, all irony aside, quite the opposite is true. The shires are far from unsophisticated, even if one still must trade Louboutins for Wellingtons when taking those long country walks. The best new additions to the area -- like the ones assembled here -- respect their past, no matter how thoroughly modern they might be. From the dells of Devon to the wooded countryside of Hampshire, from charming Cotswold villages to the Brontës' wild northern moors, the evidence is manifold. Crumbling estates have been restored into plush, contemporary hotels. And more are still to come: The Nina Campbell-designed Ellenborough Park debuts near Cheltenham in May, and a year from now, ex-Skibo Castle hand Charles Oak will open Heckfield Place in Hampshire. Such is the mood afoot in England, with old-fashioned pubs serving inventive cuisine and upscale stores and spas catering to a cosmopolitan crowd. Today, Wilde be damned, the English countryside is very tempting indeed. Departures: What $500 buys in Austin . 1. In Full Bloom: Barnsley House Barnsley, Gloucestershire . By the end of last year, the modern London design house Fox Linton Associates had left its mark not only on Coworth Park but also on the redo of this 18-bedroom property in the Cotswolds. Before becoming a hotel in 2003, the house was the longtime residence of garden designer Rosemary Verey, who filled the 11-acre grounds with purple alliums and weeping cherry trees; now the hotel's bold interiors have been redone to better reflect Verey's aesthetic. Garden-inspired furniture and soft creams and whites play off honeyed stone, and the spa pays further homage to Verey with treatments that highlight the rejuvenating power of plants. The nearby Village Pub, from the same owners, consistently delivers a cozy atmosphere and very good seasonal food, such as Dorset crab, ham hock salad or a bowl of clams and mussels with Cotswold cider, parsley and cream. Rooms start at $435. At Rte. B4425; 44-12/8574-0000; barnsleyhouse.com. Departures: World's best golf destinations . 2. A New Tradition: Lime Wood Lyndhurst, Hampshire . Hampshire County is among the most desirable regions for wealthy Londoners seeking weekend retreats, and there have long been good hotels here. Now inns like The Master Builder's at Buckler's Hard (themasterbuilders.co.uk) offer some of the area's top accommodations for less than $250 (choice rooms are in the 18th-century main building). But the big news is Lime Wood, a 29-room spot in the middle of the old-growth New Forest that combines luxe design with seamless service. The interiors are by David Collins -- known for doing the bars at several chic London hotels, including Claridge's -- with sun-soaked ash rooms and an eclectic mix of antique and bespoke furniture. The 22,000-square-foot organic spa, which opened this winter, is the best of its size outside London. Rooms start at $385. At Beaulieu Rd.; 44-23/8028-7177; limewoodhotel.co.uk. Departures: Best spas for 2011 . 3. Pastoral Paradise: Hay Barn Spa Daylesford, Gloucestershire . On her 1,500-acre Cotswolds estate, designer Carole Bamford (the force behind the popular Bamford clothing lines) has created Daylesford Organic, a rural oasis dedicated to organic farming. Beginning in 2003 with an upscale food market selling products cultivated on-site, Daylesford now has a café, a cooking school and a clothing store, and it's become a destination for a certain London sort (Kate Moss, Liz Hurley, Kate Winslet) who makes the 90-minute drive from the city or has a country home nearby. The real delight, though, is Hay Barn, a tiny day spa and yoga studio with an ecoconscious sensibility: Wool from Daylesford's sheep insulates the spa's sustainable wood walls, and therapies feature organic, chemical-free products, many from the Bamford Body line. Treatments start at $80. At Rte. A436; daylesfordorganic.com. Bottled Britain . Carole Bamford's five-year-old Bamford Body line of organic products is now available in the States at Barneys New York. Packaged in recyclable materials, the collection uses natural ingredients like rosemary, chamomile and eucalyptus. From $15. 4. Polo Grounds: Coworth Park Ascot, Berkshire . This restored 18th-century Georgian manor, the latest property from the Dorchester Collection, opened in the fall on 240 acres, only 15 minutes from Heathrow and within walking distance of Windsor Great Park, home of the prestigious Guards Polo Club. But there's no need to leave the property to play the sport of kings: Coworth Park is the only hotel in the United Kingdom that has its own polo fields (built in the mid-1980s by former resident, Selfridges owner Galen Weston). Coworth guests can ride the grounds themselves and watch professional matches from April through September. There's also a spa (the Dr. Alkaitis-brand facials use 100 percent edible ingredients) and three restaurants from Michelin-starred chef John Campbell. Rooms start at $375. At Blacknest Rd.; 44-13/4487-6600; coworthpark.com. 5. A Chef Comes Home: Hix Oyster and Fish House Lyme Regis, Dorset . The Jurassic Coast, three hours from London in western Dorset, is home to some of England's finest ingredients: hedgerow berries, common nettles, lamb, cod, Dover sole. So it comes as little surprise that the area is increasingly attracting British gastronomes, like London-based, Dorset-born chef Mark Hix, who opened this 45-seat spot in 2008. Perched above the horseshoe-shaped harbor, the restaurant has drawn a discriminating crowd, and Hix also hosts cooking demonstrations and supper clubs led by well-known writers, artists and chefs. The balcony is delightful at lunch, especially for Portland Royal oysters served with a glass of Sancerre. Dinner starts at $50. At Cobb Rd.; 44-12/9744-6910; hixoysterandfishhouse.co.uk. Departures: Spring's hottest gadgets . 6. Under the Big Top: Giffords Circus Cirencester, Gloucestershire . The brainchild of Nell Gifford -- who often gets in on the act herself -- this fairy tale re-creation of a traditional 1930s touring circus (dancing horses, twirling acrobats) first took grip of the country's imagination in May 2000 at the Hay-on-Wye literary festival. With just 360 spectators, the performances have a magical intimacy, the storytelling appealing to adults and children alike, and after evening shows, guests are invited to dine with the cast in a fairy light-strewn tent. Debuting in May, the 2011 show, War and Peace at the Circus, will feature scenes inspired by Tolstoy's epic novel. Adults, $35; children, $20. 44-84/5459-7469; giffordscircus.com. 7. Secret Gardens: Amberley Castle Amberley, West Sussex . The British love of garden follies -- fountains, aviaries, pavilions -- has had a resurgence in recent years as a spate of fanciful creations have emerged across the country. The most ambitious is Butterfly World, a $40 million development conceived by British lepidopterist Clive Farrell, which will be the world's largest indoor butterfly house when it's completed in Hertfordshire next year. On a much smaller scale, there's Amberley Castle's Mistletoe Lodge, a private dining space for just two. Perched in the branches of an enormous poplar tree in a quiet corner of the property, the thatched-roof treehouse offers an intimate spot to enjoy dishes like rare roast beef with truffles and vegetables. Rooms start at $365; dinner, $635. At Rte. B2139; 44-17/9883-1992; amberleycastle.co.uk. English Eats Thyme at Southrop is more than an excellent new cooking school. This historic Cotswolds estate now includes four pretty cottages to rent and an exceptional gastropub, The Swan. Courses start at $75; cottages, from $285; thymeatsouthrop.co.uk. 8. Parties by Design: Sophie Conran for Temple Guiting Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire . As the daughter of design guru Terence Conran (of the eponymous shops), Sophie Conran grew up surrounded by some of the world's most creative minds. Now she's opened up her Rolodex, curating country house parties in a converted barn at a 15th-century stone manor in the Cotswolds. Conran tailors each retreat to guests' requests, then calls on her expert friends to deliver the experience: French cooking classes with Michelin-starred chef Eric Chavot, say, or millinery workshops with Rachel Trevor-Morgan, who has created headpieces for the Queen. Conran also redesigned the barn at Temple Guiting to create five unique guest suites. Rooms start at $375. At Rte. B4077; 44-20/7706-1309; sophieconrantg.com. Establishment accepts no charge/credit cards or accepts cards other than the American Express Card. 9. Back to the Beach: The Cary Arms Babbacombe Beach, Devon . The thriving British beach holiday of the 19th century waned over the years as travel to other European seaside resorts became more alluring. But the UK coast is back with this 1920s seaside inn that's been redone by its new owners, Lana and Peter de Savary. The de Savarys clearly know luxury -- Peter reconceived Scotland's Skibo Castle as a lavish members-only club -- and they've injected some panache to the modest inn. The eight rooms and three converted fisherman's cottages have a crisp New England feel, and most overlook Babbacombe Bay, where dramatic red cliffs meet a dolphin-dotted sea. Rooms start at $240. At Beach Rd.; 44-18/0332-7110; caryarms.co.uk. 10. Pub Hub: The Devonshire Arms at Pilsley Pilsley, Derbyshire . It's no secret that the English pub, once a place of beer and cigarettes, has grown increasingly posh over the years, with so-called gastropub cuisine even winning Michelin stars. In July the Duchess of Devonshire entered the ring with her revamp of this seven-bedroom village pub, close to the well-known family manse, Chatsworth House. With duck's-egg-blue, apple-green and raspberry-pink interiors, the inn has a fresh English aesthetic matched by simple, locally sourced food, not least of all slow-cooked corned-beef hash with fried eggs and treacle tarts -- classic English pastries. Rooms start at $140; dinner, $30. At Rte. A619; 44-12/4658-3258; devonshirepilsley.co.uk. © 2010 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"New York (CNN) -- John Orozco won his first medal in gymnastics when he was 9. But he didn't hold onto that medal for long, giving it to another boy in the competition who was in tears after being teased for a bad performance. ""He walked over to the kid that they were making fun of, and he said, 'Here you go,' and he took his medal off and put it around the kid and said, 'One day you'll be better than I am. Don't cry,' "" says his mother, Damaris Orozco, who still gets choked up recalling that gesture. ""That's John. That's what he does. It's who he is."" That same Puerto Rican boy from the Bronx is now 19 and has made it all the way to the London Olympics. His heart is set on winning a gold medal -- this one for his country. He may be the best hope for a U.S. gold medal in gymnastics in 2012. Damaris Orozco says that she and her husband, William, are thrilled but not surprised their son made the Olympic team. ""When that little boy told us when he was 10 years old, 'I want to go to 2012,' we believed him."" John Orozco started down the path to the Olympics when he was 7. His father, who was a sanitation worker, saw a flier offering free gymnastics classes and signed him up. Orozco has never looked back. ""The minute I stepped foot in the gym I just loved it. I knew it was what I wanted to do for a long time,"" Orozco says. His Olympic dream was inspired by the Hamm brothers at the 2004 Olympics. By the time he was 14, he was fully committed to getting to the Games. ""I said I really want to have that one day -- to put the gold medal around my neck, waving to the crowd, knowing that all my hard work has paid off and my dream has come true,"" he said. Gymnastics wasn't a popular pursuit for a kid from the Bronx, and he hasn't forgotten the ridicule from schoolmates teasing him for ""leaping around in ladies' tights."" ""They just didn't understand everything that went into gymnastics. All the work, all the hours, all the blood, sweat and tears."" Besides, he jokes, ""Look at me. I'm 5-foot-5, 5-foot-4. Can you imagine me being a basketball player?"" To get the level of coaching her son required, his mother drove him to and from a gym in Chappaqua, New York, an hour away, often twice a day. By 9, he was training four hours daily five and often six days a week. ""When he needed it, we'd give him a day off, but he usually didn't want to take a day off,"" his former coach Carl Schrade says. Schrade often trained Orozco for free since there wasn't money to pay for coaching. ""With a gymnast like that, you don't think twice about it,"" Schrade says. Schrade started having big dreams for Orozco by the time the boy was 10. It's rare to find the perfect balance of strength and grace in a boy, Schrade says, but on top of all that, you need discipline and drive, and he says Orozco had both. ""People ask me if he's a once in a lifetime gymnast, and I joke around and say he's a once in a hundred lifetimes gymnast,"" Schrade says. Vitaly Marinitch, his coach at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado where he has been training for more than a year, says Orozco's combination of talent, ""cat-like"" moves and hard work make him a contender for a medal in London. ""We're aiming for gold. We'll see what happens,"" Marinitch says. Orozco says he's feeling no pressure as he faces the biggest athletic stage of his life. ""I kind of feel like there's more pressure at the Olympic trials to make the team, and now it's kind of like, it's a sigh of relief. Now I can just go and do my gymnastics and have fun,"" he says. To his mother, he's already won the gold. ""The person that he is, the heart that he has, the dreams that he has, he's a gold winner already so anything on top of that is just gravy,"" she says.","Gymnastics wasn't a popular pursuit for a kid from the Bronx .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives in my former homeland of Laos. This is the first visit by any U.S. secretary of state since 1955 and a trip I didn't think would happen in my lifetime. After all, the U.S.-backed war in Laos left the U.S. and the new government of Laos in tense relations for decades. Beyond the diplomatic significance of this trip, the visit can help to heal the wounds of war, bringing hope for many Americans of Lao descent, like myself, that we no longer have to choose between our former and new homelands. The visit offers an opportunity to help advance a complex relationship and address one of the remaining war legacies. Between 1964 and 1973, during the Vietnam War, the U.S. dropped the equivalent of one planeload of bombs every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, on a country the size of Minnesota. One ton of bombs was dropped for every person in Laos at the time, making the nation the most heavily bombed per capita in history. The ""Secret War,"" not formally authorized by Congress and in violation of international accords, sought to halt Communist ground incursions from North Vietnam and to cut off activities along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. I grew up not knowing much about this history -- it wasn't taught in school -- and what little I knew, I pieced together from my parents, who avoided extensive conversations about the past. The bombing ended in 1973, the same year I was born in the capital city of Vientiane. The new government came into power shortly after, and by the time I was 6, my family left Laos due to the country's growing instability. The decision to leave their homeland was difficult for my parents, but it was guided by the promise that their young children would one day live the American dream of bountiful opportunities and lasting freedom. Our harrowing journey began with the separation of our family members and a secretive swim by my father across the Mekong River to a refugee camp in Thailand, and eventually led us to northern Virginia, where I started my new life. Over the next 20 years, I set about becoming American, all the while mourning for a homeland I feared I would never see again. Laos clamped down its borders after 1975, and relations between the U.S. and Laos, while not severed, were tense. When they eventually thawed, I took the opportunity to travel. In 2004, I made my first trip back to Laos, and felt a deep affection for the people, culture and land that I barely remembered from my childhood. Reconnecting with my Lao heritage included discovering the dark history and lingering effects of that Secret War -- of which I and the majority of Americans knew little. I discovered that the past is still very present. In the 40 years since the bombing ceased, 20,000 people have been killed or maimed by unexploded ordnance, with an estimated one-third of Lao land still littered with it. In subsequent trips, I witnessed the devastating effects of these leftover bombs on the local population: They hinder economic growth and force thousands of people to go about their daily lives in fear of deadly explosions. I met children in the countryside, many of whom were just 6 or 7 years old -- the same age I was when my family left the for the U.S. -- who were maimed by playing or tampering with the small, toylike cluster bombs. These children are innocent victims of a war we had thought was long over. The U.S. began funding the cleanup of these bombs in 1997, and until recently, contributed an average of $2.6 million per year to this effort. This year, Congress directed that this contribution be increased to $9 million, a hopeful sign that the U.S. sees clearance of these bombs as a priority. But funding still pales in comparison to the enormity of the problem: Only about 1% of these bombs have been cleared. We have a long way to go, but this is a problem that can be solved -- as long as the U.S., in cooperation with Laos and other international donors, makes a long-term, sustained funding commitment. As an American of Lao descent, I am heartened by Secretary Clinton's visit to Laos. The reconciliation process is well under way, and despite the complex history between my two homelands, the U.S. and Lao governments can be on the right side of history and clear Laos of these deadly bombs once and for all. That way, the dreams that my parents had for me when I resettled in the U.S. -- to live freely and with bountiful opportunities -- may also be realized for the children in Laos for generations to come.

"(CNN) -- With home sales falling to five-year lows, homeowners desperate to sell their homes are looking for a little divine intervention. Retailers report statues of St. Joseph are selling briskly. Dawn Hoernemann of Minneapolis, Minnesota, had her one-bedroom home on the market for four months. Every weekend there was an open house. But there were no offers. That's until she took her mom's advice and buried a statue of St. Joseph upside down in her front yard. The next week, she had three offers and her home was sold. ""I couldn't believe it. I don't know what it is about it. It worked. It's some sort of a miracle,"" says Hoernemann. This ""miracle"" has it roots in Catholicism. According to the tradition, burying St. Joseph began hundreds of years ago in Europe. St. Teresa of Avila, a nun in the 16th century, buried a medal of the saint and prayed to St. Joseph to help secure land for a convent. The ritual is said to have worked, and so the trend of burying St. Joseph has caught on. Just ask Phil Cates of Modesto, California. His online retail site, StJosephStatue.com, offers the ""Underground Real Estate Agent"" home-selling kits. For $9.95, the 4-inch statue comes with a burial bag and a burial instruction booklet. There's even an 8-inch version of the statue for larger homes. Sales have increased 100 percent in the past two years, according to Cates. Robert Malhame, who runs Malhame & Co -- a Catholic supply company on Long Island, says sales of the St. Joseph Statue spiked last year. And he expects the trend to last. ""We're probably going to sell over 100,000 this year,"" he says. The biggest demand is coming from the Northeast and the Midwest, he says. Jan Wheelehan, the store manager at a Catholic retail supply store in St. Louis, Missouri, says the statues have been one of the better sellers, with sales increasing 25 percent this year. ""People seem more panicked and there is a hurried-ness to their expression when they come in,"" she says. St. Joseph is even on the auction block. There are dozens of St. Joseph home-selling kits on Ebay. From glow in the dark St. Joseph statues to mini pocket shrines, St. Joseph has a whole new following. Burying St. Joseph statues has its own set of rules, too, although they can vary. Home sellers are instructed to dig a hole near the ""For Sale"" sign. The hole should be three inches taller than the statue itself. The saint should then be facing the direction of the street. Then prayers to St. Joseph should be said before the saint is covered with dirt. Once the house is sold, St. Joseph should be dug up and put in a place of honor in the new home. Some renters have even cashed in on St. Joseph's divine intervention in hopes of getting a break on rent or to have their application accepted. They buried  St. Joseph statues in flowerpots. The statue's feet should either be facing the street or in the direction you want to move, according to Cates. The whole statue-burying process was a bit hard to swallow for Joe Iannacone. His Dallas, Texas, home was on the market earlier this month. Iannacone first heard about the ritual from his godfather. ""I looked on the Web. It was less than $10. So, I said why not?"" recalls Iannacone. Six hours later a young woman walked into the house and made a bid. ""I'm not very religious,"" says Iannacone. ""But that was pretty amazing.

"(CNN) -- If you were flipping around your television dial on Election Night, you saw a lot of news coverage dominated by anchors and pundits sitting in TV studios spouting opinion and analysis. But not on CNN. On our air, you saw dozens of reporters at polling places around the country, watching for irregularities but also capturing the messy yet miraculous spectacle of democracy in action. You saw Candy Crowley, Jessica Yellin, Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar at election night headquarters, offering behind the scenes details about the candidates and campaigns as they anxiously awaited the verdict of the people. You saw Dana Bash dissecting the Senate and House outcomes as only someone can who has covered Congress for two decades. And you saw the maestro of the Magic Wall, John King, interpreting the tallies from decisive counties within the swing states minute by minute as they came in, telling you what they meant and how they would shape the electoral map. A lot has been written about how cable news has become increasingly dominated by talk and opinion, because that's what drives TV ratings. But as we began our planning for Election Night more than a year ago, CNN decided to go in the opposite direction and double down on our strength: reporting. We pared back on the number of analysts in our studio and sent more reporters into the field. We invested in new state-of-the-art sets in our Washington bureau that allowed us to display electoral data more clearly and vividly than we ever had before. We relied on two anchors, Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper, who have always been more interested in conducting great correspondents than being soloists themselves. We asked our incomparable international reporters to keep track of what the rest of the world was saying about America's voteâ€”and we actually put them on our U.S. airwaves to talk about it. We did it because we value facts more than opinions, but also because these days that's what sets CNN apart. And we were glad to see that, for this historical night at least, it was what the public appeared to crave as well. An average of more than 8.8 million viewers watched the evening's coverage on our U.S. network, more than any other cable news network, and others followed it on CNN's international networks around the world. The reviews are also in, and they tell us that our investment in covering the election as journalists was welcomed. ""CNN Destroys Cable Competition on Election Night,"" was only one gratifying headline, on a post by Erik Wemple, the media critic for The Washington Post. At CNN.com, we had more than 203 million page views, the highest in four years. Our social media traffic on Twitter, Facebook and other sharing platforms set new records. But at CNN we're not ones to dwell over press clippings, good or bad, and so we are already hard at work following up on all the angles that emerged from last night's result. Can the parties now come together to address jobs, the deficit, immigration, the environment, relations with Iran and China and all the other pressing problems clouding our future? Or is a $6 billion election that left us with the same division of executive and legislative power we had before a recipe for more gridlock? And what will the demographic winds that carried Barack Obama to reelection, despite a sour economy, mean for tomorrow? How will our future be shaped by a Hispanic population that now accounts for more than 1 in 10 voters, by the empowerment of a generation of young voters who have now turned out in record numbers for two presidential cycles in a row (and who are driving a slow but steady sea change in acceptance of gay rights), by a white electorate that favored Mitt Romney, but is smaller than it has ever been, by the growing political gap between women, who favored Obama by 11 points, and men, who went for Romney by 7 points? And what are we to make of not only the persistent red/blue divide between states, but the growing urban/suburban/rural divisions within states? All fascinating questions, for our politics and for our society, and ones that will keep us at CNN busy and happy providing you with the kind of reporting and story telling we love to do.","Mark Whitaker: CNN made the choice to focus on reporting for election night coverage .

"(CNN) -- Fabrice Muamba, the Bolton Wanderers midfielder who suffered a near-fatal cardiac arrest on the pitch last month, has left hospital. The 24-year-old, who collapsed during a fifth round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on March 17, was discharged from The London Chest Hospital on Monday. ""I am naturally very pleased to be discharged from hospital and would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to every single member of staff at The London Chest Hospital who have played a part in my care,"" Muamba said in a statement. ""Their dedication, professionalism and expertise is simply amazing and I will forever be in their debt. I also wish to say thank you to all the many well-wishers who have sent thousands of messages of support,"" he added. ""Now I am out of hospital, I am looking forward to continuing my recovery and spending precious time with my family."" Muamba's heart stopped for 78 minutes with medics at White Hart Lane and then later at the London Chest Hospital battling to keep him alive. His discharge, less than a month after his collapse, continues what has been a remarkable recovery. Bill McKenna, Professor of Cardiology at The Heart Hospital in London told CNN's World Sport: ""Clearly it was a difficult and prolonged resuscitation and you would have feared the worst. ""It's great, clearly, that he's walking, talking, moving and ready to be discharged in a very short time period."" Bolton Wanderers manager, Owen Coyle said it was ""fantastic news"" before adding his thanks to all the staff at the hospital.

"(CNN) -- Now that Mitt Romney has all but wrapped up the Republican nomination for president, the discussion has veered toward potential running mates. Who embodies the conservative credentials Romney is seen as lacking? Who can deliver a battleground state that will put Romney over the top? Who can generate the enthusiasm that will bring not only Republicans, but also independents, to the polls on Election Day? Presidential candidates -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- have always considered factors like these. What is notable about this year's early speculation, however, is the manner in which women have been incorporated into the conversation. We seem to have reached the point at which a woman is always included in a ""veepstakes"" list. The Washington Post named nine men and Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico as its top 10 picks. The Fiscal Times included Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina as one of its top seven names. And Fox News offered nine men and two women as plausible running mates. A few days ago, on ABC, Jonathan Karl laid out several categories of contenders. His ""top tier"" included Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, along with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Among the ""second tier"" possibilities were New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. And then there were ""the women."" In a category all to themselves, Karl placed Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, as well as three governors: Haley, Martinez and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma. Politics: Rubio backs Jeb Bush for VP . Anyone can debate the pros and cons that each of these candidates would bring to the Republican ticket. What is not up for debate, however, is that Karl, and undoubtedly many others, consider certain potential candidates as women first and political professionals second. Before her election as governor in 2010, Fallin served two terms in the House of Representatives and 12 years as lieutenant governor. Her executive experience, therefore, is not very different from that of Daniels. Before winning a gubernatorial election two years ago, Martinez served as district attorney (a position to which she was first elected in 1996). Her political pedigree is similar to Christie's; he served as a federal prosecutor for six years before his election as governor in 2010. Ayotte was New Hampshire's attorney general when she was elected to the Senate last cycle. Rubio, who joined Ayotte as a member of the freshman class, had never before held statewide office, although he had served in the Florida legislature for 10 years. We do not mean to diminish the credentials of any of these men. In fact, that's our point. All of these names are credible and viable vice-presidential candidates. Karl doesn't say whether the women he lists are ""top tier,"" ""second tier"" or even ""wild cards"" (another of his categories). They're just ""women."" Consumers of political news are denied a real analysis of these women's place in the informal pecking order. Of course, Karl is not the first to evaluate politicians as women first and politicians second. As scholars of gender politics, we are long familiar with the tendency among the media and those who practice politics to refer to a ""woman governor"" or ""women candidates."" We hear talk about the gender gap and the Republican Party's ""woman problem"" as if women are one large, undifferentiated group best identified by their sex. And we routinely see pundits, pollsters, and politicians refer to women running for office as ""outsiders"" (even when they're insiders) or ""out-of-the-box choices"" (even when they're quite conventional). This is, of course, because women are still woefully underrepresented at every level of American government. As long as women remain an anomaly in politics, their sex will continue to cause them to stand out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Dolan and Jennifer L. Lawless.","Jennifer Lawless, Kathleen Dolan: Romney likely GOP pick; focus now on finding VP .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jaime Lerner, the former maverick mayor of Curitiba in South Brazil, has energy, passion and steely determination that started nothing short of an urban revolution. Architect Jaime Lerner, former mayor of Curitiba, Brazil . The city in Brazil and indeed its ex-Mayor, have been an inspiration to environmental urban planners worldwide. It's hardly surprising, when Curitiba has an integrated bus system that carries 2.4 million passengers a day and a population whose children have led the way in garbage disposal. CNN's Zara Bilgrami asked the architect why he believes so passionately that cities could be a solution to all our problems. CNN: Curitiba has been called ""the most innovative city in the world."" How did you achieve this? Jaime Lerner: Curitiba is not a paradise. We have all the problems that most Latin American cities have. We have slums. We have the same difficulties, but the big difference is the respect given by people due to the quality of the services which are provided. We are coming to understand that to change a city you need political will. Secondly, you need a good strategy. Then you need solidarity and a feeling of co-responsibility. I'll give you an example of co-responsibility. When I was governor, we had to clean the bays. In our state, we proposed to the fisherman the equation of co-responsibility. We said, ""If you catch the fish, the fish belong to you. If you catch the garbage we are going to pay you. The more you fish garbage, the more money you will have."" The more they cleaned the bay, the more fish they had. That's a win-win solution. CNN: You say that any city in the world can be transformed, no matter how large the scale or small the budget. Can you explain? Jaime Lerner: After working in cities for nearly 40 years I am telling you that every city can improve its quality of life in less than three years, no matter the scale or the financial conditions. All you have to do is build a good equation. Creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget! I would say there are three key issues that are important, not only for the city itself but for the whole of mankind. One is the problem of mobility. Another is the problem of sustainability. The other is social diversity and co-existence. We are afraid now of climate change and the question of sustainability. There is a feeling that we are all terminal patients and there is nothing we can do. But there are a lot of things we can do. I have been in meetings all over the world about new materials, green buildings, new sources of energy, recycling -- they are important but they are not enough. When we realized that 75 percent of carbon emissions come from the cities we realized we had to work on the concept of the cities. CNN: What exactly is urban mobility? Jaime Lerner: The condition of mobility, my approach, is don't try to choose which system is best. Use all the systems, but with one condition: never, never compete in the same space. They have to be complementary. So combine all the systems, but run them as we do in Curitiba. It's a system where we have dedicated links and boarding conditions -- that means boarding tubes and paying before entering the bus. You don't wait for a bus for more than one minute. We started with one (bus) line in 1974. It carried 25,000 passengers a day. This system is being improved every year and now we are transporting 2.4 million passengers a day. It's a very high quality system and what is amazing is that it is one of the few systems in the world which is not subsidized. It pays for itself. CNN: What about cars? Is there a role for cars in the cities of the future? Jaime Lerner: The car is like your mother-in-law. You have to have a good relationship with her but you cannot let her conduct your life. If the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law, then you have a problem. There are many solutions. That is why I call it mobility -- not just public transport -- using all the systems. CNN: How do you think quality of life was improved in Curitiba? Jaime Lerner: A city is a structure of living and working together. I have realized after all these years that a city that has a good quality of life attracts jobs. People don't want to invest in places if there is no quality of life. Everything (in Curitiba) started with the children. We started to teach the children in every school over six months, how to separate the garbage and the children teach their parents. So that's why the city of Curitiba since 1989, for almost 20 years, has had the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world, at 70 percent. Everything starts with the children. I'm obsessed with the idea of how to make the children understand their own city, because if they understand their city, they will respect it better. CNN: Which cities do you think need urgent change? Jaime Lerner: Every city needs to change in some way. My feeling with the mega-cities is that they are losing time. We are living here, working there, taking leisure time in other places. One of the reasons I am proud of my city is around 80% of people are living in diverse neighborhoods. If you want a human city, mix urban functions, mix incomes, mix ages. This is good for co-existence, for social diversity and it reduces violence. We realized that the city is what brings solidarity. Cities are not problems: they are solutions. CNN: As an architect, how important is beauty? Jaime Lerner: Quality of life and diversity is beautiful. I would say that a city that is committed to its future, in which the people are most important, is a beautiful city. We have to change from ""ego-architecture"" to ""eco-architecture"". .................. Is the city the solution to our problems? Would you support policies that pushed cars out of city centers?

"(CNN) -- Singer-impressionist-comedian Danny Gans died early Friday at his Las Vegas, Nevada, home, according to the hotel where he was based. Danny Gans was one of Las Vegas' top entertainers and recently moved to the Encore Theatre. Gans, 52, was voted Las Vegas ""Entertainer of the Year"" for 11 of the 13 years he was based there. There was no immediate word on the cause of death. ""Everybody knew that when they came to Vegas, the one show they had to see was Danny Gans,"" said Robin Leach, who covers the Vegas entertainment scene on his Web site. Hotel mogul Steve Wynn, who signed Gans to star in his Encore Theatre in February, said he was ""devastated at the loss of our brilliant, talented and loving friend."" ""One of the most unique human beings and entertainers in the world has been taken from us in an unexpected moment,"" Wynn said. ""A profoundly tragic event that leaves us all sad and speechless."" Gans is survived by his wife, Julie, two daughters and a son. ""When he landed the residencies here in Vegas, he was thrilled that he would be able to go home every night to Julie and the three kids,"" Leach said. His long Vegas run began in 1996, when he gave up his one-man Broadway show and a tour schedule of 200 shows a year for a three-month gig at the Stratosphere Hotel. He signed a nine-year deal to play in his own 1,250-seat theater at the Mirage Hotel starting in 2000. Some reports put the contract at $200 million. When that expired early this year, Gans moved to the Encore Theatre, which sits between the Encore Hotel and the Wynn Las Vegas hotel. ""He was an absolute genius with the art of impersonation,"" Leach said. ""There was nobody that he couldn't imitate, and he was uncanny."" Gans was working on an impersonation of President Obama, which he considered a tough assignment, Leach said.  Watch Gans speak with Larry King » . The easiest voice to imitate, Gans told Leach, was TV host Regis Philbin. ""When Regis came to see the show, Regis said, 'I thought I was talking out loud,' "" Leach said. Being great at being other people can limit your own fame, Leach said. ""Impersonating other stars doesn't give you too many opportunities out there in mainstream show business, to be honest,"" he said. ""But what he did was the best there was in the business, and Vegas was the ultimate place to perform that act."" Gans released an album of his musical impersonations this year, but his records have not sold well outside Las Vegas, Leach said. Gans, however, never aspired to be a global household name, he said. ""There was no lust for fame outside the fame he had here in this valley,"" Leach said. ""I think he would have been very successful if he jumped on that treadmill of insanity."" The biography on his personal Web site says that out of college, Gans played minor league baseball for two years, until a career-ending injury. He then turned to entertainment, traveling for 15 years before landing in Vegas.","NEW: ""One show [Vegas visitors] had to see was Danny Gans,"" said Robin Leach .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck in national polls, while Obama has an edge in crucial battleground states that will decide Tuesday's election. The dynamic sets up a possible outcome that has happened rarely in American politics and could undermine the credibility of the victor -- Romney beats Obama in the overall vote, but the president gets reelected by winning the decisive Electoral College. It would be the fifth time in history that the candidate who got the most overall support didn't win the election, and the first time that an incumbent president prevailed without capturing the popular vote. Explainer: What happens in a electoral tie? Analysts acknowledge that such an outcome could happen, especially when the race is so tight, but they called it unlikely. State results generally follow the national trend, they say, so the chances were remote that Romney's victory margin in states he wins will be so much larger than Obama's in states the president wins that it would counter the Electoral College result. ""If the state polls are right, then Mr. Obama is not just the favorite in the Electoral College but probably also in the popular vote,"" Nate Silver wrote last week in the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog that analyzes polling data and trends. Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics.com, wrote last month that the chances of a popular/electoral vote split were about one in three if the candidates are within one percentage point of each other in the overall count. Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. The winner of the popular vote in each state gets its electoral count, with 270 of the 538 available needed for victory. Politics: Voting challenges in battleground states could create drama, headaches . The last split between the popular and electoral vote was 2000, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore outpolled Texas Gov. George W. Bush by more than 543,000 votes in the raw count but narrowly lost the electoral tally. In an outcome decided by a controversial Supreme Court ruling that gave Florida to Bush by 537 votes, the Republican challenger ended up with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, while Gore got 48.4% of the popular vote to 47.9% for Bush. Prior to that, all previous occurrences were in the 19th Century, when the population was smaller and spread among fewer states. In 1888, Republican Benjamin Harrison defeated incumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland by 233-168 in the Electoral College even though Cleveland won 48.6% of the popular vote to 47.8% for Harrison. Twelve years earlier, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes defeated Democrat Samuel Tilden by one electoral vote, 185-184, while Tilden won 50.9% of the popular vote to 47.9% for Hayes. The result was so contentious that it took a special electoral panel to decide that Hayes was the winner. Politics: Why Tuesday, why November, why elephants? Election riddles solved . In 1824, John Quincy Adams lost both the popular and electoral vote to Andrew Jackson, who failed to get the minimum Electoral College support for victory. The House of Representatives decided the winner and chose Adams, the son of America's second president. Any close election causes raw emotions and the uncertainty from popular/electoral vote splits can undermine the legitimacy of the winner, noted Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University. That would be especially true this time if Obama, the incumbent, claims victory without getting more overall votes, she said. ""When you look at an incumbent president that can't win the popular vote, you look at a guy that's very hobbled from the start,"" Schiller said. ""For governing, it creates a much bigger problem than it does for the legitimacy of the election."" At the same time, she added, it would be hypocritical of Republicans to cry foul when they benefited from the same situation just 12 years ago, saying: ""If you win that way, you have to be prepared to lose that way."" Another factor that could contribute to a popular/electoral vote split is devastation from Superstorm Sandy in states like New York and New Jersey, which were expected to provide strong support for Obama. While the president will still win both, his overall vote total could be lower if turnout is reduced in the aftermath of widespread power outages and structural damage from the storm. Opinion: Obama's victory won't transform America . Schiller, however, said the election results would clearly demonstrate such a scenario, providing an explanation for what happened that would soften challenges to the legitimacy of an Obama victory via the Electoral College. ""I don't see any legitimate claim by either side that the system isn't going to function well, even if you get this distortion,"" she said. Electoral College voters, called Electors, will meet on December 17 in their respective states and vote for president and vice president on separate ballots. In the case of a tie between Romney and Obama, the House of Representatives would meet in January to decide the president, with each state getting one vote. The Senate decides the vice president. With the likelihood of a Republican-controlled House and a Democratic-led Senate, an Electoral College tie between Obama and Romney would make possible a split administration, with Romney as president and incumbent Joe Biden as vice president.

"(CNN) -- Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest during a soccer match on Saturday convinced former pro Mitchell Cole he was right to quit the game for fear of suffering a heart attack on the pitch. Muamba collapsed while playing for English club Bolton Wanderers on Saturday and is still in a critical condition in hospital, though he is now breathing unaided and responding to questions. Cole, who once played in the second tier of English football, was diagnosed with a heart condition at the age of 17 but decided to play on for another eight years before retiring after doctors told him one more match could kill him. The 26-year-old has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an irregular thickness of the heart in certain areas, but opted to ignore advice from doctors to try and carve out a successful career in the game. Muamba's condition continues to improve . But after suffering from shortness of breath during training and in matches last year he returned to his specialist and was told his chances of a heart attack quadrupled when he played sport. Cole says seeing Bolton star Muamba's horrific collapse on Saturday proved he had made the right decision to retire. ""It [Muamba's cardiac arrest] still sends a chill down my spine because it brings it home that it could have been me,"" he said. ""I came out of the professional game a year ago and it reiterates that I've made the right decision. I've been one of the lucky ones."" Cole's condition was detected at a young age during a routine test given to all young players coming out of school to go to a professional club. He was tested over a year-long period shortly after former Cameroon international Marc Vivien-Foe collapsed and died from a heart defect during a match against Colombia in 2003. Despite Foe's tragic death, and the advice handed down by doctors that he should retire, Cole pressed on despite the risks. He added: ""The information I took from it was that I didn't feel it was enough to stop me in my tracks for having a professional career. I [was told it was a case of] 'it might happen, it might not.' ""I took it upon myself to ignore the doctor's advice and carry on playing."" Players pray for Muamba's recovery . His condition worsened at the start of 2011 and on advice from William McKenna -- the professor of cardiology who diagnosed Cole when he was 17 -- that the risks quadrupled when playing football he retired from the professional game. McKenna told CNN the cause of most cardiac arrests like Muamba's are genetic but that the vast majority of conditions that can be dangerous to young sportsmen and women should be picked up by tests. He said: ""The testing should be done in adolescence about the age Mitchell was and it should be every year or two years. ""It should be on a routine serial basis to pick up changes at a time when you can actually do something -- you can have another career, you can stay in school, you have other options. ""If you look back there are too many events in young people, not just in football but in all sports. Bearing in mind these conditions are recognizable -- you can make a diagnosis -- and by and large there are treatments which are effective, every effort should be made. ""The onus is not on the National Health Service, the onus should be on the professional sporting bodies to ensure that players participating are safe to participate in what is pushing the body and heart to extremes.""","Ex-pro tells CNN Fabrice Muamba's collapse proves he was right to quit soccer .

"Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- Skydiver Felix Baumgartner is aiming to pull off a record-breaking free-fall jump from the edge of space Tuesday, wearing nothing but a space suit, a helmet and a parachute. His goal is not only to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet, more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier, without the aid of anything besides the space suit. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. ""I'm not nuts,"" Baumgartner said when CNN first interviewed him about the project in 2010. ""You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge."" 'Human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight . But on a more serious note, he added, ""Of course I'm afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level. You know, I'm living a good life. I think the most important thing I'm doing is to come back alive."" After years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor Red Bull, the jump is scheduled for Tuesday morning at dawn. Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent, in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon. Then he will climb out of his capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched ""delta"" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, before deploying a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth. The attempt has serious risks. He and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous ""horizontal spin."" And at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit. And if he loses consciousness during the five-minute plunge, he will survive only if his parachute deploys automatically. Another unknown: the effects on the body of breaking the sound barrier. While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe that there will be little effect on Baumgartner, because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air, shock waves are barely transmitted. Baumgartner is an Austrian helicopter pilot and former soldier who has BASE jumped from landmarks like the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. He has been preparing for five years -- both physically and mentally. ""You have to remember all the procedures,"" he said in an interview during testing for the jump. ""You know you're in a really hostile environment. And you cannot think about anything else. You have to be focused. Otherwise, you're gonna die."" The balloon, over 500 feet tall at launch, is light and translucent. The material is only .0008 of an inch thick, and it will change shape and size as it rises. The pressurized helmet and suit, which restrict Baumgartner's mobility and weigh 100 pounds, have been equipped with sensors and recorders to measure everything from his speed to his heart rate. Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt. Baumgartner was not doing interviews on the eve of the jump, but his performance coach Andy Walshe on Sunday described him as mentally well-prepared. ""He knows that he's rehearsed it and knows what to do,"" he said. ""We want him in the right state of mind. We ask him to reflect on what he's done, what he's been through and what he's achieving for himself personally, so he can relax and focus."" The record is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission. On this attempt, 52 years later, Kittinger is a consultant and mentor. He has also been giving Baumgartner advice on what to expect. For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: ""There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."" But Kittinger rejects any suggestion that he is jealous that Baumgartner is poised to beat his record. ""Oh no. I'm delighted,"" he told CNN recently. ""He's advancing science, and he'll do a great job.""","Felix Baumgartner will have only a space suit, helmet and parachute for 120,000-foot jump .

Police spotted Aaron Francis Engler lying down on a street corner, according to a police report, and an officer roused him to help him sit up and stand. He had difficulty standing, the officer said, and had bloodshot eyes, ""slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcohol"" on his breath. Engler argued and threw his arms around as the officer patted him down, the report said. And when the officer tried to handcuff him, he hit the officer's face, tensed his arm and pulled away. He then turned on his back and hit the officer's chin. The officer called for backup, and two other officers arrived and helped handcuff Engler, authorities said. The arrest occurred at 7 a.m. Engler is accused of disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest without violence. Miami police said he was released to members of the Secret Service Miami field office. The Secret Service says its Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting an internal review of the incident.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Flooding in southern India in the wake of a tropical cyclone has killed 25 people in the past few days and driven tens of thousands of others from their homes, authorities said Tuesday. The severe weather has caused flooding affecting 5,250 square kilometers (2,000 square miles) of agricultural land in the state of Andhra Pradesh, according to Vinod Kumar, an official at the state's disaster management department. Cyclone Nilam roared into India's southeastern coast last week, killing at least 15 people in the state of Tamil Nadu and running a large oil tanker aground on the shore near Chennai. The storm had already been drenching coastal areas with rain as it loitered over the sea north of Sri Lanka before it made landfall. It brought more than a month's rainfall in just a few of days, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. The ""high impact, long duration"" nature of the downpours ""overwhelmed the rivers and streams"" and led to the disastrous flooding, Cabrera said. About 70,000 people in Andhra Pradesh, which is north of Tamil Nadu, have been relocated to temporary shelters, Kumar said Tuesday. The flooding has killed 25 people in the state, he said. The full extent of the damage to crops won't be known until after the flood waters recede, according to authorities. Tropical cyclones tend to occur in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea during the April-to-June and September-to-November periods. A violent tropical storm killed at least 23 people in southeastern Bangladesh last month. And a powerful cyclone that hit India and Bangladesh in May 2009 killed at least 180 people.

"(CNN) -- French police arrested 103 Croatian soccer fans Tuesday morning ahead of a match between Paris Saint Germain and Dinamo Zagreb, police officials said, amid fears of possible hooliganism. Some Croatian fans have also been barred from entering a certain zone of the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on Tuesday evening, prefecture spokesman Franck Ernotte said. Those arrested can be held for up to 24 hours because they've breached an order issued by French Interior Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday that banned Dinamo Zagreb fans from coming to Paris, a police statement said. The Croatian fans are in the French capital as their club plays the Paris side in a Champions League match, due to kick off at 8:45 p.m. local time. Clashes broke out Monday night between about 50 supporters of the two clubs near the Place de la Bastille in central Paris, police said. The disorder resulted in 25 arrests, 19 of them Croatian fans and six of them PSG supporters, the police statement said. Three of the Croats had been flagged by Croatian authorities as being particularly violent, it added, while three of the Parisian fans have been barred from the stadium. Two Croatian fans were injured in the fracas, police said. The confrontation started with verbal insults but soon turned violent, with some fans carrying batons and tear gas canisters, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. Dinamo Zagreb has yet to win a match in its group of four in the Champions League, with three games played. PSG is in second place in the group. In a bid to ward off trouble, Croatia turned back dozens of PSG fans on their way to Zagreb in October for the opening fixture between the two sides. This is not the first time Croatian football fans have been under the spotlight. The national football association was fined during the Euro 2012 tournament this summer for unruly behavior by hardcore supporters. And last year, the head of European football's governing body, the Union of European Football Associations, met with the Croatian president to stress the importance of tackling football-related violence.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Longtime entertainment columnist Army Archerd, who was one of the first writers to reveal that actor Rock Hudson was being treated for AIDS, has died at age 87, according to the industry publication Daily Variety. Army Archerd wrote a column for Variety for 52 years and was one of the first hosts of ""Entertainment Tonight."" Archerd, who began his journalism career at The Associated Press, wrote a show business column for Variety for 52 years, four years of that online. Archerd died Tuesday at Los Angeles Medical Center of a rare form of mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer thought to be the result of his exposure to asbestos in the Navy during World War II. Archerd, Variety said, had an ongoing role in the Academy Awards, where he was the official greeter, and interviewed stars on the red carpet. Archerd's biggest scoop came in 1985 when he reported -- despite denials from managers and publicists -- that Hudson had AIDS. It was the first time it was publicly revealed that a Hollywood actor had the disease. Archerd's wife of 39 years, Selma, told Variety, ""He didn't expose secrets about other people -- he wrote news. He was a loving, quiet person. He was always working -- when we went on vacation, we went to visit movie sets."" Although much of Archerd's work was nonconfrontational, when film director Elia Kazan was to be given a honorary Oscar in 1999 for his work, Archerd wrote, ""I, for one, will not be giving him a standing ovation."" Kazan had provided testimony in 1952 to the House Un-American Activities Committee, admitted past membership in the Communist party and named others from his group. ""Army's finest hour was his courageous stand against the blacklist at a time when almost all other Hollywood columnists were red-hunting,"" said Peter Bart, vice president and editorial director of Variety. ""He really was a passionate reporter and a champion of causes he believed in."" Archerd was the first journalist honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and won numerous other awards. He also was one of the first hosts of ""Entertainment Tonight."" Archerd was born January 13, 1922, in the Bronx, New York. He attended City College of New York for two years. When his family moved to Los Angeles, Archerd transferred to UCLA and, after graduation in 1941, he began work in the mailroom at Paramount Studios. After serving in the Navy, Archerd met AP reporter Bob Thomas, who introduced him to bureau chief Hubbard Keavy. Thomas and Archerd opened the AP bureau in the Hollywood Citizen News on Wilcox Avenue in 1945. In 1953, Daily Variety editor Joe Schoenfeld hired Archerd to replace columnist Sheilah Graham. Archerd began penning the daily ""Just for Variety"" column. His 900-word column ran on page 2 of Daily Variety five days a week until the 1990s, when it went to four days a week. Archerd often used his power to support his favorite causes, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Holocaust awareness. ""When Michael Jackson's 'HIStory' album was released in 1995, Archerd chastised Jackson for a song in which he used the phrases 'Jew me/Sue me' and 'Kike me,' "" Variety said. ""A few days later, Jackson called the columnist to disclose that he would re-record the song."" Archerd was president and founder of the Hollywood Press Club and received honors from that group and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as well as Newsman of the Year from the Publicists Association. Archerd is survived by his wife, Selma; his son, Evan; and stepsons Richard and James Rosenblum. A daughter, Amanda, died in 2008.","Army Archerd died of a rare form of mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A day after Conrad Murray's lawyers complained he was suffering a ""slow death"" in a tiny jail cell, the doctor was moved to a slightly larger one, his lawyer said. Lawyers for the doctor convicted in Michael Jackson's death warned the Los Angeles County sheriff in a letter Wednesday that Murray was suffering possibly life-threatening and permanent injuries from almost a year in a 5-foot-by-7-foot cell. Authorities transferred Murray to a 8-foot-by-10-foot cell of the Los Angeles County jail Thursday, ""but it's not a good thing,"" his lawyer Valerie Wass said. Murray was found guilty of causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer's insomnia. The new cell has a solid door with only a small window, unlike the old cell that was open with bars that Murray could prop his long legs on when he stretched, Wass said. ""It's like being stuck in a closet and he's freaking out,"" she said. ""He is feeling really isolated. When Murray called his lawyer Wednesday, ""he basically said 'Valerie, I'm dying, save me,'"" Wass said. Wass, who is leading Murray's appeal of his involuntary manslaughter conviction, and Michael Flanagan, one of his trial attorneys, will meet with jail officials soon. The meeting will focus on Murray's health problems they blame on his limited exercise and small cell, Wass said. ""He needs exercise,"" she said. ""You've got to get him out of that cell more than once a week."" The best solution, she said, would be for the sheriff to release Murray on monitored home confinement for the final year of his sentence. Murray was sentenced to the maximum of four years in prison for causing Jackson's death, but California law requires him to serve just half of that behind bars. Another law intended to relieve overcrowding in state prisons has Murray serving his time in the county jail, which Wass said was never designed for long term confinement. Wass and Flanagan signed a letter for Sheriff Lee Baca Wednesday that they said was ""notice of the life-threatening condition in which Dr. Murray currently exists."" ""Correction of this intolerable situation is of extreme importance,"" they wrote. Murray is held in a high-security section of the jail and isolated from the general prisoner population to protect him. ""Death or injury at the hands of another prisoner, however, is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space,"" the lawyers' letter said. Murray -- jailed since November 7, 2011, when he was convicted -- is 6 feet 5 inches tall, but until this week he was confined in a 5-foot-by-7-foot cell, the letter said. ""If one were to keep a dog in a space just a few inches larger than the dog's length, for any extended period of time, contentions of animal cruelty possibly leading to prosecution would likely result,"" it said. The sheriff's office did not respond to CNN's calls for comment. His jail conditions ""are the equivalent of a large individual flying coach in a middle seat for a period of a year,"" Wass said. Murray was taken to a hospital Sunday night for treatment of what his lawyer described as ""marked venous stasis of his lower extremities"" and ""right shoulder pain and severe loss of motion."" His cell was so small that Murray has ""no opportunity for physical movement throughout the day,"" his lawyers wrote. ""The only actual exercise that Dr. Murray received occurs on most Monday evenings when he is transferred in chains to an 8-by-8 cage on the roof of the facility."" Murray, in a phone call to a friend Monday that was published Wednesday by the celebrity news website TMZ, complained that he feared his illness would be permanent. ""I may never be able to wear a boot again,"" he said. ""The venous stasis gives rise to a high risk for deep vein thrombosis and/or migrating pulmonary embolism,"" his lawyer wrote to the sheriff. ""This condition may have developed to a chronic state which has become permanent and uncorrectable necessitating a lifetime of medication and treatment."" Murray's physical appearance has changed dramatically since he was taken into custody, his lawyer wrote. ""A review of earlier booking photos and bio-statistics of Dr. Murray, when compared to his current condition and appearance, would be shocking to persons not previously familiar with him,"" they wrote. ""To those who have known him for the last year or longer, the suffering that has obviously taken its toll on his health is unimaginable."" Keeping a human in such conditions ""would at the very least give rise to civil liability for negligent confinement resulting in a debilitating medical condition,"" the letter said.","Jailers transfer Murray to a 8-foot-by-10-foot cell, ""but it's not a good thing,"" lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Convicted Ohio serial killer Anthony Sowell won't be eligible for parole after being classified as a ""sexually violent predator,"" court officials in Cleveland said Wednesday. Sowell was found guilty of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges Friday in a string of deaths of Cleveland-area women from 2007 to 2009. Officer Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office, said Sowell's classification as a sexually violent predator guarantees that he can only receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty when the sentencing phase of his trial begins August 1. The jury could have recommended parole if members believed Sowell could be rehabilitated, according to Greg Popovich, the Cuyahoga County court administrator. During the sentencing phase, Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination, Miday said. The defense also can call expert witnesses to discuss Sowell's background, including his childhood and military service. If jurors decide to recommend death, the judge can intervene and impose a life sentence -- but if the jury recommends life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, according to Popovich. Jurors found Sowell guilty on a total of 84 counts, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. The sole not-guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge. The convictions ended a saga that began for investigators in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two sets of victims' remains inside Sowell's home. Eventually, they blamed him for the slayings of at least 11 women, ages 25 to 52. Sowell had served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as ""a normal guy,"" known locally for selling scrap metal. His inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where one in five homes was in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. Neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around Sowell's residence was from human flesh and not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years, with only four of them even being reported missing. Many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives, with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. In late 2008, Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined, he punched her in the face several times. Wade said that he then tried to rape her, dragging her toward his home, adding that she got out only after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, with one police report noting blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. Six more women disappeared after her complaint. Authorities discovered the bodies after a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story eerily similar to those of Wade and the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's first conviction for attempted rape. She said he'd invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face, then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull is all that remains of one victim. It was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. Sowell's lawyers have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case, and the suspect has not been interviewed. CNN's Chris Perry contributed to this report.","Anthony Sowell was declared not eligible for parole Wednesday .
Sowell was convicted Friday on 84 counts, including murdering 11 women from 2007 to 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell walked jurors through his life as he testified Monday in the sentencing phase of his case, apologizing to families of his victims but offering no explanation for his actions. ""I'm sorry, I know it might not sound like much, but I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,"" Sowell told the jury and victims' relatives gathering in a Cuyahoga County, Ohio, courtroom. Jurors on July 22 convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. If jurors decide to recommend that Sowell die for his crimes, the judge can overrule that recommendation and impose a life sentence. But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, according to Cuyahoga County court administrator Gregory Popovich. As part of the sentencing phase, and in addition to testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses, Sowell was able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, . Visibly agitated and occasionally tearful during his remarks Monday, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. Sowell said his childhood ""was like a war,"" with his mother and grandmother constantly arguing, yelling and ""whopping"" the children. He said the lack of nurturing in his home made him unable to stand physical contact or any signs of affection. Sowell said he sought an escape and joined the Marines. He said he married and the couple had a daughter, but that his wife ""was touchy-feely"" and he never got used to the physical contact. Eventually their relationship dissolved and in 1985, Sowell began a 15-year sentence for attempted rape. After his release from jail, Sowell said, his health began to fail. Sowell said in 2007, he suffered a major heart attack and began hearing voices. He did not elaborate on the crimes for which he was convicted. ""I don't know what happened, it's not typical of me,"" Sowell said. ""I can't explain it and I know it's not a lot, but it's all I can give."" Sowell's convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home.

"(CNN) -- Filipino authorities sought to calm panic unleashed among some residents after a hoax text message warned that radiation from Japan may affect the Philippines. Concerns persist about nuclear reactors in Japan in the wake of a magnitude-9.0 quake and subsequent tsunami that struck the nation Friday. But ""there is no immediate danger of nuclear radiation in the Philippines,"" the nation's Department of Science and Technology said in a statement Monday. The text message, which appeared to be a news flash from the BBC, spread like wildfire on Monday. It said that the Japanese government had confirmed a radiation leak at nuclear plants in Fukushima Prefecture and that ""Asian countries should take necessary precautions."" It went on to warn that radiation may begin hitting the Philippines by Monday afternoon and instructed people to stay indoors and apply Betadine, an over-the-counter topical iodine-based antiseptic, on their neck area where their thyroid gland is located. The message also warned against being in the rain, telling recipients to use an umbrella or raincoat ""even if it's only a drizzle."" It was not immediately clear how many people received the message. Although some Filipinos dismissed it as a hoax immediately, others rushed to drugstores in search of Betadine. The message also spread to some Filipinos living abroad, who became concerned about their relatives back home. ""I contacted my family, telling them not to go out, not to go anywhere,"" said Rowena Acquino, a Philippines expatriate in Jakarta, Indonesia. ""The one who spread that news should be punished."" In its advisory, the Department of Science and Technology warned against believing in ""hoax messages"" and ""rumors."" ""The advice circulating that people should stay indoors and wear raincoats if they go outdoors has no basis and did not come from the DOST or the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Center,"" the statement said. It asked Filipinos to stop forwarding the message ""so as not to sow panic among our people."" ""It was an irresponsible thing to do, considering the anxiety and panic that it can cause the public,"" said Lyndon Daz, a resident of the Philippine capital, Manila. But, like many, Daz said he is still concerned. ""We know the dangers that this can cause when the spread of it and containment is unabated,"" he said. ""I am not quite certain that the Philippines is distantly safe from the radiation effects of the Fukushima power plant."" Hoax text messages, warning of impending disasters and often quoting reputable news organizations like the BBC or even CNN, are not uncommon in the Philippines or Indonesia. Some Indonesians also received the message on their mobile phones, on their BlackBerries and on social networking sites like Facebook, Indonesian executive Manda Azhairie said.

"(TIME.com) -- Another victim of superstorm Sandy's devastation in New York: laboratory animals representing years of critical medical research. When the New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center lost power as Sandy buffeted New York on Monday night, the back-up generators malfunctioned and the hospital was forced to evacuate around 300 patients to neighboring hospitals. The patients were saved, but the power outage left one of the medical center's animal research facilities in the dark, and the New York Daily News reported that thousands of laboratory mice may have drowned, resulting in the loss of years of research, cell cultures and tissues that had to be abandoned in failing incubators. The Smilow Research Center, one of NYU's three animal research facilities, lost unique strains of mice when the power outage restricted access to the 13th floor research center, ABC News reported. The center held specimens critical to NYU scientists' research in heart disease, cancer and neurodegeneration. The center ""was adversely impacted by the severity of the flood surge and the speed with which it came on,"" according to a statement from the NYU Langone Medical Center. ""Animal resource staff was on site continuously to mitigate the damage from the storm, but due to the speed and force of the surge, animal rescue attempts were unsuccessful."" TIME.com: Lessons from storm Sandy: When hospital generators fail . Dr. Michelle Krogsgaard, a cancer biologist at the center, told ABC News that she and her colleagues were allowed into the lab to rescue whatever they could from the failing fridges. ""We could lose everything we've done since I started at NYU six years ago,"" she told ABC. ""All the work we did, all the time and money, we're going to have to start all over."" Other New York City research institutions like The Rockefeller University did not lose power, nor valuable research, but the scientists sympathize with the NYU researchers' loss. ""We feel badly for the mice and for the science that was disrupted and The Rockefeller University is obviously committed to helping NYU scientists in this difficult time,"" says Ravi Tolwani, the associate vice president and senior director at The Rockefeller University's Comparative Bioscience Center, which is involved in the care of the institute's research animals. TIME.com: How disasters bring out our kindness . As for what was comprised, Tolwani says that most institutions like Smilow and Rockefeller base their biomedical research on mice, since the animals are relatively easy to manipulate genetically. This makes them an ideal model for understanding the biology of human genetic defects. ""When we modify mice to modify genes, those modifications made are unique to that specific mouse strain. That may be the only mouse strain that's available for a specific genetic defect in the world,"" says Tolwani. ""Those mice are not replaceable, or they're not very easy to replace. The effort to actually generate those mice is lost, and whatever science has been done on those mice is stopped."" Not only is years worth of research potentially lost for the NYU scientists, but it will also take years to recover their work with new mice. To make new strains with the appropriate modifications can take anywhere from one to two years, and the researchers must breed a significant amount of the mice to replicate their studies. ""It's devastating,"" says Tolwani. ""Science is a very competitive field, and it is rapidly advancing. Even reproducing those strains and having to wait to use them is devastating to their science because research advances very quickly. You can imagine that scientists' lives are actually disrupted."" TIME.com: Breast milk during the storm: With power gone, moms safeguard their stash . For many researchers and students working on their doctorates and dissertations, their work and projects are now in jeopardy. Without their specimens, researchers will have difficulty getting published and receiving grants for their work. As NBC News reports, it is possible the NYU scientists shared their mice with other institutions who requested the mice for collaborative study, in which case some of the strains may be recovered in a relatively short time. However, Tolwani says for more recent and unpublished studies, this is unlikely. ""Before the science on these mice is published, there will not be as much sharing. I would guess that the majority of the mice were not shared with other investigators. Therefore those mouse strains were lost,"" he says. It's possible that the NYU researchers preserved sperm and embryos from their lab mice, which could make recovering any unique strains slightly easier, but even that may take time and put the researchers further behind.

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian court has issued an arrest order for a Google official there, arguing that he violated the South American country's election law when he didn't respond to a request to take down YouTube videos that allegedly slandered a candidate for mayor in upcoming elections. The warrant from a judge in the southwest state of Mato Grosso do Sul accuses Fabio Jose Silva Coelho, Google's president in Brazil, of ""disobedience"" for not removing YouTube videos about Alcides Bernal, who is running for mayor in the city of Campo Grande. The order also says Brazilian Internet service provider Embratel must block the Google-owned YouTube website in the city for 24 hours. A Google spokesman did not be immediately respond to a request for comment. In court documents, the company argues that it isn't responsible for the contents of the videos and asks for the case to be dismissed. Under Brazilian law, the penalty for disobeying a judge's order could be up to six months in prison or a fine. Earlier this month, another company executive faced a similar order in the northern state of Paraiba for a video that allegedly slandered a mayoral candidate there. That case was dismissed after Google successfully convinced the judge that it was not responsible for the contents of the video, but simply provided a platform for its diffusion. In August, Facebook faced an order to remove a page criticizing a political candidate or be forced to go dark in the country for 24 hours. The judge in that case suspended his decision two days after it was issued.","A warrant accuses Google's president in Brazil of disobedience .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- CNN President Jim Walton announced a major shakeup of CNN management Friday, replacing the head of CNN/US with a long-time CNN executive known for his business turn-around skills. HLN head Ken Jautz takes over as executive vice president of CNN/US, replacing Jonathan Klein, who headed the network for six years.  CNN's chief marketing officer Scot Safon will run HLN, replacing Jautz. Walton also said he would hire a managing editor to ""help leverage our newsgathering resources across multiple platforms."" ""Ken is a rarity -- a working journalist who is an even better news  executive,"" wrote Walton in a memo to staff. ""Ken has launched, made  profitable and turned around businesses for our news organization,  Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner literally around the world."" Jautz, who joined CNN in 1989 as a bureau chief in Germany, has held a wide variety of jobs at the company, including executive vice president in charge of CNN's business news operations.  During a stint with Turner Broadcasting Europe, he helped launch channels in several European markets.  Most recently, Jautz has presided over the revamp and rebranding of the HLN channel, introducing signature programs such as Nancy Grace, Joy Behar, ShowBiz Tonight, Issues with Jane Velez Mitchell and Morning Express with Robin Meade.  The new evening line-up doubled the network's prime-time ratings. ""I look forward to working with CNN's many fine journalists and launching two new shows that I think will make our prime-time lineup more engaging and lively,"" Jautz said, ""and will continue CNN's strategy of delivering smart, informative news and analysis from across the political spectrum."" Safon takes over HLN after heading CNN's marketing for the last eight years, winning wide industry accolades for his marketing campaign for CNN and CNN=Politics.  Before joining CNN, Safon oversaw marketing for one of CNN's sister channels, TNT. ""Scot is one of the most creative and passionate executives at Turner Broadcasting,"" said Walton. The moves come as CNN/US has suffered declining prime-time ratings in recent years as other cable channels have taken on partisan tones in their programming and news coverage.  CNN/US recently announced a new prime-time lineup, hiring global media personality and former newspaper editor Piers Morgan to host an interview program to replace Larry King Live, and pairing Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Kathleen Parker and former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer in an 8 p.m. time slot. The memo sent to staff said Jonathan Klein is leaving CNN.  During Klein's six years at CNN/US, the network won many awards for its aggressive coverage, including Hurricane Katrina, the South Asia tsunami, the 2008 U.S. elections and the devastating Haiti earthquake. ""Jon has made important contributions to the CNN story, and he leaves with our  respect and friendship, and with my sincere thanks,"" Walton wrote to staff. Walton said that a search is under way for the new position of company-wide managing editor.  The assignment for the new editor, Walton wrote to staff, is to generate ""the kind of front-page reporting and analysis that captures a news event, translates its meaning and shapes the dialogue about the story."" Phil Kent, CEO of Turner Broadcasting System, the parent company of CNN, also highlighted the role of the new managing editor position, saying it would ""build on the network's unique strengths in journalism and on CNN's quality editorial voice across all platforms."" ""Jim Walton is a  world-class leader, and I'm in full support of his newly announced  organizational structure and leadership team,"" Kent said. ""I believe these changes will position CNN/U.S. and HLN for future growth and  success.""","HLN head Ken Jautz replaces CNN/US President Jonathan Klein .

The death of the 92-year-old retired engineer means that the Scots dialect known as Cromarty fisherfolk is now consigned to a collection of brief, distorted audio clips. It is the first unique dialect to be lost in Scotland, according to Robert Millar, a reader in linguistics at the School of Language and Literature at Aberdeen University. ""Usually minority dialects end up blending in with standard English to form a hybrid. However, this is a completely distinct dialect which has become extinct,"" he said. Cromarty fisherfolk appears to be the only descendant from the Germanic linguistic world in which no ""wh"" pronunciation existed, Millar said. ""'What' would become 'at' and 'where' would just be 'ere',"" he said. It was also the Scots language's only dialect that dropped the ""H"" aspiration. A history of invented languages . ""The loss of Cromarty is symptomatic of a greater, general decline in the use of the Scots language,"" according to Director of Scottish Language Dictionaries Chris Robinson. ""This should be a wake-up call to save other struggling dialects."" Ten miles down the coast from Cromarty is Avoch, another sleepy fishing village with the closest surviving dialect to Cromarty fisherfolk, one that may also be endangered, according to Robinson. ""It looks more than likely that this will go the same way as the Cromarty dialect,"" he said. The dialect of the peoples who originally resided on the shores of Cromarty -- which lies on the tip of Black Isle peninsula, a four-hour drive north of Edinburgh -- was directly linked to their traditional fishing methods. However, during the industrialization of fishing in the 1950s, established working methods were lost and the connection between the way of life and the dialect eroded. In fewer than 30 years, much of the dialect became obsolete. Millar argues that the decline in Scots language represents a wider global trend. ""Generally, in the literate world, local dialects are suffering. The highly mobile and technologically advanced areas of the world are worst affected,"" he said. There are some 6,000 to 7,000 languages in the world and it is estimated that they are disappearing at a rate of one every two weeks, according to Millar. Some 96% of the world's population speak just 4% of the world's languages, he said. ""Most languages are only spoken by a few hundred people,"" he added. Why mourn the loss of a language? ""At a banal level, it's a little bit of color in our lives is gone,"" he said. ""Any time something dies, it's lost. Whether it be languages or species, we lose something. Everyone in the world loses something. Diversity surely is a good thing, and we've just lost a bit of it."" Greater communication and interdependence among communities is resulting in ""dialect homogenization,"" Millar said. And people tend to abandon their own languages for one of the larger languages for good reasons, according to Anthony Aristar, professor of linguistics at Eastern Michigan University and director of the school's Institute for Language Information and Technology. ""They want modern conveniences; they want their children to have decent jobs,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""All this requires being able to speak in the dominant language. So they see little use in preserving their languages."" But the loss of a language often results in the loss of the stories that were told in that language, and in the cultural knowledge they contained. ""Even medical know-how,"" he said. Robinson, of the Scottish Language Dictionaries, maintains that Scots minority dialects like Cromarty have faced other pressures. ""Educationally, English has been the language used in Scotland since the 18th century. Consequently, Scots speakers are not literate in their own language. Also, until recently, Scots has had a social stigma attached to it as a working-class or second-rate language."" Yet there are signs of improvement for the state of Scots minority dialects. More Scots books, especially children's books, are being published than ever before. In addition, since 2009, the Scottish government has provided funding for the Scottish Language Dictionaries, which has also given the language a status boost. The support has been seen as a natural progression from the move by Westminster in 2002 to sign the European Union Charter of Minority and Regional Languages recognizing Scots, Gaelic and Welsh as languages separate from English. Still, the rate of the worldwide loss of dialects and languages remains consistent. Robinson said he would like to see more efforts taken to safeguard minority Scots dialects. ""Scots has an amazing literary history, yet it is completely ignored in our schools,"" he said. ""The books must be made more widely available and read more in schools for the language to survive in the future."" How to create a language from scratch .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio jury on Monday began the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009. Jurors on July 22 convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. The sole not-guilty verdict came on an aggravated robbery charge. On Monday, they heard from prosecutors asking for the death penalty and from defense attorneys trying to save Sowell's life. ""We believe that, at the end of the day ... at the end of all the evidence, that you will decide that death is not the appropriate penalty in this particular case,"" said John Parker, who is representing Sowell. During the sentencing phase, the defense could call up to 28 witnesses -- among them family members, acquaintances and five expert witnesses -- according to Cuyahoga County court administrator Gregory Popovich. They are expected to wrap up their case in four to five days. The prosecution expects to call two or three witnesses of its own, during the rebuttal phase, Popovich said. Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office. Sowell has been classified as a ""sexually violent predator,"" meaning parole is not an option, Miday said. If jurors decide to recommend that Sowell die for his crimes, the judge can overrule that recommendation and impose a life sentence. But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, Popovich said. Sowell's convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as ""a normal guy."" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. At one point, one in five homes there was in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents received food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing. In late 2008, a woman named Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined he punched her in the face several times. Wade said he then tried to rape her, dragging her toward his home, and that she escaped after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, and one police report noted the presence of blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. Six more women disappeared after her complaint. The first bodies were discovered after a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story similar to Wade's. It was also similar to the story of the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's attempted rape conviction. The Cleveland woman said he had invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face and began performing oral sex on her -- letting her go only after she promised to return the next day. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home had been strangled by ligature, which can include a string, cord or wire, and at least one had been strangled by hand, officials said. Seven women still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull was all that remained of one victim; it had been wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. At Sowell's trial, his defense rested without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence, according to CNN affiliate WOIO. His defense attorneys have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case.","NEW: A defense attorney says he feels jurors will decide ""death is not the appropriate penalty""

"(CNN) -- New Jersey towns could soon get help paying the extra costs of having drunken reality show stars wandering their streets. The proposed ""Snookiville Law"" would let townships license reality show productions and levy fees on them to pay for additional police to control the cast members and the crowds drawn by the shows' cameras, New Jersey Assemblyman Ronald Dancer said. The legislation is named for Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi, star of MTV's ""Jersey Shore,"" who was arrested for disorderly conduct in Seaside, New Jersey, two years ago, Dancer said. While ""Jersey Shore"" is in its last season of taping, Snooki and co-star JWoww (Jennifer Farley) have been producing a spinoff show in Manchester, which is near Dancer's central New Jersey district. ""This bill will permit local officials to make sure taxpayers don't get 'Snook'-ered or public safety is compromised when reality stars such as Snooki or JWoww come to town,"" Dancer said. The law would not prevent drunken reality stars from stumbling down the streets, Dancer said. ""I can't go as far as to say that would not happen."" Dancer, a Republican, said he is not trying to discourage reality TV shows from taping in New Jersey, because production can bring money to a community. But it also ""may cost taxpayers money by requiring additional services when cameras are rolling in town,"" he said. Political campaigns' 'Snooki factor' Snooki spins off 6-pound baby .

"(EW) -- Harrison Ford is open to the idea of bringing Han Solo back to life on the silver screen in 2015, according to sources close to the just-announced ""Star Wars"" sequel, but don't be surprised if his contract includes a mandatory death scene for the sly old space smuggler. ""Harrison is open to the idea of doing the movie and he's upbeat about it, all three of them are,"" said one highly placed source, referring to Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, the trio that made a hyper-speed jump to global fame on May 25, 1977, the opening night for George Lucas's original ""Star Wars"" film. The Hollywood trajectories of Hamill and Fisher led to reinvention — he's now an in-demand voice actor; she used a gift for acerbic memoir to deliver ""Postcards from the Edge"" and ""Wishful Drinking."" But Ford, who reached his 35th birthday in the summer of 1977, launched himself on a truly historic career run that synced up with the blockbuster bonanza of the 1980s. Ford's star rose with ""The Fugitive,"" ""Air Force One,"" ""Clear and Present Danger,"" ""Presumed Innocent,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and of course, the four fedora films as a certain archaeologist named Henry ""Indiana"" Jones. EW: Who should direct new 'Star Wars' movie? The actor, now 70, is plenty proud of Indy, Jack Ryan, John Book and Dr. Richard Kimble, but in the past he didn't disguise his disdain for Solo. ""As a character he was not so interesting to me,"" the frosty Ford explained in an ABC interview in 2010. The slippery Corellian pilot's great talent is keeping himself alive, a skill that apparently extended beyond the screen. Solo's death scene in early outlines for ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" was scrapped, according to Ford and others, because the character was a top-seller as an action figure. As Ford told ABC in the same interview: ""I thought he should have died in the last one to give it some bottom...George didn't think there was any future in dead Han toys."" Disney, which acquired Lucasfilm in a $4.05 billion deal, sees plenty of retail future with ""Star Wars"" sitting on the same corporate toy shelf as Marvel and Pixar, and they'll certainly be offering a stellar payday to coax Ford to bring his star power back to role that started it all. 'Star Wars': Where are they now? More than money, Ford might be drawn back by the upside of changes at Lucasfilm, where the respected Kathleen Kennedy is taking over as company president, and with the Jedi franchise as a whole now that Kennedy is in as executive producer and Lucas will take on a consultant role, leaving the director's chair for someone else. Indeed, Ford won't go to the next level of contract talks until there's a script and director in place. Either could be a deal breaker. Still, at any stage, an ""upbeat"" signal from Ford on any Solo matter is enough to shock and excite fans who view ""Star Wars"" as something close to religion. Solo, Luke Skywalker (Hamill), and Princess Leia (Fisher) appeared in two more films, and when last we left them (in 1983's ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi""), they were on the forest moon of Endor reflecting on the downfall (literally) of the Emperor and Darth Vader's final act of redemption. Now a new-look Lucasfilm — with Lucas moving into retirement and the Walt Disney Company taking over — plans to circle back with a new trilogy that picks up the story decades later and presumably uses the original trio to hand off the franchise to a new generation. (It's a familiar approach; 2009's ""Star Trek"" beamed Leonard Nimoy back aboard, or 2010's ""Tron: Legacy"" turned to Jeff Bridges to initiate the next cycle.) Hamill told EW that he and Fisher heard about the idea when Lucas summoned them for a lunch in August, not long after both were onstage return guest at ""Star Wars Celebration VI,"" an official Lucasfilm event that drew tens of thousands of fans to Orlando. Many of those true believers are delirious about the new hope of a third trilogy but Hamill, 61, knows that some outsiders will roll their eyes. ""I can see both sides of it,"" Hamill said. ""Because in a way, there was a beginning, a middle, and an end and we all lived happily ever after and that's the way it should be — and it's great that people have fond memories, if they do have fond memories. But on the other hand, there's this ravenous desire on the part of the true believers to have more and more and more material."" EW exclusive: Mark Hamill weighs in on the future of 'Star Wars' In the 29 years since the red carpet premiere of ""Return of the Jedi,"" Ford has declined hundreds -- if not thousands — of offers to appear at ""Star Wars"" events and cast reunions, even the ones sanctioned and run by Lucasfilm. In fact, in all those years there was only one offer he accepted: He attended a 30th anniversary screening of the ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in 2010 to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. About 400 fans (including Christopher Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige) paid $100-$175 each to hear Ford reflect on his Millennium Falcon days. I was the moderator for the event and the star arrived in a cheery mood but, after watching the film, he was weary of the crowd's zeal for something he could never love. ""I don't know that I understood it very well,"" Ford said in a flat tone of the franchise's ascension in popular culture. ""I'm not sure I understand it yet ... I was very happy to be involved. I was pleased to be a part of an ensemble."" It was a bare-bones answer but still the crowd cheered and no one asked for a refund -- everyone was just excited to see Ford back in the same theater as the ""Star Wars"" universe. That alone may be the Force that brings Ford and Solo back together for their date with destiny. See the full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Another day of rainy forecasts has pushed NASA to put off the space shuttle Endeavour's piggyback flight to California for a second day, the space agency said Monday. The orbiter had been scheduled to take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop its 747 carrier plane on Monday morning. NASA planed to take the craft on a three-day cross-country tour before delivering it to Los Angeles, where it will be put on display at the California Science Center. But storms over the Gulf Coast states forced the agency to postpone Monday's takeoff by a day, and a poor forecast for Tuesday triggered another delay until Wednesday, NASA says.

"(CNN) -- The morning started off as just another day. The alarm clock announced the start of the day at 4 a.m., well before the sun would begin to peer over the eastern horizon. I had merely 75 minutes to get myself and two young boys ready and out the door for what would soon become a roller-coaster of a day. I don't have what everyone would consider a normal job. I'm a soldier in the United States Army. Currently, I serve as the public affairs chief for the 4th Sustainment Brigade in Fort Hood, Texas. My job is one of the greatest in the armed forces, because I have a unique opportunity to focus my efforts in telling the stories of the many heroes and patriots who serve in our military ranks. The mechanics, truck drivers, personnel specialists, etc., are some of the unsung heroes in our formation, and it's my goal to highlight their achievements. But on this day, after I dropped my boys off at day care and arrived at the first formation of the morning to salute the flag at Reveille, the tables were turned. I was called in front of all my peers, recognized for my hard work and awarded an opportunity to attend the Tony Stewart Smoke Show Fantasy Camp at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth the following day. Watch Staff Sgt. Thompson take to the track . This was an incredible honor to be recognized by my leadership as they recommended me for this opportunity. I am humbled that they would think so highly of my performance at work; however, I feel it is more of a privilege to be in a position to meet so many other soldiers who have volunteered to serve our great nation. However, for me, it's my job when I'm not in the office that is much more important: I'm a single parent to two very special boys. My oldest son, Haden, 6, has cerebral palsy as a result of a heart arrhythmia, stroke and seizures when he was just 3 months old. His brother, Jason Jr., 5, is about two years developmentally delayed and borderline autistic. Having two children with special needs added to my appreciation for the experience at the Smoke Show, as all the proceeds benefited the Speedway Children's Charities. Seeing someone in the position of Tony Stewart, the defending NASCAR champion, donate his time to help raise money for less fortunate children was simply amazing. This was the fifth time Stewart has hosted his Smoke Show at Texas Motor Speedway, and in only five years, he has raised more than $1 million for Speedway Children's Charities. Not only does it speak volumes to the character of Stewart as an individual, it goes to the generosity of people in the Dallas/Fort Worth area who donated that money for the charities. As a single parent of two exceptional children, I understand the importance of a helping hand once in a while. On the day of the Tony Stewart Smoke Show, I was able to drive a stock car around the track for a pair of 10-lap sessions as well as a three-lap heat session as a passenger with Stewart driving. I'm a long-time NASCAR fan, so it had always been a dream of mine to get a car up to full speed on the high banks. The experience was certainly a once in a lifetime opportunity that I will always be grateful for and an opportunity that I hope will be afforded to other outstanding soldiers in the years to come. I am but one man serving as part of a much larger team of volunteer soldiers who have dedicated their life to serve the United States of America. Some may look at my circumstances with being a single military father of two special needs children as a difficult and challenging hardship; those individuals couldn't be more incorrect. I am truly blessed for everything that I have been given. I have an extraordinary opportunity to be a strong role model for the two most resilient and strong boys a father could ask for.","Staff Sgt.

"Cincinnati, Ohio (CNN) -- As she began a foot pursuit of a suspect down a dark alley and around a forbidding street corner, Cincinnati police officer Mandy Curfiss radioed to headquarters that she was heading toward a local gas station. ""Fourteen-26, still running towards Shell,"" Curfiss said as the suspect ignored her commands to stop. Seconds later, the man wheeled around, grabbed Curfiss and, after a brief struggle, ripped her Taser from her hands and charged toward her. Then he charged the officer who arrived to back up Curfiss. The second officer wrestled the suspect to the ground and cuffed him, with no injuries to anyone. The suspect was charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer. If he had chosen to fight the charge in court, he would have had to contend with a piece of evidence only recently available: a videotape of the entire incident. The confrontation on February 24 was recorded with a small camera Curfiss was wearing on her head. It's called the AXON, manufactured by Taser International, the same company that makes the widely used stun guns. Curfiss is one of 10 Cincinnati police officers who have patrolled the streets with the AXON camera mounted behind an ear. Five police departments across the United States are testing the AXON and one department -- in Aberdeen, South Dakota -- has purchased a set. It's a crucial tool for gathering evidence, said officers who've used the device. They like that it is capable of moving with them where mobile video recorders, so-called ""dash cameras"" in squad cars, can't go. They say the camera often pre-empts ""he said-she said"" disputes in court. Since the Cincinnati Police began testing them in January, the cameras have recorded several confrontations. In another incident in February, an officer ordered a suspect to lie face down after a traffic stop. Despite repeated commands to show his hands, the suspect didn't respond and appeared to reach toward his pockets. Officers quickly handcuffed him and discovered he had two pistols. On an overnight ride-along with Cincinnati officer Melissa Cummins in early April, a CNN camera -- and Cummins' AXON camera -- rolled as a man on a street corner ignored her request to throw away an alcoholic beverage. The man ran, and Cummins, with the CNN crew in tow, took off after him. After ignoring repeated instructions to stop, the man was tased and arrested for obstructing official business. We later reviewed the incident on Cummins' portable recorder. ""What's your evaluation of how you handled it?"" CNN asked. ""Good, I think,"" said Cummins. ""I mean, I gave him every chance to stop running."" The AXON camera played a pivotal role in a case in Fort Smith, Arkansas, in November. When Cpl. Brandon Davis responded to a domestic violence call, he was led to the front door of a small one-story house. When the door opened, Davis saw the suspect sitting at a table, holding a gun. Despite Davis' repeated commands to drop the weapon, the suspect refused. Davis fired two shots, killing the man. Because his warnings -- at least 10 of them -- were recorded, Davis was cleared of wrongdoing in an internal investigation. But the camera is not without controversy. To record an incident, the officer has to double-click a button on a communications hub, a small box mounted in the chest area. The video is recorded and stored in a ""tactical computer,"" a box strapped to the waist. All three devices -- the camera, communications hub and tactical computer -- are connected with one wire. If the officer does not double-click the communications hub, the incident will not be recorded. That means the beat cop has sole discretion over what gets recorded and what doesn't. ""That's a problem,"" said Cincinnati criminal defense attorney Steven Adams. ""That puts too much bias and prejudice against the person that's suspected of a crime, or the person that's being interviewed, or the person that's being interrogated."" Cincinnati Police Chief Thomas Streicher was asked about a theoretical case in which police beat a suspect and make sure among themselves that the scene was not recorded. ""Well in the scenario that you're talking about right there, No. 1, I'd say to you I hope to God something like that never does happen. And if it does happen, I can tell you this: There are some real serious questions that have to be answered. And I'd have to tell you also that peoples' jobs would be in jeopardy here in Cincinnati,"" Streicher said. Streicher has instructed his officers to record every encounter with citizens. There are also questions about the chain of evidence captured by AXON cameras. After an incident is captured and stored in the portable computer carried by the officer, that computer is placed into an electronic panel at headquarters. The video is uploaded into a data file in Arizona called Evidence.com, run by Taser International, where it is stored. Taser International officials said that evidence cannot be altered or erased and that police are the only people with access to it. No one at Evidence.com or Taser has that access. Defense attorney Adams said that despite the best intentions of the police departments and Taser, the business relationship between those parties has the potential to create conflict. ""They need to put it in the hands of an independent forensic scientific examiner to make sure it's out of the hands of the police and outside of the company's domain,"" he said. Streicher said some officers were initially reluctant to wear the cameras. ""A cop goes into a world that is very mean and down in the gutter and can get downright nasty, and sometimes words are said that we might not use at the dinner tables with our families,"" he said. ""So the cops worry about that kind of thing, and let's face it, not everyone is an angel here."" But Streicher said that most officers have reconciled with the device. ""It's just another tool in the toolbox to help us capture evidence, and that's what becomes critically important about this. And that's what eventually the cops learn to understand and they learn to accept.""","AXON camera, developed by Taser, is mounted behind officer's ear .

"(CNN) -- Investigators suspect a criminal gang was behind the Sunday morning killings of nearly two dozen men in a marketplace in northern Nigeria, a government official said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan troops are surrounding the city of Bani Walid, awaiting orders to enter what had been a stronghold for late dictator Moammar Gadhafi as those inside appeal to the international community for help. Massoud al-Waer, a local official, told CNN late Friday that Bani Walid was under siege with no food or fuel able to get in, nor even fresh oxygen for its main hospital. The standoff -- and possible military offensive -- stems from the death of a Libyan revolutionary fighter from Misrata credited with capturing Gadhafi last year. Omran Shaaban and two other fighters were kidnapped near Bani Walid in July. He was released two months later, at which point he was in bad shape physically. After being transferred to a hospital France, Shaaban died September 24 of the aftereffects of gunshot wounds. One day after his death, the country's General National Congress authorized the Libyan ministries of defense and interior to use force, if necessary, to arrest those responsible for allegedly kidnapping and torturing Shaaban. The national assembly also called for the release of the others being detained in Bani Walid, giving those in the city 10 days to comply -- or else the North African nation's military would take action. The deadline for that ultimatum was Friday. And over the past week, Libyan army troops and militia members from different parts of the nation -- including Misrata -- mobilized and surrounded Bani Walid. Bani Walid and Misrata have a longstanding rivalry. The chief of staff for Libya's army issued a statement Thursday calling on the people of Bani Walid to cooperate by handing over the wanted individuals to avoid a military assault. Yet many in Bani Walid remained defiant Friday, turning out in large numbers to protest the national government's demands and call for the release of those from the city being held about 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the northeast in Misrata, according to al-Waer. ""They treat us as if Bani Walid is not part of Libya,"" the city official said. Hundreds of Bani Walid residents have been arrested by armed militias, according to the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International. Many continue to be detained without being charged, or put in trial, across Libya, and have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated, Amnesty said. Meanwhile, talks are ongoing to resolve the issue in Bani Walid, without the use of force, al-Waer added. But he said that many residents are ""anticipating a military offensive, but will not leave the city and are ready to die in Bani Walid."" Bani Walid was a holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists until the very end of the fighting late last year. And tensions between residents and fighters aligned with what was the National Transitional Council -- and later the fledgling Libyan government -- continued to simmer after the city's fall. A petition was being circulated Friday around the inland city, which is about 170 kilometers southeast of the capital, Tripoli, asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an emergency meeting and act ""to immediately intervene to protect the civilians in the town."" The petitioners claimed that pro-government ""armed militias"" were trying to indiscriminately kill large numbers of people in Bani Walid, because of the city's history in support of Gadhafi. They report ""bombing on civil neighborhoods"" on October 1 ""with no regards to the lives of unarmed civilians."" ""The Libyan government claims that it is trying to arrest some criminals in the town. But the question is: Could those criminals be arrested with mortars, missiles and a ban on daily necessary requirements?"" Amnesty joined those calling for restraint Friday night. It issued a statement urging ""Libyan authorities to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of force in the city and to ensure essential medical supplies are allowed into the city.""","A man credited with capturing Gadhafi was kidnapped and died last month .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan mayor has apologized for anti-gay comments she apparently posted on Facebook over the summer. ""Yes I said it, yes I accept full responsibility,"" Troy, Michigan, Mayor Janice Daniels told CNN affiliate WDIV on Monday. ""Yes I regret it, yes I am sorry."" A group of student demonstrators gathered outside Troy City Hall on Monday in protest of Daniels' comments and had called for her to step down. According to a screen grab of Daniels' entry, dated June 25, the posting reads, ""I think I am going to throw away my I Love New York carrying bag now that queers can get married there."" The posting came after New York became the sixth state in the union to legalize same-sex marriage. Troy City Manager John Szerlag also chimed in Tuesday to address the scandal. ""The City of Troy is the second most diverse City in the State of Michigan and we are extremely proud of and enriched by our diversity,"" he said in a written statement. ""Personal comments made by the mayor and any individual Council member are just that."" But others continued to express their outrage over the comments. Denise E. Brogan-Kator, executive director for a Detroit-based gay rights advocacy group, said the mayor's language ""shows obvious contempt for gay people."" Daniels, a Tea Party candidate, was elected to office last month. Her Facebook page has since been removed.","A Michigan mayor apologizes for anti-gay comments on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's team principal Stefano Domenicali has insisted there is no ""political intention"" in the Italian marque's decision to bear the country's naval flag on their cars at the Indian Grand Prix. Both Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa will carry the symbol on their livery, a move that has been interpreted as a message of support for two Italian navy officers arrested after an incident that resulted in the death of two Indian fishermen in February. The officers are understood to have mistaken the fisherman for pirates who they thought were trying to attack an oil tanker they had been protecting. They were jailed in March and later bailed ahead of their trial. Ferrari posted a statement on their website on Wednesday that read: ""Ferrari will carry the flag of the Italian Navy on the cars driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa in this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. ""In doing so, Ferrari pays tribute to one of the outstanding entities of our country, also in the hope that the Indian and Italian authorities will soon find a solution to the situation currently involving two sailors from the Italian Navy."" Ferrari's decision to bear the flag on their cars was applauded by Italy's minister for foreign affairs, Giulio Terzi, who took it as a show of support for the sailors -- Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone. He wrote on his official Twitter page: ""Congratulations to Ferrari for displaying the the Navy's symbol at the India GP. It will show the sailors the whole country is behind them."" Formula One's governing body, the FIA, states clearly that it ""shall refrain from manifesting racial, political or religious discrimination in the course of its activities and from taking any action in this respect."" But when questioned about the flag at a press conference ahead of Sunday's race in New Delhi, Domenicali was coy about the reasons behind it. ""I think that you have to refer to that (Ferrari's statement) to be honest, and look what is written exactly, and the reason why we put that on,"" he said in quotes carried on the sport's official website. ""There's not any political intention or discussion in that. If you look at that, that's really what is written. ""If you look behind in the past we've done a lot of initiatives but there's nothing that I want to go into very specifically because it's not really the place where I should do it."" AFP reported that Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone had said the matter should be dealt with by India's national motorsport association, the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI). ""What we'd do, we'd look at the national sporting authority (FMSCI) here to have a look at that... we are not political,"" Ecclestone was reported to have said in New Delhi. As for matters on the track, both Ferrari drivers trail behind reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, who was quickest in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Red Bull's German driver sits six points ahead of Alonso at the top of the drivers' championship standings, as he goes in search of a third straight title. Vettel and teammate Mark Webber were over half a second quicker than Alonso in the second practice session with Nico Rosberg fourth fastest for Mercedes. Qualifying is on Saturday before the race on Sunday. ""The track improvement was quite big today, it was dusty to start and improved lap by lap, so I wouldn't be surprised if tomorrow the order is different, but we've had worse Fridays, so I am happy,"" Vettel told F1's official website. Alonso, who has seen his championship lead eroded by Vettel in recent weeks, added: ""This is an interesting circuit: after the longest straight, there's a combination of high-speed corners which are very nice to drive. ""Today the track was still very dirty, which is usually the case at new tracks that aren't used very often. Tomorrow, when it will deliver more grip, it will be even more fun.""","Ferrari denies making a political statement having the Italian navy flag on its F1 cars .

"(CNN) -- When Entertainment Weekly published the first trailer of USA Network's new series ""Common Law"" in November on its website, readers were abuzz with excitement. According to the synopsis, the show revolves around two quarreling Los Angeles homicide detectives, played by Warren Kole and Michael Ealy, who are ordered to go to couples therapy. While many were keen to see ""Think Like a Man"" star Ealy again, it appeared that most commenters were sure they would like ""Common Law"" because they knew what to expect. ""Another light-hearted show that is PERFECT on USA,"" one user, Tim Mahoney, said. ""I'll always give a USA Network show a chance and rarely have I been disappointed,"" another user named Kaiulani said. Now, six months later, ""Common Law"" is set to kick off the network's 2012 summer line-up that includes returning shows ""Royal Pains,"" ""Burn Notice,"" ""Suits,"" ""White Collar,"" ""Necessary Roughness"" and ""Covert Affairs."" The buddy-cop show, which will premiere at 10 p.m. ET Friday, will form a crucial part of USA's annual and popular summer block. The network even claimed that it ""owns summer"" in a recent news release. According to ratings tracker Nielsen, USA averaged 3.61 million viewers in primetime from May 30 to August 21 last year. The newspaper USA Today also reported in January that USA Network had an average of 3.2 million total viewers and remained the top-rated cable network for the sixth consecutive year in 2011. Over the years, this success has largely been attributed to USA's original series, which are often character-driven comedy-dramas that are fun and set in bright and beautiful locations, which have become almost synonymous with destination summer viewing. The 'Characters Welcome' branding . Jon Turteltaub, executive producer of ""Common Law,"" told CNN that the show was originally written to air on CBS, but was picked up by USA because the focus on the detectives' relationship and therapy sessions seemed to be a better fit for them. ""USA does work differently, they push characters over plot,"" he said. ""They were really interested in well-developed and fully drawn characters. For the creators of the show, that's music to our ears."" Turteltaub said that he sees this priority not necessarily as a formula, but more of ""a guiding principle of things that have worked."" ""USA has been very clear about not letting the story bog down the tone,"" he said. ""The feel of your show is more important than the police procedural details. If we are loving the characters and feeling a sense of entertainment and fun, then three clues to solve the crime is fine, not five."" This emphasis is what drew Cory Andrew Barker to USA shows in the first place, so much so that he eventually ended up doing research on the network's programming theme. Barker, who just graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio with a master's degree in popular culture, said he was intrigued by how the shows were tonally similar and yet often popular. In his university-approved thesis, ""Genre Welcome?: Formula, Genre and Branding in USA Network's Programming and Promotional Content,"" he explained how the network has carved its own niche. The show that really heralded the network's present style was ""Monk,"" Barker found. When Tony Shalhoub's Adrian Monk, a brilliant detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder, was introduced in the summer of 2002, USA at that time was mostly known for reruns. Barker, who also runs a blog called TV Surveillance, argues that since then, USA has branded itself with its ""Characters Welcome"" slogan to signify its shows' ""quirky, sort of left-of-center"" personalities. These characters tend to work toward ""the greater good"" in ways not always in tandem with the law, have an overarching goal and happen to live in sunny locales. For example, the character of Monk solves crimes with his detailed-oriented abilities, lives in San Francisco and throughout the series is trying to figure out who murdered his wife. This pattern of elements or formula, Barker said, can be found in most of USA's shows, making them recognizable and easy to pick up and consume. So audiences are loyal as they automatically have an idea of what the next USA show will be like and view the network as unique. ""If you are a person who likes USA shows, you will probably like 'Common Law,' "" Barker told CNN. ""You have watched nine shows like these, so why wouldn't I try this?"" Robert Bianco, a TV critic for USA Today, has reviewed several USA Network shows and summarized the cultural perception of the network this way: ""They have a very clever, successful marketing position for themselves, as the home of these 'blue sky,' mostly crime-based dramas with more of a comic twist than you would get on [for instance] FX."" Blue skies, all season long . The ""blue sky"" that Bianco refers to is the approach or philosophy that USA shows tend to have. The lighter theme is favored over a gloomy or gritty scenario because the objective is not to be overly somber, he said. ""The cable dramas these days have become very serious, and the network procedurals tend to be in the darker side of crimes,"" Bianco said. ""USA shows tend to be glossier, on the sunnier side."" Jeff Eastin's USA series ""White Collar"" is a good example. The show is about a con man named Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) who, after getting caught by the FBI, helps them solve white-collar crimes using his expertise. Eastin, the show's creator executive producer and show runner, said that since the crimes mostly involve white collar offenses such as art forgery, the lighter elements of the crime are shown and stressed on. "" 'White Collar' ... we're a good prototype show for 'blue sky,' what USA is,"" Eastin said. ""There's a certain classy slickness to the show, just in the general world of police shows ... [It's] pushing for that cleverness [in a] sort of high-end world."" A part of that slickness also comes from the shows' locations. ""Burn Notice"" is set in Miami, ""Royal Pains"" in the Hamptons, ""Psych"" in Santa Barbara, all of which bring to mind warm weather, beaches and an abundance of sunshine. Eastin said that for the New York City-set ""White Collar,"" there is a tendency to shoot in places where the architecture can be exploited. Barker said that these settings, along with the warm weather timing of the premieres, capture the allure of summer and are all about escapism. ""You are sort of immediately drawn to this place where you might want to take a vacation to,"" he said. Future of USA Network . Many critics have pointed out that despite the likely success, USA's cookie-cutter model for its shows can only go so far and that viewers might tire of similar series. But Bill McGoldrick, USA's executive vice president of original scripted programming, said he doesn't look at it that way. He said that when they go through show pitches, they certainly look for characters that stand out because of their background or relationships. However, McGoldrick added that while the network focuses on a feel that ""puts you in a good mindset"" it is not the motivating factor. ""We definitely stay away from the word 'formula,' he said. ""It's a dirty word here."" McGoldrick, who worked on ""Monk"" and ""Psych"" early in his career, said that USA, like any other network, is evolving. When ""Monk"" was being developed, network executives at the time were not that interested in serialized character development or just procedurals. ""In those days, we saw that there were not a lot of shows doing throwback, where you could mix comedy and drama,"" McGoldrick said. ""Where you didn't have to be so earnest and serious like 'Law and Order' and 'CSI.' "" After the success of ""Monk"" and the fan-base growth of ""Psych"" and ""Burn Notice,"" McGoldrick said that USA is encouraging its older shows to have continuous and rougher plots and is green lighting new shows such as ""Suits,"" which have more edge. ""Covert Affairs,"" ""Fairly Legal"" and ""Necessary Roughness"" not only deal with more provocative subjects, but also have female leads. USA's political miniseries, ""Political Animals,"" starring Sigourney Weaver as the secretary of state, is set to premiere this July. Bianco said that the new direction might be challenging because the blue sky and escapist vibe might not accurately portray real life -- such as the workings of a law firm in ""Suits"" versus the workings of a law firm like in CBS' ""The Good Wife."" But he said that there is no need for USA shows to compete with the more serious shows for the fear of becoming too formulaic. ""I don't think there is anything wrong with simple, enjoyable entertainment when you pull it off well,"" Bianco said.","New series ""Common Law"" is set to kick off USA network's 2012 summer line-up .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Between 1969 and 1993, all 11 justices confirmed to the Supreme Court were named by Republican presidents. Now the re-election of President Barack Obama promises to continue reshifting the balance of federal courts toward a more progressive stage, a legacy of judicial power that may be felt for decades. Obama has already named two justices to the top bench -- Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- and it is possible he might name two or more in his second term. ""With the president re-elected, I think it's very likely that Ruth (Bader) Ginsburg, the justice who's the oldest (at age 79), will retire within the third year of a second term, leaving the president time to get another nominee in there,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a top appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com publisher. ""Other than retirement, I think -- absent health problems -- the justices are not too anxious to leave. They all really like their jobs, it's a good job, and they all seem to be in great shape."" Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here . Federal judges serve for life, giving the president the political opportunity to shape a legacy that will long outlive his or her public service. Besides Ginsburg, three other justices are in their 70s: fellow liberal Stephen Breyer, who is 74; and Republican appointees Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, both 76. Many conservative court watchers predict Obama will not dramatically alter his criteria for selecting judges, an approach driven in large part by political reality. ""As the president himself said, he'll have a lot more 'flexibility,' so he could appoint someone who's more of a hard left,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group. ""Frankly, he has already appointed a very solid, intelligent, articulate liberal in Elena Kagan. Justice Kagan, I think, in many ways is sort of a left Scalia. She's by no means in the center. She votes lock-step with Justice Ginsburg."" While Democrats control the Senate -- the body that must confirm all nominees -- the Republican minority has been successful blocking two Obama appeals court picks deemed to be ""activist"" and ""radical"" by the right -- Californian Goodwin Liu and New Yorker Caitlin Halligan. For its part, the current conservative-majority high court has not been shy in adding some of the hottest political and social issues onto its docket. This year alone, the justices tackled immigration reform, affirmative action and the blockbuster health care reform law -- a late-June majority ruling giving the president a major victory. And the justices in coming days are set to decide whether to hear pending appeals on same-sex marriage and voting rights enforcement by the federal government. 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America . ""The Supreme Court and its ideological divide is really placing the Constitution and the country in many ways at a crossroads,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. ""Where President Obama could have a big impact on the court is if one of the more conservative justices, like swing vote Anthony Kennedy or Justice Anton Scalia -- if they retired, then President Obama could replace a conservative or a right-leaning moderate with a liberal justice and that would really shape the outcome of Supreme Court rulings for quite a while."" Some liberal groups have criticized the Obama White House for being less than aggressive in his first term naming proven progressives to the federal courts -- including district, and appeals vacancies. The number of judicial nominations by the current president has lagged by the dozens behind recent chief executives, and those nominees have on average been four years older than those named by President George W. Bush, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution expert on judicial nominations. But publicly, liberals say they are encouraged the courts will receive greater political attention over the next four years. ""We look forward to working with the president on a robust justice agenda,"" said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice. ""That agenda must include a renewed commitment to civil liberties and leaving a legacy of judicial appointments that support our values of fairness and equal justice under law."" White House sources have acknowledged privately that Obama put judicial picks on a lower political priority in his first term, for the most part choosing what they characterize as moderate, non-ideological, non-controversial -- and confirmable -- slates of judges. Those sources said the strategy reflected the president's own personal views that judges should not bring sharp partisanship to their jobs, but also political reality: Obama did not want to be sidelined fighting culture wars over judges with Republicans, while trying to repair the ailing economy and push health care reform. Photos: Justice Roberts on the high court . His supporters also blame Senate Republicans for opposing many of the president's choices, even ones Democrats deemed well within the mainstream. Both sides of the aisle blame the other for abandoning an unofficial 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases. Republicans for their part say they cannot be criticized for the president being slow to bring judicial nominees to the Senate, and have said the rates of confirmation are consistent with previous administrations. White House officials have emphasized diversity of the bench over hard numbers. Obama has successfully placed 72 women in the federal courts, the most ever in a single presidential term. It matches the number Bush named in his eight years from 2001-09. President Clinton named 111 female judges in his two terms. From 1993 to 2017 Democratic presidents will have served 16 of those 24 years, approaching in judicial impact what Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and George H.W Bush did in their terms. ""I think filling the lower court benches is going to be key,"" said Severino. ""That's something, much to my relief, actually, (that) President Obama hasn't focused on as much this past term. He did get his two Supreme Court nominations, which is huge, and has a great impact. But there's also the long-term impact of filling the district court and the circuit-court spots, and that's what is going to provide a deeper bench later on. ""So we'll see if President Obama decides to switch his emphasis and fill more of those judicial vacancies or continues to embrace that as a lower priority."" Of more immediate concern to the rank-and-file federal courts: the pending $7 trillion ""fiscal cliff"" of mandatory federal tax increases and spending cuts if a budget deal is not reached by early January. Economists fear another journey back to a recession if things are left unchanged. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, in a letter obtained by CNN, warned a proposed 8.2% across-the-board sequestration cut in judicial funding would be ""devastating,"" potentially forcing employee downsizing, and reductions in court security, even fees paid to public defenders and citizens for jury service.","Federal judges serve for life, which means a president can shape a far-ranging legacy .

"(CNN) -- Pat Summitt, the all-time winningest major college basketball coach, said Friday that it was 100% her decision to step down as head coach of the Tennessee women's team after her diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's. Her statement came one day after an affidavit she filed, in which Summitt said she had felt forced out. ""It was entirely my decision to step down from my position as Head Coach of women's basketball at the University of Tennessee. As I stated at my press conference in April when I announced my decision, I loved being the Head Coach for 38 years, but, after consultation with my son, my doctors, my lawyer, and several close friends, I concluded that the time had come to move into the future and step into a new role,"" Summitt said in a written statement Friday. In April, the coach announced her on-court retirement eight months after revealing her diagnosis. ""I did not then, and I do not now, feel that I was 'forced out' by the University.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia's president fired the country's defense minister Tuesday after his office became embroiled in a controversy involving alleged corrupt property deals, state media reported. Anatoly Serdyukov, a former businessman, had been in charge of the Defense Ministry since early 2007. Putin appointed Sergey Shoigu, a former Emergencies Minister, as the new head of defense, according to Russia's state-owned channel RT. Shoigu, who's been serving as governor of the Moscow region since the summer, was well regarded in his role at the helm of the Emergencies Ministry, the channel said. Russia's Investigation Committee has filed a court case against a company affiliated to the Defense Ministry, Oboronservis, over the sale of ministry properties, according to RT. Two suspects, Yekaterina Smetanova and her partner Maksim Zakutailo, are accused of aiding illegal sales. Another suspect, Yevgeniya Vasilyeva, is thought to be a former protege of Serdyukov, RT said. The scandal, which must be embarrassing for the Kremlin, concerns real estate scams involving nearly $100 million, according to state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. ""Given the situation that has developed around the Ministry of Defense, in order to create the conditions for an objective investigation of all the issues, I have decided to free the Minister of Defense Serdyukov from office,"" Putin is quoted as saying by RT. Russia's large military is in the midst of a much-needed modernization program. Putin urged Shoigu to push forward with the reforms, according to RT, saying he ""must continue further dynamic development of the army to ensure the fulfillment of the state arms order and the immense plans of re-equipment of the army."" The appointment of Shoigu, a general, in place of Serdyukov, who was Russia's first civilian defense minister, may please senior military figures who've been unsettled by sometimes painful reforms. The modernization program was ordered after Russia's invasion of the former Soviet republic of Georgia in 2008 revealed unexpected weaknesses in its armed forces. CNN's Arkady Irshenko contributed to this report.","Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov is sacked as a scandal embroils his ministry -- state media .

"(CNN) -- For a new parliament, it was an inauspicious beginning. While most new buildings are inaugurated with a ceremonial shovel, a gentle turning of the first sod and possibly a brass band, Georgia turned the earth on its new parliament by demolishing a 46-meter-high Soviet-era war memorial with explosives. The blast ended in tragedy when it killed a Georgian woman, her 8-year-old daughter and left several more injured. ""According to preliminary information, safety measures were not met,"" Murtaz Zodelava, the country's chief prosecutor, stated at the time. Three years later and the glass dome -- a vast structure that would not be out of place on the set of a science fiction film -- is still dogged by controversy. Costing almost $83 million, critics see the building as a gigantic folly in an impoverished country. Others say the decision, which effectively takes the seat of power from the capital Tbilisi and puts it in Georgia's second city Kutaisi 220 kilometers (137 miles) to the west, will mean less rather than more transparency. For the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili, however, the building represents Georgia's hopes for the future. His pro-Western government, which suffered a defeat at the hands of Russia's military in 2008, has continued to defy its giant neighbor. The destruction of the war memorial, which commemorated Russian and Georgian war dead from World War Two, was denounced by Moscow as an act of ""vandalism"". For Saakashvili, the new parliament sends a potent message to Moscow. ""This new building of our parliament is a symbol of the new Georgia,"" Saakashvili said at the official opening of the yet-to-be finished legislature late last month against a backdrop of marching troops and military hardware. He warned in his speech that Moscow still wanted to ""accomplish its cherished dream: to topple Georgia's government"". ""I am confident that the Georgian people will stand guard to save Georgia's independence,"" he said. ""We have fought so that Georgia would not have a single elite and that the country would not be managed from a single street."" Meanwhile, opposition groups maintain the construction of the parliament has been shrouded in secrecy and at least $45.3 million in public funds has been allocated for the project in a 'totally non-transparent' manner, according to a report by the Tbilisi-based legal advocacy group, Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA), released in April. The GYLA report said papers requested under the country's freedom of information laws only resulted in the partial release of some documents, while other documents on the public record were not released at all. ""It became obvious from the very beginning of the monitoring that information about construction of the parliament building was totally concealed,"" the report reads. ""The absolutely non-transparent process gives a legitimate reason to conclude that 73.77 million Georgian lari ($45.3 million) has been handled in an absolutely vague and, possibly, corrupt manner."" The group also maintains that the move to Kutaisi will sideline the country's opposition, taking the legislature to the industrial city where it will not be called to account by protests or petitioners. The Georgian government, however, is unperturbed by the critics, saying the move makes a clean break from the brutalist Soviet-era architecture that dominates Tbilisi. The Regional Development and Infrastructure Minister, Ramaz Nikolaishvili, who heads the construction work, recently told foreign media on a tour of the site that the building would raise the bar on Georgia's levels of visual education. ""We don't want our children's taste to be ruined by communist architecture,"" he said. ""We want beautiful buildings and we want the next generation to grow up with good taste. This will help them live in a better and more dignified way."" CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile.

"(CNN) -- As yet another presidential election cycle ends, it's a good time not only to tally wins and losses, but to reflect on the nature of the American political system and why it so often disappoints voters and presidents alike. Think of the extravagant hopes and promises that attended Barack Obama's election in 2008. Obama surely had good historical grounds for thinking that the seismic financial upheaval of 2009 presented him with opportunities to transform America for the better. And so it did, to a degree his own reelection campaign somewhat mysteriously chose not to emphasize, by creating the political space for major legislative victories like the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms. But those achievements fell measurably short of candidate Obama's aspirations, and were matched by precious few other initiatives that met the expectations arising from the 2008 campaign. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . This time around a chastened Obama notably failed to offer a grand vision for the American future and instead contented himself with delegitimizing Mitt Romney and dwelling for the most part on small-bore issues. What is it about the American presidency, anyway? Every four years, Americans become besotted with presidential politics. Indeed, in the media-marinated age of the ""perpetual campaign"" the besotting has no fixed cycle, quadrennial or otherwise. Though for more than a century near majorities of eligible voters have not bothered to cast ballots in presidential elections, none today can escape the saturation news coverage, ubiquitous advertising, and relentless prattle of the chattering classes that attend the contest for the White House. No other country spends so much of its time choosing its top-level political leadership. The British and the Australians usually get the job done in less than six weeks. The French, as a rule, take no more than three. Canada's longest campaign ever, in 1926, lasted just 74 days. And no other people pour such vast buckets of money into their electioneering as the Americans -- some $6 billion in the current round. Perpetual presidential politicking is as American as apple pie -- and a darn sight more expensive. And as for the candidates, what makes them run? In a nation long schooled to believe that any child can grow up to be president, an astonishing number of men of outsized ambition (and at least a few women) have taken the lesson to heart. News: Romney only prepared a victory speech . They have devoted virtually their entire adult lives to seeking the presidency. They have plotted, maneuvered, schemed, bargained, cajoled, begged, exalted and often humiliated themselves in pursuit of the prize. Once in hand, the long-coveted office has sometimes made but more frequently broken them. Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt, two examples of the relatively few presidents who can be counted as successful, largely realized their grandest aims -- though in both cases the presidency cost them their lives, one by assassination, the other through catastrophic overwork and consequent self-neglect. More often, in the case of otherwise accomplished and respected men, the presidency has merely cost them their reputations. For the likes of Ulysses Grant, Herbert Hoover and Lyndon Johnson -- each of them celebrated masters of their pre-presidential domains -- the presidency proved a career-killing heart-breaker. Sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue has been the scene of many bitter disappointments, as well as some tragedies of epic, Shakespearean proportions. In light of that dispiriting history, why would anyone wish the travails of the presidency upon himself? As President James Garfield put it in 1881, after just a few months in office: ""My God! What is there in this place that a man should ever want to get into it?"" Yet men have wanted it, desperately, including Mitt Romney and Barack Obama. Both of them might answer Garfield's question by saying, simply, that the Oval Office is a matchless place from which to serve one's country. But as Garfield and other presidents -- including Obama -- learned, the American presidency is a truly peculiar institution, with less power in actuality than folklore has it. The president and vice president are but two of the 537 elected officials in Washington. Surrounding the White House is a political playing field mined with enough vetoes to stymie even the most ambitious of men. News: GOP expands majority in governor's mansions . Yes, modern presidents oversee a vast 21st-century machinery of state whose operations touch almost every corner of American life. But they share executive authority with 50 governors; and many government entities, such as the Federal Reserve system, are formally independent of presidential control. The president has no official voice in the legislative process, save for his own veto, which can be overridden by congressional super-majorities. He can nominate federal judges and Supreme Court justices, but they must receive Senate confirmation, and in any case serve for life in a proudly independent judiciary. He is the commander in chief, but the Constitution reserves to Congress the right to declare war. It is not simply the lust for power, however constitutionally jacketed it might be, that fuels men's and women's appetites for the office; it deserves to be acknowledged that love of country is among the reasons that so many good people, including Obama and Romney, have pined for the opportunity to serve. Yet contrary to the balladeer's promises, in politics no less than in romance, love is not enough, and it rarely, if ever, conquers all. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . This is the hard lesson that Obama has learned in the last four years as president. He is a devoted patriot who in his 2009 inaugural address praised the Founders, whose ""ideals still light the world."" He excited effusive affection among his countrymen on his way to winning the presidency in 2008. But the last four years have seen no deepening love affair between the president and his people. On the contrary, the ardor of his supporters has measurably cooled, and some have jilted him altogether. His detractors have multiplied and hardened against him. And events have tempered even his extravagantly idealistic vision of his country. The president's frustrations have derived not simply from the septic political climate of our times, but at least as much from a set of mechanisms carefully crafted by those same hallowed Founders more than two centuries ago. Generations of schoolchildren have been taught to reverence the ""checks and balances"" the framers stitched so artfully into the Constitution. Less frequently noted are the liabilities that were integral to their design. They deliberately constructed the American governmental system so that it would be difficult to operate, the presidency in particular. What do you think of the election results? Share your reaction. Their colonial experience with the British crown and royal governors made them especially wary of executive power, and though the presidency was one of their cleverest innovations in that long-ago Philadelphia summer, they hedged it about with constraints and counterbalances to ensure that no president would ever accrue anything remotely resembling monarchical authority. Small wonder that over the arc of American history only a handful of presidents can be said to have effected truly lasting transformational change -- Lincoln, FDR, Lyndon Johnson and perhaps Ronald Reagan make the short list, but few others do, and that's no accident. Americans may yearn for strong leadership, but in their stubborn contrariness they do not want truly powerful leaders. They may want effective government, but they apparently like divided government even more, when neither party simultaneously controls House, Senate, and presidency -- the situation we've been saddled with for 31 of the last 43 years. So it should not be surprising that Obama's accomplishments marked the narrow limits of the achievable. They triggered a vicious political backlash in the 2010 election, ushered in yet another round of divided government, and may yet prove but short-lived reminders of the young president's aspirations, not permanent features of the American landscape. We are a democracy, and cannot escape the logic of the venerable maxim that we have the government we have chosen and that we deserve. Like it or not, Obama's first term confirmed that our inherited governmental system worked according to its design specifications. The season of effective, vigorous presidential leadership had but the briefest half-life; the wheels of the constitutional machinery designed to hem the president in began to turn almost from his first day in office, as did the gears of our often perversely contradictory political culture. Within two years we had stalemate, and the blame game began in earnest. Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game . But in the last analysis we have no one to blame but ourselves, and our inherited political system -- and we have no plausible reason to expect anything substantially different in Obama's second term. From all appearances we are most probably in for a repeat performance of the last two years: a remarkably disciplined and decidedly intransigent Republican party dominating the House, a paper-thin and fragile Democratic majority in the Senate, and a diminished, dispirited, and check-mated president with little or no room for maneuver -- and this in the face of perhaps the greatest fiscal challenge in the history of the republic, an increasingly volatile international environment, and a raft of unfinished business like devising coherent national energy and immigration policies. So why do we get so overheated about the presidency? Why don't we generate some heat about the antiquated system of which the president is but one, too often hapless, part? What is it about divided government, anyway? If even as committed a change agent as Obama is doomed to four more years of nothing more than Lilliputian, small-beer tinkering; if the self-described greatest power in the world is so powerless to put its house in order, isn't it time for a thorough overhaul of our manifestly antiquated political machinery? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David M. Kennedy.","David Kennedy: Barack Obama's achievements fell short of his aspirations .

"Washington (CNN) -- Call them ""unicorners."" A liberal group says it has collected more than 19,000 e-mails requesting Arizona officials to confirm Mitt Romney is not a unicorn. Without such proof, the group Left Action argues with tongue in cheek, Romney may indeed be a unicorn -- his dark mane hiding a horn -- and therefore ineligible to be on the presidential ballot in November. The farcical campaign mimics efforts by ""birthers,"" and some top supporters of certain Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to continually raise the already-settled issue of whether President Barack Obama meets the Constitution's requirements for citizenship. Romney hits 'magic number' for GOP nomination . ""I feel like we've tried logic with the birthers for too long,"" Left Action founder John Hlinko said Wednesday. ""Now it's time to take their arguments to the logical extreme to show how absurd they are."" While steeped in satire, the unicorn-birther matter touches on deeper issues as Obama and Romney head into the November campaign. Since before Obama's election in 2008, some conservatives have questioned whether he was born in the United States. If not, they said, he was ineligible to serve as president. Despite conclusive evidence to the contrary, the issue has remained alive, nurtured by the conservative blogosphere and getting raised repeatedly by Republican figures. Donald Trump, whose 2011 crusade to unearth details about Obama's origins drew global attention and prompted the White House to release the president's long-form birth certificate, raised the issue again last week. Before campaigning with Romney on Tuesday, Trump bristled when told by CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he was beginning to sound ""a little ridiculous"" for characterizing the question of where Obama was born as a matter of opinion, rather than fact. ""You are, Wolf,"" Trump fired back. ""Let me tell you something, I think you sound ridiculous."" Wolf Blitzer responds to his Donald Trump interview . The Romney campaign appears anxious to distance itself from the birther issue. When asked Monday about Trump's raising it, Romney said he believes Obama was born in the United States. ""You know, I don't agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is, they don't all agree with everything I believe in,"" Romney said. ""But I need to get 50.1% or more, and I'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people."" Obama's campaign jumped on that comment, with deputy manager Stephanie Cutter issuing a statement Tuesday that said Romney's ""continued embrace of Donald Trump and refusal to condemn his disgraceful conspiracy theories demonstrates his complete lack of moral leadership."" Meanwhile, the Romney campaign accused Obama supporters of using the issue to distract attention from the high unemployment rate. Romney surrogate John Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor, went further Wednesday, accusing CNN of deliberately focusing on the birther issue in support of Obama. ""Why is CNN so fixated on this? Why don't we talk about the jobs issue in this country?"" Sununu asked after CNN's Soledad O'Brien raised the birther issue to start an interview. ""It's CNN that wants to bring it up. I don't want to bring it up. Mitt Romney made it clear that he believes that President Obama was born in the United States."" When O'Brien responded that Trump's raising of the birther issue made it a valid question about a possible major contributor to the Romney campaign, Sununu fired back that comedian Bill Maher -- known for politically incorrect commentary -- is a Democratic supporter. ""The fact is that this country has a jobs problem, and supporters of the president like CNN keep wanting to talk about other issues,"" Sununu said. Pressed on the matter by O'Brien, Sununu declared, ""It's not an issue. There is nobody in the Romney campaign that believes that the president was not born in the United States. Donald Trump is wrong. The president is born in the United States."" Hlinko of Left Action called Sununu's pronouncement ""a good start,"" but he called on Romney and other Republican leaders to make that point directly to birthers to halt what he labeled a racism-tinged attempt to delegitimize the nation's first African-American president. ""It is the Republican grass roots and Republican leaders who keep on raising it,"" Hlinko said of the birther issue, adding that Romney and other GOP leaders ""refuse to actively push back."" ""They're not just saying, 'This is nonsense, and it's tinged with racism, and it needs to stop,' "" Hlinko said. While targeted at Romney, the unicorn campaign actually is satirizing last week's justification by Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett for threatening to bar Obama from the November presidential ballot. Bennett, who initially said his office received 1,200 e-mails from Arizonians questioning whether Obama was born in Hawaii, said that he was duty-bound to investigate that public concern. It didn't matter that the White House last year released Obama's long-form birth certificate from Hawaii. Trump and others question whether the document is authentic, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona's Maricopa County -- known for his tough crackdown on illegal immigrants -- has sent a deputy to Hawaii to check it out. Bennett, a co-chairman of Romney's Arizona campaign, defended the request for proof from Hawaii, telling Arizona radio station KTAR last week that ""I don't see anything wrong with verifying something so that as many Arizonans as possible have confidence that the people that appear on the ballot are entitled to be there."" ""If I embarrassed the state, I apologize,"" he said. When Hawaii later provided the requested proof, Bennett announced the matter settled and said Obama would be on the ballot in Arizona as long as he filed all the proper paperwork. Hlinko called the episode ""asinine,"" saying it was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" for inspiring him to launch the Romney-unicorn campaign. He created a website labeled www.MittRomneyisAUnicorn.com and spread the word using his network's Internet connections on Facebook and other sites. ""What about the persistent rumors that Mitt Romney is in fact, a unicorn?"" the website says, using italics for emphasis. ""There has never been a conclusive DNA test proving that Mitt Romney is not a unicorn. We have never seen him without his hair -- hair that could be covering up a horn."" Lampooning the logic of birthers, the website says: ""No, we cannot prove it. But we cannot prove that it is not the case. And if Mitt Romney is or may be a unicorn, he is not constitutionally qualified to be president."" On Wednesday, the website said it had more than 19,000 e-mails supporting an investigation by Bennett into Romney's possible unicorn heritage. Birther theories vary. Some argue Obama was born in Kenya, not Hawaii, and therefore cannot serve as president. Others focus on the fact that Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, supposedly rendering his son ineligible for the Oval Office. Earlier this month, the Iowa state GOP wrote a passage into its proposed party platform calling on presidential candidates to ""show proof of being a natural-born citizen,"" beginning with the 2012 election. ""There are many Republicans who feel that Barack Obama is not a 'natural-born citizen' because his father was not an American when he was born and, therefore, feel that according to the Constitution he's not qualified to be president, should not have been allowed to be elected by the Electoral College or even nominated by the Democratic Party in 2008,"" Don Racheter, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party's platform committee, told Radio Iowa. In addition, Republican Congress members from Florida, Colorado and Missouri have publicly raised questions about Obama's citizenship in recent weeks. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus calls the birther issue a distraction, and Sununu sought to turn the tables on the matter Wednesday by arguing it was the Obama campaign seeking to use the topic to distract. ""I think it's an effort by the Obama administration not to talk about the laws they passed that are strangling specific segments of the American job market,"" Sununu said. To Hlinko, Sununu ""knows in his heart"" that the birther discussion ""is a losing issue."" CNN's Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","A campaign to reveal ""absurd"" logic generates more than 19,000 supporters .

"(CNN) -- Jill Thacker was dying for a cup of coffee when she recently ran into a 7-Eleven convenience store. To her pleasant surprise, the coffee was free -- as long as she would commit to drinking it in either a red Mitt Romney cup or a blue Barack Obama cup. ""Which are you going to choose, Mom?"" her son asked. Which, indeed. A gun-owning, big-government-hating Republican, Thacker's every instinct told her to buy a Romney cup. But Thacker, 56, and her daughter have asthma -- a pre-existing condition -- and with Obama as president they'll be guaranteed the ability to buy insurance. Thacker stood in the 7-Eleven and stared at the red and blue cups, stymied by the choice they represented. 7-Eleven tries to predict presidential election winner . A concrete issue . Perhaps no other election has posed such a difficult personal decision for some conservatives: How do you vote if you're ideologically conservative, but you're benefiting, or stand to benefit, from the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as ""Obamacare""? ""In 2008, health care was a very conceptual, a very theoretical issue,"" said Michael Traugott, a professor of political science and communication at the University of Michigan. ""This year it's very concrete and real."" Some Republicans told CNN they would never vote Democrat, even though they might benefit from Obamacare, while others said they will switch their vote because of health issues. ""The real question is: Could defections in this group make a difference in states where the race is close, such as Virginia, Ohio or North Carolina?"" Traugott said. ""I think in those states it's so tight they could make a difference."" Several groups of people would fare very differently under Romney's health care plan than they do under Obamacare, such as those with preexisting conditions, which can range from anything from back pain to cancer. Between 20% and 50% of all Americans have a preexisting condition, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Obamacare tells insurance companies they can't say no to people with preexisting conditions, or charge them more because of their health issues. According to his website, Romney's health plan calls for ""preventing discrimination"" against people with preexisting conditions as long as they've maintained continuous insurance coverage in the past, but does not define what ""continuous coverage"" means. Young Republicans could also fare differently under Romney's plan. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, some 3.1 million young adults now have health insurance because of Obamacare, which requires insurance companies to allow young adults to stay on their parents' policies up until the age of 26. Before Obamacare, insurance companies in many states took young people off their parents' policies at age 18 or 19. Romney has vowed to repeal Obamacare. In the presidential debate, the former Massachusetts governor said the ""private marketplace"" is already taking care of young adults who want to stay on their parents' plans so the United States doesn't need a government mandate. However, it's not clear that insurance companies will allow young adults to stay on their parents' insurance up until age 26 without a mandate. If Obamacare is reversed, insurance companies ""will make their own decisions about the coverage options they provide,"" according to a statement from America's Health Insurance Plans. The undecided: What will sway them? 'I feel torn' Jon Campbell may become one of the Republican ""defectors"" Traugott says could make a difference in battleground states. Campbell, 49, has voted Republican in nearly every presidential election since he cast his vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980, but this year might be different. For two years his 22-year-old stepdaughter, a self-employed dog trainer, didn't have health insurance. Then Obamacare kicked in and she was allowed onto her father's insurance. ""If something had happened to her during those two years it would have been a disaster,"" Campbell says. The Olathe, Kansas, resident is leaning toward Obama, but not just because of his stepdaughter. Campbell's wife, Barbara, has diabetes and is in the final stages of breast cancer treatment. She's now on his insurance, but if he ever lost his job, his wife would be faced with trying to buy insurance on her own and would surely be rejected. ""I'm really torn,"" he said. ""Because of Obama, I now have a wife who can get covered. But really, at heart, I'm a limited-government kind of guy."" Campbell said if the election were held today, he'd vote for Obama, but not without a lot of reservations. ""It's really an intriguing conundrum,"" he said. Photos: From the campaign trail . 'I'm born to be a Republican' Like Campbell, Sara Nicastro feels conflicted about her vote. A popular diabetes blogger, Nicastro, 31, knew a woman who stopped taking her insulin regularly when she lost her insurance, and Nicastro thinks it might have contributed to her death. Nicastro said she herself would be ""in a pickle"" if she were ever laid off because insurance companies don't want to offer policies to diabetics. Still, Nicastro, a lifelong Republican who lives in south Florida, will vote for Romney in November. She cares about other issues besides health -- most notably the economy -- and she's voted Republican in every election. She even remembers the excitement she felt when she shook Bob Dole's hand at a rally at her high school 16 years ago. ""The Republican party most closely matches the things I value and the beliefs I have,"" she said. ""I'm pretty passionate about it."" Katherine Weaver, who also has diabetes, hasn't considered voting for Obama for even a minute. ""I'm born to be a Republican,"" she said. Weaver, 52, knows it would be difficult if not impossible to buy insurance on her own because of her disease, but she said she's not worried because she has good insurance through her job as a public school teacher in Dallas, where she's worked for 20 years. ""It's very hard to get rid of teachers,"" she said. ""I'm very protective of my job. I document everything I do."" Voter issues . A choice to make . Jill Thacker felt ""weird"" as she stood there in the 7-11 in Sanford, Florida, thinking about which cup to take. She thought about her insurance, which covers her only if ""I get hit by a bus."" It's the only insurance she can afford given her preexisting condition. She thought about how she's still paying off a $22,000 emergency room bill from last year. She thought about her 25-year-old daughter, who's on her father's insurance only because of Obamacare. But she also thought about how, in many fundamental ways, she just doesn't like Obama. Then she reached for the blue cup with Obama's name on it. ""I really do feel conflicted,"" she said. ""But for me, it's all about health care. It's my number one thing."" Did debate make undecided voters more decided? CNN's William Hudson contributed to this story.","Republicans benefiting from 'Obamacare' face a tough choice in November .

"(EW.com) -- To promote her Fox comedy ""Raising Hope"" (which begins its third season October 2), Martha Plimpton pitched a funny idea. ""People are always trying to come up with creative ways of engaging the viewers,"" she tells EW. ""And I thought well, I play a housekeeper on a show, what if I went and cleaned the house of ""Raising Hope's"" biggest fan. In my uniform."" The network thought she was joking, but she was serious. The contest begins today at www.fox.com/cleansweep. Through October 8, fans can enter by submitting their best ""Awkward Family Photo"" and a paragraph stating why their family is just like the Chance family and why they deserve a house call from Martha and her TV husband Garret Dillahunt. Yes, he's coming along to, to make like his character and mow the winner's lawn. (And okay, they'll have professional crews there to help them.) ""Raising Hope"" creator Greg Garcia will select the winner from the top 10 finalists in mid-October, and Plimpton and Dillahunt will get their hands dirty later that month or in early November. Entertainment Weekly: What does this say about your commitment to promoting your show? Martha Plimpton: Well, I think it says a lot about my commitment to promoting the show. [Laughs] It's a funny thing: A lot of people who haven't seen the show yet say they haven't watched because they're not really sure what it is. They think it's about a baby, or that it's extremely dumb or something. But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize. The writing is very, very sharp. If dare I say it, it's a lot more sophisticated underneath. [Laughs] Do you know what I mean? The exterior is really ridiculous and silly, but there's real sophistication in the writing, and I'm really proud to be a part of it. And I think it's really smart, and it makes me laugh. If it makes me laugh, well, I'm sorry, but then it must be good. [Laughs] Because I don't laugh at a lot of things. I'm thrilled that we got a third season. I very much would like for people to enjoy this show as much as I do. I want to share it with the largest amount of people I can. And I will do what is necessary. Muppets: 'Blue Brothers' sing for EW! Clearly. Have you given Greg Garcia any guidelines for choosing the winner? We should stay away from hoarders, crime scenes, and people with too many cats. I'm not bringing a hazmat suit. What's your personal cleaning specialty that fans should be aware of? I am excellent with laundry. For example, as a laundry expert, I never use fabric softener on towels because it makes them less absorbent. I don't know if your readers know this. You should not put Bounce sheets or fabric softener in with your towels. You should dry them separately without fabric softener, so they stay absorbent. And I'm kind of a bed fascist. I don't know if I'll be doing this in the home of our winner, but I like to iron my sheets. I'm that kind of odd person weirdo. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- At 16, gymnast McKayla Maroney has already accomplished enough to give her license for a break. But the gold- and silver-medalist isn't stopping, even while on the mend from a recent injury. Maroney hurt her left leg after suffering a fall during a stop on Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions in September, and she's been recovering slowly but surely, she recently told CNN. One upside to her time away from the tour, though, is that she was able to squeeze in an appearance on The CW's ""Hart of Dixie,"" which returns for a second season Tuesday. Yet for Maroney, it wasn't simply a fun opportunity -- it's part of a larger goal to one day become a working actress. ""I've always wanted to be an actress ... Ever since I was very little, I really liked being in front of a camera. I've always been drawn to it and I've always wanted to pursue it, just like gymnastics,"" she said. ""It's something that you kind of put in your brain and you never let go of. "" With gymnastics being a sport that retires its athletes at a young age, Maroney has been putting all of her energy toward her athletic goals while she has youth on her side. But ""after it's all said and done with the Olympics and Worlds and whatever I get the chance to do, I think that would be my time to really get into acting, something that I want to have as my job when I'm older,"" she said. If there was one actor she looks up to and hopes to pattern her career after, the gymnast said, it'd be Angelina Jolie. ""I really like Angelina Jolie, all the jobs that she's done,"" she said, pointing to Jolie's turn in the action thriller ""Salt"" as a favorite. ""I'm kind of more into movies, because I'm really into getting into [character] and being that person and selling it as well as she always does."" ""I like comedy, I like romantic stuff. I think the movie 'Easy A' is super cute and I love Emma Stone, she's an amazing actress and I love how she does all different sorts of things, and that's what I'd like to do. I'm not one kind of person, and that's the whole thing about being an actress, being able to play all different kind of roles."" And so, with help from an agent she acquired a few months before the Olympics, the 16-year-old champ has been looking for ways to break into the industry. The ""Hart of Dixie"" guest appearance in an upcoming episode came through said agent, and, given that she was momentarily at home from the tour, she went for it. ""It was my first time ever doing anything like that,"" Maroney said. ""Gymnastics, you're in the gym eight hours a day and acting, that's a full-time job as well. So I finally had the time to do it, and I had the best time."" The CW show stars Rachel Bilson (""The O.C."") as Dr. Zoe Hart, a city doctor who's had to adjust to living in small-town Alabama after accepting a job from a physician who left half his practice to her in his will. Maroney will portray the friend of Rose (McKaley Miller), herself a friend of Zoe's. ""Zoe has this guy that she's going on a date with, and Rose really likes this guy, and there's a little bit of drama and I'm kind of backing up Rose,"" Maroney explained. Maroney may be green, but she's without trepidation, saying that learning lines and acting on set felt like it came naturally. ""I've done acting classes before, and school plays, and I've always loved it,"" she added. ""It's weird, I was watching ['Hart of Dixie'] the same day that my agent told me that they might want me on the show. I really like the character Rose on the show ... and I thought if I was ever going to be on the show, I'd really want to play her, and then I ended up being her best friend. So it was really surreal and kind of special."" She's also lined up a guest actor role on ""Pretty Little Liars"" (as a huge fan, she said, ""I kind of always thought that it was Toby"" who was the elusive ""A""), which she hopes to shoot at some point in the future. ""Everything that I'm doing, I love to do. I really just take things one step at a time. Even when things get hard, I just believe that everything happens for a reason,"" she said. ""Life goes on, and you have to make the best of everything. You really do have to enjoy life, because it's short."" But before fans of her athletic prowess fear Maroney's cutting her gymnastics career short in favor of Hollywood, rest assured that she's not done yet. ""Right now, I'm only 16, and gymnastics will always be a part of me,"" she said of her future plans. ""I'm really an athletic person and I don't think I could let go entirely of the sport. I really want to try to go to this next Olympics, [and] after I heal up I'll be back in the gym working as hard as I possibly could just like I did for this Olympics. You can't just say that you want to try ... you have to be focused for whatever you do, just like acting. So I'll really be getting into trying to work for the next Olympics, and in between that I'll be doing, hopefully, little things like what I just did.""","McKayla Maroney snagged an appearance on the CW's ""Hart of Dixie""

"(CNN) -- An argument before the Supreme Court on October 1 in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum will have enormous significance. The case concerns the torture of Ogoni leaders in Nigeria, but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought, the Alien Tort Statute. The United States stands at a crossroads. At its best, our nation has played a crucial role in championing human rights throughout the world and pioneering human rights law. At its worst, it has abandoned its lofty ideals in the name of realpolitik and supported dictators and policies that were responsible for horrible abuses. Passed in 1789, the Alien Tort Statute was a prescient piece of legislation. It allows foreign victims of human rights abuses in foreign nations to seek civil remedies in U.S. courts, and its animating idea -- that people anywhere should have recourse for violations of the ""law of nations"" -- was the foundation of our modern understanding of human rights. In the 1990s, Royal Dutch Petroleum (Shell) had extensive oil drilling operations in the Niger Delta in Nigeria, a region long plagued with poverty, human rights violations and environmental disaster. A popular movement of the Ogoni people resisting what they saw as reckless oil development in the region was violently suppressed by Nigeria's military dictatorship. In the suit, the plaintiffs accuse Royal Dutch Shell of helping the former dictatorship in the arrests on false charges and torture of 12 members of the Ogoni tribe, who sought to peacefully disrupt Shell's operations because of the devastating health and environmental effects of unregulated drilling. All the plaintiffs were themselves tortured except Esther Kiobel, who brought her claims on behalf of her late husband, Barinem Kiobel. Kiobel was executed through a sham trial process in which the plaintiffs believe Shell played a central role. The Supreme Court court accepted Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations. The justices indicated in February that they might question not just the application of the statute to corporations but whether and under what circumstances it applies to any human rights violations, even by individuals, that take place outside the United States. They ordered the case to be re-argued on exactly that question. The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation's historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law. From Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that Eleanor Roosevelt tirelessly worked for, to the stirring oratory of Robert Jackson at the Nuremberg Tribunal, mid-century Americans gave voice and visibility to the idea that all people, everywhere, were entitled to certain fundamental rights. Since 1977, the State Department has annually produced Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The international leadership of the past century is a long way from where we find ourselves now. Our own era is defined by a different legacy: one of waterboarding and ""torture memos,"" extraordinary renditions, indefinite detention at Guantánamo Bay and targeted killings in countries with which we are not at war. ""The United States is abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights,"" Jimmy Carter wrote bluntly in The New York Times in June. Shell Oil must aid Nigeria workers who were tortured, abused . On this grim and morally and legally compromised horizon, the Alien Tort Statute is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy. In a groundbreaking case in 1980, the family of a 17-year-old Paraguayan, Joelito Filártiga, who had been tortured and killed by a henchman of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, brought and won a civil case against his murderer, Americo Peña-Irala. The young man had been tortured to death because his father opposed the government. The ruling established that the statute could be used to hold modern torturers accountable for their actions, wherever they are committed. In the wake of the case, Filártiga v. Peña-Irala, the Alien Tort Statute developed into a new tool in human rights law. Successful cases were brought against government officials, against non-state actors like Radovan Karadžić in Bosnia-Herzegovina and against multinational corporations before the Second Circuit ruling in Kiobel that disallowed that. It is this legacy that is at stake in the Kiobel case before the Supreme Court. The immediate questions before the court on October 1 concern the reach of the Alien Tort Statute and whether it will continue to be possible for people like the Filártigas and the Kiobels to pursue their tormentors and hold them accountable for their heinous acts, and whether corporations can be held to account. But the larger question is: Does the U.S. want to be a leader or a laggard in upholding international human rights? If the statute is narrowed and its promise of universal accountability curtailed, it will rightly be perceived as yet another step by the U.S. away from its once leading advocacy for human rights. If, on the other hand, the Supreme Court upholds the Alien Tort Statute, it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vincent Warren.","Vince Warren: At its best, U.S. has been key in championing universal human rights .

"(CNN) -- Eight people have died from a rare, noncontagious form of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid injections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. In addition, 105 people in nine states have been infected with the illness as a result of the shots, the CDC said. The number of reported cases has increased significantly in recent days as federal and state authorities continue to investigate the outbreak. As many as 13,000 people may have received the medicine between May 21 and September 24, a spokesman for the CDC told CNN. Tennessee is reporting the most number of overall cases, with 35 infections and four deaths, according to the CDC. ""In our state we estimate there are about 1,000 people who we believe are at risk,"" said Tennessee Commissioner of the Department of Health Dr. John Dreyzehner. ""In other words they have potentially received some of the contaminated medication."" He told reporters Monday that because not enough was known about the incubation period for the disease, his department continues to stay in contact with people who might have been exposed. Dreyzehner said there haven't been any new exposures since the department contacted clinics in the state two weeks ago about the contaminated injections. The number of cases grows as the state learns of more people with meningitis, he explained . The fourth death reported in Tennessee on Monday occurred in late September, he said. The patients contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spines with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. What is meningitis? The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. On Saturday, the same pharmacy announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all its other products as well. NECC said that the new recall was being announced out of an abundance of caution and that there is no indication any of its other products are contaminated. The Food and Drug Administration has already asked doctors, clinics and consumers to stop using any of the pharmacy's products. The pharmacy on Wednesday voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the FDA investigation into the contamination is complete. Health officials say 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC. List of medical facilities that received the contaminated injections . Other than Tennessee deaths have been reported in Maryland, Michigan and Virginia. There are also confirmed cases in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio. CDC: State-by-state breakdown of meningitis cases . The other states that received the contaminated products from NECC are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. Federal health inspectors began inspecting the NECC plant last Monday. Inspectors found foreign particles in unopened vials, and after testing one of the unopened vials, they determined the substance was a fungus. The investigation is still under way. Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report. Drugs manufactured by compound pharmacies do not have to go through FDA-mandated premarket approval. Instead, state health pharmacy boards are responsible for the oversight and licensing of these pharmacies. Compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals won't work, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi, according to the CDC. Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, it is not contagious. Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms from other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the CDC says. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. Health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning May 21 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away. The earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive. Patients are treated with anti-fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. Patients may need to be treated for months. The FDA is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the NECC product to report it to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program, by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","NEW: CDC: As many as 13,000 people may have received medicine .

"(EW) -- ""Doom"" may have flopped, and ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" may have been all buzz and no buck, but Disney's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" proved that there is a place for videogame-themed movies at the box office this weekend. The $165 million animated film topped the chart with $49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a Walt Disney Animation production (i.e., not including Pixar titles). Disney's ""Tangled"" opened with a whopping $48.8 million over the more lucrative Thanksgiving weekend in 2010, so ""Wreck-It Ralph's"" slightly larger bow (and its hefty $13,086 per theater average) should be viewed as a major victory for the Mouse House. Now the studio is looking ahead not only to Thanksgiving, but Christmas as well, both huge moviegoing seasons since kids are out of school and parents are off of work. ""There really are few things for families in the time between now and then,"" says Dave Hollis, Disney's Executive Vice President of Domestic Distribution, who cites DreamWorks' ""Rise of the Guardians"" and Disney's own 3-D re-release of ""Monsters, Inc."" as the only animated competition for the rest of 2012. ""[We] have great word-of-mouth and a story that resonates,"" Hollis says. ""We feel really good about where we're headed for the rest of this run."" Disney has every right to feel good. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" earned an ""A"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, and very positive reactions will help the film hold up even better than a typical family film would anyway. The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama ""Flight"" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275. For star Denzel Washington, one of the few actors working today who can legitimately be called a box office draw, ""Flight"" marks his second hit of 2012. His last picture, ""Safe House,"" opened in February with $40.2 million on the way to a $126.2 million finish. While it remains to be seen whether ""Flight"" will fly that high, a finish above $100 million certainly seems likely given the film's strong reviews, awards buzz and ""A-"" CinemaScore grade. Fellow adult-targeting drama ""Argo"" opened substantially lower (with $19.8 million) in substantially more theaters (3,232 to be exact), and, as you'll read in a moment, is headed past the $100 million mark thanks to slim declines. With better per-theater averages and room for expansion, ""Flight"" should enjoy a similar fate. Speaking of ""Argo,"" the Ben Affleck-helmed thriller finished in third place in its fourth weekend, dropping only 15 percent to $10.2 million (anytime a film is still in double digits after four frames, you know it's clicking with crowds). That lifts its total to $75.9 million. Warner Bros.' $45 million investment is proving to have been a smart one — the film is earning massive Oscar buzz and will pass the $100 million mark in the next few weeks. That last Ben Affleck vehicle to gross $100 million was 2003′s ""Daredevil,"" which earned $102.5 million. Welcome back, Affleck! The martial arts picture ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" debuted in fourth place with $8.2 million — certainly not a knockout result, but in line with studio expectations considering American audiences have never consistently taken to flying daggers and karate chops. Fortunately, Universal spent only $15 million on the film, which was directed by RZA. The studio boasted producer Quentin Tarantino's name heavily in advertising, but audiences, which were 64 percent male and 53 percent below the age of 30, didn't take the bait. Those that did see the film weren't especially enthusiastic and issued ""Fists"" a ""C+"" CinemaScore grade. Rounding out the top five was ""Taken 2,"" which fell 22 percent in its fifth frame to $6 million and has now grossed $125.7 million in North America. Though Fox's $45 million sequel will finish a tad below the original ""Taken's"" $145 million domestic finish, it has more than made up for that fact overseas, where ""Taken 2"" has grossed $210.8 million (the original ""Taken"" found $81 million internationally). All told, the Liam Neeson picture has grossed a tremendous $336.6 million worldwide. 1. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" -- $49.1 million . 2. ""Flight"" -- $25.0 million . 3. ""Argo"" -- $10.2 million . 4. ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" -- $8.2 million . 5. ""Taken 2"" -- $6.0 million . The biggest story at the box office this weekend, however, doesn't have anything to do with the domestic chart. ""Skyfall,"" the 23rd James Bond picture, grossed an incredible $156 million this weekend internationally, giving it a remarkable 10-day total of $287 million — by far the best ever initial numbers for the Bond franchise. For perspective, ""Quantum of Solace,"" which finished with $417 million internationally, didn't achieve that total until its fourth week of release. ""Skyfall's"" best market was once again the United Kingdom, where it fell only 21 percent in its second frame to $25.7 million, good for an $85.8 million total. The film's top new market was Germany, where it earned $23.9 million — the best opening of 2012 in that country. ""Skyfall"" debuts in the U.S. next weekend, and taking into account how engaged the rest of the world seems to be by the film (and taking into account its glowing reviews), it's looking increasingly likely that ""Skyfall"" will score the best debut ever for a Bond film — perhaps in the $80 million range.

"(CNN) -- The Etch a Sketch was in full effect at the first presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday night. Mitt Romney put forward a strong performance, transforming back into his 2002 Massachusetts moderate mold, a belated advocate of bipartisan leadership. It would have had a lot more impact if it hadn't contradicted almost every policy statement Romney has made on the campaign trail since he started running for president. This flip-flopping is a force of habit, but it was used to great effect, reflecting a campaign and a candidate finally focused on the general electorate. President Obama, in turn, had an objectively weak debate. The president was more professor than preacher, a budget wonk getting lost in paragraphs of detail rather than concisely punching back. He fulfilled the political truism that incumbent presidents have bad first debates because they are comparatively unprepared and overburdened by budgets and other details of governing -- as President Reagan did in his disastrous first 1984 debate. The trick of communicating policy is to distill it to memorable concise concepts. That happened far too rarely, and when it did, it seemed to be off the cuff, winning Obama points for authenticity but few for debate prep. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race . The audacity of the Etch a Sketch was evident in the first 15 minutes of the debate, when Mitt Romney said, ""I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans."" It was an eye-popping assertion, almost as if the candidate hadn't been listening to his own campaign rhetoric -- especially if you'd been following Romney's campaign rhetoric for the past 18 months or more. (Remember that ""Etch A Sketch"" entered the campaign lexicon in March, when Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom signaled on CNN that Romney could transform his primary campaign message for the general election.) The pattern continued with Romney asserting that after repealing Obamacare, he would advocate the implementation of his own individual mandate plan -- ""And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state"" -- but it would be state by state, along a federalist model. Romney did not hesitate to play the MediScare card -- the most discredited Democrat tactic against entitlement reform, but apparently acceptable if it is done by a Republican trying to win Florida. Happily, for hypocrisy watchers, this move also scored worst with the focus group of undecided voters conducted by CNN's Erin Burnett in Denver during the debate. The litany of flip-flops increased when the candidates' policy positions were pushed for specifics. It was a necessary goal that wasn't aided by the too often unfocused moderation of veteran newsman Jim Lehrer, who did not need a 12th presidential debate under his belt. Among the gaps was the question of whether Romney supports ending ""too big to fail"" -- which might mean breaking up the big banks, and/or restoring safeguards from the 1933 Glass-Steagall banking reform act, repealed in 1999 -- or simply repealing the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which regulates Wall Street. On that issue, as well as on Obamacare, it was not clear what Romney would put in place of the laws he plans to repeal. Romney seemed to indicate he would end oil company subsidies if corporate rates were lowered enough -- that's news to Exxon, I'm guessing. Romney said Obama should have backed the Bowles-Simpson Commission's deficit reduction proposals (I agree), but did not back the recommendations of that panel himself. Opinion: Romney wasn't stellar, but Obama fell short . He advocated a balanced deficit reduction plan but refused to raise any revenue -- and perhaps unwisely said he'd kill ""Sesame Street"" icon Big Bird in the process. His enthusiasm for budget cutting does not square with his commitment to increasing military spending to 4% of GDP. Likewise, he wasn't pressed -- by Obama or Lehrer -- to specify the loophole closures which Romney said would make his 20% tax cuts revenue-neutral for top income earners. Whenever Lehrer did try to assert himself as a moderator, Romney reflexively bristled -- he is not a man who likes being told he has to conform to other people's rules. The president's strategic decision to try to find rhetorical common ground on policy at the outset came across as passive rather than conciliatory. His correct pressing on the fact that many of Romney's stated economic plans ""do not add up"" got lost in paragraphs rather than topic sentences. To be fair, Obama had a few good lines -- dismissing Romney's economic plan by saying ""math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth."" His pushback on Wall Street reform was also memorable: ""Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Gov. Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe."" But Romney exceeded expectations and put forward a confident debate performance that was especially impressive given its disregard for his own past policy positions. Romney shone in the moments he discussed the generational theft of deficits and debt. In contrast, Obama did not come ready for combat, even in a Jed Bartlett egghead way. Assessments of presidential debate performances tend to evolve over the next day, reflecting a combination of spin, fact-checking and conventional wisdom. This first debate will be subject to the same evolution, as partisans on both sides try furiously to spin the debate in their direction. A flip-flop ad, contrasting past statements with debate statements, could be effective for either campaign. It's worth remembering that many swing voters who have lives were watching the high-stakes season-ending baseball games, instead of obsessively trolling Twitter for debate commentary. Opinion: It wasn't just Romney who won . In the search for honest brokers -- patriots, not partisans -- we can only hope that the truth, ever elusive, will win out in the end, because we ultimately get the government we deserve.

"(CNN) -- A backpack bomb discovered last week along a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade route in Spokane, Washington, contained a chemical found in rat poison and was packed with little metal pellets, apparently as shrapnel, a law enforcement official said Thursday. The device was set up to be detonated remotely, the official told CNN. The bomb is being examined in the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. Authorities don't have a suspect and don't know whether the bomb was linked to a white supremacist group, the official said. Before the King march kicked off last week, three parade workers found the gray backpack on a bench at the northeast corner of North Washington Street and West Main Avenue in downtown Spokane. No threat was made before the device was found, and no note was found with the backpack, authorities said. The FBI said last week it will consider regional neo-Nazi activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb. Two T-shirts were found in the Swiss Army-brand backpack, authorities said. One shirt says ""Treasure Island 2009"" and the other reads ""Stevens County Relay For Life June 25th-26th 2010."" Frank Harrill, special agent in charge of the FBI's Spokane field office, said last week that authorities know of no link to ""any specific group or individuals"" and called reports linking the bomb to recent neo-Nazi activity in a nearby Idaho town ""premature."" The bureau is looking into the incident as ""an act of domestic terrorism,"" and investigators are analyzing ""every square millimeter"" of the backpack, Harrill said. Tony Stewart, one of the founders of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, told CNN last week that he found the timing of the planted bomb and two recent neo-Nazi activities in Coeur d'Alene ""just too overwhelming"" and suggested hatred was also behind the Spokane bomb. Coeur d'Alene is 35 miles east of Spokane. But Stewart had no evidence tying the Spokane bomb to the two activities in Coeur d' Alene. Earlier this month, a handful of neo-Nazis protested two Mexican restaurants with signs saying, ""This is white land"" and ""We want you out of here,"" he said. Then, during the evening of the King holiday, about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene, Stewart said. About the Spokane bomb discovery, Stewart said: ""It's clear that it was an attempt to end the march and attack human rights advocates. ""All three events were going on when there was a reaction by the white supremacists or hate groups in some way,"" specifically at the two Coeur d'Alene events, Stewart said. ""We don't know who did it, but there was certainly a reaction to human right events."" The Coeur d'Alene area had been a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity through the Aryan Nations and Order II hate groups since at least the 1970s, though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000, Stewart said. Several bombings in Coeur d'Alene in the 1980s, including at the home of a Catholic pastor and priest who was also serving as president of the human relations task force, were blamed on the Order II, Stewart said. The priest wasn't injured in that bombing, he said. A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. The FBI is asking the public for information on who might have been seen with the backpack from about 8 a.m. to 9:25 a.m. on the King holiday, January 17. It also is asking for photos or videos taken in the area. CNN's Carol Cratty and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","The backpack bomb also contained metal pellets, the official says .

"(CNN) -- A day before Tuesday's election, millions of people in key states already had cast absentee or early ballots despite long lines, legal disputes over poll procedures and damage inflicted by Superstorm Sandy. In Ohio, which may be the decisive battleground state, the deadline for early voting passed Monday afternoon. By Friday, more than 1.6 million of Ohio's 7.9 million registered voters had cast ballots, either in person or by mail, said Matt McClellan, a spokesman for Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. About 200,000 of the 1.3 million absentee ballots that had been distributed were still out, he said. Election officials are already facing a lawsuit over how provisional ballots -- issued to people whose eligibility to vote at a particular precinct was in question, or if they requested an absentee ballot but didn't return one -- should be filled out. Opinion: America's voting system is a disgrace . State law says poll workers need to note a voter's drivers' license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number on the ballot. But left-leaning groups say instructions Husted issued to election officials on Friday appear to indicate that writing down those digits is the voter's job, not the poll worker's, and warn that could result in votes being thrown out when provisional ballots are counted November 17. A federal judge has set a hearing for Wednesday on the issue. But Husted, a Republican, said on Sunday that the process ""is consistent with the courts and consistent with the law."" ""We believe that this is the best way to make elections run successfully so that the most votes are counted,"" he said. ""We believe it's consistent with the law. We believe it's the right way to run elections in Ohio."" Husted had already been taken to court for trying to cut off early voting in the three days before Tuesday, with Democrats accusing him of trying to suppress the votes of Democratic-leaning constituencies. Husted called that ""an absurd notion."" ""The rules are the same for everybody,"" he said. ""They don't target any one group or individual. What we're trying to do is to make the system run fair and smooth for everybody."" Other eyes were on Florida, another vote-rich state where polls show President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney running neck-and-neck. CNN Poll of Polls . There were still long lines for early voting when the deadline passed over the weekend, so election officials in the state's most populous belt -- Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties -- allowed voters to pick up, fill out and submit absentee ballots. In Miami, the lines snaked around the block from the office of the county supervisor of elections ahead of a Monday afternoon deadline. Oscar Silvia said he cast a ballot within 20 minutes during early voting last week -- but when he came back to pick up an absentee ballot for his son, he spent more than three hours in the queue. ""It's normal. It's election time,"" Silvia told CNN. ""No other option -- you do what you have to do."" Melinda Soliz spent more than four hours in line. But since she had been in a similar line four years ago, she had planned for a long wait. Tuesday, she predicted, ""is going to be worse."" ""I am really tired, but it is worth it,"" Soliz said. ""Thank God it isn't every day."" Florida Republicans, led by Gov. Rick Scott, had pushed to cut the number of days available for early voting from 14 to eight. Democrats went to court to get that period extended, arguing the polling facilities in south Florida, a Democratic stronghold, weren't up to the demand. In the Northeast, the states hit hardest by Superstorm Sandy were trying to make accommodations for people who had been displaced by the storm or whose normal poling places had been knocked out of commission. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he has signed an executive order allowing people displaced by Sandy to go to any ""approximate polling place,"" sign an affidavit add cast their votes for president, U.S. Senate or other races that would have been on the ballot in their own precincts. ""We want everyone to vote,"" Cuomo said. ""Just because you're displaced doesn't mean you should be disenfranchised."" Lawrence Norden, an election expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said he believes Cuomo's move is allowable under state election laws. ""This is probably not ideal,"" said Norden, the deputy director of the Democracy Program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center. ""But given the dire circumstances, people should be allowed to cast their ballots."" Norden said it would be ""hard to imagine what the objection could be,"" but said there is one potential downside: Voters might be left with the mistaken impression that they could vote on local issues or races in another district. And voters in some counties may get another day to cast ballots if the disruptions prevent enough citizens from showing up, state Board of Elections spokesman Thomas Connolly said Sunday. County election officials could ask to allow another day of voting if Tuesday's turnout is less than 25%, he said. The state board would consider the request and, if approved, a second day of voting would be scheduled within 20 days of Tuesday, he said. New Jersey lets Sandy victims vote via e-mail . Polls would be open for 11 hours on the second day, with only those who were eligible to vote on Tuesday allowed to cast ballots. Nassau County Elections Commissioner William Biamonte expects a ""significant drop-off"" in the turnout on Long Island, which saw extensive flooding when the storm hit October 29. In New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall, residents displaced by the storm will be allowed to vote by e-mail or fax, the first time civilians have been allowed to cast ballots remotely. New Jersey's announcement allows people who have been forced to leave their communities, as well as emergency workers working with disaster-relief efforts away from home, to do the same. ""This isn't like, 'Hell, I feel like staying at work tonight, let me fax my vote in.' No, no, no,"" Gov. Chris Christie told reporters Sunday. ""This is if you have been displaced from your home by the storm. This is also not, 'I got evicted for not paying rent -- I'd like to vote by fax.' No."" The state is also consolidating polling places that have lost power or are cut off with others that are up and running, said Ernest Landante, a spokesman for New Jersey Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno. In many states, remote electronic voting is already available to members of the military and U.S. citizens living overseas. But experts have raised concerns about the security of electronic voting in the past. New Jersey officials did not explain how they will authenticate e-mails or faxes from voters. But Christie quipped Sunday that there would be ""no more voter fraud in New Jersey than usual."" ""Nothing's different because we're giving people different modes to be able to vote,"" he said. ""I don't think it's any more susceptible to fraud than the system is already."" And anyone who tries ""better hope they don't get caught, because if they do, we'll make an example of them."" The presidential race isn't expected to be close in New York or New Jersey, both longtime Democratic strongholds in national politics. Know your polling place . And offshore, the Navy said it would help any sailors and Marines aboard the helicopter carrier USS Wasp who had planned to vote on Tuesday get their ballots cast. The ship had been at sea on a training mission when Sandy formed, and it was then dispatched to the New York/New Jersey area to assist with relief efforts. Many of the roughly 1,100 aboard were registered to vote in their hometowns rather than in the counties around the ship's homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, so their votes had likely been cast and mailed already. For those registered in Virginia, the Navy is working to get them a federal write-in ballot that will be transferred back to shore, Lt. Commander Chris Servello told CNN. CNN's John Zarrella, Kim Segal, Ram Ramgopal, Larry Shaughnessy, Jason Kessler, Bill Mears, Don Lemon and Brandon Griggs contributed to this report.","NEW: New York governor says voters can cast ballots in any precinct .

"(CNN) -- Both parties have received an electoral politics wake-up call, courtesy of a diversifying America. President Obama won re-election thanks in part to a 52-percentage-point spread among Latino voters, the nation's fastest-growing electorate, according to election eve polling. In the America coming over the horizon, it is practically impossible to overcome such a number and win the race for president. According to the polling by Latino Decisions, Hispanic voters nationally and across every battleground state swung heavily to Democrats. And it wasn't even close. Nationwide, the margin was 75% to 23%. And there were remarkable spreads in the tightest of swing states: 87% to 10% in Colorado, 82% to 17% in Ohio, 66% to 31% in Virginia. (CNN's own poll showed a smaller but still significant spread nationwide -- 71% to 21% -- and in the swing states). Even in Florida, with its large, Republican-leaning Cuban population, the Latino Decisions poll found that Latinos overall favored the president 58% to 40%. While these trends worked to Democrats' advantage on the ground on Tuesday, that's not entirely good news: A demographically challenged Republican Party is bad for America. As a nation, we are at our best when both parties work together to address difficult policy issues. And, in the case of immigration -- an issue of great concern to Latinos -- a bipartisan roadmap is good politics and great policy. Bringing the country together around a common-sense immigration process is not a bridge too far. In fact, while partisan politics dominated the national debate, faith, law enforcement and business leaders have worked with immigrant leaders across the political spectrum to forge a new consensus on immigrants and America. People who hold a Bible want change. ""Christians can agree on basic values to guide our decisions and help heal our land,"" Luis Cortes, president of Esperanza, a Latino faith-based aid organization, said in a recent radio ad -- in which he shared air time with Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. It's not every day that the leader of one of the nation's largest Hispanic evangelical networks stands shoulder to shoulder with a Southern Baptist and presents a unified message. People who wear a badge also want reform. At a recent Midwest summit on immigration, Lake County, Illinois Sheriff Mark Curran said, ""We don't need higher deportation levels; we need to fix the system as it exists."" And job creators, people who own businesses, are yearning for common-sense reforms too. We know we need to find a solution when Larry Wooten, president of the North Carolina Farm Bureau, says, ""The longer national political leaders ignore the issue or use it as a political wedge, the more our farmers suffer because they cannot find a sufficient labor pool to harvest their crops."" Post-election talk will focus on the president's mandate. Immigration is different from other issues because the mandate for reform is clear, and it's not only because of his vote margin among Latinos.

"(CNN) -- A 23-year-old exchange student, attacked in her Toronto apartment while a friend in China watched via computer webcam, was found dead there hours later, police say. Toronto Police on Monday identified the student as Qian (Necole) Liu of Beijing. She was talking early Friday morning to a male friend from home when a man allegedly knocked on her door, asking to use her phone, police said in a news release. The online witness said he saw Liu and the unknown man struggle for a time before the attacker turned off her laptop, the news release said. The friend in China then started a desperate bid to find out what happened, CNN-affiliate CTV reported. Ten hours later, police arrived at the basement apartment to find Liu's body, naked from the waist down. Her laptop was missing. ""It was obvious that she had been dead for some period of time,"" Detective Sgt. Frank Skubic said in the news release. The cause of the death is yet to be determined, the news release said. There were no obvious signs of sexual assault or severe physical trauma, and police are awaiting toxicology reports, it said. Police are unsure whether Liu, an exchange student at York University, knew the man. The attacker was described as white, age 20 to 30, 6 feet tall, weighing 175 to 200 pounds, with a muscular build and medium-length brown hair, and wearing a blue crew-neck T-shirt. With no suspects and no one in custody, police have been questioning neighbors, CTV reported. A cell phone found in the apartment is also undergoing forensic examination, police said. York University President Mamdouh Shoukri released a statement saying, ""Qian's death is a terrible tragedy and our entire community mourns the loss of a promising young student."" Liu's family is currently on their way to Canada from China, CTV reported. A call to police seeking further comment was not immediately returned. This is not the first time a crime has been captured by webcam. In the most notorious incident, Meleanie Hain of Lebanon, Pennsylvania was shot dead in 2009 while talking to a friend via webcam. The friend was looking away when he heard a shot and a scream, police said. Upon looking back at the screen, the friend saw Hain's husband firing a handgun at where his wife had been, they said. Police later found both Hain and her husband dead in their home.","A friend in China sees the woman attacked in her Toronto apartment .

"(CNN) -- Around the world, media reaction to the Democrats' victory has poured in, as newspapers and broadcasters reflect on the Barack Obama campaign and the global impact his win will have. A woman picks up a copy of a newspaper in Sydney, Australia . The International Herald Tribune said that America had ""leaped"" across the color line, calling Obama ""a 47-year-old black man who made history both because of his race and in spite of it."" The Times of London said Obama had revitalized U.S. politics. ""The immense turnout in yesterday's election was testament to the energy, excitement and expectations of a rejuvenated American democracy, as well as the fears of a nation standing at a crossroads of history,"" the paper said. It added that Obama's inheritance would be challenging. ""The new president faces economic and social convulsions at home, conflict abroad."" Also in London, The Guardian focused on the historic nature of the Democrats' win, saying: ""Victory in the end came as easily as the polls had predicted,"" and comparing Obama's achievement with Roosevelt's of 1932 and Reagan's of 1980. In Germany, Der Spiegel's Gregor Peter Schmitz, writing from Chicago, called Obama's rise ""astonishing,"" adding that his ""curious ability to remain untouched by all the razzmatazz around him is likely to prove a source of strength."" Al Jazeera said Obama had ""surfed to power on a wave of voter discontent generated by the failures of President George Bush and the Republican Party"" and added that he faces ""unique challenges."" It continued that he must ""act quickly"" to restore confidence in the economy and with his country ""sick of war"" is ""unlikely to make any additional major overseas military commitments."" The Jerusalem Post said that the transition in Middle Eastern policy from the Bush administration to Obama's would be ""'evolutionary, not revolutionary,' according to diplomatic assessments in Jerusalem."" Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz called the U.S. election an ""example of democracy at its best,"" citing Americans' ""plethora of opportunities"" to learn about the candidates' policies and stance on key issues. It also paid tribute to Obama's unifying influence, saying, ""Whites and blacks, Jews and Muslims, all decided to give their votes to a candidate who is young, black and lacking in governmental experience,"" and expressed its hope that the President-elect would ""rehabilitate the status of a superpower that remains unrivaled in its influence over the peace and welfare of all humanity."" Jordan's English daily, The Jordan Times, wrote an article entitled: ""The American leader we need,"" in which the writer said: ""Around the world, America's presidential election campaign has attracted as much attention as domestic political controversies in each of our own countries. The interest the world has taken in America's vote is the best example of America's soft power, and a lesson in democracy from the world's only superpower. If only we could all vote as well as watch and listen, because the outcome is vital for everyone around the world."" UAE Arabic daily, Al Khaleej considered in its editorial that ""whoever is the winner, Israel had guaranteed that the White House will be biased to her."" In Tunisia, the Arabic daily Al Chourouk said: ""Today America elects ""The President of the World."" China Daily wished Obama well, saying that although it was elated at his landslide win, he faced ""daunting challenges."" It cited the economic crisis and the Iraq war as the driving factors behind the Democrats' victory, adding: ""We have every reason to anticipate a more cooperative and talk-savvy new America."" And The Asia Times heralded the ""End of a subprime era,"" calling the Bush administration ""classic American salesmen"" for whom ""selling was their passion."" The Times of India called Obama an ""advocate of strong partnership with India,"" saying the President-elect had ""made it clear India poses no threat to Pakistan."" But it also expressed concern about Obama's references to discouraging outsourcing, a policy it says would have an adverse effect on India. The Kenya Times said Kenyans were ""exuberant"" and called Obama ""the foremost blaze-trailing son of this land,"" adding that ""[he] has convincingly shown that the world could be better through diplomacy than intimidation and arm-twisting tactics."" Japanese news agency Kyodo said Obama's task to repair the economy was ""daunting,"" saying the American sub-prime meltdown had ""sent global financial markets into a tailspin."" In Russia, Pravda was ecstatic, announcing that ""Eight years of hell are over."" It proceeded to catalog George W. Bush's perceived failures and slights against Russia and criticized the cost of the ""grand American soap opera"" during a time of economic crisis. Over in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald paid tribute to the Obama campaign, calling it a ""stunning grassroots political movement, powered by massive multi-million dollar fundraising."" It said his ""stunning ascent"" to the leadership of a nation ""still riven by racial divides"" would close an ""eight-year era of turbulence under Bush.""","Global media heralds the end of the Bush administration and the dawn of a new age .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian soccer club Al Ahly snatched a late equalizer against Tunisia's titleholders Esperance on Sunday to leave the African Champions League final in the balance. The Cairo club will travel to Tunis for the second leg on November 17 thankful for the 88th-minute leveler from substitute El-Sayed Hamdy, who canceled out a valuable away goal by Waleed Hichri. The match was played at an army stadium near Alexandria due to the security problems faced since 74 fans died in February's Port Said tragedy during a match involving Al Ahly and Al Masry. Some 20,000 spectators were allowed to attend -- only the second time since the deaths that a match in Egypt has not been played behind closed doors.

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- A hundred and fifty-five Warriors from Booker T. Washington High School received a diploma Monday -- and a handshake from the president of the United States. ""Just a couple of years ago, this was a school where only about half the students made it to graduation. For a long time, just a handful headed to college each year,"" President Barack Obama pointed out in his address to the students. The school's dramatically improved graduation rate was one reason the president came to Memphis on a cool spring day. Booker T. Washington High is credited with a jump in graduation rate from 55% to 82 % in just four years through the use of gender-based classrooms and increased teacher effectiveness. Teachers who seemed to get more than a year's growth out of their students were moved to the core classes of English and mathematics as part of the school's educational innovation. ""Because you created this culture of caring and learning, today we are standing in a very different Booker T. Washington High School. Today, this is a place where more than four out of five students are earning a diploma -- a place where 70% of the graduates will continue their education,"" Obama said. The president has set a goal of having the largest percentage of college graduates in the world by the year 2020. Booker T. Washington is an inner-city school in a low-income neighborhood with high incidents of teenage pregnancy and violence. ""I gave Barack Obama a hug,"" happy graduate Markeshia McKinney said after the ceremony. For her success, she credited her hard work and not falling behind in her schoolwork. McKinney said she plans to take care of her baby that is due in a few weeks for the short term, and go to college in the long term. Graduate Catron Roland attributed his success in school to his teachers, who he said pushed him to succeed. ""When I tried to quit, they told me not to, and to come to school every day,"" he said. The students knew Obama would speak to them from the stage during their graduation ceremony, but the president surprised them by visiting them in their holding room prior to the ceremony. The students, bedecked in green-and-yellow caps and gowns, erupted in applause and tears of joy when the president appeared to tell them how inspired he was with their accomplishment of graduating high school. ""A lot of you had to struggle to get here. Most of you weren't born with a silver spoon in your mouth,"" he told them. ""What you have shown is determination, what you have shown is character, what you have shown is a willingness to work hard, and the ability to steer clear of folks that were trying to send you down the wrong path."" The students earned the visit from Obama by winning the Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, a high school competition in its second year in which high school students write essays and create videos to show how their school is innovative in education. ""In the face of all odds against them succeeding, they are succeeding. That represents the American spirit at it's best,"" said Kriner Cash, Memphis superintendent of schools.","NEW: ""I gave Barack Obama a hug,"" one student proclaims .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad insists he will ""live and die"" in Syria, even as countries offer him safe passage in exchange for halting a gruesome civil war. ""I'm not a puppet, and I was not made by the West to go to the West or to any other country,"" he told Russia Today TV. ""I am Syrian. I was made in Syria and to live and die in Syria."" He also made an ominous threat against foreign intervention, saying it would have a ""domino impact"" on the world. ""I think that the cost of foreign invasion of Syria, if it happened, would be greater than one that the whole world can afford,"" he told Russia Today. ""Because if there were problems in Syria, particularly as we are the last bastion of secularism, stability and coexistence in the region, it will have a domino impact that will affect the world from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. ""And you know its implications on the rest of the world. I do not think that the West is moving in this direction, but if they do, no one can predict what will happen after."" Al-Assad's comments came after British Prime Minister David Cameron broached the idea of giving him ""safe passage"" if that's what it takes to stop the bloodshed in Syria. 50 Syrian soldiers killed in suicide bombing, opposition says . ""Anything, anything to get that man out of the country and to have a safe transition in Syria,"" Cameron told Al-Arabiya TV. ""Of course I would favor him facing the full force of international law and justice for what he's done. I am certainly not offering him an exit plan to Britain, but if he wants to leave, he could leave; that could be arranged."" Even Tunisia, the first country in the region last year to oust its longtime ruler, has offered asylum to al-Assad in an attempt to prevent further violence. Meanwhile, a prominent Syrian opposition group and Western leaders are trying to unite the opposition to form an alternative to al-Assad's government. But while the Syrian National Council is trying to maintain a majority rule in unification efforts, the West is trying to dilute the group's dominance. Once viewed by Western countries as ""a legitimate representative of the Syrian opposition,"" the SNC scrambled to regroup after Western leaders said it should no longer be the face of the Syrian rebellion. The SNC announced the formation of a ""national conference"" in which ""all opposition groups participate, with SNC having the highest percentage of representation."" Syrian rebels blame 'heinous' executions on 'extremists' ""The National Conference shall consist of 300 participants from the SNC, local councils in the liberated areas, defected technocrats, independent opposition groups and national armed resistance groups under the umbrella of the (rebel) Free Syrian Army,"" the group said. Representatives from Britain, France, the United States and Turkey are meeting in Qatar Thursday to try to ensure Syria's opposition is represented by more than just the Syrian National Council. ""Our objective is to encourage Syria's opposition groups to unite around a vision for a democratic and stable Syria,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""This is necessary to offer the Syrian people a credible alternative to the Assad regime and to achieve an inclusive political transition that ends the appalling bloodshed and reflects the will of the Syrian people."" Meanwhile, Turkey urged the international community to do more to support Syrian-led efforts to resolve the crisis, and warned against further delay. ""There is not a moment to lose,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told delegates in Doha, Qatar, Thursday, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency. The Doha meeting comes after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the SNC -- which consists largely of expatriates -- should no longer be considered the ""visible leader"" of efforts to form a new government. Clinton said the opposition must include seats for ""those who are on the front lines fighting and dying today.""

""There are a number of blind spots where we know no aid has reached the population."" Aid workers have to contend with a complex situation and obstacles on the ground that include security threats and military or bureaucratic restrictions on access, ICRC spokeswoman Carla Haddad Mardini said. ""We try to fill the cracks which open, and whenever we have an opportunity to deliver aid, we go ahead,"" Maurer said. At least 64 people have died in Syria so far Thursday, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition activist network. Of those, 22 were killed in Damascus and its suburbs, the LCC said. A car bomb exploded in Sayda Zainab, a neighborhood in the Damascus countryside, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. There was no immediate information on how many people were killed. Saida Zaynab is home to a historic Shia shrine that draws thousands of pilgrims every year. Fighting between loyalist Syrian forces and fighters from the Free Syrian Army also raged along Syria's border with Turkey, leading Turkish authorities to close schools in the border town of Ceylanpinar. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said at least 10 rebels and 16 Syrian troops were killed on the Syrian side of the border, in Hasaka province. Some rebels entered Syria from Turkey and engaged the Syrian army in clashes, the group said. At the same time, Turkish President Abdullah Gul said his country was drawing up contingency plans with the NATO military alliance to fortify its border with Syria. Turkey mulls defensive measures on Syrian border . Gul told reporters Thursday that because of the ongoing civil war in Syria and its possible repercussions for NATO member Turkey, every measure was being considered to counter the risks. Turkish and international media have reported in recent days those options include the installation of Patriot missiles along the border, something Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied Wednesday. Several stray mortar rounds and a tank shell landed Thursday in the Golan Heights -- captured by the Jewish state from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War -- as a result of fighting inside Syria, according to the Israeli military.

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government launched a major military operation Monday, sending thousands of troops into the town where the country's uprising began to carry out what witnesses described as a brutal, wider-scale crackdown. The United States threatened sanctions against the country, calling for a halt to Syria's ""deplorable"" actions. At the United Nations, a draft statement condemning the violence was being circulated among security council members, a U.N. diplomat said. Between 4,000 and 5,000 members of the Army and security forces equipped with tanks raided the southern city of Daraa just after 4 a.m. and began shooting indiscriminately, in some cases shooting into homes as people slept, according to an activist with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Seven people were confirmed killed in the city, the activist said. Other witnesses described a trail of dead bodies in the streets. ""Ambulances could not help the injured because of the snipers and army officers who are deployed all over the city,"" one witness in Daraa said. ""They shoot on anything that moves."" A military official -- the second commander in a brigade that entered Daraa -- defected over the violence, according to the activist with the human rights group and another opposition source. The commander was then arrested, the activist said. The Syrian government had a different account of events in Daraa. ""In response to the calls for help from the citizens of Daraa and their appeal to the Armed Forces as to intervene and put an end to the operations of killings, vandalism, and horrifying (actions) by extremist terrorist groups, some army units entered ... Daraa to restore tranquility, security and normal life,"" state-run news agency SANA reported, citing an official army source. Several members of such groups were arrested and ""huge quantities of weapons and ammunitions"" were confiscated, the government said, adding that confrontations ""caused the martyrdom"" of some members of the army and security forces as well as deaths and injuries among ""some members of the extremist terrorist groups."" In the Damascus suburb of Douma, security forces were out on the streets and arrested numerous people, a witness said, comparing the city to a prison. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman summoned Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha on Wednesday to express concern about the violence in Syria, State Department officials said. The United States is preparing new sanctions against members of Bashar al-Assad's regime who are overseeing the violent crackdown, according to several senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the action. A new Treasury Department executive order targeting senior officials accused of human rights abuses would involve an asset freeze and travel ban, as well as prohibiting them from doing business in the United States. ""The Syrian people's call for freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly and the ability to freely choose their leaders must be heard,"" Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said in a statement. A U.N. diplomat said a draft security council statement sponsored by France, Portgual, and the United Kingdom condemned the violence and called for restraint. It also supported Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's call for an independent investigation on the matter. The draft was to be formally introduced Monday, and a final statement could be agreed upon by Tuesday, the diplomat said. U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay issued a statement saying Syria has offered ""paper reforms followed by violent crackdowns on protesters."" Her office has received a list naming 76 people killed on Friday during evidently peaceful marches, but the number may be much higher, Pillay's office said. The office is also looking into reports of 13 people killed in funeral processions Saturday. Anti-government protests that have taken hold in many parts of Syria began in Daraa last month following a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti. Protesters have asked for freedom and regime reform, and public discontent with al-Assad's government has mounted. Activists also want the easing of the ruling Baath Party's power and a law that would permit the establishment of independent political parties. In recent days, witnesses in Syria had told CNN they want the security apparatus, which includes Syria's secret intelligence operatives, dissolved, and would rather see the army take to the streets. They believed the army would be friendlier to protesters, as was the case in the Egyptian uprising earlier this year, but video from Syria on Monday showed what appeared to be members of the army carrying out al-Assad's crackdown. The activist with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian forces occupied two mosques and a graveyard, and snipers were located on rooftops. Another witness also described the onslaught of tanks invading Daraa. ""Before dawn prayers, around 4:30 a.m., the Syrian security forces broke into Daraa,"" the witness said. ""There were so many tanks that entered the city from its four corners. People were heading to mosques when the attack started. People in mosques started warning the people through loudspeakers, but the gunfire had already started."" Witnesses added that ambulances were not allowed into the city and that electricity and phone lines were down. None of the witnesses wanted their names used for fear of reprisals. CNN has not been allowed into Syria and is unable to verify independently the witness accounts. Douma was surrounded by security forces Monday, not by the military, a witness told CNN. They seemed to be in every alley in the city, preventing people's movements and carrying out arrests, the witness said, adding that 15 of his friends were arrested. Following morning prayers, intense gunfire was heard in the city, the witness said, adding that he did not see casualties in his vicinity but did not know about other areas in Douma. Cautious calm followed later in the day, he said. Shops were closed, and people were frightened, the witness said, comparing it to ""living in a big prison cell."" ""As we woke up in the morning we started hearing that the Syrian security forces are arresting people randomly in (Douma),"" activist and human rights lawyer Razan Zaytouni said from Damascus. ""Many of these men are our colleagues and friends. I do not know the exact number yet because telephones are down. We are contacting our fellow activists through other ways other than telephones ... we are worried we cannot know their destiny."" Monday afternoon, Jordan Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh confirmed to CNN that Syrian authorities have closed off the border with Jordan. Because Daraa lies on the border, sealing it makes it difficult for besieged residents to flee the military offensive. The Syrian government has accused protesters of shooting at security forces, while opposition activists and demonstrators accuse the government of killing demonstrators. The Syrian government and security forces have been largely silent over the past month and generally speak only through state media. There was no immediate word from the Syrian leadership about the reports from Daraa on Monday. SANA reported Monday that ""seven martyrs who were killed in Nawa near Daraa by armed criminal groups were laid to rest."" So were two ""martyrs"" killed in Moathamia, in the Damascus countryside, the report said, citing ""an official source at the General Command of the Syrian Army and Armed Forces."" A military doctor ""said that the martyrs' bodies had signs of mutilation that defies all humane principles, and that the firearm injuries were made to the head, torso, back and limbs of the victims, and that the bodies were mutilated with knives and sharp implements afterwards,"" the report said. ""The towns of Soda and Shas in Tartous, Syrian coast, escorted three of its sons who were martyred at the hands of armed criminal groups in Jobar near Damascus at Souk al-Hal while marketing their crops,"" the report said. ""The criminals intercepted them and shot them to death, then mutilated their bodies afterwards."" The report added that the ""martyrs' relatives affirmed that the Syrian people are aware of the conspiracy targeting Syria and that they will confront it, expressing pride that their sons were martyred.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Although domestic issues may continue to dominate the presidential campaign, eventually the candidates will be called upon to give a comprehensive view of U.S. national security interests and defend those views in a presidential debate. Americans will want to know: What is each candidate's vision of America's role in the world and which candidate is better suited to be our commander in chief? The stakes are high, even if public attention is not. The Middle East is quaking from a cascade of revolutions. Iran is inching ever closer to having a nuclear bomb. China is rising, prompting countries across the region to both engage with it and hedge against it. Al Qaeda's power has shattered, yet its fragments remain dangerous. Sustained economic growth is transforming countries across Africa and Latin America, while Brazil, Turkey and India grow in global influence. Europe appears to be turning inward, as financial crises create economic constraints and political turmoil. Global energy markets are changing dramatically, with the United States now importing more than twice as much oil from the Western Hemisphere as it does from the Persian Gulf. Whatever the outcome of the November election, America's next president must confront these changes. At a time of fiscal constraint and political divisiveness, the next president and his administration must lay out a vision that matches national means to national ends -- in other words, a grand strategy. Grand strategies assess the international and domestic environments, define U.S. interests in these environments and recommend ways and means to secure those interests. They explain America's role in the world and how to think about that role. And they provide a vision for how America should build and marshal all the relevant elements of national power and leverage assets in one area to achieve goals in another. They are a map for getting things done. As President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney articulate their respective grand strategies, they will need to confront five big questions about U.S. national security: . 1. What are the most significant threats and opportunities facing the United States? How serious and immediate is the threat posed by Iran? Is terrorism still the greatest threat to the United States or is al Qaeda on the ropes? What does the rise of China portend for American interests? Does the Arab Spring represent an opportunity or a threat to longstanding interests -- or both? What should the United States do to reduce violence and drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere? How can Americans derive greater prosperity from today's interconnected global economy? How should the United States engage pivotal states such as Brazil, India, Indonesia and Turkey? 2. When should America engage and when should it isolate? Is the dual-track approach to Iran -- negotiate and sanction -- the right one? Are sanctions in general useful? Should American diplomats engage with foes such as Iran or the Taliban or fear that doing so will convey legitimacy upon them? What is the right level of engagement and pressure in the U.S. relationship with Pakistan? When is it appropriate to use military force and in what measure? 3. How much defense do we need and how much can we afford? What kinds of wars should our military prepare to fight in? Can we safely reject the prospect of large-scale land wars and counterinsurgency operations? Should America invest more in technologically advanced weaponry? Should pressure to cut the overall government budget determine the scale of defense spending? How can we make our armed forces more effective and efficient in the future, regardless of the level of budget cuts? 4. How can the United States prosper in the global economy? Are trade agreements fundamentally good for the United States and should America pursue more of them? How should Washington deal with China's currency practices? What threat does the eurozone crisis pose to the American economy, and what should the United States do about it? How will America's economic challenges affect our influence abroad? What must the United States do at home to make us more competitive globally? 5. What role should human rights and democracy play in American foreign policy? Is the ""freedom agenda"" a thing of the past, or does it speak to longstanding traditions in U.S. policy? How does America balance its values and interests in countries such as Bahrain? Has the Arab Spring demonstrated the importance of supporting democratic values in the Middle East or has it illustrated the limits of doing so? Should the United States be willing to use force to end atrocities in Syria? In a new report published by the Center for a New American Security, we asked four of America's leading strategists to grapple with questions like these. Robert Art argues that the United States should continue to play a global leadership role, but that it cannot afford to do everything and thus must be selective in its engagements. He calls for the United States to focus its energies on providing what he calls ""global public goods"" that cannot easily be provided by other countries and that benefit both the United States and the world. These include protecting freedom of navigation on the seas, which undergirds the global economy, and helping to ensure peace among major powers, without which both security and economic prosperity will suffer. Richard Betts, in contrast, calls for a more limited U.S. role in the world. Since today's security threats are less severe than at other points in our history but America's fiscal challenges are intense, Betts calls on the United States to rebuild its economic power and pull back from global military commitments. He argues that America should rebuild its ""strategic solvency"" -- the economic and fiscal ability to confront national security threats in the future. Peter Feaver calls for robust American engagement in the world and expresses concern that Americans sometimes overvalue the risks of intervening militarily and overlook the risks of not intervening. He argues that the United States should dissuade the rise of a hostile peer rival, such as China, even as it engages Beijing as a stakeholder in the international system. The United States should do this from a position of strength -- what he calls the ""velvet-covered iron fist."" To protect U.S. leverage in the Asia and the Middle East, he expresses deep concern about any erosion of America's military might and cuts to the U.S. defense budget. Anne-Marie Slaughter calls for the United States to recognize that answering most of the questions raised above depends not just on America's diplomatic relations with other countries, but also on its ability to work with networks of nongovernmental organizations, businesses, religious groups, philanthropies and even individuals. The United States derives enormous power from its influence in these networks and ability to attract students and entrepreneurs from around the world.

"(CNN) -- The charismatic but unpredictable lead singer of American rock band The Doors could be about to receive a posthumous pardon almost 40 years after being convicted of exposing himself on stage. Jim Morrison had been performing with the band at a typically raucous concert at Miami's Key Auditorium on March 1, 1969 when the incident took place. Reportedly drunk and slurring obscenities at the crowd, he was accused of unzipping his pants and simulating a sex act, a charge he denied. Despite being acquitted of lascivious behavior and drunkenness, Morrison was convicted of indecent exposure and open profanity and sentenced to six months in jail. He was still appealing the verdict in 1971 when he died in Paris at the age of 27. Four decades on and the outgoing Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, has said he may consider an official let-off for the legendary hell-raiser. ""It's something that I haven't given a lot of thought to, but it's something I'm willing to look into in the time I have left,"" Crist told U.S. Congressional newspaper The Hill. ""Anything is possible. Stay tuned."" Doors fans have long appealed for an official pardon for Morrison, petitioning previous Florida governors without success. Many argue that the trial was a sham and that there was no conclusive evidence supporting the exposure charge against Morrison. Crist was first approached about the issue of clemency in 2007. According to The Hill, he said he would consider it, acknowledging ""there was some doubt about how solid the case was."" But with Crist set to leave office in January after losing his bid for the Senate in the recent Midterm elections, time is running out for Morrison's supporters as the request must be submitted by December 9. Under state law a pardon must have the consent of the governor and at least two other members of the Florida Board of Executive Clemency. The Doors formed in Los Angeles in 1965 and comprised of Morrison on lead vocals, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore.","Jim Morrison was performing with the band in Miami on March 1, 1969 .

"(CNN) -- Kevin DuBrow, the lead singer of the 1980s heavy metal band Quiet Riot, has died, CNN has confirmed. He was 52. Kevin DuBrow and Quiet Riot hit No. 1 with ""Metal Health"" in 1983. DuBrow died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, according to TMZ.com. The Clark County coroner's office was examining the body to determine the cause of death, according to TMZ. ""I'm at a loss for words. I've just lost my best friend,"" Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali told CNN. ""Out of respect for both Kevin and his family, I won't comment further. There's going to be a lot of speculation out there, and I won't add to that. I love him too much."" Quiet Riot hit the top of the charts with its 1983 album, ""Metal Health,"" considered by some sources as the first heavy metal album to hit No. 1. The album was driven by the group's cover of Slade's ""Cum on Feel the Noize,"" which hit the Top 40. The band's other hits included ""Bang Your Head (Metal Health)"" and another Slade cover, ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now."" The band formed in the mid-1970s behind DuBrow and guitarist Randy Rhoads, who later joined Ozzy Osbourne's band and died in a tour accident. After several years, during which time the band disbanded, regrouped and built an audience, everything came together for ""Metal Health,"" which put Quiet Riot in the vanguard of the Los Angeles heavy metal movement. But the band's rushed follow-up, ""Condition Critical,"" didn't do as well, and DuBrow started taking shots at other L.A. bands, such as Motley Crue and Ratt, according to Allmusic.com. Within a few years, the band had mutinied (leaving DuBrow at a hotel in Hawaii while other members returned to California, Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia observes) and taken on a new lead singer. The bad blood prompted a lawsuit from DuBrow. By the 1990s tempers had calmed and the band got together again, putting out a live album in 1999 and a new studio set, ""Guilty Pleasures,"" in 2001. The group's most recent album, ""Rehab,"" came out last year. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this story.","Kevin DuBrow died in Las Vegas home, according to TMZ.com .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Mozart is trying to win a million dollars for New Orleans recovery efforts. But the charitable effort by the  6-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel may be derailed by a dog named after the satirical TV anchorman Stephen Colbert. Mozart's owner says if he wins, all the prize money will go to charities aiding New Orleans. Both canines are contestants in a dog beauty pageant -- but only one pup can take home the big money. The first round is under way, with a hairy finalist selected each week by the number of fan votes. Mozart, or MoMo as friends and family know him, came in second last week in the Cutest Dog Competition with 2,780 votes. This week he is running neck and neck with a new challenger, Stephen Colbert el dos, a Pomeranian Chihuahua mixed-breed puppy from Atlanta, Georgia. MoMo's owner is crying foul. ""It's just coming out of nowhere,"" Cara McCool said. ""It's just unfortunate. MoMo is named after a famous person too, but he's dead."" The Cutest Dog Competition is run by All American Pet Brands. Over 60,000 people have uploaded photos of their adorable dogs to the contest's Web site. The final 12 pooches will get to compete for the grand prize, a cool million in cash. ""It's a fraternity or sorority with people who don't just have pets, these are their family members, their best friends,"" said All American Pet Brands CEO Barry Schwartz. ""He's my furry child,"" said McCool, a New Orleans piano teacher who named her dog Mozart after her favorite composer. ""Sometimes I pull up chairs for him to sit next to me when I play or teach. He has been known to jump on the bench and actually has put his paws on the keys."" McCool has been active with several nonprofits working in New Orleans. If Mozart wins she said all the money will got to several charities: Redeemer Presbyterian Disaster Relief, Desire Street Ministries, Louisiana Teachers Save Our Students fund, Cavalier Rescue USA, Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana SPCA, and Teach for America. ""I already support them, but I can't afford that much because I'm a piano teacher,"" she said. If Mozart wins, all that could change. Colbert el dos' owners did not want to be identified. They told CNN they have only mentioned the contest to a few friends and family members. However, they did post a note about the doggie competition on a Colbert fan site. The owners have not heard from the show but one of the fan sites says Colbert el dos will appear on ""The Colbert Report"" if he makes the top 12. Renata Luczak, a spokesperson for Comedy Central, could not confirm or deny the pet's booking, saying, "" 'The Colbert Report' refrains from commenting on upcoming guests appearing on the show."" Even without a television appearance, Colbert el dos appears to be benefiting from the famous Colbert name bump. Colbert has wreaked havoc in other online competitions -- from a Hungarian bridge-naming contest to a NASA competition to name a room in the International Space Station. In both cases Colbert won the popular vote. However, NASA pushed back and instead of naming the room in his honor, the agency sent a treadmill to space with the Colbert honorific. In both of those contests, the competitions received heavy promotion during the show, with Colbert urging his viewers to participate. However, in this dog photo fight, Colbert is having an impact without any direct participation. Schwartz said the competition recognizes the outside influence of the Colbert bump. ""If there are those Colbert-named dogs that can get those thousands of votes, we don't want to leave anyone out, so we added a new daily contest."" The voting for this week ends at midnight on Saturday. Schwartz said the grand prize winner will be named on Thanksgiving Day.","""Stephen Colbert El Dos"" is causing some snapping over cute dog contest .

"Washington (CNN) -- Computer hackers who promise ""high-quality entertainment at your expense"" claimed to have taken down the Central Intelligence Agency website in support of WikiLeaks, but on Thursday the website appeared to be operating normally. ""WikiLeaks supporters, LulzSec, take down CIA ... who has task force into WikiLeaks,"" the hackers, who call themselves ""Lulz Security,"" said on Twitter late Wednesday. WikiLeaks, Julian Assange's group that facilitates the release of secret information, reposted the message on its own Twitter feed. About an hour later, they said, ""Goodnight twitter. The CIA anti-lizards will probably rise from the packet sea while we rest our shining-yet-saturated power field arrays."" CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said Thursday that the agency's public, unclassified website ""experienced technical issues that caused it to respond slowly for a short period of time yesterday evening. Those issues have been resolved."" The problem had no impact on anything classified, she said. Separately, a U.S. official told CNN there was no hacking, no intrusion, no access into the CIA site. Instead, ""the server was overwhelmed,"" this official said. A law enforcement official also downplayed the incident, telling CNN it compared to attacking a bridge with graffiti. The hackers group, using the name The Lulz Boat, claimed responsibility last month for hacking the PBS news website in the United States and posting a story saying that rapper Tupac Shakur, who has been dead for nearly 15 years, was alive and living in New Zealand. That hack followed a PBS documentary on WikiLeaks. The Lulz Boat said it was ""less than impressed"" with the program, ""WikiSecrets.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House must release its visitor logs and cannot hide behind a shield of privilege, a federal judge ruled Monday. The Bush administration has resisted public disclosure while it fights a lawsuit over alleged political influence by conservative Christian leaders. The Bush administration has been fighting the release of White House visitor logs. U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth concluded the information is part of the public record and is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as ""agency records."" ""Because the Secret Service creates, uses and relies on, and stores visitor records, they are under its control,"" said Lamberth. He ordered the Secret Service to produce records within 20 days. The White House claimed exclusive control of the documents, subject to the complete discretion of the president over their release. Secret Service records have been an important tool for advocacy groups and members of Congress seeking information on the inner workings of the executive branch. Congressional investigators used the records a decade ago in their investigations of the various Whitewater scandals involving President Clinton and his associates, as well as allegations of influence peddling by the Clinton campaign in the 1996 elections. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a self-described government watchdog group, sought the visit records of prominent conservatives James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Wendy Wright of Concerned Women of America and seven others including the late televangelist Jerry Falwell. ""CREW is pleased that the judge saw through the White House's transparent attempts to hide public documents from the American people,"" said Melanie Sloan, the group's executive director. ""We look forward to sharing the documents we obtain through this lawsuit."" The White House and Justice Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling. Separate legal action by CREW and other groups, including Judicial Watch and the Washington Post, sought White House visitor logs that listed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He pleaded guilty last year to public corruption charges. The White House and the Secret Service in 2006 signed an agreement that visitors to the White House complex were not subject to public disclosure. That ""memorandum of understanding"" was disclosed during legal action over the Abramoff records. Lamberth called that a ""self-serving"" agreement because it was issued after the records were created and after the CREW lawsuit. The judge, in a separate ruling Monday, said he lacked the authority to order the Secret Service to stop destroying its visitor records once copies were turned over to White House officials. But Lamberth noted the National Archives had to approve any destruction of the logs. Another federal judge in Washington ordered the release of Secret Service logs of visitors to Vice President Dick Cheney's office. Cheney claimed those logs were subject to executive privilege. That ruling is being appealed. Lamberth noted the Secret Service has an important ""protective mission"" when compiling electronic information -- including background checks -- of those seeking to enter the White House complex. But he said the agency's claim of ""limited use"" of the data does not mean the records are not subject to judicial review. ""This does not mean the Secret Service does not read or rely on them,"" wrote Lamberth. ""If that were the case, any convenience store patron who has ever bought a losing scratch ticket could claim they did not gamble simply because they held the ticket for only a few minutes."" The issue of White House privilege over visitor logs has not been fully addressed by the Supreme Court. The case decided Monday is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v.

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania's highest court Wednesday upheld a judge's earlier decision to grant a stay of execution for a man who says the person he killed had sexually abused him years earlier. The court's decision denied prosecutors an emergency petition to have Terrance Williams, 46, put to death on Wednesday, though the court could decide at a later point to have the execution go forward. ""As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has now confirmed, Judge (M. Teresa) Sarmina's grant of a stay was factually and legally sound,"" said attorney Shawn Nolan. ""The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office should stop its pursuit to execute Terry Williams."" No one disputes that Williams beat Amos Norwood to death with a tire iron in 1984 or that he should be in prison. But his defense team says information that Norwood had allegedly sexually abused Williams was withheld from the trial, and his life should be spent in a cell. Attorneys ask Pennsylvania judge to call off killer's execution, citing sex abuse . Last week, Sarmina, a common pleas court judge in Philadelphia, found ""reasonable probability"" that the verdict might have been different had allegations of abuse surfaced during the initial case and that the relationship between the two men had been established but not disclosed. His attorneys have argued that the jurors who convicted Williams more than 25 years ago were told that it was a robbery-homicide case and never learned of the abuse allegations. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams filed an emergency appeal, and has called the abuse allegations hearsay and ""a last-ditch effort to escape punishment."" Williams, the district attorney, said that although the high court denied the immediate review of the case, the ruling means the case would now proceed as a normal appeal. ""The Supreme Court will now have the time to look at all the facts,"" the district attorney said in a statement. ""I continue to believe that this defendant received an appropriate sentence and that his new claims are not true."" Williams and accomplice Marc Draper led Norwood, 56, to an area near a cemetery, forced him to lie on the ground, tied him up, gagged him and stole his valuables, the governor's office said in a statement. ""Williams and Draper repeatedly beat the man with a tire iron and a socket wrench and then drove away in the victim's car. Williams later returned and burned Norwood's body,"" the statement said. Draper is serving a life sentence. Since the execution date was set, a number of high-profile supporters have called for clemency in the case, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. More than 360,000 people have signed an online petition asking authorities to spare Williams' life. Norwood's widow has also asked for the execution to be called off. But Norwood's daughter wants the execution to go forward, the Philadelphia district attorney's office said. She said Friday that accusations of sexual abuse were false and asked the court to uphold the death penalty.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Two South Korean presidential candidates have decided to join forces in an effort to challenge the conservative front-runner in a move that could be a game-changer for the election next month. The election will determine who will lead South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia, for the next five years amid long-running tensions with the unpredictable, nuclear-armed North. In a closed-door meeting Tuesday, the two left-leaning presidential hopefuls, Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party (DUP) and Ahn Cheol-soo, a professor and former software mogul, agreed to field one candidate between them, according to a statement from the DUP. But a decision on which of the two will run against Park Geun-hye, the candidate for the governing Saenuri Party, hasn't been decided yet, the DUP said. Candidates must register before the end of November. Read more: South Korea's ruling party taps Park for presidential bid . Park's party called the move by her opponents a ""show meant to confuse voters."" The current South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak of the Saenuri Party, is prevented by the constitution from running for another term. All three candidates are expected to pursue a more conciliatory line toward North Korea than Lee, who took an uncompromising approach to dealings with Pyongyang. Popular among conservative voters, Park has said she aims to focus on welfare policies. If elected, she would become the country's first-ever female president.

Some claim he was a dictator who stifled opposition while others credit him with overseeing a key phase of South Korea's economic development. He was shot and killed by his intelligence chief in 1979. Ahn, who founded an anti-virus software company, has gained popularity for his criticism of the large South Korean conglomerates, known as ""chaebols."" He has argued that the nation's economy is dominated by a few rich individuals. He is a professor at South Korea's prestigious Seoul National University and a former medical doctor.

"Rhinebeck, New York (CNN) -- Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and longtime beau Marc Mezvinsky were wed Saturday ""in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts,"" a 50-acre estate in Rhinebeck, New York, according to her parents. ""We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family,"" former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. ""On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day."" The confirmation by the Clintons put to rest a slew of speculation on where and when the nuptials would take place. ""Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends,"" the statement said. The interfaith ceremony -- Clinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewish -- was led by Rabbi James Ponet and the Rev. William Shillady, the family said. The groom wore a tallit, or prayer shawl, and a yarmulke. A friend of the couple read the Leo Marks poem ""The Life That I Have,"" according to the family. The bride -- as predicted -- wore a dress designed by Vera Wang, the family said. The strapless dress had a swirling silk organza ball skirt and train, and was accented by an embellished belt. Clinton had been spotted by Women's Wear Daily outside the designer's showroom in New York earlier this week, and Wang was spotted in Rhinebeck on Saturday. Hillary Clinton wore a pink gown by Oscar de la Renta, the family said. Jim Valli and his band performed at the reception, and the couple's good friend, Tim Blane, played at the rehearsal dinner, according to the Clinton family. The reception was catered by The St. Regis, the rehearsal dinner by Blue Ribbon. Hundreds of curious onlookers -- along with hordes of reporters and cameramen -- gathered Saturday at the main intersection of the tiny New York town in hopes of catching a glimpse of celebrities and dignitaries attending the wedding. Well-heeled wedding guests wearing floor-length gowns and tuxedos were seen boarding shuttles to take them to what one event planner billed as ""the wedding of the century."" Storefront windows displayed signs reading ""Congratulations Marc & Chelsea"" and similar messages. ""You could make a case that this is the most significant thing to happen in Rhinebeck since Washington's army drove the British out of Rhinebeck back in the 1700s,"" said Jim Langon, editor of the Hudson Valley News newspaper, who was the first to report that the wedding would take place there. Bill and Hillary Clinton were seen arriving at a formal dinner at the Beekman Arms Inn in Rhinebeck on Friday night. Also attending were former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- who was spotted lunching in town before the wedding Saturday, presidential adviser Vernon Jordan and numerous young couples presumed to be friends of the bride and groom. Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen -- longtime married friends of the Clinton family -- told CNN that despite the public spectacle of the wedding, ""it's been a very personal experience for them."" ""There's been so much love and tenderness around the whole thing,"" Steenburgen said. ""That kind of gets obscured a little bit when you're talking about someone that's a public person. But on the inside of it I can tell you that it's been very much like everybody's wedding -- full of tenderness and memories and laughter."" Some wedding planners had speculated that the cost of the celebration could run to seven or even eight figures, but a longtime Clinton family friend said the cost would be less than $1 million. Mezvinsky, a 32-year-old investment banker, is the son of former U.S. Reps. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania and Ed Mezvinsky of Iowa. When Bill Clinton was seen in Rhinebeck earlier this week, someone asked him if his daughter was going to look beautiful on Saturday. ""She looks beautiful every day to me,"" the beaming father said. Earlier in July, Hillary Clinton told Polish media that she was enjoying taking part in her daughter's wedding planning. ""It's a very happy time for my family,"" she said. ""It truly is the most important thing in my life right now."" Steenburgen, who told CNN that she has known the Clintons for 30 years, predicted tears from the former president by the end of the night. ""Knowing my friend Bill ... I can honestly tell you that I'm sure he'll be crying his eyes out,"" she said. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Chelsea Clinton wore a gown by Vera Wang, the family says .
