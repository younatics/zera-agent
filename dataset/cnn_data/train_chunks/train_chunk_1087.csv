"Alan Pardew refused to speak to press following the win at St James’ Park, fuelling the Newcastle United manager’s link with the vacant Crystal Palace job. Pardew would not speak to television, radio or print journalists after Newcastle’s 3-2 win over Everton, with the North East club saying the 53-year-old was simply ‘unavailable’. Pardew remains the bookmakers’ favourite to become Neil Warnock’s successor at Selhurst Park, and assistant manager John Carver led the press conference in his absence. Alan Pardew has refused to speak to the media after Newcastle's win over Everton at St James' Park . Neil Warnock was sacked by Crystal Palace after their Boxing Day defeat to Southampton . The Londoner is familiar with Palace, having spent four years of his playing career at Selhurst Park. He played the most games there of any club in his professional career, most notably scoring the winning goal against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final in 1990. He also played in both the final and the final's replay, as the south Londoners narrowly missed out to Manchester United. Keith Millen (right) is currently taking temporary charge of the Eagles while hierarchy look for a new manager . Pardew celebrates after scoring Crystal Palace's winning goal against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final . Asked why he was filling in for Pardew, Carver said: ‘He just said: “Will you go do the press for me?” That was it. ‘He’s fine. Delighted. It’s a fantastic result for us. We’ve had a difficult period against good opposition, and it was another good opposition today. He’s been pleased with the performance. It’s probably been one of our best performances in recent times.’ Warnock became the first sacking of the Barclays Premier League season after defeat against Southampton on Boxing Day left Palace in the relegation zone. Pardew came in from 20/1 to 4/7 favourite recently to take the job, with Tony Pulis another in the frame. The Palace players celebrate during Palace's 4-3 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final - they had lost 9-0 in the league earlier in the same season .","Alan Pardew's Newcastle beat Everton 3-2 at St James' Park on Sunday .

"Will Stevens is adamant he is not putting his life on the line when he makes his Formula One debut this weekend. The 23-year-old from Essex has been thrust into the spotlight after his sponsors agreed to stump up £500,000 to get him into the vacant Caterham seat. The Leafield-based marque are back on the grid after being allowed to skip the last two races after falling into administration. Will Stevens is set to make his Formula One debut for Caterham this weekend in Abu Dhabi . 23-year-old Essex-based Stevens is pictured as Caterham's test driver in July 2013 at Silverstone . After raising nearly £2million to date via a crowd-funding project to ensure they take part in this weekend's race in Abu Dhabi, Caterham are back in the public eye. Co-administrator and interim team principal Finbarr O'Connell hopes an investor will now come forward to take the team on into 2015 and beyond. For now, at the Yas Marina circuit, it is Stevens and Kamui Kobayashi who will attempt to fly the flag. The cars, though, have been in storage and untouched since the team went into administration in mid-October. That was just a few days after the Russian Grand Prix where Kobayashi had admitted to being scared to drive as a part had been patched up as there were no spares. Stevens, who was only granted his required superlicence by the FIA on Thursday morning, has no fears getting into the car. Stevens (centre) took part in a track walk on Thursday ahead of practice starting on Friday . Kamui Kobayashi is Caterham's other driver for the weekend's Formula One 2014 season finale in Abu Dhabi . 'I can't speak for what happened before, but I know what we have here and I'm sure everything is fine and I feel comfortable in going out there and pushing to the limit,' said Stevens. 'Everyone here wants the car to be safe and to finish the race, that is the No 1 priority in every single team. 'I'm absolutely certain there are no issues at all with the car or anything around it. 'Clearly the number one thing is reliability. These guys have enough experience to know what they have to do, with the main priority then to finish.' Caterham mechanics prepare their cars for this weekend's race at the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi . Caterham have not competed in the previous two races after going into administration . Stevens, who clocked up 1100 kilometres for Caterham over two young driver tests last year and this summer, and who this season has been competing in the World Series by Renault 3.5 championship, is in no doubt he is ready to take to the track in F1. 'I've done the tests, been working with these guys for a long time, been driving since I was 10 and done six years of car racing, so I feel like I've a lot of experience,' added Stevens. 'I'm going into the last race, which is not the easiest situation, but when you get an opportunity like this you need to take it with both hands, and I'm sure I can go out and do a good job.'","Caterham have missed the previous two Formula One races .

"Alan Pardew is considering an emotional return to Crystal Palace as manager. Newcastle boss Pardew scored the winner for Palace in their 1990 FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool and while it seems incredible that he would walk out on such a big club, he has privately maintained that he wants the chance to manage Palace. Palace co-chairman Steve Parish is considering Pardew — along with Hull chief Steve Bruce and other British managers — as a replacement for Neil Warnock. One of the biggest stumbling blocks is the £5million compensation fee in Pardew’s contract. Alan Pardew is the bookmakers' favourite to take over from Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew (No II) scores the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . And Pardew did not face the press after his side's 3-2  win over Everton on Sunday, fuelling speculation he could be set for a move. Bruce is another surprise name on Palace’s list, which also includes Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy and Alan Curbishley. Bruce’s position has come under scrutiny in recent weeks after a poor run of results has left Hull in danger of relegation. Palace are keen to explore the possibility of a move for Bruce, who was a target in the summer following Tony Pulis’ shock departure. The Palace hierarchy, who are keen to appoint a British manager with a proven Premier League track record, have huge admiration for the job Bruce has done at Hull and want to find out if luring the former Manchester United defender is a viable option. Palace were held to a goalless draw by Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . There are fears, though, that Bruce’s appointment could spark a backlash from supporters. Bruce left Selhurst Park in controversial circumstances during the 2001-02 season, when he left to take charge of Birmingham City. And a section of Palace fans have never forgiven the 53-year-old, targeting Bruce with abuse, particularly when he comes back to Selhurst Park. There would be similar issues with a move for Curbishley given his links with fierce south London rivals Charlton. Bruce’s current deal expires in the summer and he is yet to agree an extension, which has cast a further cloud over his reign at Hull. Fulham tried to take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding his future earlier this season, but failed in attempt to lure him to Craven Cottage as they appointed Kit Symons instead.

"CLICK HERE to read Matt Lawton's full match report from Anfield . Liverpool players returned to training with a noticeable spring in their step following Monday night's impressive 4-1 hammering of Swansea City. Brendan Rodgers' festive revival has seen the Reds take seven points from their last three games to finish the year in eighth place in the Premier League ahead of the New Year's Day visit of Leicester City. Adam Lallana bagged a brace after Alberto Moreno had opened the scoring against Swansea, while a final own goal from former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey will  also have raised a smile from players at Melwood on the morning after. Most of the players that featured against the Swans, except for Mario Balotelli who made a late substitute appearance, appeared to be rested on Tuesday morning - but it was clear to see how the infectious nature of a good result breeds confidence throughout the club.

Monday night's result was also the first time that Liverpool have scored four goals in a game without Luis Suarez - dating back 34 games to the 4-0 dismantling of Tottenham on March 30 2013, which provided the catalyst for a title run-in that came within two points of being crowned champions. Two-goal hero Lallana admits Liverpool have struggled to live up to the expectations of last season but is confident the side can now kick on in 2015. He told Sky Sports: 'It's a massive, massive result. We said before the game it was important we got back-to-back wins and I thought the lads were brilliant. 'We've turned a corner the last few weeks but we're still not there yet by any means. I always knew it would be different, no disrespect to Southampton, but the pressures are always different coming to Liverpool and a team like this.

"Many would argue that Liverpool have been living under the shadow of Luis Suarez since the Uruguayan left in the summer, but there are signs that the gloom has lifted. Brendan Rodgers continued his festive revival on Monday evening with a resounding 4-1 victory over former club Swansea to move up to eighth in the Premier League table. Not only was it Liverpool's most impressive league performance of the season, it was also the first time that the Reds have scored four goals in a game since they had their former talisman in the side. Adam Lallana (right) scored twice as Liverpool destroyed Swansea 4-1 on Monday evening . It has taken 273 days for Liverpool to score four goals in a game in any competition . Liverpool celebrate a mini-revival that has seen them take seven points from their last three games . The last time that Liverpool scored four in any competition was during a 4-0 league hammering of Tottenham on 30 March 2013, which provided the catalyst for a title run-in that came within touching distance of reclaiming the trophy last term. On that Sunday, Suarez scored the second after an own-goal opener by Younes Kaboul - before Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson completed the rout. That was 34 games or 39 weeks or 273 days to the day that the Merseyside club has taken to recover from the loss of Suarez to the extent that they have dominated a game in the same style they managed on a regular basis last season. Suarez scores Liverpool's second goal in the 4-0 defeat of Tottenham on March . Suarez celebrates his goal, while Liverpool have had to wait 34 games to score four in a game again . During the 2013-14 campaign, the free-scoring Reds scored more than four goals in 11 separate league games - with Suarez's name on the scoresheet more often than not, none more so than the four goals he scored during the 5-2 hammering of Norwich last December. On Monday, the goals came from Alberto Moreno, a brace from Adam Lallana (with the assistance of Lukas Fabianski) and an own goal from former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. Whether the floodgates will remain open, or whether Anfield supporters will once again be lamenting the loss of Suarez after their next fixture against Leicester City on New Year's Day remains to be seen.","Liverpool defeated Swansea 4-1 in the Premier League on Monday .

"Adam Lallana believes Liverpool's poor start to the season has partly been down to new players struggling to cope with the high expectations at Anfield after last season's second-placed finish.

Following his side's win, former Southampton midfielder revealed that some the Liverpool new boys had struggled to adapt quickly to life on Merseyside.

Lallana claimed some of the Liverpool squad have struggled with high expectations this season . Following Lallana's Man of the Match performance, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher were also full of praise for the 26-year-old. Speaking of Lallana, Carragher said: 'He's always been the one (of the summer signings) who's stood out from the rest. 'He maybe hasn't always been at his best but he is a class act. He can take it on both sides, the left and the right side, and he's not a luxury player. He works for the team.

'There are very few players who can do that with both feet, maybe Ross Barkley, in England as you usually associate that with foreign players.' While Neville added: 'The Southampton players understand the game, they know why they're there, and why they need to be there. Lallana learned how to press from his time at Southampton where they train their players so well.'","Adam Lallana scored twice during Liverpool's 4-1 win against Swansea .

"Neil Warnock has been sacked as manager of Crystal Palace after just four months in charge at Selhurst Park. The Eagles dropped into the bottom three of the Premier League on Boxing Day after a 3-1 loss to Southampton, with pressure mounting on Warnock and fans calling for his head. Keith Millen will once again take temporary charge, with Palace travelling to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. Neil Warnock has been sacked as manager of Crystal Palace after four months at the helm at Selhurst Park .

The club confirmed the sacking with a brief statement on their website. It said: . 'Crystal Palace Football Club can today confirm that Neil Warnock has been relieved of his duties and is no longer first-team manager. 'The club would like to put on record its thanks to Neil for all his hard work and energy over the past four months. 'Keith Millen will lead the team against Queens Park Rangers tomorrow [Sunday] as caretaker manager.' Neil Warnock was appointed as manager of Crystal Palace on August 28th during a press conference . The nail in Warnock's coffin was a 3-1 defeat to Southampton at Selhurst Park on Boxing Day . August 16: Arsenal 2-1 Crystal Palace . August 23: Crystal Palace 1-3 West Ham . August 30: Newcastle 3-3 Crystal Palace . September 13: Crystal Palace 0-0 Burnley .

December 20: Man City 3-0 Crystal Palace . December 26: Crystal Palace 1-3 Southampton . Speaking to the Croydon Advertiser, chairman Steve Parish revealed the reason behind the sacking, while admitting that it is a priority to start negotiations with a new manager immediately. 'We have let Neil go and we have thanked him for his work,' the Palace owner said. 'It's not working out and we are looking for a reaction against QPR. 'I slept on it really and just spoke to a few people and made my mind up this morning. Neil is a great guy and he wanted to do it at Palace. It just hasn't happened.

Keith Millen will take temporary charge of Crystal Palace when they travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday .

He has a win record of 22.4 per cent, and 70 points from a possible 228. Credit: Opta . 'It just wasn't working. You always want it sorted out as soon as possible but I haven't got anyone lined up. We want to hold negotiations as soon as possible.' Warnock has therefore become the first managerial casualty of the Premier League season, taking charge of just 16 league games in his second stint at Selhurst Park. The substitution of winger Yannick Bolasie for full-back Martin Kelly, when Palace were 3-0 down to Southampton, saw fans call for Warnock's head on Boxing Day. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish (right) has made the decision to sack Warnock after a poor start . Last season under Tony Pulis, Palace finished 12th in the Premier League, but they have struggled this term . Warnock has left his post in charge of the Eagles after just 16 Premier League matches . Chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rang around Selhurst Park, while sections of the home fans booed at the full-time whistle. Warnock was honest in his assessment of the performance though, admitting that he expected a negative response from the Palace faithful. 'I have no complaints, at 3-0 down, you'd be very surprised not to get a bit of stick. I thought the players were very good today in the circumstances, they were almost as shell-shocked as some of the fans.' Caretaker boss Millen is now in a position familiar to him, after two previous stints as caretaker manager at Selhurst Park. After the departures of Ian Holloway and Tony Pulis, it was him whom Palace called upon to take the reigns, and so it is not a position alien to the 48-year-old. 'It is not a nice position to be in again, I must admit,' Millen told Sky Sports News. 'It was a surprise this morning. Tony Pulis is a contender to take over at Palace, after leaving a day before the start of the season. He is pictured (centre) with Yannick Bolasie and Joe Ledley while doing punditry for BT Sport last weekend . Mile Jedinak plays his final game for Crystal Palace against QPR, before captaining Australia in the Asia Cup . 'We have all been disappointed by yesterday's result but the first-half performance was decent. We're just not taking our chances at the moment, so we've come into work this morning and I get the phone call from the chairman. 'It has been a shock for us all, but we have got to try and be professional and try and concentrate on a massive game tomorrow [Sunday].' The Eagles face a tough trip to Loftus Road, where they take on relegation rivals QPR in what would have been a return to his old club for Warnock. 'Neil came in this morning and we had a quick chat,' Millen continued. 'He cleared his desk and his stuff. Toby Alderweireld's third goal for Southampton was the last Warnock would concede as Palace manager . Sunday would have seen Warnock (centre) return to his old club Queens Park Rangers . 'It is always a sad time and it is very difficult for all of us, the staff, because he kept us here and we were part of his backroom staff. 'We're all disappointed but we have got to move on very quickly with this big game.' Tim Sherwood has emerged as the early favourite to take over at Palace (6/4), with Chris Hughton (6/1) and former boss Pulis (7/1) shortly behind. Former Eagles defender Tony Popovic, who is currently managing Western Sydney Wanderers in the Australian A League, has also been linked with the vacancy.","Crystal Palace have won three of their first 18 league games this season .

"Raheem Sterling has been described as 'lucky' by Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher, after the Liverpool star was seen appearing to swing an arm towards the face of Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. The incident occurred towards the end of the Reds 4-1 Premier League triumph against their Welsh opponents on Monday night at Anfield. After shielding the ball out for a goal kick from Sterling, Fernandez was bumped into the Kop by the 20-year-old - much to the annoyance of the Argentine. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling (right) swung an arm towards the face of Federico Fernandez (left) on Monday . The incident came during the closing stages of Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea . The pair, who had been battling against each other throughout the game, confronted one another before Sterling was seen to aim a swing at Fernandez right in front of the linesman. Sterling's indescrestion went unpunished by referee Andre Marriner and the makeshift forward was subseqeuntly replaced by boss Brendan Rodgers - with Mario Balotelli his replacement on 82 minutes.

On Sunday, Newcastle's Papiss Cisse elbowed Everton defender Seamus Coleman in the jaw but has since been charged retrospectively by the FA. Speaking post-match on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show Neville said: 'He's [Sterling] a lucky boy. Cisse's been charged retrospectively today. 'I think the referee and the linesman have both seen this and Howard Webb said a few weeks ago that this is a sending off. Cisse will get a three-game ban for violent conduct but how are the referee and linesman going to give credibility where both can say they haven't seen these two incidents. 'It cannot happen where they say they haven't seen it so I think Sterling will get away with it because the referee can't put it in his report that he hasn't seen it. How he, the linesman, tomorrow, can write in his report that he didn't see it will mean that I think he will lose credibility, I really do.' Newcastle's Papiss Cisse (circled) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing Seamus Coleman on Sunday . The mideamonour was the only blemish to an impressive performance by Sterling playing as the Reds' furthest forward. Carragher added: 'I think he [Sterling] was lucky. Fernandez was tight and aggressive and earlier on in the night Sterling was frustrated with his tackling. 'He gives a push then Fernandez gives Sterling a clip with the left hand before Sterling throws his hand, it's not a punch, but we've seen people sent off for things like this.'

"Lukas Podolski has been to stop 'blaming others' for his lack of playing time at Arsenal by Germany's 1990 World Cup-winning captain Lothar Matthaus. Podolski has failed to start a Premier League game so far for the Gunners this season - featuring just seven times off the bench for Arsene Wenger's side. The 29-year-old has been recently been linked with a move to Italian giants Inter Milan as a result of his unsettledness, but Matthaus is adamant Podolski should accept his position on the bench and honour the remaining 18 months of his contract at the Emirates. Arsenal's Lukas Podolski has only made seven appearances for the club this season - all as a substitute . Matthaus (left) captained West Germany to the World Cup in 1990 - with a 1-0 win against Argentina in the final . 'What Podolski seeks is not important,' he told the Hamburger Morgenpost. 'What matters is what Arsenal want. There he has a contract to fulfill. 'In Bayern, he fled. The only club where he was a regular player was at Koln. You cannot always blame others if things go wrong. There are just others that are better.'

"A 12-year-old boy accidentally ran up a £1,500 bill while playing Xbox Live - leaving his cash-strapped dad with no choice but to pick up the tab. Sam Ghera's son Nik thought he was using up game points every time he 'improved' his characters while playing Call of Duty and Fifa. However, with each click he was actually purchasing an online currency - which was draining money from his dad's account. Game over: Sam Anupam Ghera was horrified when his son Nikhil Ghera accidentally ran up a £1,150 bill while playing on X-Box Live . Now Sam, from Wolverhampton in the . West Midlands, wants to warn parents of the hidden costs lurking behind . games consoles after he was left with a sky-high credit card bill. Sam, 48, had allowed Nik register his . credit card details to cover the £5.99 monthly subscription fee so he . could play X-Box Live with classmates online. However, unbeknown to Sam, his card . details were stored in the machine and his son was able to buy . ‘Microsoft Points’ - an online currency which allows players to unlock . new features in their favourite games - without having to enter a . password. The youngster . thought he had earned the points for scoring goals and killing villains . and he used these to add extra weapons for his soldier in hit game Call . of Duty and players in football game Fifa. Between December and June this year Nik spent a wallet-busting £1,150. In . one marathon gaming session Nik spent £100 in a single day on weapons . and extra features after playing Call of Duty with his online friends. Sam only realised what was happening . when he tried with use his card to withdraw some cash - and was told he . had insufficient funds. Innocent: Nikhil Ghera did not realise he was using money and instead believed he was using points he'd won in games . He was horrified when he realised his own son was responsible for the credit card bill. Sam has now lodged a complaint with the . computer giant Microsoft - which owns X-Box Live - and is demanding the company makes its charging policy . clearer for parents. He said: 'I went to the bank to take some money out with my credit card but the machine said I had insufficient funds. 'I was standing there thinking that I’d been hacked in to, but the bank came back saying they were legitimate charges. 'When I went through my statement I saw that they were charges for XBox Live. 'I . didn’t even know that it was storing my information, and even if that . thought had entered my head I would have thought there would be . something in place so it wasn’t so easy to spend money. 'With sites like eBay and iTunes it always asks you for a password before you make a purchase. 'But with Xbox Live you just press a . button and then your money’s gone. I contacted Microsoft but six months . down the line they’re still saying they’re looking into it. 'I’m waiting for them to get back to me.' Cash-strapped: Every time Nik clicked on improving his characters, he was actually draining funds from his dad Sam's bank account . Funds: Sam's bank statement showing charges debited from his account by X-Box Live . Council worker Sam, is now warning other parents to monitor their children's X-Box Live accounts. He claimed that Microsoft is aware of . the problem, adding: 'He didn’t realise he was using money, he thought . he was using points he’d won in games. 'He didn’t realise it was costing real money. 'An . apology would be nice but I’m more interested in having this problem . stopped so that we as parents can stop our kids from making payments on . our cards. 'I think it’s a big problem, I’ve spoken to other parents and parents online who’ve had the same happen to them. 'I . would have thought they’d be a bit more helpful with parents but once . they’ve got the money they just say ""it’s not our problem"".' Under the terms of the service, children have to be 13 to play but younger kids can do so 'with parental consent'. A Microsoft spokesman said: 'Throughout the purchase of any digital product on the Xbox LIVE service there are multiple opportunities where consumers are asked to confirm their purchases. The price is clearly displayed on the screen throughout this process, it should also be noted that Xbox LIVE accounts registered for children’s use have online activity automatically defaulted to off, and these can be enabled should the parents wish to in the family settings section. 'These settings include specifying the email address to which all purchase notifications are sent and using other features, such as “over the shoulder approval,” that allows the account holder to give permission for purchases by typing in the password. We remain committed to working with the customer to help them further and offer guidance on the many control settings we offer on Xbox LIVE.

"Lady Thatcher’s final journey will take her from the House of Commons, the political home she bestrode for more than three decades, to a service at St Paul’s Cathedral. Details of the ceremonial funeral with military honours are understood to have been mapped out in talks between government officials and Baroness Thatcher more than five years ago. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . and Nancy Reagan, wife of her closest ally US President Ronald Reagan, . are expected to lead a list of international mourners. MAILONLINE AND DAILY MAIL CAMPAIGN: HOW TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD . If you believe Lady Thatcher deserves a state funeral, and want the Government to know, just sign this online petition or print out the form below and send it to us. We will pass it to the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing Street . Every living Prime Minister – Sir John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron – plus the Cabinet and shadow cabinet will also attend the service, which is expected on either Wednesday or Thursday next week. Yesterday, as flags flew at half-mast from London to Port Stanley in the Falklands and Washington DC, well-wishers lay tributes at the Iron Lady’s Belgravia home in Central London. The evening before her funeral, Lady Thatcher’s coffin will rest in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster. There will be a short service following its arrival. On the day itself, the streets will be cleared of traffic and the coffin will travel by hearse to the Church of St Clement Danes, the RAF Chapel, on the Strand. At the church the coffin will be . transferred to a gun carriage drawn by horses of the King’s Troop of the . Royal Horse Artillery, the Queen’s ceremonial Saluting Battery which is . stationed at Woolwich in South-East London.

After the official funeral ceremony there . will be a separate private family event as Lady Thatcher is cremated in . Mortlake, South West London. The costs of the funeral will be shared by the Government and Lady Thatcher’s estate. Government departments like the Ministry of Defence will pick up the tab for their own contributions. It was estimated that the Queen Mother’s funeral cost £6million. A No 10 spokesman said: ‘All the arrangements being put in place are in line with the wishes of Lady Thatcher’s family.’ Friends say the former PM told them she did not wish her body to lie in state. Family spokesman Lord Bell said: ‘She specifically did not want a state funeral…and she didn’t want a fly-past as she thought that was a waste of money – somewhat in character you might think.’","Details of ceremonial funeral were mapped out 'more than five years ago'

"When Saido Berahino won his first England call-up in November, he had just enjoyed a run of six goals in five games for West Brom and was on the back page of every national newspaper for the right reasons. Just two months on and the sulky striker refused to celebrate any of his four goals during Saturday’s 7-0 victory over Gateshead in the third round of the FA Cup. Saido Berahino (second left) was in a sulky mood as he scored four goals in the FA Cup third round . So what has upset the Baggies frontman? Well, he didn’t make it off the bench with England for starters. We all expected to see Berahino win his first Three Lions cap in either the Euro qualifier with Slovenia or the friendly in Scotland. Roy Hodgson, though, chose not to introduce the 21-year-old and it remains to be seen whether he will be included in the next full squad. Why is that? It later emerged that he had been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in October, two days after scoring for West Brom in a 2-2 draw with Manchester United. It was alleged he was driving at speeds of up to 110mph. If charged and found guilty, Berahino could face a penalty of up to six months in prison, a £5,000 fine and a driving ban of at least one year. Berahino was called up by England manager Roy Hodgson in November but did not earn his first cap . Berahino celebrates scoring against West Ham at Upton Park on New Year's Day . How has he performed since? He did not score for West Brom until the New Year’s Day draw at West Ham and went 11 matches without a goal. In that time his form dipped and, with the team struggling, manager Alan Irvine was sacked. What about his contract? Berahino – who earns £12,000 a week - was in line for an improved deal in light of his scoring start to the campaign and promotion to the England senior ranks. Those talks, however, have been put on hold. The striker was in blistering form at the start of the season, scoring six goals in five games for West Brom . Do West Brom risk losing him? There has been talk of Liverpool making a £25m approach for the Burundi-born frontman and it is thought new boss Tony Pulis could well be willing to cash in as he looks to bring in his own players in their fight against relegation. So what was his problem at the weekend? Berahino scored four for the first time in his career but was in no mood to celebrate. He later insisted he was simply ‘acting professionally’ and said there was no need to explain himself to reporters. What now? All is clearly not well and the suggestion that West Brom could listen to offers for Berahino may well trigger a January approach from Liverpool, especially given his contract situation. He has 13 goals this season and would not be short of suitors should it become clear that he is available for transfer. Berahino could well be on his way out of The Hawthorns if Liverpool make an offer .","Saido Berahino did not celebrate any of his four goals against Gateshead .

"FIFA have got themselves into yet another potentially explosive muddle over the report into World Cup bid corruption that has already descended into farce. After the debacle of investigator Michael Garcia disowning the summary of his own report by ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the buck was passed to FIFA compliance chief Domenico Scala to decide the next step after reviewing all the documents. And FIFA hope Scala will put enough evidence from the full Garcia report to the executive committee meeting in Morocco next month for them to decide once and for all whether a re-vote is needed over the staging of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Michael Garcia is probing the conduct of five FIFA officials - including three who are still on the executive . But to complicate matters, Garcia is still probing the individual conduct of five people — three believed still to be on the executive, one a high-profile former member and another a powerful ex-FIFA official. And Zurich insiders believe it will be impossible for Scala to divulge fresh information from the Garcia file to the executive in Marrakech on December 18-19 — even with names redacted — without compromising Garcia’s inquiries, especially if they involve three people who will be in the room. Christmas looks to have been cancelled by Arsenal as far as their supporters are concerned. The traditional festive drinks with Arsenal fan groups may well be ditched this year, with the club seemingly sensitive to any criticism of under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger. Last year the Gunners waited until the day after their Christmas bash with fans before announcing ticket price rises. An Arsenal spokesman said they were organising a larger gathering of supporters for an end-of-season party. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen’s granddaughter Zara Phillips but has time on his hands after leaving his role coaching Gloucester, is understood to have signed up for a reality show.

Coe says 'oui' to IAAF . It has been assumed since Lord Coe said athletics was ‘in his DNA’ when turning down the chance to lead the BBC Trust that he preferred to run for the IAAF presidency. And it is understood Coe will announce in French sports newspaper L’Equipe that he is officially in the running to succeed Lamine Diack next August. The choice of a French media outlet suggests Coe is positioning himself as an international statesman rather than a British one and French is an important language in the athletics community. Lord Coe turned down the chance to lead the BBC Trust as he has aspirations to succeed Lamine Diack . Lord Moynihan, who has led the House of Lords’ all-party campaign to regulate the secondary ticket market, is hopeful that the Government will take notice of the peers winning a rare amendment. This would see greater transparency in online ticket selling in time for next autumn’s Rugby World Cup. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid is opposed to the changes but the Government response will be led by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, whose Secretary of State Vince Cable is the MP for Twickenham, of all places.

"Pentagon officials are finding it difficult determining how effective US airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria are because of 'significant gaps in intelligence'. Senior current and former US officials have told the Associated Press that American aircraft are running under less restrictive rules than those governing drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. Despite this, they are having difficulties determining the effectiveness of the bombing missions targeting Al-Qaeda and ISIS due the lack of intelligence assets on the ground. These assets identify targets before an airstrike and conduct an after action battle damage assessment. Scroll down for video . US President Barack Obama has reduced the restrictions on US airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria . US aircraft such as these F-15E Strike Eagles patrolling over northern Iraq are looking for ISIS strongholds . Military intelligence is hampered during the current conflict by the lack of agents operating on the ground . The US military says its airstrikes have been discriminating and effective in disrupting the terrorists. But independent analysts say ISIS remains on the offensive in areas of Iraq and Syria, where it still controls large sections. And according to witnesses, US airstrikes have at times hit empty buildings that were long ago vacated by Islamic State fighters. Human rights groups also say coalition airstrikes in both countries have killed as many as two dozen civilians. US officials say they can't rule out civilian deaths but haven't confirmed any. Rear Admiral John Kirby said: 'We do take extreme caution and care in the conduct of these missions. But there's risk in any military operation. There's a special kind of risk when you do air operations.' Military officials acknowledge that they are relying mainly on satellites, drones and surveillance flights to pinpoint targets, assess the damage afterward and determine whether civilians were killed. That stands in sharp contrast to the networks of bases, spies and ground-based technology the US had in place during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials say. As a result, 'it's much harder for us to be able to know for sure what it is we're hitting, what it is we're killing and what it is collateral damage,' said Tom Lynch, a retired colonel and former adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is now a fellow at the National Defense University. In Iraq, the US is relying for ground reports on the Iraqi military and intelligence services, whose insights into ISIS controlled territory are limited. US strike aircraft are targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria during round-the-clock missions over hostile territory . In Syria, the US is not coordinating the strikes with the main moderate opposition group, the Free Syrian Army, even though it has backed that group with weapons and training, said Andrew Tabler, who follows the conflict for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The CIA is generally unwilling to send American intelligence officers into Syria, and partner Arab intelligence services are often focused on their own agendas. The intelligence gaps raise questions about the effectiveness of the strikes and about whether the current strategy will achieve the administration's goal of defeating ISIS. The group has begun adapting to US airstrikes by seeking to conceal itself, move at night and blend in with civilians, Pentagon officials say. Air Force Major General Jeffrey L Harrigan said: 'They're a smart adversary.' In terms of tracking the movements of militants, US intelligence coverage of Syria and Iraq is not as good as it was in Pakistan and Yemen at the height of covert CIA drone campaigns there, officials say. At the same time, the military's targeting rules are less restrictive. Under rules Obama announced in May 2013, no drone strike would occur without a 'near certainty' that civilians would not be harmed. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said that the near certainty standard does not govern US strikes underway in Syria and Iraq. It was intended to apply 'only when we take direct action outside areas of active hostilities,' she said in a statement. What's happening in Iraq and Syria right now is an armed conflict, Hayden said, and targeting is undertaken in compliance with the international law of war. The law of war requires militaries to take precautions to avoid killing noncombatants, but it does not hold them to a near certainty standard. After the near certainty standard was imposed on drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, the frequency of strikes dropped precipitously, and the use of so-called signature strikes - attacks aimed at large groups of armed men who fit the profile of militants but whose names were not all known to the CIA - was curtailed. There have been just nine drone strikes in Pakistan this year, according to Long War Journal, a website that tracks the strikes based on media reports. The US has been joined by the RAF who have completed their first bombing mission in Iraq . A pair of Tornado GR4 jets spotted an ISIS armed pick up truck and destroyed it with a Brimstone missile . That is down from a high of 110 strikes in 2010. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based group that has been critical of drone strikes, found no instance of civilian casualties in Pakistan in 2013 after the policy took effect. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the Syrian government, says US airstrikes have killed up to 19 civilians, including several when bombs hit a grain silo Sunday in the town of Manbij. In Iraq, according to a report in by the National Iraqi News Agency, four civilians were killed in a US airstrike on Sept. 26 in Mosul. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said this week that the US was investigating the reports of civilian casualties but that, so far, 'we've found nothing to corroborate' that civilians have been killed. The US has relied on intelligence-gathering technology - or ISR, which stands for 'intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance' - such as satellites, drones and overhead surveillance flights to determine whether there have been civilian casualties. Few if any human spotters are believed to be on the ground assessing the results of US and coalition airstrikes. Warren acknowledged that the Pentagon could not say for sure that every person killed in the bombing of Iraq and Syria has been a combatant. He said: 'The evidence is going to be inconclusive often. Remember, we're using ISR to determine the battle damage assessment.' Jennifer Cafarella, the top Syria analyst with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, said the Syrian Observatory reports are generally regarded as credible. She said: 'I think it is likely that airstrikes will inevitably result in some civilian casualties.'","President Obama has loosened the rule of engagement for bombing ISIS .

"Lager tops and Frickley Athletic brought Blyth Spartans back to reality even before the departing TV trucks signalled the end of another FA Cup fairytale at Croft Park on Saturday night. Captain Robbie Dale might have hoped for a bigger celebration after netting the two first-half goals which put the Evo-Stik League side on the brink of round four before a quick-fire second-half response from Championship Birmingham gave the visitors a 3-2 win. Instead, just hours after starring on Match Of The Day, Dale was back at his job as a bar man at the Blacksmith's pub in Gosforth on Sunday morning, while Spartans boss Tom Wade was already planning for Tuesday's looming league trip to Frickley. Robbie Dale salutes the Blyth fans after he got the side on their way to a giant killing on Saturday . Wes Thomas celebrates as Blyth lost their two-goal cushion and Birmingham went 3-2 up in the FA Cup . For lifelong Blyth fan Wade the inevitable disappointment of coming so close to a famous victory was quickly eased by his continuing focus on a job which he reluctantly accepted two years ago when the club were in dire straits. Wade said: 'We've got Frickley on Tuesday night, but if we show the same resilience and character that we showed here today then we will be okay. 'Hopefully there will be a big crowd down there to support us again because we proved today just how much this team has got to give and the future is bright. Dale applauds fans after Blyth were knocked out of the FA Cup despite their courageous effort . Blyth players are gutted after letting their two-goal lead slip in the FA Cup to eventually fall against Birmingham . 'I'm very proud of what we have achieved and the fact we scored two goals and dominated against a Championship side is a huge compliment to us. We have now got to get back to the league and hope to come again next year.' Dale sent Croft Park wild with two well-taken finishes towards the end of the first half, which stirred memories of Blyth's most famous Cup run in 1978 when - watched by Wade - they eventually lost a fifth-round replay to Wrexham. But Newcastle-born Lee Novak narrowed the deficit before two quick goals from Wes Thomas ensured Gary Rowett's Championship side wriggled out of another potential giant-killing.

'It's back to reality on Sunday morning then away to Frickley on Tuesday,' said Dale. 'We can be proud of what we have done as a team because we have been close to going out a few times, but we managed to get to this point. 'At half-time we thought the shock was on and the aim was to keep it tight for 10 or 15 minutes, but it didn't work out. In the last 20 we came again and we might have nicked something, but it wasn't to be.'","Blyth Spartans went 2-0 up against Birmingham but eventually lost 3-2 .

"New evidence: Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow, Katherine Russell (pictured in 2007 mugshot) is under scrutiny after officials discovered radical Islamist files on her computer . Federal officials investigating the Boston bombings have discovered radical Islamist materials on a computer belonging to the widow of the deceased suspect, it has been revealed. Katherine Russell, 24, has repeatedly claimed through her attorney that she knew nothing about the deadly April 15 bombings allegedly set off by her late husband, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and his younger brother, Dzhokhar. However, the discovery of al Qaeda’s Inspire magazine on Russell’s computer, along with the presence of explosive residue throughout their home, have raised new questions about Russell's possible involvement in the act of terror. According to a government document obtained by NBC News, an analysis of the bombs used at the Boston Marathon and pipe bombs that the Tsarnaevs had allegedly thrown at police may have been built following instructions that appeared in an Inspire article titled: Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom. Officials have yet to determine whether the Islamist files found in Russell’s possession belonged to the 24-year-old mother, her late 26-year-old husband or a third party, a source told The Washington Post. Tamerlan Tsranaev was shot dead in a gun battle with police four days after the marathon bombings when he and his brother allegedly carjacked a vehicle in a Boston suburb. His younger brother, 18-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had fled, setting off a massive manhunt that ended when he was discovered gravely wounded hiding in a boat. Russell's attorney, Amato DeLuca, had previously said his client was kept in the dark about the deadly plot, and she was shocked to learn that her husband and brother-in-law were allegedly responsible for the attacks. Staying silent: Katherine Russell, the wife of Boston bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office with attorney Amato DeLuca on Monday. She has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities . Meanwhile, CNN reported that . investigators inspecting Russell and Tsranaev's home in Cambridge, . Massachusetts, found traces of explosive residue in the kitchen sink, . the bathtub and on a table. Following . his arrest, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told police that he and his older brother . built the pressure cooker bombs in the basement of the Cambridge . residence. 'Incriminating': Officials say among the materials discovered on Russell's computer was al Qaeda's Inspire magazine . It was . established earlier this week that female DNA found one a piece of an . explosive device used in the attacks did not match Russell's, but rather . belonged to a department store clerk where the siblings had purchased . the pressure cookers. In . another development in the case, federal and state law enforcement . officials accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs scoured a wooded area near . Dartmouth, Massachusetts, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended college, in . search of new evidence possibly related to the attacks. According to witness accounts, the brothers may have tested explosives in the woods two weeks before the bombings . It was revealed earlier this week that Tamerlan Tsarnaev called his wife in the hours after the FBI released surveillance images of him and his younger brother. But only Russell knows what was said in the conversation, as she has stopped cooperating with authorities over recent days, the New York Times reported. Authorities are skeptical of her . insistence that she played no role in the attack or in helping the . brothers escape the authorities following the release of the . photographs, the Times reported. A source told CNN that the bombs were built in the apartment that Tsarnaev shared with Russell and their three-year-old daughter. Residue samples were found on the kitchen table, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub, the source said. Her silence comes as sources told the newspaper that the fingerprints and female DNA found on at least one of the bombs did not belong to her. Authorities had taken a sample from her this week. Spokesman Jason Pack confirmed that . agents investigating the Boston bombings visited the North Kingstown . home of Russell's parents, where Tsarnaev's widow has been staying since . the attacks. An official had revealed that female DNA was found on at least one of the bombs, although investigators haven't determined whose it is or whether it means a woman helped the two suspects. Probe: Authorities visited her parents' home this week after female DNA was found on one of the bombs . Hiding out: Russell has been staying at her parents' North Kingstown, Rhode Island home, pictured . Her lawyer says Russell denies any . involvement in the bombings, but authorities are still working to . establish what exactly she knew - if anything - before or after the . April 15 attacks. On Wednesday, attorney Amato . DeLuca insisted Russell 'will continue to meet with law enforcement, as . she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much . assistance to the investigation as she can'. Russell met Tamerlan while she was a student at Suffolk University, according to her lawyer. She converted to Islam and they married in 2010 before having a daughter, now three. Her husband was killed on April 18 following a shoot out with police in Watertown. Investigators say his younger brother hit him with a car as he fled the scene. Suspect: Russell's husband Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured in 2010, died after a gun battle with police . Body: A vehicle believed to be carrying Tsarnaev's body backs into an underground garage at the Dyer-Lake Funeral Home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. His family claimed his body on Thursday . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught the following day as he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard. Tsarnaev's cause of death could be released on Friday. The state medical examiner's office will go public with that . information once the funeral home files a death certificate. Russell, who has been living with her . parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, learned this week that the medical . examiner was ready to release his body and wanted it released to his family. Department of Public Safety spokesman Terrel Harris said a funeral home . retained by Tsarnaev's family picked up the remains. He . said he had no more information about plans for the body. Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, said Tuesday night the family would take the body. Changed: Russell, pictured left in high school and right following the bombings, met Tamerlan while she was a college student but dropped out when she fell pregnant. She converted to Islam for him . 'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' Tsarni said. 'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.' The April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards near the marathon's finish line, . killed three people and injured more than 180 others. Russell's attorneys have previously said she and her family were in shock when . they learned of the allegations against her husband and brother-in-law, . Dzhokhar.","Katherine Russell, 24, had al Qaeda's extremist Inspire magazine on her computer .

"Dozens of disabled travelers have lodged complaints with Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport over invasive TSA checks that left them feeling violated and humiliated, according to records released this week. One complaint involved an 82-year-old, wheelchair-bound woman who was allegedly asked to remove her prosthetic breast by a TSA agent in June 2012. Some 26 complaints were made against the Arizona airport involving people with disabilities in 2012 - double the national average. Humiliated: Marine Cpl Toran Gaal, pictured, lost both of his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan. He was allegedly subjected to humiliating searches at Phoenix airport in March this year . According to the Arizona Republic, the complaint filed on behalf of the 82-year-old woman read: 'At her age and physical capability, she posed absolutely no risk whatsoever to anyone’s safety and should not have been subjected to such invasive and (undignifed) treatment. 'This sort of degrading treatment is more appropriate for prisoners.' Another breast cancer survivor said that a TSA agent ordered a pat-down of her prosthetic breast in a public area of the terminal. The woman said that she was forced to reveal her breast 'in front of the world' and that the degrading experience 'ruined my vacation'. In a high-profile incident in March this year, a double amputee and Afghan War veteran, Marine Cpl Toran Gaal, was allegedly forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them without the use of his wheelchair. The TSA has denied that this incident took place, saying that airport surveillance footage shows that the Marine's prosthetics were not removed. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Phoenix Airport regarding the high level of complaints. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport received more than double the national average of complaints about its security checkpoints in 2012 (file photo) In . a statement to MailOnline, the TSA said: 'The Transportation Security . Administration (TSA) strives to treat every passenger with dignity and . respect. During the screening process, if an anomaly is detected, . secondary screening is required to ensure the passenger does not have . threat items, such as explosives concealed under clothing. 'A . passenger should not be asked to remove or lift any article of clothing . to reveal a sensitive body area or to remove a prosthetic. 'TSA . works with numerous groups including breast cancer organizations to . continuously refine and enhance our procedures to improve the passenger . experience while also ensuring the safety of the traveling public.' The TSA recommends on their website that disabled passengers and travelers with medical conditions call ahead to find out what they may face at the screening process. According to the TSA website, if an agent feels that a pat-down is necessary as part of the screening process, then a private screening area can be requested at any time by the passenger. It also states that the option should be offered by the agent. It is against TSA policy to ask a passenger to remove or lift any article of clothing to reveal a sensitive body area.","Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport had double the national average of complaints against TSA agents in 2012 .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . Blyth Spartans are faced with a dilemma – use the momentum of the FA Cup run to bid for promotion, or allow their heroes to win a promotion of their own with an offer from the Football League? The seventh-tier club – the lowest-ranked team in the third round and who led 2-0 against Birmingham before the Championship side turned the tie around – will attempt to do both. The Spartans – who won a new Twitter follower in Luis Figo on Saturday - have ambition. But they have loyalty, too. Blyth Spartans players celebrate taking the lead against Birmingham as they looked to cause a FA Cup upset . Wes Thomas celebrates as Blyth lost their two-goal cushion and Birmingham went on to win 3-2 . Dale applauds fans after Blyth were knocked out of the FA Cup despite their courageous effort . Manager Tom Wade explained: ‘This is a crucial point in the club's history. How we do in the next month will decide the next few years. If we don't take advantage and build we will just float around and we don't want that. ‘We have to make this club into something special. We have got the team to do it and the momentum is there. ‘But yes, we have already had three or four inquiries and there were scouts watching our players (on Saturday). ‘I would be very disappointed if I didn't get a few calls in the next week or so. I think a lot of these lads deserve a chance to be full time. If you put some fitness and strength into these lads they could be world beaters. ‘They'd definitely go with my blessing. We wouldn't stand in their way.’ Blyth manager Tom Wade admitted the club may sell its star players to plan for the future . Dale of Blyth Spartans scores his side's first goal after the 35th minute to take a surprise lead . Blyth players Stephen Turnbull (centre) and Jarrett Rivers (right) after the full-time whistle confirmed  defeat . Newsagent Jarrett Rivers, 21, is one player courting attention from above and he laid on the first goal for barman Robbie Dale, who has long since turned down professional advances. The 30-year-old put Blyth in dreamland with a solo second but by the hour mark those hopes were dashed, Lee Novak and Wes Thomas (2) netting three times in six minutes for the Championship side. Dale, though, is fully signed up to the Spartans cause and wants to see the revenue from the cup run invested in the side. ‘You could get hammered off a team like that, so we’ve shown what a good side we are by giving them a proper game,’ he said. ‘Our last cup run paid off a lot of the debts. There was money invested in the team last time, but we need to make sure it’s the right investment and that it’ s the right players who come in.

"US Navy Seals are believed to have killed a senior member of the terrorist group Al Shabaab in a pre-dawn raid on its headquarters in Somalia. Residents in the coastal town of Barawe told news agencies they were woken by heavy gunfire and shelling early yesterday morning as soldiers came ashore in boats and launched an attack on a two-storey building. US defence sources said helicopters were called in for air support as a battle raged for an hour in the coastal town 150 miles south of the Somalia capital Mogadishu. Responsible: Somalian-based terrorist organization al Shabab took credit for the attack while it was going on . Residents in the coastal town of Barawe said they were woken by gunfire and shelling early yesterday morning . But the Americans were forced to withdraw before they could confirm the death of their terror target. No details were revealed about fatalities or casualties among the Seals, but a spokesman for Al Shabaab boasted that the raid had been repulsed. British and Turkish defence officials denied that their troops had been involved. Confirmation of the raid came as Kenyan police released the names of four Al Shabaab fighters they believe were killed in the Westgate mall attack – which left 67 people dead including six Britons. Abu Baara al-Sudani, Omar Nabhan, Khattav al-Kene and Umayr are not  thought to have escaped the shopping centre alive. The four – who were seen on CCTV carrying rifles and patrolling storerooms inside the mall – supposedly died in a shoot-out with police. Abu Baara al-Sudani is believed to have been the ringleader. He was apparently seen beckoning to the others. Omar Nabhan is thought to have been related to the mastermind of the Al Qaeda attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1991. Surveillance footage from the Westgate Mall shows one of the terrorists involved in the attack that killed 67 shoppers last month .","Residents in coastal town say they were woken by gunfire and shelling .

"A Department of Homeland Security employee who was unmasked in August as a radical black nationalist who publicly called for an all-out war against with the white race is no longer employed by the agency, it was revealed today. Ayo Kimathi, an acquisitions officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement handling small businesses, was placed on administrative leave four months ago after it was revealed that he has been using his website, WarOnTheHorizon.com, to advocate for the mass murder of Caucasians. The site includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race.' Kimathi is black. Good riddance: Ayo Kimathi finally left his job as acquisitions officer . for Immigration and Customs Enforcement some four months after it . was discovered that he has been moonlighting as an advocate for a race . war . Hate speech: Kimathi, who is black, operates the website War on the Horizon, which includes descriptions of an 'unavoidable, inevitable clash with the white race' On Wednesday, DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen confirmed to National Journal that Kimathi left the agency December 6. She would not specify, however, whether he resigned or was fired, citing privacy policies. 'This is welcome but long overdue news,' said Josh Glasstetter, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which exposed Kimathi's double life over the summer. 'DHS had known for months about Kimathi's promotion of violence. Some of his coworkers reportedly feared for their own safety. Regrettably, DHS only took action after we publicized his activities.' Kimathi was hired by DHS in 2009, and last year he drew an annual salary of more than $115,000. On the side, the federal employee has been running a website criticizing whites, gays, those of mixed race, and blacks who integrate with whites. In his lectures and speeches, some of them available on YouTube, Kimathi heaped abuse on President Obama for his support of gay rights, calling him a ‘goddamn f***** mulatto.’ The SPLC in August reported on Kimathi's role in operating the radical web portal. Hostile: A former manager at DHS said that 'everybody in the office is afraid' of Kimatha . 'At this point in history, whites worldwide are threatening the existence of every Black man, woman, and child on Earth,' one passage on the site read. 'Since we are the most valuable people . alive and there is no need for this planet’s existence without us, it . is time for us to prepare for the international war for Black survival.' Kimathi, . who calls himself 'the irritated Genie,' received permission to launch . the site after falsely telling his supervisors at the DHS that War on the . Horizon was set up to sell concert and lecture videos. Author: Kimathi wrote a book under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees on the subject of the effeminization of the black male by whites, which retails on Amazon for more than $756 . ‘He called it simply WOH, never saying that WOH stood for War on the Horizon,’ the report stated. DHS spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said in a written statement that the agency ‘does not condone any type of hateful rhetoric or advocacy of violence of any kind against anyone.’ The Alabama-based SPLC said in its report that Kimathi's site declares: ‘in order for Black people to survive the 21st century, we are going to have to kill a lot of whites – more than our Christian hearts can possibly count.' A former manager at DHS reportedly told SPLC that 'everybody in the office is afraid of him,' adding that his co-workers have expressed concerns that one day, Kimathi would bring a gun 'and go postal.' His hate-filled rhetoric aside, however, Kimathi’s ex-supervisor described him as a ‘suave’ professional with a ‘commanding presence’ who excelled at his job advocating for small business owners. The radical activist appears to have a long list of enemies, among them Rev. Al Sharpton, Lil Wayne, Oprah Winfrey, Whoopi Goldberg, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, dubbed by him ‘Colon,’ and the long-deceased FBI director ‘Gay Edgar Hoover.’ Besides preparing members of the black . race for war on whites, Kimathi also has been going after gays and . lesbians, while accusing the US government of pursuing a secret agenda . of trying to ‘effeminize’ the black male as a way of destroying the race. In a lengthy blog post that was uploaded on the radical site November 1, the writer accused the Obama administration of pressuring Lincoln University and other historically black colleges to promote homosexuality to student body - or risk losing their funding. In September, another post addressed the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin. The author of the foul-mouthed communique referred to the defendant as a 'zionist smallhat' while calling the victim 'Brother Trayvon.' Firebrand: Besides running the website, Kimathi also has been giving lectures and speeches advocating for a war of whites and homosexuals . Anti-gay: Lomathi lambasted President Obama for his support of LGBT community in 2009 speech . Harsh words: Kimathi said he was disillusioned with Michelle Obama for wearing a 'lingerie'-style dress on the cover of People magazine . A book on the subject titled ‘War on the Horizon: Black Resistance to the white-sex Assault,’ which was apparently written by Kimathi under the pen name the Irritated Genie of Soufees, retails on Amazon for more than $756, the Huffington Post reported. In a particularly incendiary video from August 2009 posted on his YouTube page, which was unearthed by the site Mediate, Kimathi delivered a racially charged and homophobic speech blasting President Obama as a' goddamn f***** mullato' for his efforts to extend rights to members of the LGBT community. Dressed in a gold-colored African garb with an amulet around his neck, Kimathi raged against Obama, whom he repeatedly called 'f**' and 'miserable, low-life, scum-dwelling product of the Europeans’ for his decision to designate June 2009 as National LGBT Pride Month. List of enemies: Rev. Al Sharpton (left), Oprah Winfrey (center) and Colin Powell(right) are among the black leaders that Kimathi considers traitors to their race . Kimathi also did not spare the first . lady, saying that he had started out admiring Michelle Obama as an . articulate black woman, but was later disillusioned with her after . seeing the cover of People magazine that featured the mother of two . sporting a pink lacy dress with a V-neck, which he labelled 'lingerie.' ‘Damn, these crackers got us! They got a f***** and a sister who's out of control, and they're embarrassing us around the world,' he cried.","Ayo Kimathi worked as acquisition officer for DHS dealing with small businesses since 2009 .

"Deceased: Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot by an FBI agent. Initial reports said he had a knife but that was not true . An FBI agent fatally shot a Chechen man in Orlando, Florida early Wednesday after the man allegedly turned violent as he was preparing to sign a written confession to his involvement in a 2011 triple homicide, according to authorities. Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot dead at his condo near Universal Studios just after midnight, FBI Special Agent Dave Couvertier confirmed to MailOnline. Authorities say Todashev, who had ties to Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pulled a knife on the agent, prompting him to fire his weapon in self defense. The agent was taken to a nearby hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. 'The agent, two Massachusetts State Police troopers, and other law enforcement personnel were interviewing an individual in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation when a violent confrontation was initiated by the individual,' the FBI said in a statement. 'During the confrontation, the individual was killed.' Investigators said Todashev is not suspected of playing a role in the bombings, but that he had implicated himself and Tsarnaev in a gruesome triple slaying in 2011. No suspects had been arrested in that case, in which three men were found in an apartment in Waltham, Mass. on Sept. 11, 2011 with their throats cut and marijuana covering their bodies. Confession: Todashev had allegedly admitted to being involved in the 2011 slaying and that he was preparing to sign a written statement based on his confession when he turned violent and was subsequently shot dead earlier this week . Ibragim Todashev is pictured in 2009 with injuries from boxing at the Massachusetts gym where Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev trained . Investigation: An FBI evidence response team enters an apartment after an agent shot and killed Ibragim Todashev who was questioned in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings . Crime scene: Investigators stand outside the apartment complex where Todashev was fatally shot . Todashev met Tsarnaev while he was living in Boston because they were both involved in mixed martial arts and boxing . Massachusetts investigators had reported earlier this month that they were uncovering 'mounting evidence' that Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, were involved in the slaying. One of the victims, Brendan Mess, was a close friend of Tamerlan's. Officials told NBC that Todashev had admitted to being involved in the slaying and that he turned violent when authorities pressured him to sign a statement based on his confession. The officials also told NBC that Todashev had some connections with radical Chechen rebels. The FBI has been investigating Todashev for the last month, questioning him several times regarding his ties to 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by . police in a shootout following the deadly April 15 marathon bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, has been charged in connection with the bombings . and is being held at a prison medical center outside Boston. Khusen Taramov, a friend of Todashev's, confirmed that Todashev and Tsarnaev knew each other. He said they had been in contact via phone or Skype about . a week before the bombings. Friend: Todashev's friend, Khusen Taramov, says the FBI had been following him and Todashev since the bombings . Shortly before the shooting, Todashev 'had a bad feeling. He felt there's going to be a set-up against him,' a friend said . An FBI investigator walks to the apartment where Todashev was shot by an FBI agent . In an interview with Orlando television station WESH, Taramov said that the two met while Todashev was living in Boston because . they were both involved in mixed martial arts and boxing. Todashev . 'wasn't like real close friends [with Tsarnaev], but he just happened . to know him,' Taramov said. 'But he had no idea that they were up to . something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I . mean?' Taramov says the FBI has been . following him and Todashev since the bombings. He said that they were . both being interviewed by agents late Tuesday before Todashev was killed. He claims his friend is innocent and that he has been targeted by authorities because he is a Muslim. 'He was just a Muslim - that was his . mistake, I guess,' Taramov, also a Muslim, told WESH. He said his friend . is not an extremist and that he doesn't believe he owned a gun. Shortly before the shooting, Todashev 'had a bad feeling. He felt there's going to be a set-up against him,' Taramov said. Todashev gave him phone numbers for his mother and father late Monday just in case he got 'locked up.' The FBI had questioned Todashev in the past regarding his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right). Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, (left), has been charged in connection with the bombings . Blasts: The April 15 explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon killed three people and injured more than 240 . 'We had a feeling that a worse-case scenario, that something like [a shooting] is going to happen,' Taramov told the television station. Victim: Brendan Mess was one of three victims in a triple slaying that Todashev allegedly confessed to police that he and Tsarnaev had committed in September 2011 . The mother of the Tsarnaev brothers, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, also confirmed that her older son knew Todashev. In a telephone interview with the New York Times from Dagestan, Tsarnaeva said Todashev moved from Boston to Florida about two years ago. She said she is devastated to learn that he has been killed. 'Now another boy has left this life,' she told the newspaper. 'Why are they killing these children without any trial or investigation?' Todashev . was arrested in an unrelated incident on May 4 for aggravated battery . after he left a man unconscious in the parking lot of a shopping mall. According to the arrest affidavit, Todashev had gotten into an altercation with a man and his son over parking space. Todashev told police that the man . 'got into his face' so he pushed him and then the man's son 'got . involved' and Todashev began fighting him. 'Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March,' the affidavit states. A mall security officer arrived on scene to find the son unconscious and lying in a pool of blood on the ground just as Todashev was pulling away in a white Mercedes. The officer chased down the Mercedes, ordered Todashev out at gunpoint and arrested him. The son was later treated at a hospital with a split upper lip, several teeth knocked out and head injuries.

"Self-confessed 'quiet man' Iain Duncan Smith may not have been much of an inspiration to Tory leader. But the Cabinet minister appears to have made an unlikely lasting impression elsewhere - after a superstar American footballer quoted one of his most ridiculed speeches. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick features Mr Duncan Smith's 'quiet man' defence of his failing Tory leadership on his official Twitter page. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has plastered on his Twitter profile a quote from 'Iain Smith', reading: 'Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man' The US pin-up has plastered on his Twitter profile a quote from 'Iain Smith', reading: 'Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.' The quote is taken from a speech given by Mr Duncan Smith in 2002 to his party conference in Bournemouth, amid grumblings about his leadership. He warned delegates that he would not waver in his mission to transform his party after suffering a second landslide election defeat to Tony Blair in 2001. He told Tory representatives: 'Go out there and tell the world - the Conservatives are back.' Mr Duncan Smith said his opponents should not underestimate 'the determination of the quiet man'. Just a year later Mr Duncan Smith was forced to resign after losing a vote of no confidence in his leadership by Conservative backbenchers.] . He had only become the leader of the party in 2001, succeeding William Hague. Kaepernick is unlikely to be troubled by any embarrassment about his choice of Mr Duncan Smith as an inspiration. The quarterback signed a bumper new contract at the San Francisco 49ers last year - worth a mammoth £75million. The six-year deal, which will see him stay at the 49ers until 2020, has rocketed him among the top earners in the NFL and will see him earn £12.5million annually. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured giving his last party conference speech as Tory leader in 2003, described himself as a 'quiet man' who would lead the Tories back into power . He will rake in £240,000-a-week in his new contract and, when this is compared to the salaries of the Premier League's top earner, only Wayne Rooney (£300,000-a-week) and Robin Van Persie (£250,000-a-week) take home more. Kapernick was a second round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, but he quickly took over the starting berth from Alex Smith, leading the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season - a match they lost to Baltimore by three points. He then guided them to the NFC championship game last season - and another a three-point defeat, this time to 49ers' rivals and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks.","Work and Pensions Secretary finds unlikely supporter in the United States .

"Dozens of protesters on both sides of the immigration debate showed up in a small town near Tucson on Tuesday after the sheriff said the federal government plans to transport about 40 immigrant children to an academy for troubled youths - but the kids never arrived. The rallies demonstrated the deep divide of the immigration debate. One group waved American flags, held signs that read 'Return to Sender' and 'Go home non-Yankees' and said they would block a bus that was supposed to arrive with immigrant children aboard. It turned heated at times, with . shouting matches and a group of mariachi musicians getting shoved before . the skirmishes were quelled. A few miles up the road, about 50 pro-immigrant supporters held welcome signs with drawings of hearts.  The dueling groups each had about 50 people. Scroll down for video .

A major U.S. effort to discourage repeated attempts by immigrants to enter the country illegally by flying and busing them into Mexico hundreds of miles away from where they were caught has been sharply scaled back after producing relatively modest gains . 'We are not going to tolerate illegals forced upon us,' protester Loren Woods said. Emily Duwel of Oracle said she did not want her town to be misrepresented by what she said was a minority of people against the children being housed here. 'I'm just concerned about these children who have had to escape worlds of incredible violence,' Duwel said. No immigrant children had arrived as of midday, and it wasn't clear if they would ever show up. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu's office cited 'whistleblowers' within the Department of Homeland Security that immigrant children were being sent there. A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a Democrat who represents southern Arizona, said the congressman's office was told by the federal government that children would not be arriving Tuesday. Anger has been spreading in the town of Oracle since Sheriff Babeu warned residents last week that immigrant children from Central America caught crossing the border illegally would be placed at the Sycamore Canyon Academy in Oracle.

Seeing red: Adam Kwasman, a Tea Party patriot running for congress (R), has a heated discussion with an anti-immigration activist during a protest .

Dozens of protesters on both sides of the immigration debate showed up in a small town near Tucson on Tuesday after the sheriff said the federal government plans to transport about 40 immigrant children to an academy for troubled youths . Protesters were hoping to mirror demonstrations in Murrieta, California, when immigrants were taken there recently. Babeu is credited with stirring up the anti-immigrant protesters via social media postings and a press release Monday and by leaking information about the migrants coming to a local activist. He addressed both sides of the protesters, asking them to remain civil, abide by the law and keep the roads cleared. Immigrant rights activists questioned Babeu about why he is stirring up protesters when he should be bringing order as the county's top lawman. The sheriff says he is concerned about public safety because he does not know whether any of the migrant children are gang affiliated or have health issues. He said that reports of health issues are likely overblown. Protesters were hoping to mirror demonstrations in Murrieta, California, when immigrants were taken there recently . Open hearts: Approximately 50 people gathered in Oracle, Ariz., 50 miles from Tucson, to pass friendly messages to unaccompanied minors of Central American origins . The brightly colored signs decorated with hearts and words of support stood in sharp contrast to posters reading 'Return to Sender' and 'Go home non-Yankees' Waiting game: Federal officials delayed the bus with no details on whether the children will arrive or not . Babeu has generated controversy in the past over his immigration rhetoric. When five bodies were found in a burned-out SUV in his county in 2012, Babeu quickly declared that the killings appeared to be the work of a drug cartel. A few days later, it was learned that it was a murder-suicide of a suburban Phoenix family and not drug-related. The same year, Sheriff Babeu, then a rising star in the local Republican Party with aspirations to run for a congressional seat, became embroiled in a scandal sparked by allegations that he threatened his ex-boyfriend, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, with deportation, Phoenix New Times reported. Unflattering coverage: In 2012, Sheriff Babeu, pictured here in his underwear in an imagie allegedly sent to a friend, was accused by his ex-boyfriend, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, of threatening him with deportation; Babeu was later cleared of any wrongdoing . Jose Orozco, Babeu’s former paramour, accused him of threatening to use his influence to eject him from the country if their relationship ever became public. Babeu, who at the time co-chaired Mitt Rooney's presidential campaign in Arizona, vehemently denied these allegations, even as Orozco released their text message exchanges on the subject and a photo depicting the sheriff in his underwear, which he allegedly had emailed to an unnamed friend. About five months later, a special prosecutor assigned to investigate the claims cleared Babeu of any wrongdoing, saying that there was no indication the sheriff misused his authority or public funds to intimidate his ex-boyfriend. The controversy forced Babeu to part ways with Romney’s campaign and drop out of the congressional race. 'All this was done in secrecy and that's where a lot of people are upset,' Babeu said Tuesday. 'My concern (is) where's the federal government? Why are they not here? Why did they not hold a town hall to answer some of these questions?' Calls to the academy where the children were supposed to be housed were not returned. A spokesman for the federal Department of Health and Human Services said the agency would not identify the locations of shelters for migrants to protect their identities and security. 'We don't know who they are. We don't know their health conditions. We don't know a doggone thing because the federal government isn't telling us anything,' protest organizer Robert Skiba said. Anger has been spreading since a massive surge in unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally began more than a month ago.

Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeau addresses immigration protesters, who's anger has been spreading throughout the U.S. Southwest since a massive surge in unaccompanied Central American children crossing the border illegally began more than a month ago . Though largely considered a humanitarian crisis, the influx of immigrants has also become political fodder. In a state known for its strict immigration laws, including SB1070, which many call the 'show me your papers' law, attitudes are just as contentious. The fallout began in late May when reports surfaced that immigration officials were dropping off hundreds of women and children at Phoenix and Tucson Greyhound bus stations after they had been caught crossing the border illegally. Within a week, immigration authorities were flying hundreds of children who had crossed the border into Texas alone to the Border Patrol facility in Nogales. Possible solution: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he is prepared to host some of the undocumented youths in temporary shelters set up in his city . Republican Gov. Jan Brewer sharply criticized the move and demanded it stop. Republican candidates for governor have also chimed in. Some are expected to attend the rally on Tuesday. As tempers flared during the dual protests in Oracle, Arizona, Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he is prepared to host some of the undocumented youths in his city. Garcetti announced that he is working with local charities to find temporary shelter for some of the Central American children in response to a request made by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. The subject of kids fleeing from countries in Central America to the U.S. arose at a forum hosted by Politico Magazine, where Garcetti was asked whether Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, would be willing to accept any of the youngsters on a temporary basis. ‘We are going to. We've already talked to HHS,’ he said, adding, ‘These are children. ‘As a father, who are we as Americans if we don't step forward first and say, “these kids who are isolated, alone ... let's get them someplace safe and secure,""’ he said. Mayoral spokeswoman Vicki Curry said Garcetti, acting at the request of HHS, had convened a meeting last Friday with a number of local charities and public agencies ‘to discuss the means of taking in and taking care of some these children.’ Garcetti said 62 per cent of Los Angeles residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, a demographic he cited as a ‘competitive strength’ for the city.","Sheriff Paul Babeu in Oracle, Ariz., said the federal government plans to transport about 40 immigrant children to an academy for troubled youths .

"Phil Mickelson said he will make 'drastic changes' because of federal and California state tax increases. 'It's been an interesting offseason,' Mickelson said Sunday after the final round of the Humana Challenge. 'And I'm going to have to make some drastic changes. 'I'm not going to jump the gun and do it right away, but I will be making some drastic changes.' 'Drastic changes': Phil Mickelson pictured during the Humana Challenge golf tournament in La Quinta, California, says the state's tax hikes may force him to either retire or move out . The 42-year-old golfer said he would talk in more detail about his plans - possibly moving away from California or even retiring from golf - before his hometown Farmers Insurance Open, the San Diego-area event that starts on Thursday at Torrey Pines. 'I'm not sure what exactly, you know, I'm going to do yet,' Mickelson said. 'I'll probably talk about it more in depth next week. I'm not going to jump the gun, but there are going to be some.' He added: 'There are going to be some . drastic changes for me because I happen to be in that zone that has . been targeted both federally and by the state and, you know, it doesn't . work for me right now. So I'm going to have to make some changes.' On the way out? Mickelson says 'there are going to be some drastic changes for me' In November, California voters approved Proposition 30, the first statewide tax increase since 2004. Mickelson lives in Rancho Santa Fe. 'If you add up all the federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security and the state, my tax rate's 62, 63 per cent,' Mickelson said. 'So I've got to make some decisions on what I'm going to do.' Last year, Mickelson flirted with becoming a part owner of the San Diego Padres, the baseball team that sold for $800million in August. He was asked Sunday if there was a correlation between the tax increases and what happened to the Padres' deal. 'Absolutely,' Mickelson said. He later explained why he was waiting to provide more details. 'I'll probably be in the media center and I'll probably be a little more open to it because San Diego is where a lot more things, it's where I live, it's where the Padre thing was a possibility, and it's where my family is,' Mickelson said. 'And it just seems like a better fit than right here off of 18 on Palm Springs.' Mickelson closed with a 66 on Sunday to tie for 37th at 17 under in his season debut. 'I was rusty starting the year,' Mickelson said. 'I had a great four days here where I can work on my game with perfect weather and wonderful golf courses, where I could build some momentum. Heading into San Diego, I feel a lot more confident.' The tournament was his first since the HSBC Champions in early November in China. The Hall of Famer has 40 PGA Tour victories.

"With the tax return deadline looming, many Americans are scrambling to ensure that everything is in order. With the economic situation still precarious, tax collectors are looking for ever more weird and wonderful ways to raise revenue. Such is the diversity of products and lifestyles across the 50 states that federal financial planners are hoping to take advantage of the specific portfolio of products on offer in their area. Below is a list of some of the more interesting and inventive solutions federal leaders have come up with to try and balance the books. Drug tax: In many U.S. states anyone possessing cannabis or other illegal drugs is legally obliged to buy and affix state-issued stamps onto the contraband material . The Marijuana Tax . In many U.S. states anyone possessing cannabis is legally obliged to buy and affix state-issued stamps onto the contraband material. The total cost of the tax is generally determined by the quantity of the marijuana possessed. Unlike typical criminal statutes prohibiting the possession and sale of controlled substances, drug tax stamp laws primarily assess financial penalties on the offender for noncompliance. The Blueberry Tax:  Maine produces all but 1 percent of the wild blueberries sold nationally. Anyone growing, handling, processing, selling or . purchasing blueberries pays a tax of a penny-and-a-half per pound. Berry taxing: Anyone growing, handling, processing, selling or purchasing blueberries in Maine pays a tax of a penny-and-a-half per pound . Jock Tax:Many cities and states levy a 'jock tax' on any income earned by entertainers and athletes while working in that city. Therefore, athletes have to pay taxes on a portion of their income in any place they play. Tax prize money: Many cities and states levy a 'jock tax' on any income . earned by entertainers and athletes, such as Tiger Woods, while working . in that city . Nudity:  Those responsible for raising funds in Utah levy a tax on . services provided by those who make their money in the non-clothed manner. Any business employing 'nude or partially nude' workers, must pay a . tax of 10 percent on services sold to patrons. Naked truth: Any business employing 'nude or partially nude' workers in Utah must pay a tax of 10 percent on services sold to patrons . Fur: Minnesota, imposes a tax of . 6.5 percent on the sale of fur apparel. A garment must contain at least three times as much fur as . it does of the next-most-valuable material that went into its creation. The same tax applies to the shipping of fur items and to . any finance charges that may have been incurred. Tattoos: Arkansas taxes tattoos at a rate of 6 percent for every sale, and it also applies the same tax to body piercings and . electrolysis, so getting a tattoo, body piercing and some electrolysis will set you back a tidy sum. Tatt's a lot: If David Beckham (pictured) lived in Arkansas he would . have had to pay 6 percent to get this tattoo of his wife Victoria . Pets:  In Durham, North Carolina, anyone who . owns a cat or dog must pay tax, since the state considers pets to be . personal property no different from, a computer or a bike. However the tax is less for spayed or neutered pets at a rate of only $10 per animal. But for pets who still have their vital reproducing equipment, it is $75. This . is in contrast to New York's bagel tax, where an eight per cent . charge is added to bagels that have been 'altered' but not to ones which have been uncut. Pet power: In North Carolina the tax is less for spayed or neutered pets. Pictured, Yoda who took part in the World's Ugliest Dog Contest in California last year .

"David Cameron and Theresa May are locked in a battle to curb police stop and search powers. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary are split over plans to limit the use of the powers and impose heavier punishments on officers who break the law. Mrs May has warned the excessive use of stop and search is a ‘dreadful waste of police time’ and fears young black men being disproportionately targeted risks undermining public confidence in the police. Clash: David Cameron fears Theresa May's plans to rein in the use of stop and search powers will make the Tories appear soft on crime . In a damning report last year, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary found more than a quarter of police stop and searches are ‘unlawful’ and risk promoting ‘major disorder’. In 27 per cent of cases, police failed to show they had reasonable grounds to carry out the search. It is the equivalent of 250,000 people every year being stopped and subjected to hugely intrusive searches without the police sticking to the rules. Official statistics show that, if someone is from a black or minority ethnic background, they are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than if they are white. Mrs May has warned: ‘If anybody thinks it is sustainable to allow that to continue, with all its consequences for public confidence in the police, they need to think again.’ Risks: Excessive use of the powers wastes 312,000 hours per year, Mrs May believes . She also believes a total of 312,000 hours per year—the equivalent of 145 full-time police officers – are taken up filling in forms recording searches. ‘At its best, stop and search is a vital power in the fight against crime; at its worst, it is a waste of police timeand serves to undermine public confidence in the police. It is time to get stop and search right,’ Mrs May said in July. The government was due to respond to a consultation on reining in the powers by the end of the year. But the Home Office is at loggerheads with Downing Street, which fears the Tories appearing soft on crime. In a bid to play down talk of a Cabinet split, Mr Cameron insisted at Prime Minister's Questions that reforms to stop and search are needed. But he stressed Government would only legislate if it was 'necessary'. He told MPs: 'Stop and search does need reform because what the HMIC report shows is that in 27 per cent of cases the police have not been following their own guidance in terms of stop and search. So, we do need to reform stop and search. If it is necessary to legislate, legislate, if it is not, we won't. 'But what's really important is that stop and search is used properly but we don't add to the burdens of the police.' Number 10 played down the suggestion it was blocking Mrs May’s flagship reforms, but insisted no final decision had been made. A Home Office spokesperson said: ‘Nobody should ever be stopped just on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity. ‘The government supports the ability of police officers to stop and search suspects, but it must be applied fairly and in a way which builds community confidence. ‘This is why we consulted over the summer on the powers of stop and search – and we received a strong response. We will respond to the consultation in due course.’","Young black men 7 times more likely to be stopped than a white person .

"Jack Bruce, the composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist, most famous for being part of 1960s group Cream has died aged 71. Bassist Bruce, who was part of the group with guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker, passed away at his home in Suffolk today, surrounded by his family. His family said: 'It is with great sadness that we, Jack's family, announce the passing of our beloved Jack: husband, father, granddad, and all round legend. The world of music will be a poorer place without him but he lives on in his music and forever in our hearts.' Scroll down for video . Jack Bruce who was part of 1960s group Cream has died aged 71 at his home in Suffolk . Bruce's family said 'the world of music will be a poorer place without him but he lives on in his music and forever in our hearts' Bassist Bruce, left, on stage with Eric Clapton, middle, and Ginger Baker at Madison Square Garden in 2005 . Bruce's death was announced on his official website, and confirmed by his publicist Claire Singers. Cream sold 35 million albums in just over two years and were awarded the world's first ever platinum disc for their LP Wheels of Fire. Bruce wrote and sang most of the songs, including 'I Feel Free', 'White Room', 'Politician' and perhaps the world's most performed guitar riff, in 'Sunshine Of Your Love'. Cream split in November 1968 at the height of their popularity. Bruce felt that he had strayed too far from his ideals and wanted to re-discover his musical and social roots. Many artists covered Bruce's songs, from Jimi Hendrix, to David Bowie and Ella Fitzgerald. Bruce, born in Glasgow on May 14, 1943, joined his first major band in London in 1962. This was Alexis Korner's Blues Inc. with whom Charlie Watts, later to join the Rolling Stones, was drummer.

Bruce, left, Baker, middle and Clapton, right, leaving London's Heathrow Airport for America in 1967 . Bruce left Korner in 1963 to form a group with organist Graham Bond, guitarist John McLaughlin and drummer Ginger Baker. This group became the seminal Graham Bond Organisation after McLaughlin left, and saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith joined. Bruce was compelled to leave this band after three years by Baker, who said his playing was 'too busy'. Bruce joined John Mayall's Blues Breakers, where he first met Clapton, followed by Manfred Mann in an ill-advised attempt at commercialism. It was Baker who initially asked Bruce to form a trio with Clapton, who insisted that Bruce would be the singer. Bruce joined his first major band, Alexis Korner's Blues Inc, in 1962, and later embarked on a solo career . After Cream broke up, Bruce began recording solo albums, the first being his influential Songs For A Tailor and thereafter began his policy of playing simultaneously in rock, jazz and classical formats. He also worked as session man on carefully chosen dates with such stars as Lou Reed and Frank Zappa, with whom Jack co-wrote Apostrophe, which became Zappa's biggest selling album. In 2005, Bruce reunited with Clapton and Baker for Cream's first concert tour in 37 years. And in May the band played four historic nights at London's Royal Albert Hall, which were recorded and subsequently released on both audio and video. In October the band played three concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Bruce and his wife Margrit were hoping to retire to their beautiful estancia in Majorca.","Jack Bruce's family said the 'world of music will be a poorer place'

"Orson Welles's last film may finally be released after four decades as one of cinema's most renowned unfinished creations. The New York Times reported that a Los Angeles-based production company, Royal Road Entertainment, has agreed to buy the rights to Welles' largely unseen The Other Side of the Wind. Producers are now planning to unveil the film on May 6 - the 100th anniversary of his birth. Scroll down for video . Unfinished creation: A Los Angeles-based production company, Royal Road Entertainment, has reportedly agreed to buy the rights to Orson Welles' largely unseen The Other Side of the Wind . The semi-autobiographical film is about a movie director, played by John Huston, feuding with Hollywood over an ambitious film. Welles shot the movie in 1971 and spent the rest of his life editing it, before dying in 1985. Director Peter Bogdanovich, who appears in the film, will help edit the footage, which includes a roughly 45-minute edited print. Welles is said to have worked tirelessly on the project in the last 15 years of his life - he died in 1985 - and bankrolled it by taking on television roles and tapping investors. The supporting cast included Susan Strasberg, Lilli Palmer and  Dennis Hopper. Bogdanovich also makes an appearance as a young up-and-coming director. The new agreement comes following a long stalemate between rights holders: Welles's longtime companion and collaborator, Oja Kodar; his daughter and sole heir, Beatrice Welles; and an Iranian-French production company, L'Astrophore. Cast: Dennis Hopper (left(, John Ford (middle) and John Huston (right) pose for a photo believed to have been taken during filming for The Other Side of the Wind . Mrs Kodar, 73, has a 45 minute edited print which the director smuggled out of Paris in 1975, and shipped to California. She has now stored it at her home in Primosten, on the Adriatic coast in Croatia. In a phone interview with the paper, she said: 'The catalyst is the hundred-year anniversary and everybody is moving in a kind of wave. When I finally see it on the screen, then I will tell you that the film is done.' Josh Karp, who is writing a book about the film, said: 'This is like finding the Land of Oz or some lost tomb. This film is art imitating life and life imitating art. 'It's become so mythical because of what happened with all the failures to finish it and the players involved.' Mr. Bogdanovich said he will be fulfilling a promise he made to Welles in the 1970s. 'He just turned to me rather casually during lunch and said, ""I want you to promise that you will finish the picture if anything happens to me."" I was shocked and said, ""Nothing is going to happen to you."" '","The Other Side of the Wind set to be released in a film festival in May .

"On the run: Eric Frein, 31, escaped police capture again today. He is on the FBI's Most Wanted List . Scroll down for video . Fugitive gunman Eric Frein has again evaded the massive police dragnet that has now been hunting him for 16 days as he ran into woods after being spotted in the Pocono Mountains. Frein, 31, wanted for murdering one state trooper and critically injuring another, managed to flee, although MailOnline understands they have an article of clothing that he left behind. Frein, who is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, was seen just outside the perimeter of the five-square-mile search area that up to 1,000 cops are manning at any one time. The sighting led to a huge shift southwards as heavily armed cops were forced to rethink their tactics in their frustrating task of finding the expert woodsman. The drama unfolded in the Delaware State Forest around 3 p.m. on Saturday, Pat Snively, whose home abuts the Delaware State Forest told MailOnline. She said her son, Cody, 32, was first to see the action. 'My son went out to the garage and he saw a state trooper there,' said Snively, 61, a hotel housekeeper. 'He waved to him and the trooper waved him down and he shouted 'Put the kids in the house. 'He said: ""Somebody is in the back."" They saw him running back into the woods — they flushed him out and he ran.' Snively lives on the Snow Hill Falls development just south of the area where cops have concentrated their search for Frein for more than a week. On Sunday, Pennsylvania State police spokesman, Trooper Adam Reed told MailOnline: 'I can't comment on any possible sightings or evidence found yesterday. 'The Snow Hill Falls area is one we are focusing on, however.' Snow Hill . Falls was reopened to visitors late on Sunday afternoon after more than 24 . hours when only residents were allowed in.  But the police presence on the . rustic estate remained heavy. When . asked whether it was open, one trooper said: 'We'd prefer it if you didn't go . up there, but.... 'You must . realize there is an inherent danger,' he added. Survivalist: Frein is believed to have taken two guns with him on his flight through the forests - an AK-47, which he later abandoned, and a .308 rifle . Manhunt: FBI and state police, pictured this Friday, have launched a huge hunt through the mountains for Frein . Frein, 31, is the only suspect in the murder of Pennsylvania state trooper Bryon Dickson, 38, a father-of-two. He ambushed him late on September 12 at the Blooming Grove police barracks, and as he lay dying he then shot a second trooper, Alex Douglass, who had gone to Dickson's aid. Douglass is still critically injured in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Police, who have called Frein a 'coward' and 'an assassin', say he then took off in his green 2001 Jeep but failed to negotiate a turn and plowed into a swamp. They say he then managed to walk 25 miles through dense forest to an area south of the picturesque Poconos town of Canadensis where he lived with his parents and teenage sister. Saturday's was the first sighting of Frein in four days. Lt. Col. George Bivens, the man heading up the hunt, said Friday he believes Frein, a military simulation fan, is playing games with cops. 'War games if you will,' he said. Bivens said that in the past, Frein has gone close enough to the police line to be seen but far enough away that they have been unable to shoot at him. Officers are authorized to shoot to kill if they make a positive identification and Frein refuses to surrender. Extensive: Police, using dogs, cars and even choppers have been searching for Frein for weeks . 'War games': Police chiefs hunting Frein believe he is toying with them in his lengthy journey through the forest . Flying high: A helicopter takes part in the search for Eric Frein in Canadensis, Pennsylvania . Cops say Frein had been planning the attack for more than two years judging by evidence they found on a computer he used. They say he bought equipment to make a bunker — which they have not managed to find — and believe that is where he is hiding out. Police refused to confirm Saturday's sighting, but there was a dramatic increase in activity in the afternoon with hundreds of cops moving south into the area that Snively describes. Helicopters were seen hovering over the area and police dogs were sent in as the hunt for Frein gets more desperate. 'There were two or three regular helicopters and one big black one — it looked like something out of Black Hawk Down,' said Snively, referencing the 2001 movie about a U.S. military helicopter downed in Somalia. 'It was down so low I could wave at the pilot. 'Obviously the troopers had never seen anything like it, they were taking pictures of it on their cellphones.' Cordon: Police have set up numerous cordons and checkpoints to stop Frein escaping - to no avail . The choppers were flying so low wind from their rotors knocked over three trees on the nearby property of Snively's daughter and son-in-law Farley and Tom Carvalho and their two sons Connor, 14, and Cole, 8. One of them fell on electrical lines, knocking out power to the area for several hours. On the ground, Snively said troopers rushed to the scene, fanning out into the woods, but once again Frein had made a successful getaway. 'They were so quiet we didn't even know they were there,' she said. Police have said repeatedly that they believe they have Frein surrounded. But Saturday's sighting appears to show he somehow got outside the perimeter they have set up. Snively said the effect of the search has been hard on her. She had to miss several days' work last week when she could not get out of her neighborhood because of the police cordon. Her husband Larry is bedridden after falling off a roof and her 14-year-old grandson has been traumatized by the action near his house. 'He is petrified. He won't sit out on the porch with us,' she said. 'Really into guns': Frein's sister Tiffany, 18, opened up about him in an interview . Snively lives about two miles from Frein's home on Seneca Lane. Police believe the fugitive is intimately acquainted with acres of woods surrounding his house. They say they have found soiled diapers, a rare Serbian brand of cigarettes and an AK-47-type rifle that they say he abandoned probably because it was too unwieldy for him to carry as he makes his way through the dense undergrowth. They believe he still has a .308 rifle. Frein's father Michael, an ex-U.S. Army major say the two weapons are missing from his house. Frein is known to have read survivalist material that advises the wearing of diapers to allow someone to stay in place for extended periods. He is also known as a heavy smoker who is obsessed with Serbia, a country he has visited at least once. He was a member of Istocni Vuk - which translates to Eastern Wolves - a military simulation team which reenacts battles from the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s. In an interview with the Times-Tribune newspaper of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Frein's 18-year-old sister Tiffany said her brother was 'really into guns.' Police have said that Frein has a strong hatred of law enforcement, but Tiffany said that he several years ago he dated a woman who became a police officer. She told the paper: 'I want this to be all over. At the same time, I don’t want my brother to sit and rot in jail.' She said that despite the age difference she had a 'strong relationship' with her brother. 'We are a typical brother and sister. We fought and had our moments, but we bonded.'","Eric Frein, 31, is accused of killing a state trooper and injuring another .

"The sight of a Cabinet minister deep in discussion with police about the opening of the gates of Downing Street could cause panic at the highest levels of government. But far from a repeat of the Plebgate row which cost Andrew Mitchell his job, Michael Gove – dubbed the ‘politest man in politics’ – is understood to have had a perfectly pleasant conversation with the officers. The Education Secretary emerged from Number 10 to find his car had been locked out by the closure of the gates, which Mr Mitchell famously demanded be opened so he could ride his bicycle through them. Questions: Education Secretary Michael Gove was seen asking armed police why his car could not pick him up in Downing Street . Aides stressed that Mr Gove is one of the politest men in politics and did not have a cross word to say about the officers . Mr Gove had been Number 10 helping David Cameron to prepare for Prime Minister’s Questions. But Mr Cameron left before him, and any movement involving the Prime Minister leads to Downing Street being placed into a security lockdown. It meant that Mr Gove’s ministerial car could not meet him at the door to Number 10, so the Tory  minister walked down to speak to police to find out what was going on. Despite the animated expression in some of the photographs, aides insist it was an amicable conversation. ‘He is the politest man in politics. Any suggestion of cross words could not be further from the truth,' said a source. On foot: The Education Secretary had expected to find his car waiting for him after prepping David Cameron for Prime Minister's Questions . Andrew Mitchell resigned as Chief Whip for swearing in Downing Street when police would not let him ride his bike through the Downing Street gates . If only Mr Mitchell had taken the same approach. One evening in September 2011 he tried to ride his bike through the main gates, but was told by officers to dismount and use a side gate. He admits losing his temper and swearing, saying: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us’. The foul-mouthed outburst eventually cost him his Cabinet job as Chief Whip. However, he denies a claim made in an official police log that he called the officers ‘f***ing plebs’ – a dispute which has led to legal and disciplinary action being taken against some of the officers involved.","Education Secretary surprised to find his car not waiting for him .

Horrific: A man wedged his head in a metal fence and then twisted his body until his neck snapped outside a busy Ukrainian fast food restaurant . Police in the north-eastern city of Sumy are investigating the bizarre public suicide, which took place in the middle of the lunchtime rush . Witness Murat Loginov said the tragic event happened as customers had been queuing in the store on Cathedral Street  to buy pizzas and burgers. He said: 'It was pretty busy in the store, but I saw him  standing behind the guy who was serving and talking on the telephone fairly loudly about not having a job. 'I thought it was probably his mum or his girlfriend, and when he was supposed to be served he was still talking and wandered outside of the store to carry on the conversation. 'Next minute I heard someone scream and then all the customers went up to the window and started looking to see what was going on outside.' Police say the dead man, aged in his early 30s, had no identity papers on him. They are trying to identify him using his mobile phone . The man was heard complaining on the phone about not having a job in the economically-deprived city . He added: 'I went too and saw him slumped hanging over the fence with his neck bent at a completely unnatural angle. 'Apparently he just stuck his neck in the fence and then pushed until it snapped. It was really horrific.' The city is close to where ethnic tensions have caused the Ukraine to split into Russian and Ukrainian-controlled territories. The upheaval has devastated the regional economy and left many people unemployed and despondent about the future. Police say that the dead man, aged in his early 30s, had no identity papers on him.

"David Greenglass, who served 10 years in prison for his role in the most explosive atomic spying case of the Cold War and gave testimony that sent his brother-in-law and sister, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, to the electric chair in 1953, has died at 92. Greenglass — who admitted decades later that he lied on the stand about his own sister — died in New York City on July 1, according to the Rosenbergs' sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol. After his release from prison in 1960, Greenglass lived under an assumed name in Queens, hoping to be forgotten for his part in a McCarthy-era cause celebre that is still furiously debated to this day. Scroll down for video . David Greenglass, pictured in 1956, was an Army sergeant and Los Alamos bomb project employee whose testimony led to the conviction and execution of his sister and brother-in-law, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg . Ethel and Julius Rosenberg sit in a police van after being convicted of espionage in 1951 . A spokeswoman for the Meeropols, Amber Black, said the brothers were aware of their uncle's death last summer but did not seek media attention and received no inquiries at the time. The Rosenbergs were convicted in 1951 of conspiring to steal secrets about the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union and were executed at New York's Sing Sing prison, insisting to the very end that they were innocent. Greenglass, indicted as a co-conspirator, testified for the government that he had given the Rosenbergs research data obtained through his wartime job as an Army machinist at Los Alamos, New Mexico, headquarters of the top-secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. He told of seeing his older sister transcribing the information on a portable typewriter at the Rosenbergs' New York apartment in 1945. That testimony proved crucial in convicting Ethel along with her husband. In 2001, in revelations more boastful than contrite, Greenglass was quoted in the book 'The Brother' by New York Times reporter Sam Roberts as saying he had not actually seen Ethel typing and knew of it only from his wife, Ruth. For the prosecution, however, the typewriter 'was as good as a smoking gun in Ethel Rosenberg's hands,' Roberts wrote. In this 1951 file photo, Greenglass (second from left) is led into Federal Courthouse in New York for sentencing as an atom spy . Bound for separate cells, handcuffed Julius Rosenberg and his wife, Ethel, share a fervent kiss in prison van outside Federal Court after arraignment on atomic spy charges in 1950 . In the book and a CBS television interview, Greenglass shrugged off any notion of a betrayal. He said he lied to assure leniency for himself and keep his wife out of prison so she could care for their two children. 'As a spy who turned his family in ... I don't care. I sleep well,' Greenglass said in the interview, adding that 'stupidity' had kept the Rosenbergs from possibly saving themselves by admitting guilt. Greenglass said that while history might blame him for the Rosenbergs' deaths, he hadn't known that would be their fate — and that in any case, his own family came first. He also said he had been urged to lie by prosecutors, among them Roy Cohn, later a key aide to anti-communism crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Greenglass (left, in handcuffs) admitted decades later that he lied on the stand about his own sister . To some, he came to be regarded as a symbol of betrayal. In the 1989 Woody Allen movie 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,; Allen's character says of his smug and annoying brother-in-law: 'I love him like a brother — David Greenglass.' Convicted atom bomb spy David Greenglass sits in a taxi leaving New York's Federal House of Detention (1960 file photo) Greenglass was born in New York in 1922. After Army service in World War II, including the Los Alamos assignment, he and Julius Rosenberg became partners in a machine shop. The business failed; a Rosenberg attorney later claimed that led Greenglass to seek revenge on his brother-in-law. In fact, David and Ruth Greenglass, like the Rosenbergs, were active communist sympathizers, having joined the Young Communist League in 1943. Both couples believed that the Soviet Union should have the bomb if the United States did. At trial, the Greenglasses said Julius Rosenberg had recruited David Greenglass as a spy and arranged for him to feed stolen atomic research and a detonator to a go-between, Harry Gold. Gold also was later convicted. Greenglass served 10 years of a 15-year sentence for espionage. After his release, he lived with his family in anonymity as controversy over the Rosenberg case rose and ebbed over 40 years. Greenglass remained estranged for the rest of his life from the Rosenbergs' sons, who were 10 and 6 when their parents were executed. The brother later took their adoptive parents' surname, Meeropol. Author Roberts wrote that while Greenglass was willing to see his nephews, he remarked that 'their whole life has been involved with this kind of stupidity, to actually think they (the Rosenbergs) were innocent.'

"A gardener who carved a giant bush into a hand displaying a rude gesture has been ordered to remove it after being accused of committing a public order offence. Richard Jackson has displayed the offending topiary, which shows the middle-finger sign, in his garden for the last eight years. The 53-year-old has now been told by the council to alter it after a neighbour complained, but he has refused to comply. 'Public order offence': The council has ordered that this bush carved into the shape of an offensive hand gesture in Richard Jackson's garden be altered after a complaint from a neighbour . Mr Jackson, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, said: 'I was contacted by the police and they said the council had been in touch because somebody had complained to them about it. 'Apparently, one person was offended by it and the police said it was a public order offence. 'I . don't intend to change it though - I’m not a trouble maker and I don’t . want to offend anyone, but at the same time it’s been here for eight . years and I don’t see why I should have anybody telling me what to . change in my garden.' Mr Jackson says his neighbours are backing his pledge to the keep the shrubbery and have even started a ‘Save the Bush’ campaign. Green-fingered: Mr Jackson, right, trims the bush which stands proudly in his front garden in Tamworth, Staffordshire. He refuses to comply with demands by the police and council to change it . 'Rude': Mr Jackson has been ordered by the council to take down the bush as they claim that it is considered a public order offence . He added: 'If everybody else likes it and there’s . only one complaint in eight years then I don’t think it is a public . offence, as the majority aren't offended. 'I don’t think the policeman wanted to be here as much as I wanted him here, but he did ask me if I could make alterations to it - but I won’t.' Mr Jackson claims the bush had become something of a minor celebrity figure in his village and people enjoyed looking at it. It sits next to three other intricately carved pieces of foliage. He added: 'Everybody else in the village see it as just a bit of fun so they think somebody complaining is down to narrow-mindedness. There are trees either side of it so it’s not offensive at all.' Warwickshire Police say they sent a police officer to investigate although they had not received a direct complaint. They said if they did receive a formal complaint they would look into it - and deal with it proportionately. Public order offences cover a wide range of crimes including riots, violent disorder, provocation of violence and harassment.","Richard Jackson has been accused of committing a public order offence .

"A tense diplomatic standoff between Kiev and the Kremlin over a convoy of 'humanitarian vehicles' attempting to travel from Russia into Ukraine has continued today. Around 280 white trucks, which President Vladimir Putin says are carrying aid packages for the people of Luhansk, are still stationed at a military base near the Russian city of Voronezh today. Officials from the two nations exchanged colourful insults late last night over the convoy, with Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov telling Putin where he could stick his aid. The tense situation continued today amid reports that at least 12 Ukrainian activists have been shot dead after a bus was attacked in Dontesk. Scroll down for video . A convoy of around 280 white trucks which Vladimir Putin claims are carrying humanitarian aid into Ukraine were still stationed outside a military base in Russia today after Ukraine refused to accept them . Russian and Ukranian officials exchanged colorful insults late last night over the convoy, with Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov telling Putin where he could stick his aid . Russia claims the trucks contain aid packages for the people of the Luhansk region but have refused to cooperate with the Red Cross in delivering the supplies, leading to suspicions from Ukraine . Attacked: 12 Ukraine Far Right militiamen were allegedly shot dead in an attack on this bus near Donetsk . The shuttle, owned by the Ukrainian Right Sector, was allegedly ambushed by pro-Russian separatists this morning in what was billed as an anti-terror operation. Many others on board were wounded and taken hostage, the Kiev-based party claims. It comes a day after Kiev reports claimed six military officers were killed and 31 left wounded after fighting broke out in the region. The Far Right party's leader Dmytro Yarosh claims the bus held one of their combat groups travelling outside the rebel-held city of Dontesk, which is under siege by government troops. A spokesman for the radical nationalist movement Artem Skoropadskyi told Ukrainian News Agency: 'While being seated here in Kiev we don't know a great deal. 'I know that 12 our activists were killed, some more were wounded; I think details will appear throughout the day. 'There is a suspicion that the wounded will be treated very harshly and could be shot,' he said. The Right Sector volunteer battalion does not formally operate within the government armed forces but coordinates its activities with the security services and the Defense Ministry. Targeted: The party's leader claims the combat group was targeted as they advanced towards the city . The Far Right party has been the target of Russian media reports lambasting the party's 'extremist' actions . Ambush: The shuttle was attacked by pro-Russian separatists who took many hostage, reports claim . It comes as government troops advance on the rebel-held city with the support of the Ukrainian Far Right . Right Sector played a marginal if highly visible role in the street uprising that culminated in the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych in February. Its far-right affiliations have made it a target of substantial lurid reporting in Russia state media, which has sought to cast the leadership that took over from Yanukovych as an extremist cabal. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said Wednesday that 11 servicemen were killed in the previous day's fighting, but he could not immediately specify whether that figure included the Right Sector militiamen. Inside Donetsk, at least three people were killed overnight Tuesday as the government intensifies its shelling campaign. Associated Press reporters saw two bodies lying in a street Wednesday morning in the city's southwestern Petrovsky district, 11 hours after the rocket fire ended. The city government reported three deaths. Tensions: The attack comes as President Putin travels to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in March . He greeted officials on arrival at Belbek airdrome before addressing security ministers in parliament . Residents said the intermittent artillery barrage lasted around two hours. One high-rise building appeared to have been struck five times. City authorities said 10 residential buildings and the wing of a hospital were struck. Donetsk city council spokesman Maxim Rovinsky said the shelling Tuesday night was some of the heaviest the city has seen. Government troops have laid siege to Donetsk and nearby rebel holdings in their push to quash the pro-Russian insurgency. They have largely refrained from street-to-street fighting, favoring often inaccurate rocket fire.

But both Kiev - which said it would not be allowed in- and the West have expressed fears it contains military equipment, an accusation strongly denied as 'absurd' by Vladimir Putin's officials. Russia says the convoy, which left a military base near Moscow on Tuesday, is carrying about 2,000 tonnes of water, baby foods and other goods.

"Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Hacker group Anonymous have reportedly released some 911 dispatch calls around the time of his death . Hacktivist collective Anonymous had a Twitter account suspended today after they named the wrong police officer in the Michael Brown cop shooting. Police told NBC that the person who Anonymous had named online is a dispatcher and was not involved in the Ferguson shooting on Saturday. In a comment today to MailOnline, a Twitter spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy an security reasons.' Twitter rules state: 'You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission.' Anonymous was now tweeting about Ferguson under a secondary account, @TheAnonMessage2. On Wednesday, the hackers apparently released St Louis police dispatch tapes which reveal further details surrounding the cop shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The computer hackers' collective posted two hours of the 911 calls online. On the tape, time-stamped between 12.05pm-12.35pm, a person, believed to be a dispatcher can be heard referring to an incident in Ferguson, Missouri. Additional squad cars were being requested from Ferguson Police Department for crowd control. With details unclear, the dispatcher revealed she has heard 'on the news' that actually it appears to be an 'officer involved shooting'. The dispatcher added that when she called Ferguson Police Department 'they don't know a thing about it'. About ten minutes into the two-hour recording, the dispatcher allegedly said: 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?' She then added: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.' Around a minute later, the St Louis dispatcher said: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.' Seconds later, the dispatcher said: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.' A dispatcher then added: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.' The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene. Listen to 'St Louis Police Dispatch 911 tapes' here . A dispatcher then says: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.' A number of squad car numbers are then read out. The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.' Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers. One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.' The intersection referred to on the tapes is close to the spot where Brown, 18, was shot dead by a Ferguson police office on Saturday. The release of the dispatch tapes comes after Anonymous earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the killing of the teenager. Hacker collective Anonymous claimed today to have released St Louis' 911 dispatch tapes. The supposed details on the cop shooting in Ferguson are interspersed with other emergency calls. A basic transcript of elements of the call are below. Dispatcher (D): 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?' D: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.' D: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.' D: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.' D: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.' The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene.

The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.' Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers. One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.' Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead. Despite calls for calm, officers fired tear gas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area on Tuesday. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer. As police tried to put the area on lock-down, messages posted on a newly-established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appeared to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated. 'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient. 'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.' A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated. 'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.' There has been anger from the teenager's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son. At a rally in Ferguson on Tuesday, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.' Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white. The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures. In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'. 'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests. 'That's not a threat, it is a promise.' In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.' Police officers keep watch while demonstrators protest the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday night. Hackers' collective Anonymous has warned that it will punish acts of police brutality . 'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.' There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective. However an officer in the records department at Ferguson Police Department told MailOnline today that emails could not be sent because their system had been taken down. This remark could not be confirmed by the police department spokesman on Wednesday. Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon. At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request. The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk. Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.' The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back. Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car. The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '""I'll shoot you' or ""I'm going to shoot"",' Mr Johnson said. When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car. Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again. When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said. Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin at technical college on Monday.","The computer hackers' collective said they had an account suspended on Thursday .

"Three alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel are in jail after allegedly bringing their brutal tactics north of the border and using them on a South Carolina man who owed them a $200,000 drug debt. The FBI says the men kidnapped a 23-year-old from his hometown in St. Matthews, South Carolina, on July 9 and held him for nearly a week while they tried to extort up to $400,000 from his family. He was rescued mostly unharmed early Tuesday from a home in rural Roseboro, North Carolina, where he was found chained to the floor and blindfolded. Authorities say the man was a drug runner, responsible for distributing marijuana and cocaine across North and South Carolina for a Mexican drug cartel. The is the house in rural Cumberland County, North Carolina, where the drug cartel kidnapping victim was found - along with two alleged captors guarding him . Captors: The FBI says Ruben Ceja-Rangel (left) and Ruben Ceja-Rangel (right) were guarding the man when agents raided the home where he was being held early Tuesday . The cartel members got angry a 200lb shipment of marijuana that he was supposed to deliver to a drug dealer went missing. Authorities are not sure whether he stole the marijuana or was ripped off by the dealer. The FBI operation to free the hostage was a massive undertaking, that spanned North and South Carolina, Texas, Mexico and several other states. Authorities estimate that up to 500 federal agents and police officers were involved in the effort. The man is currently not in custody and does not face any charges. 'Right now he's a victim, and we will . have to look at that very carefully,' said FBI agent David Thomas, who . is in charge of the Columbia office. Juan Manuel Fuentes-Morales was arrested at a different house and found with one of the phones used to negotiate the extortion, the FBI says . The kidnapping began early July 9 when the three men, posing as police officers, pulled the man over as he was going to work in his hometown of St. Matthews, about 30 miles southeast of Columbia. His truck, still running, was left on the side of the road with its door open. Ransom demands were sent to the man's family within hours of his disappearance and continued for several days. The night he went missing, the man's fiancee began receiving calls demanding up to $400,000 for his return. Agents traced the calls to Mexico and then to North Carolina. Early Tuesday morning, agents raided a home in Roseboro, about 160 miles northeast of the man's hometown, and found him bound and in chains, being guarded by two men. According to court documents unsealed Wednesday, the man later told agents he tried to cut off his restraints with a knife, but a kidnapper discovered his attempt and hit him in the jaw and pointed a gun at him. Authorities said Juan Manuel Fuentes-Morales, Ruben Ceja-Rangel, Luis Castro Villeda appeared in federal court in Raleigh on Wednesday on charges of conspiracy to kidnap. Court documents did not say what cartel with which they are associated or indicate their nationality. Their ages and home addresses were also withheld. The three men were held without bond pending a detention hearing before a federal magistrate judge scheduled for next week. The Federal Public Defender's Office in Raleigh has been assigned to represent them. A message seeking comment was not immediately returned. Officials said the U.S. attorney's office in Columbia will be handling the prosecution and that the three defendants will likely face extradition to South Carolina. The kidnapping spanned two states - and the investigation involved several states and Mexico .","23-year-old was kidnapped outside his home by three alleged drug traffickers posing as cops .

Police are reportedly being warned of 'retaliatory action' from the gang in the aftermath of the death of Lawrence Campbell who was shot dead by police after he killed rookie officer Melvin Santiago. A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.' Scroll down for video . Officers have reportedly been warned of threats from a street gang following the death of Lawrence Campbell (left) who was shot dead by police after he killed rookie officer Melvin Santiago (right) An internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police officers and law enforcement. 'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.' It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang. A law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been issued following three shootings involving police in the city. Santiago was ambushed on Sunday as he responded to an armed robbery call at an all-night Walgreen's, authorities said. Other officers returned fire, killing Lawrence Campbell, 27. Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning. A pedestrian stands at a memorial to Lawrence Campbell, who allegedly shot and killed 23-year-old Jersey City police officer Melvin Santiago . She had told News 12 New Jersey on Sunday that she was sorry for Santiago's family but that her husband should have killed more officers if they were planning to kill him. She later apologized for the comments. 'Both families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's gone, that's it.' She said that Campbell had slipped back into an old drug habit over the past couple of weeks and 'got back with the wrong crowd.' Santiago was ambushed Sunday as he responded to an armed robbery call at an all-night Walgreen's, authorities said. Other officers returned fire, killing Lawrence Campbell . Authorities in Jersey City, already . on edge following the ambush-killing over the weekend, said an officer . shot a man Tuesday morning who authorities say had attacked him and his . partner with a sharpened fence post. Angelique Campbell, Campbell's widow, said she doesn't plan to restore a memorial to him that went up in their neighborhood but was taken down by Tuesday morning . The . man, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital and was . expected to undergo surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, the . prosecutor's office said. The police officers were also being treated. West District Commander Capt. Michael J. Kelly said yesterday's shooting was not related to officers being in a heightened state of alert in the wake of Santiago's killing. 'Our officers are always in a high-alert state. That's part of our profession. It's a dangerous profession,' he said. Kelly said condolences have been pouring in from departments across the region. He described Santiago as a quiet, serious young man who had dreamed of being a police officer since childhood and who had just started to hit his stride after less than a year on the job. According to a preliminary investigation of Tuesday's shooting, two officers with the emergency services unit saw the 25-year-old man at about 2:30am and ordered him to drop the fence post, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. Authorities said the man threw the post through a passenger-side window of the emergency services truck, hitting an officer in the head. The man then reached through the window and grabbed the officer's rifle, authorities said. The two struggled for the rifle, which discharged through the vehicle's door and struck the man, officials said. The officers exited the vehicle and ordered the man to the ground. One officer opened fire, striking the man, after authorities said the man refused to show his hands and hid a hand in his waistband.","Officers are reportedly being warned gang members may target police .

"A child who suffered from thousands of . seizures a week is finally on the road to recovery - after her parents . treated her with cannabis. Suffering from a rare genetic disorder, Charlotte Figi, 5, had as many as 300 grand mal seizures a week, used a wheelchair, went into repeated cardiac arrest and could barely speak. As a last resort, her mother began calling medical marijuana shops. Two years later, Charlotte is largely seizure-free and able to walk, talk and feed herself after taking oil infused with a special pot strain. Scroll down for video . Matt Figi hugs and tickles his once severely-ill 7-year-old daughter Charlotte, as they wander around inside a greenhouse for a special strain of medical marijuana known as Charlotte's Web, which was named after the girl early in her treatment, in a remote spot in the mountains west of Colorado Springs, Colorado . A special strain of medical marijuana known as Charlotte's Web grows inside a greenhouse, in a remote spot in the mountains west of Colorado Springs . Charlotte's Web is a strain of marijuana in which the psychoactive THC has largely been bred out, and the other cannabinoid compounds thought to be medically useful accentuated . Her recovery has inspired both a name for . the strain of marijuana she takes that is bred not to make users high — . Charlotte's Web — and an influx of families with seizure-stricken . children to Colorado from states that ban the drug. 'She can walk, talk; she ate chili in the . car,' her mother, Paige Figi, said as her dark-haired daughter strolled . through a cavernous greenhouse full of marijuana plants that will later . be broken down into their anti-seizure components and mixed with olive . oil so patients can consume them. 'So I'll fight for whoever wants . this.' Doctors warn there is no proof that Charlotte's Web is effective, or even safe. In the frenzy to find the drug, there have been reports of non-authorized suppliers offering bogus strains of Charlotte's Web. In one case, a doctor said, parents were told they could replicate the strain by cooking marijuana in butter. Their child went into heavy seizures. 'We don't have any peer-reviewed, published literature to support it,' Dr. Larry Wolk, the state health department's chief medical officer, said of Charlotte's Web. Workers cultivate small clones of a special strain of medical marijuana known as Charlotte's Web . There is increasing evidence that the pot strain is helping some children with epilepsy has led more than 100 families to relocate to Colorado for treatment since last summer, when success stories about Charlotte's Web began circulating via social media. Dravet syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They often also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet syndrome. Still, more than 100 families have relocated since Charlotte's story first began spreading last summer, according to Figi and her husband and the five brothers who grow the drug and sell it at cost through a nonprofit. The relocated families have formed a close-knit group in Colorado Springs, the law-and-order town where the dispensary selling the drug is located. They meet for lunch, support sessions and hikes. 'It's the most hope lots of us have ever had,' said Holli Brown, whose 9-year-old daughter, Sydni, began speaking in sentences and laughing since moving to Colorado from Kansas City and taking the marijuana strain. Amy Brooks-Kayal, vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, warned that a few miraculous stories may not mean anything — epileptic seizures come and go for no apparent reason — and scientists do not know what sort of damage Charlotte's Web could be doing to young brains. 'Until we have that information, as physicians, we can't follow our first creed, which is do no harm,' she said, suggesting that parents relocate so their children can get treated at one of the nation's 28 top-tier pediatric epilepsy centers rather than move to Colorado. Elizabeth Burger, 4, suffers from severe epilepsy and is receiving experimental treatment with a special strain of medical marijuana, which she takes orally as drops of oil . Aileen Burger holds up a bottle of cannabis-infused oil used as medicine for her 4-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who suffers from severe epilepsy and is receiving the experimental treatment with a special strain of medical marijuana . Aileen Burger loads an oral syringe with cannabis-infused oil used as medicine for her 4-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who suffers from severe epilepsy and is receiving the experimental treatment with a special strain of medical marijuana . However, the society urges more study of pot's possibilities. The families using Charlotte's Web, as well as the brothers who grow it, say they want the drug rigorously tested, and their efforts to ensure its purity have won them praise from skeptics like Wolk. For many, Charlotte's story was something they couldn't ignore. Charlotte is a twin, but her sister, Chase, doesn't have Dravet's syndrome, which kills kids before they reach adulthood. In early 2012, it seemed Charlotte would be added to that grim roster. Her vital signs flat-lined three times, leading her parents to begin preparing for her death. They even signed an order for doctors not to take heroic measures to save her life again should she go into cardiac arrest. Her father, Matt, a former Green Beret who took a job as a contractor working in Afghanistan, started looking online for ways to help his daughter and thought they should give pot a try. But there was a danger: Marijuana's psychoactive ingredient, THC, can trigger seizures. The drug also contains another chemical known as CBD that may have seizure-fighting properties. In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved testing a British pharmaceutical firm's marijuana-derived drug that is CBD-based and has all its THC removed. Elizabeth Burger, 4,  suffers from severe epilepsy and is receiving experimental treatment with a special strain of medical marijuana, which she takes orally as drops of oil . Few dispensaries stock CBD-heavy weed that doesn't get you high. Then Paige Figi found Joel Stanley. One of 11 siblings raised by a single mother and their grandmother in Oklahoma, Stanley and four of his brothers had found themselves in the medical marijuana business after moving to Colorado. Almost as an experiment, they bred a low-THC, high-CBD plant after hearing it could fight tumors. Stanley went to the Figis' house with reservations about giving pot to a child. 'But she had done her homework,' Stanley said of Paige Figi. 'She wasn't a pot activist or a hippy, just a conservative mom."" Now, Stanley and his brothers provide the marijuana to nearly 300 patients and have a waitlist of 2,000. The CBD is extracted by a chemist who once worked for drug giant Pfizer, mixed with olive oil so it can be ingested through the mouth or the feeding tube that many sufferers from childhood epilepsy use, then sent to a third-party lab to test its purity. Charlotte takes the medication twice a day. 'A year ago, she could only say one word,' her father said. ""Now she says complete sentences."" Increasing anecdotal evidence that the pot strain is helping some children with epilepsy has led some families desperate to help their children to relocate to Colorado for treatment . The recovery of Charlotte and other kids has inspired the Figis and others to travel the country, pushing for medical marijuana laws or statutes that would allow high-CBD, low-THC pot strains. Donald Burger recently urged a New York state legislative panel to legalize medical marijuana while his wife, Aileen, was in the family's new rental house in Colorado Springs, giving Charlotte's Web to their daughter Elizabeth, 4. The family only relocated to Colorado after neurologists told them Elizabeth's best hope — brain surgery — could only stop some of her seizures. 'It's a very big strain being away from the rest of our family,' Aileen Burger said recently while waiting for her husband to return from a trip to sell their Long Island house. 'But she doesn't have to have pieces of her brain removed.' Ray Mirazabegian, an optician in Glendale, Calif., brought Charlotte's Web to his state, where medical marijuana is legal. He convinced the Stanley brothers to give him some seeds he could use to treat his 9-year-old daughter Emily, who spent her days slumped on the couch. Now, she's running, jumping and talking. Mirazabegian is cloning the Charlotte's Web seeds and has opened the California branch of the Stanleys' foundation. Mirazabegian has begun to distribute the strain to 25 families and has a waitlist of 400. It includes, he said, families willing to move from Japan and the Philippines.","Charlotte Figi has Dravet syndrome - a rare and severe form of epilepsy .

"A Florida painter smashed a $1million vase by famous Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei to protest a Miami museum's preference for foreign work. Maximo Caminero, 51, now faces up to five years in prison after he was arrested and charged with one count of criminal mischief for the vandalism at the Perez Art Museum Miami on Sunday. According to the arrest affidavit, Caminero picked up the ancient vase painted over by Weiwei and a security guard told him to put it down. Instead, Caminero smashed the vase on the . floor and 'spontaneously told [police] that he broke the vase in . protest of local artists and that the museum only displayed . international artists.' Vandal: Florida painter Maximo Caminero (left) was arrested Sunday after destroying a piece of Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei's (right) art at a Miami museum . Valuable: Ai Weiwei's Colored Vases was created by covering urns that are thousands of years old with paint . Caminero has been working as a painter for 30 years and says he's frustrated that local artists like himself aren't showcased in Miami-area art museums. 'I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here,' Caminero told the Miami New Times. 'They have spent so many millions now on international artists. It's the same political situation over and over again. I've been here for 30 years and it's always the same.' Caminero plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon to 'answer all the questions'. The police affidavit lists the value of the vase as $1 million - but Caminero said he had no idea it was that valuable and feels sorry for damaging such an expensive relic. Frustrated: Caminero was protesting a lack of gallery space for local artists . 'If you saw the vases on display and the way they were painted there was no way one would think the artist had painted over an ancient artifact,' Caminero said. 'Instead I thought it was a common clay pot like you would find at Home Depot, frankly.' In addition to being a work of art by a famous artist, the vase is ancient and could be as much as 7,000 years old. Criminal mischief can be a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison when the property damaged is worth more than $1,000. Landmark: Weiwei's most famous piece of art is the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing . Weiwei is arguably China's most famous artist, and probably best known for having designed the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. A sculptor, designer and documentary-maker, Weiwei has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law. He was detained for 81 days in 2011 during crackdown on dissent. After his release in June 2011, Ai's design firm was slapped with a $2.4million tax bill, which he fought unsuccessfully in the Chinese courts. Dissident: Weiwei (pictured) is a multidisciplinary artist who was imprisoned in his home country for China for 81 days in 20911 for his political activism . According to museum's web site, the vase is one of more than a dozen that are part of a floor installation. Each vase is partially painted in bright colors. Behind the installation are a series of three black-and-white photos showing Ai holding a vase and then letting it drop to the ground, smashing into pieces. Caminero said he admires Weiwei and interpreted the pictures as a way to join his fellow artist in protest. Copy: Caminero says he was inspired to smash the vase after seeing this series of photos of Ai Weiwei . 'I was at PAMM and saw Ai Weiwei's photos behind the vases where he drops an ancient Chinese vase and breaks it. And I saw it as a provocation by Weiwei to join him in an act of performance protest.' Caminero had a recent showing at the JF Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and 'view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.' The Ai Weiwei: According to What? exhibit runs through March 16 at the museum. Museum officials did not immediately respond Monday to emails seeking comment.","Maximo Caminero, 51, is facing a charge of criminal mischief after the incident Sunday .

"Colorado made roughly $2 million in . marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday in . the world's first accounting of the recreational pot business. The tax total reported by the state Department of Revenue indicates . $14.02 million worth of recreational pot was sold. The state collected . roughly $2.01 million in taxes. Colorado legalized pot in 2012, but the commercial sale of marijuana . didn't begin until January. Washington state sales begin in coming . months. Big business: Chris Broussar (left) and David Marlow inside Medicine Man marijuana retail store. Colorado made roughly $2 million in marijuana taxes in January, state revenue officials reported Monday . The pot taxes come from 12.9 percent sales taxes and 15 percent . excise taxes. Voters approved the pot taxes last year. They declared . that the first $40 million of the excise tax must go to school . construction; the rest will be spent by state lawmakers. Colorado has about 160 state-licensed recreational marijuana stores, . though local licensing kept some from opening in January. Local . governments also have the ability to levy additional pot sales taxes if . they wish. Monday's tax release intensified lobbying over how Colorado should . spend its pot money. Budget-writers expect the nascent marijuana . industry to be extremely volatile for several years, making lawmakers . nervous about how to spend the windfall. Budget-writing lawmakers joke that plenty of interests have their hands out to get a piece of the pot windfall. Gov. John Hickenlooper has already sent the Legislature a detailed . $134 million proposal for spending recreational and medical marijuana . money, including new spending on anti-drug messaging to kids and more . advertising discouraging driving while high. A long line of buyers trails from a store selling marijuana in Pueblo West on January 1, 2014 . State police chiefs have asked for more money, too. ""The whole world wants to belly up to this trough,"" said Sen. Pat . Steadman, a Denver Democrat who serves on Colorado's budget-writing . Joint Budget Committee. Other countries also are watching Colorado, which has the world's . first fully regulated recreational marijuana market. The Netherlands has . legal sales of pot but does not allow growing or distribution. Uruguay's marijuana program is still under development. Colorado's pot revenue picture is further complicated by the state's . unique budget constraints, known as the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights not only requires voter approval for tax . increases, it limits budget-writers when those taxes earn more than the . figure posed to voters. Last year's pot vote guessed that the taxes . would produce $70 million a year, and it's not clear what lawmakers can . do with tax money that exceeds that figure. Several U.S. states have moved to legalize the sale of marijuana following Colorado . Colorado's JBC plans a Wednesday briefing with lawyers to lay out their options for spending pot taxes beyond $70 million. ""There probably is a tendency to want to just grab on to this revenue . from marijuana and feed my own pet projects, and I don't think it's . going to be that simple,"" said Sen. Kent Lambert, R-Colorado Springs and . another JBC member. Colorado's 2014-15 budget is under debate now and does not include any anticipated recreational marijuana taxes.","Recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado on January 1 .

"Imprisoned: Matthew Schrier, 35, was held by Syrian rebels with al-Qaeda links for seven months . An American photographer has revealed the torture he suffered at the hands of Syrian rebels who held him captive in a dark cell for seven months after accusing him of working for the C.I.A. Matthew . Schrier, 35, from Syosset, New York, was captured by Jabhat . al-Nusra, a militant group  aligned with al-Qaeda, as he traveled in . Syria last December during his first trip to  a war zone. He was taken to a compound near Aleppo and locked up with an American cellmate - who could still be in captivity - before escaping from a gap in a basement window on July 29, he said. Before he fled, Schrier said he was beaten with a metal cable across his feet and given electrical shocks. He also said the rebels cleaned out his bank accounts and emailed his family pretending to be him and assuring them he was well, he told the New York Times. The paper chose not to identify the other American captive at the request of his family. While Schrier's abduction has not been reported before, he was one of several  Westerners in rebel-held . territory since the civil war began. He said he was traveling without a . commission from a media organization and had attempted to leave Aleppo by . taxi on December 31. But the vehicle was stopped and he was taken by the rebels. Rebels: He was held by Jabhat al-Nusra; a member is seen riding a motorcycle in Deir al-Zor . Locked up: The compound was near Aleppo, where a Free Syrian Army fighter in pictured above . He said on one occasion, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, he was filmed confessing . to espionage after the captors coerced them into doing so. Schrier was also whipped with  cable on the soles of his . feet while his knees were wedged in a car tire, and he was questioned  by men speaking fluent English whom he guessed were Canadian. His captors masked . his plight by sending emails from  his account. They also demanded to know his card PINs to raid his . online bank account and buy computers and car parts with his eBay . account. He said he was moved several times and often . held alongside Syrians accused  of fighting for the government, and he was also taken  for a time by another group, Ahrar al-Sham. Alone: He was working as a freelance photographer when he was taken on December 31 . At one place, where he was held in April, a boy as young as 12 was allowed to beat prisoners and use a Taser gun to shock them. But . amid the torture and frustrations, he said that there were moments when he was not treated forcefully, including when he was seized by three men with their . faces covered with black cloths. 'They were so nonchalant,' he said. 'They didn't point a gun at me, and moved me very gently.' When . he was taken to the compound - where he thought they'd release him . after looking at his photographs - they were polite, he said. One man even warned . him the glass was hot when he was given tea, he said. Treatment also improved  when he converted to Islam and was given a Koran in . English. But amid these moments of solace came . the fear of being beaten and the boredom of pacing around a tiny cell. He . shared the cell with two roommates, but rather than bond, they fought. The rebels never gave . any indication of when he could be released, but he deduced that many . men had been held captive for much longer than he had been there. 'In your country you have a saying: You . are innocent until proven guilty,' one captor said. 'Here we have the . opposite. You are guilty until proven innocent. We do not know who you . are.' Schrier's mother . grew worried about getting no word from her son and reported him missing . to the State Department on January 31 - exactly one month after he was . taken. Held: He says that he was beaten, electrocuted and robbed by the rebels after they kidnapped him . But the captors assured friends and family he was well. One email they wrote to a friend on February 2 read: 'I'm doing good man. I have access to Internet for like 5 minutes or . so, and I will not be able to log in my e-mail for at least the next few . weeks.' Schrier eventually slipped from a gap in a . basement window early on July 29,  he said, leaving behind his bulkier . compatriot. Schrier . said he was able to  stand on his cellmate's back and unravel a wire . mesh covering a  window. Just before dawn, he wriggled out but the other . American  got stuck. 'All right, go,' he told Schrier, who walked until . he  found other rebels. They drove him to the nearby Turkish border and he was eventually helped by American officials. Escape: He eventually fled after climbing through a gap in a basement window at the end of July .

"Arsene Wenger was confronted by an angry fan, believed to be an Arsenal supporter, towards the end of his side's defeat to Southampton. The supporter was hauled away by two stewards after he managed to get right in front of Wenger and assistant manager Steve Bould and was later arrested by police. Southampton believe the man was an Arsenal fan who had bought a ticket amongst the home supporters. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger's reaction to the St. Mary's pitch invader . Arsene Wenger feels the strain as Arsenal succumbed to a two-goal defeat against Southampton . Wenger was confronted by an angry fan during the poor performance at St Mary's on New Year's Day . Wenger claimed afterwards that it was a Southampton fan and that he did not hear what was shouted at him. But the fan, wearing a purple hoody, jeans and white trainers, clearly gesticulated at Wenger and Bould as they sat in the away dugout at St Mary's. The pair waved him away before he was grabbed by the stewards and escorted down the St Mary's tunnel. Southampton were last night reviewing CCTV footage of the incident, which occurred in the final 10 minutes of the game, and are prepared to take the severest action against the supporter. 'It was a young boy,' Wenger said. 'I think he was Southampton fan. He was not aggressive at all. I don’t think he said anything.' The fan, who Wenger thought was from the Southampton end, runs to the dugout and gestures at Wenger . Stewards quickly led the man away, and Wenger showed little reaction to the confrontation . Last month a group of Arsenal supporters confronted Wenger at Stoke-on-Trent train station after they lost to there. They booed and shouted expletives at him. Arsenal fans are clearly growing frustrated with Wenger. The defeat on Thursday left them fifth, three points behind Southampton in fourth. Lukas Podolski is also set to leave the club with his transfer to Inter Milan expected to be complete this weekend. The forward was not available for the match against Southampton carrying a groin injury but negotiations between the two clubs are nearing a conclusion.

"The microscope at the University of New Haven, set at 10-times magnification, shows a marijuana leaf covered with dozens of tiny bumps of mold, and someone . The tiny bumps aren’t easily detectable with the naked eye, so someone somewhere could be smoking similarly contaminated pot and not have a clue. Heather Miller Coyle, a forensic botanist and associate professor at the university, says all sorts of nasty things not visible to the naked eye have been found in marijuana - mold, mildew, insect parts, salmonella and E. coli, to name a few. Moldy marijuana: A 10X magnification of a pot leaf shows tiny bumps of mold all over the specimen and researchers the University of New Haven say contaminants like this as well as insecticides, insects, and others are becoming increasingly common . Invisible menace: While the marijuana tested at the University of New Haven may appear normal to the naked eye, the contaminants become visible when magnified . That's why Coyle and her students earlier this year began developing a new process to detect contaminants in marijuana through DNA profiling and analysis. The aim is to be able to identify potentially harmful substances through a testing method that could make the analysis easier and quicker for labs across the country in the developing industry of marijuana quality control testing. Twenty states and Washington, DC, now allow medical marijuana with a doctor's recommendation, and Washington state and Colorado have legalized the recreational pot use. Connecticut and Washington state already require testing and other states are doing the same, spawning a testing industry. ‘If there's no certification ... it's like saying we don't check our meat for mad cow disease,’ Coyle said. ‘That's our goal as a private university, to develop the tools to address or mediate this issue.’ A number of labs around the country . are testing marijuana for contaminants using different methods, many of . which have been around for decades and used to test other plants, . including food crops, for harmful substances. The . health effects of marijuana tainted with mold, pesticides and other . contaminants aren't clear, said Mason Tvert, a Colorado-based spokesman . for the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington, D.C. The project was . founded in 1995 to lobby for the reduction or elimination of penalties . for marijuana use. ‘Although . we have not seen significant problems with tainted marijuana in the . past, we should certainly be taking steps to make sure it's not a . problem in the future,’ Tvert said. ‘We have never seen a death solely . associated with marijuana use. The same certainly can't be said of . alcohol and other drugs.’ ¿Significant toxicological threat¿: Another group in California this year found that pesticides found on marijuana could pass to the smoke, and then the smoker, when burned and inhaled . 'Mediate this issue': Heather Miller Coyle, an associate professor at the University of New Haven, shows a DNA she hopes will help her develop a new method to detect contaminants on marijuana using DNA profiling and analysis . Food and Drug Administration records from 1997-2005 show no cases in which marijuana was the primary suspected cause of death, but the drug was listed as a secondary suspected cause contributing to 279 deaths. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in July that an ‘epidemic’ of synthetic drug use has caused rising numbers of deaths and emergency room visits. One study released earlier this year, however, found that pesticide residues on cannabis are transferred to inhaled marijuana smoke, possibly posing a ‘significant toxicological threat.’ The study was done by The Werc Shop, an independent testing lab for medical cannabis in Pasadena, Calif., and published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Toxicology. New problems, new solutions: Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow medical marijuana and Washington and Connecticut are blazing the trail toward a certification process patients can lean on for assurance their marijuana is safe . Marijuana can develop mold from an inadequate drying process or poor storage conditions after harvesting. It can also become tainted with E. coli and other dangerous substances by being near farm animals. Coyle will be developing a new method . for creating DNA profiles of biological contaminants found in marijuana . including mold, viruses, fungi and bacteria. The profiles could then be . compared with DNA profiles of organisms kept in a database maintained . by the National Center for Biotechnology Information - a division of the . National Institutes of Health. ‘What . we're trying to do is put the information together in a user-friendly . format,’ Coyle said. ‘Having some better technology in place is a good . thing.’ The . university's work also will include identifying whether cannabis . material is real marijuana or a synthetic version comprising . non-marijuana herbs sprayed with THC, the compound that gets users high. Coyle . is aiming to complete the new process by next summer. What happens . after that hasn't been determined. The school could patent the process . and sell it for a fee to whoever wanted to use it, or could allow its . use for free, she said. The school also could establish its own . commercial testing lab. The . University of New Haven's work is an extension of the law . enforcement-related marijuana DNA profiling the school has done over the . past five years under a $100,000 grant from the federal Office of . National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas . program. The school created a marijuana DNA profile database that has . helped federal authorities determine where illegal pot growers and . dealers got their product.","University of New Haven researchers in Connecticut, where medical marijuana is legal, say they've found samples covered in mildew, salmonella, and insecticide .

Once again, though, the Prince chose an excellent night to watch the arrows. In a wonderfully thrilling second-round performance, Bunting underlined his class by smashing Wade 4-1. Prince Harry enjoyed a night at the darts as HRH watched the action at Alexandra Palace on Monday . Prince Harry was engrossed in the darts as Stephen Bunting knocked out No 6 seed James Dart .

'I was really nervous out there,' said Bunting, who faces Michael Smith in the Last 16. 'But I had a lot of fans watching. They were my 12th man and they got me through it. I'm not happy with a 93 average. I need to do better.' Wade, 31, said: 'Stephen is not of the same level as me but he was the better player out there. This is embarrassing.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce received a huge boost on Tuesday night when influential midfielder Alex Song announced his international retirement, meaning he will be available to play in Barclays Premier League and FA Cup matches for his club this month rather than participating in the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon. Allardyce was at Goodison Park speaking about his side's 1-1 FA Cup third-round draw against Everton when news broke that Song had told his national association that he didn't want to play for them any more. The Hammers manager had to choose his words carefully so that he or West Ham couldn't be deemed by FIFA to be putting any pressure on the player but he will be delighted at the prospect of Song returning home from Cameroon in time for their match against Swansea on Saturday.

Allardyce said: 'Alex is doing his own talking over there in terms of what they want from him and what is expected of him. 'He is going to make a decision with the manager or has made a decision with the manager on what the situation is.' Song, 27, then clarified the situation by announcing on Instagram: 'I have taken the decision to retire from International football.' The Barcelona midfielder, on loan at Upton Park, was disappointed to be originally left out of the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations even though they then tried to make a U-turn.

Alladyce felt his side were unlucky not to progress at Goodison having taken a second-half lead through James Collins but for Everton boss Roberto Martinez, the injury-time equaliser by Romelu Lukaku was a potentially season-defining moment after a run of four defeats. 'It was real satisfaction rather than relief,' he said. 'We could have felt sorry for ourselves but we kept the right attitude and frame of mind. It could create a snowball reaction because a result like this gives you confidence. It felt like a win and the finish and contribution from Rom (Lukaku) was very good.' Allardyce has seen Lukaku score in four successive games against his team. 'It is always seems to be him,' grimaced the Hammers boss after the Belgian had turned in Bryan Oviedo's cross.

"If Manchester United needed to make a decision on the future of Radamel Falcao now, there's every chance they'd allow his season-long loan deal to run its course before sending him back to Monaco. Fortunately for the Colombian, he has until April to turn around his disappointing form - and the unwanted statistics that accompany it - to secure a permanent deal at Old Trafford. The numbers don't lie. Falcao has been less productive in front of goal during his four months with the Red Devils than at any of the European clubs he has played for previously. Radamel Falcao (left) tussles with Yeovil's Ben Nugent during Manchester United's third-round FA Cup win . The Colombian striker skips over a sliding challenge from Yeovil's Stephen Arthurworrey at Huish Park . Falcao failed to find the back of the net as United ran out 2-0 winners over their League One opponents . His opportunities under Louis van Gaal have been limited due to injury - 12 appearances in the Premier League and one in the FA Cup so far - but he has done little to warrant United splashing out £43million to sign him at the end of the season. As part of a £150m spending spree last summer, the Old Trafford club paid Monaco a £6m fee to take the 28-year-old on a temporary basis, while also agreeing to pay him wages of £285,000-a-week. So far he has failed to justify that outlay, having scored just three goals for his new club. Even with creative geniuses Angel di Maria and Juan Mata behind him, it just hasn't quite happened for Falcao. There is an argument that he is still finding his feet - and a regular place in Van Gaal's starting XI - after a calf injury kept him out for a month between between late October and November. Falcao  pokes home Manchester United's equalising goal against Stoke City on New Year's Day . The striker, who is on loan from Monaco, celebrates after scoring for United at the Britannia Stadium . But his stats for the Red Devils tell a different story. Falcao appears to be a player in terminal decline after bursting into public consciousness with prolific spells at Porto and Atletico Madrid. In his final season with the Portuguese side, the Colombian scored an average of 0.7 goals per game and had 1.7 shots on target every match. At United he has managed just 0.3 goals and 0.9 shots on target every 90 minutes. Comparing Falcao's numbers while at Porto - a team who were dominating their division - with those he has produced in a United side who are still in transition under Van Gaal may be slightly unfair, but the trend continues throughout his time in Spain and France. Falcao scored 0.71 goals per game in the 2011-12 season at Atletico and 0.82 the following campaign. He also recorded 1.76 shots on target in his first season and 1.56 in his second - all of which are superior to his numbers in the red of United. Falcao, pictured celebrating a goal against Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals, was prolific for Porto . The striker earned a £50million move to French side Monaco after impressing for Atletico Madrid in Spain . Falcao celebrates scoring against Nantes shortly before joining Manchester United on a season-long loan . A £50million move to big-spenders Monaco followed and he continued his good form in France before suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage while on international duty last January. Falcao netted 0.53 goals per game for the Ligue 1 side and hit the target 1.41 times every 90 minutes - his worse stats for three seasons but still better than what he has achieved in Manchester. To his credit he does have three assists for United, the same amount he managed in his first season in Spain and more than in any other campaign in Europe.. But strikers will always be judged on goals and, quite simply, Falcao isn't scoring enough of them or having enough attempts to convince us that he will find the sort of form which once made him one of the hottest properties in world football. If he continues in the same vein, don't expect to see him at Old Trafford next season.","Radamel Falcao has scored three goals during his loan at Man United .

"If QPR count as giants, then surely the entry barrier is too low. That is not to skimp on the praise due to Sheffield United or indeed the manager with the famous bloodline and delightful habit of embarrassing bigger clubs. But the shock of this result needs to be considered against one truth — Queens Park Rangers are capable of staggering incompetence and yesterday was an example of a struggling club close to their worst. It was their misfortune to run into a side that has now won 14 of 17 cup fixtures under Nigel Clough. A side that in the past year has beaten five Barclays Premier League clubs, contested the semi-finals of the FA Cup and will play Tottenham Hotspur this month in the last four of the Capital One Cup. Marc McNulty fires league One side Sheffield United ahead at Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup . Sheffield United players run to celebrate the opener from McNulty after 36 minutes in West London .

Scorers: McNulty 36, Campbell-Ryce 49, 90 . Booked: McNulty, Reed . Referee: Mark Clattenburg 6.5 . MOTM: Jamal Campbell-Ryce . Not bad for a team from League One who in the past month have had less publicised engagements with Walsall, Fleetwood and Port Vale and taken only two points. One can only wonder how the QPR of this tie would do in such fixtures. It was all neatly summed up when, at 1-0 down to a Marc McNulty goal, Rangers goalkeeper Alex McCarthy came to collect a corner but flapped and missed. Jamal Campbell-Ryce watched the farce unfold and stuck out a leg to make it 2-0. The forward then had the good fortune to be close by when Leroy Fer’s dreadful late header to McCarthy landed in his path and 2-0 became 3-0. Harry Redknapp, the QPR manager, was furious, even if the cynical view is probably correct —this early exit will probably help in the bigger picture of Premier League survival. But that is a mission that will require a happy squad and results like this, against a club 34 league places beneath them, ought to sting. Redknapp said: ‘I thought they were sharper than us all over the pitch. They played well and you have to give them credit — they are a good cup side. They obviously raise their game in the cup.

QPR have yet to record even a point on the road in the Premier League and are in desperate need of reinforcements.

I haven’t got a clue where we will find any at the moment.’ Redknapp made seven changes to the side that drew with Swansea City on New Year’s Day, but it was Fer — one of the four survivors – who had the best chance to set this game on a different path. Receiving the ball with his back to goal after seven minutes, he hit a hard shot on the turn that forced a good save from Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard. That was pretty much as good as it got.

United settled and started to create chances, although QPR’s propensity for self-destruction provided generous help. The breakthrough came on 36 minutes. Louis Reed played a through-ball, defender Rio Ferdinand was unsure whether to step out or attack the ball and in the event did neither, meaning McNulty had a path to goal. McCarthy got a touch on the ball but not enough for it to matter. The QPR goalkeeper was far more culpable for United’s second goal, four minutes after the break. Reed hit a corner to the near post, McCarthy came, missed and watched as the ball clattered off Jordon Mutch and towards his own goal-line. Campbell-Ryce poked it over.

When Fer made a hash of a header back to his keeper in stoppage time, it was Campbell-Ryce who pounced again. Sheffield United coach Chris Morgan, speaking in place of Clough, said: ‘I don’t think people will take us lightly, because of the results we’ve had. In the last calendar year we’ve beaten five Premier League clubs. ‘We had the great run in the FA Cup last season and we were confident of getting a result but we had to work hard. ‘It’s great that we have good runs in the cup — great for the club, great for the revenue and for the fans — but we know that first and foremost our target is promotion. ‘It sends a message to us that we can come and compete with top teams.’ A label that served as the only consolation for QPR all day.

"Our galaxy is suddenly looking far more crowded. NASA has confirmed a record setting bonanza of 715 newly discovered planets outside our solar system. Scientists using the planet-hunting Kepler telescope have nearly doubled the number of planets discovered in the galaxy to around 1,700. Scroll down for video . Nasa says many of the new finds are multiple-transiting planet systems, which are stars with more than one planet. The planets eclipse or transit their host star from the vantage point of the observer. This angle is called edge-on. Nasa says its new technique for spotting planets can be likened to the behavior we know of lions and lionesses. In our imaginary savannah, the lions are the Kepler stars and the lionesses are the planet candidates. The lionesses would sometimes be observed grouped together whereas lions tend to roam on their own. If you see two lions it could be a lion and a lioness or it could be two lions. But if more than two large felines are gathered, then it is very likely to be a lion and his pride. Thus, through multiplicity the lioness can be reliably identified in much the same way multiple planet candidates can be found around the same star. Astronomers used a new confirmation technique to come up with the largest batch of planets announced at one time. Twenty years ago, astronomers had not found any planets circling stars other than our sun. All the new planets are in systems like ours where multiple planets circle a star. Four of those new planets are in habitable zones where it is not too hot or not cold. NASA's Kepler mission announced Wednesday the discovery of 715 new planets. These newly-verified worlds orbit 305 stars, revealing multiple-planet systems much like our own solar system. Nearly 95 percent of these planets are smaller than Neptune, which is almost four times the size of Earth. This discovery marks a significant increase in the number of known small-sized planets more akin to Earth than previously identified exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system. 'The Kepler team continues to amaze and excite us with their planet hunting results,' said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'That these new planets and solar systems look somewhat like our own, portends a great future when we have the James Webb Space Telescope in space to characterize the new worlds.' Since the discovery of the first planets outside our solar system roughly two decades ago, verification has been a laborious planet-by-planet process. A record breaking day for Kepler: The histogram shows the number of planet discoveries by year for roughly the past two decades of the exoplanet search. The blue bar shows previous planet discoveries, the red bar shows previous Kepler planet discoveries, the gold bar displays the 715 new planets. Now, scientists have a statistical technique that can be applied to many planets at once when they are found in systems that harbor more than one planet around the same star. To verify this bounty of planets, a research team co-led by Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., analyzed stars with more than one potential planet, all of which were detected in the first two years of Kepler's observations -- May 2009 to March 2011. The Kepler space telescope orbits around the Sun, 40 million miles from Earth. It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . Kepler's mission was supposed to be over by now, but last year NASA agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about £13 million ($20 million) a year. According to Nasa scientists, there is, what's dubbed, a 'Goldilocks Zone' in space where the temperature is not too hot, or too cold, for water to exist in liquid form. Any planets found in this zone could have life on them. If Kepler is retired, Nasa scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered. The research team used a technique called verification by multiplicity, which relies in part on the logic of probability. Kepler observes 150,000 stars, and has found a few thousand of those to have planet candidates. If the candidates were randomly distributed among Kepler's stars, only a handful would have more than one planet candidate. However, Kepler observed hundreds of stars that have multiple planet candidates. Through a careful study of this sample, these 715 new planets were verified. 'Four years ago, Kepler began a string of announcements of first hundreds, then thousands, of planet candidates --but they were only candidate worlds,"" said Lissauer. The blue bars on the histogram represents all the exoplanets known, by size, before today's Kepler Planet Bonanza announcement on Feb. 26, 2014. The gold bars on the histogram represent Kepler's newly-verified planets. 'We've now developed a process to verify multiple planet candidates in bulk to deliver planets wholesale, and have used it to unveil a veritable bonanza of new worlds.' These multiple-planet systems are fertile grounds for studying individual planets and the configuration of planetary neighborhoods. This provides clues to planet formation. Four of these new planets are less than 2.5 times the size of Earth and orbit in their sun's habitable zone, defined as the range of distance from a star where the surface temperature of an orbiting planet may be suitable for life-giving liquid water. One of these new habitable zone planets, called Kepler-296f, orbits a star half the size and 5 percent as bright as our sun. Kepler-296f is twice the size of Earth, but scientists do not know whether the planet is a gaseous world, with a thick hydrogen-helium envelope, or it is a water world surrounded by a deep ocean. Sizes of Verified Planets found by Kepler - boosted significantly by today's announcement . 'From this study we learn planets in these multi-systems are small and their orbits are flat and circular -- resembling pancakes -- not your classical view of an atom,' said Jason Rowe, research scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., and co-leader of the research. 'The more we explore the more we find familiar traces of ourselves amongst the stars that remind us of home.' This latest discovery brings the confirmed count of planets outside our solar system to nearly 1,700. Launched in March 2009, Kepler is the first NASA mission to find potentially habitable Earth-size planets. Discoveries include more than 3,600 planet candidates, of which 961 have been verified as bona-fide worlds.","Newly developed technique to spot planets led to massive haul .

Lotte, from Colchester, Essex, said: 'As part of my course I've been around these size-zero women at London Fashion Week on numerous occasions and I've never thought they really represent real women.

'I think they are much more representative of the general British public . 'I was just so happy to win it with so much amazing competition. In my eyes this is what women really look like. 'Being part of a world in which size six is the norm has never affected my self confidence but in turn has encouraged me to discover a sense of style that enhances my natural hour glass shape.'

"Fat people live longer than their skinny counterparts because their brains get more nourishment under stress, a German obesity expert has claimed. Achim Peters says that overweight people are more suited to the stresses of modern life because their metabolisms are better able deal with it. Professor Peters, of Luebeck University in northern Germany and author of the book 'Overweight Myths - Why Fat People Live Longer,' has been studying the . brain and weight related issues for three decades. He says it is a . myth that fat people die sooner than their thin counterparts. Fat people live longer because their brains get more nourishment under stress, a leading obesity expert has claimed . He said: 'People react to a stressful, uncertain circumstances in two different ways. Some eat and become fat. 'The others refuse food and become thin. The ones who become really ill are the thin ones. The fat ones are, in comparison with the thin ones, much healthier.' He added that being thin in itself not a problem, but those who lose weight when under stress are in danger. 'We have to worry much more about the thin stressed people than about the fat stressed people. Yet they are not regarded widely as having a problem precisely because they are thin. But in fact they die earliest.' Professor Peters told a German newspaper that he and his colleagues studied 'toxic stress' brought on by factors outside of an individual's control, such as poverty, bullying, abuse, divorce, low self-esteem and trouble in the workplace. People who don't eat when they're stressed are in danger, as their brain gets nutrients from the muscles and organs, rather than food . Individuals who pile on the pounds under such circumstance 'get the nutrients they need to feed their brains. 'When the brain doesn't get them from external sources, it gets them from within - from muscles and even worse, from the organs. Thin stressed people are the least healthy people.' He went on: 'So far, only the relationship between being overweight and mortality has been studied. The cause of the mortality is not in just being overweight, it lies in stress.' He said that 'social imbalances' that lead to stress cannot be fixed with diets - rather, it is the duty of government to worry about taking away the stresses of modern day life to get people to shed some weight. 'Society needs to change, not fat people,' he added. Asked if there is an ideal weight, he said; 'No. Modern research speaks only of weight diversity. Every human being has the survival strategy ideal for his or her life. 'The ostracism of fatties puts pressure on fat people psychologically.' Indeed, he said, there are studies that prove that fat people earn less, are fired faster and are more often bullied. He added that the idea that slimness equals beauty 'contributes greatly to the misfortunes of the overweight'. 'If you look carefully there were or are stressful circumstances for fat people who do not seem stressed. But these people have found a solution. 'They have become stress tolerant and in return, get a balanced mood. But they have to pay a price for this - eating.' There are anti-stress therapies which he said were effective in the longer term and could alter eating behaviour and lead to weight loss.","People who don't eat when stressed are in danger, warns Achim Peters .
Thin people's brains take nutrients from their muscles and organs .
This is riskier for their health than being fat, and affects life expectancy .
But fat people don't have such risks as they are better nourished ."
"Madcap Matt Cotterell has created a unique memento of 2014 - by taking a selfie every day of the year and posting the pictures on Facebook. The 27-year-old set himself the challenge to take a daily snap of himself to document his activities over the last 12 months. The 365 snaps include selfies with relatives and professional footballers and DJs, at family weddings and on holiday. Scroll down for video . Madcap wannabe DJ Matt Cotterell took a picture of himself every day for a year so he can remember 2014 . Matt took pictures of himself at various events, here he is celebrating Halloween in Wolverhampton . Matt, who works at Western Power Distribution, posted his first picture on 1 January last year of him posing at his favourite football club Wolverhampton Wanderers FC. He managed to secure his sporting heroes, former Wolves legend, Steve Bull and the team's striker Nouha Dicko, for two photos. Matt's selection of snaps also acts as a reminder of the fads and crazes that defined 2014, and included the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which took the web by storm throughout August. Matt, of Codsall, Staffs, said: 'The idea started off as a joke suggestion really but my friends seemed to like it and encouraged me to take it up. 'I'm not a keen photographer by any means and at first I was struggling for ideas but by the end of January I couldn't give up, I was in too deep. Matt started 2014 in the Wolves ticket office with sporting heroes Steve Bull, left, and Nouha Dicko, right . Matt took a screen shot from a video so he could have a photograph of himself doing the ice bucket challenge . Matt went on to say: 'I started the year working at the Wolves ticket office, and got to meet some footballing idols, like Steve Bull and Nouha Dicko. 'I have had a lot of fun, I guess I picked quite a good year in general. Looking back, I seem to have spent the majority of my time with friends, family and work colleagues. 'The Ice Bucket Challenge one was very nearly a disaster. My dad shot the video and he isn't very good with phones, so he stopped filming pretty much as soon as the water went over my head. 'I had to screen shot it and take a photo from that, which luckily worked out pretty well.' Matt said that this picture - taken with his Great Aunty Betty Austin and his Great Aunty Pat -  was especially poignant as his Aunty Betty died not long after the picture was taken . Matt was best man for his friends Ben and Amy in August and captured the moment for his picture diary . As an aspiring DJ, Matt took the opportunity to take part in a meet-and-greet with North London electro duo Gorgon City during his weekend at Reading. He said: 'While I was at Reading festival, there was a signing tent where acts will sit for a couple of hours and meet their fans. 'I am a big fan of Gorgon City and was planning to go and see them later on in the day. As I walked past the tent, I noticed they were doing a signing but it looked pretty much finished, everyone was packing up. When Matt was at Reading festival he managed to persuade DJs Gorgon City to be part of his challenge (left), he also shared pictures with his friends at EDM festival in Manchester . On his last day at work for Wolves FC Matt persuaded his colleagues to take part in his picture . 'I had a word with security and told them about my selfie challenge and they let me through. The guys seemed to think it was a good idea too and were more than happy to pose. My friend said that had to be my photo for that day. 'Then at Birmingham's BPM, which is a three day electronic music event, I got a photo with Chewbacca from Star Wars.' Matt said that his family would regularly feature in his pictures: 'There are loads of pictures with family as well. We are a very close family. We like to get together a lot anyway and take photographs so they were happy to join in. The wannabe DJ always had his camera on hand to document his goings on, taking this snap on a night out . Some of Matt's friends were less keen to be part of his mission to take a seflie every day for a year . Matt had a great time at Reading festival taking snaps with his friends along the way . 'One especially significant photograph shows me with my great aunt Betty Austin, who had cancer and died a few months after the picture was taken.' Other snaps include Matt taking part in the Wolverhampton half marathon dressed as the 118 man as well as pictures of himself with girlfriend Kelly, 27, on holiday. Matt said: 'It's strange that we got together last December so she has only known me as this guy who takes photographs every day. Matt's Christmas photo, not long before his challenge of taking pictures every day for a year was over . But Kelly's not too keen on Matt doing the challenge again this year: 'I think she wants me to pick a different New Year's Resolution for 2015, sometimes hunting for photographs can become quite tiresome for others. 'But there's also one from when I was best man for my mate Ben Harvey. We have known each other all our lives, our parents are best friends and so are we. 'That was a special day and it's nice to have got a photo with the happy couple. At times I have felt a little strange constantly taking photographs. 'I must have looked crazy to others, but I have a priceless memento of this year that I will never lose.' Matt's girlfriend hopes he doesn't repeat the challenge in 2015 as she is tired of his taking photos of himself . Matt took 365 selfies in 2014, all pictured above, to capture his year of meeting heroes and seeing family .","Aspiring DJ Matt Cotterell, from Staffordshire, wanted to remember his year .

"Jordan Henderson feels criticism of Steven Gerrard this season is totally unjustified. The Reds captain's perceived waning influence has been highlighted as a factor in Liverpool's shaky start to the campaign. But Brendan Rodgers' side were much more dynamic in Saturday's Merseyside derby and Gerrard's free-kick in the 65th minute appeared to have sealed victory until Phil Jagielka struck a stunning late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw. Steven Gerrard scored a superb free kick on Saturday to put Liverpool 1-0 ahead against Everton . The Liverpool captain has scored nine times against Everton, the most of any player in Merseyside derbies . Gerrard has now scored nine goals in Premier League Merseyside derbies, more than any other player. Henderson said of his 34-year-old midfield partner: 'Stevie's still one of the best players in the Premier League. 'There's no doubting his quality. A lot of teams have been putting someone to man-mark him, which shows just how good he is. 'I don't think he deserves any criticism. He's been the best player this league's probably seen in a long time and still is.' Gerrard answered his critics with an excellent performance against Everton after a slow start to the season . Jordan Henderson says his captain is still a top player who doesn't deserve his criticism . Liverpool had 24 shots compared to Everton's 11 and Tim Howard, who got a hand to Gerrard's free-kick but could not keep it out, was certainly the busier goalkeeper. Rodgers' team have struggled to recapture the form that almost brought them the league title last season, but the consolation from Saturday's result was certainly an improved display. Henderson said: 'It's disappointing. The performance was very good, back to the level we expect. 'The intensity was good all over the pitch, we worked hard, we were more fluent going forward and we made chances as well. And also we defended really well throughout the game so that was pleasing. Phil Jagielka's wonder-strike was enough to earn Everton a point at Anfield late in the game . Henderson said he was disappointed with the result after conceding late but the performance was better . 'We did quite a lot of work during the week on defending and I think we showed just how well we can defend, so that needs to be the case from now on. 'Then with the goal, there's not much you can do about that, it's a great strike.' Rodgers had hoped for a similar spark to last season, when a 4-0 victory over Everton at Anfield began a run of 37 points from a possible 39. Instead, their bubble was well and truly burst by Jagielka's wonder strike and it was the Everton fans left singing in the stands at the end. Gerrard, Henderson and Mario Balotelli stand over a free kick as Liverpool put pressure on their neighbours . But Henderson is confident there will be no hangover with a busy fixture list ahead, starting with a Champions League trip to Basle on Wednesday. 'I don't think it'll affect us because the performance level was very good,' said the England man. 'We've got to take the positives out of that. The goal was in the top corner so we've just got to keep going and keep playing like that. If we keep putting in performances like that we'll win more than we don't.'","Steven Gerrard scored brilliant free kick in 1-1 draw against Everton .

"Four-time Winter Olympian and five-time British champion alpine skier Chemmy Alcott, who retired from competition at the end of the 2014 season, on rivalling Serena Williams, starring as a Bond girl, Muhammad Ali and how finishing 19th at Sochi was like winning gold. WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? Muhammad Ali. He was incredible. Skiing is quite an aggressive sport and so is boxing, but he carried himself so well. Chemmy Alcott, the recently retired British alpine skier, says her sporting hero is Muhammad Ali . WHAT WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WEREN'T A SPORTSWOMAN? It’s always been sport for me but if I wasn’t a skier I would have been a tennis player. I was a power hitter and could have done well in the era of Serena Williams! WHICH OTHER SPORTS STAR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE? I’d love to have something like the mobot so I’d have to say Mo Farah. Chemmy likes the idea of having her own signature, such as Mo Farah's famous 'Mobot' CAREER HIGHLIGHT? Finishing 19th in Sochi six months after I broke my leg. I had 1,048 minutes of surgery so to finish within two seconds of the leader was like gold for me. ... AND THE WORST MOMENT? The crashes. You can’t ski in ignorance of injury but they do define you. I fought back and became a positive person. Alcott on her way to a remarkable 19th place in the women's alpine skiing super combined at Sochi 2014 . IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN, WHAT ONE POSSESSION WOULD YOU SAVE? Probably photographs of my mum. She passed away in 2006 but is still a really important person in my life. I wear her engagement ring to carry her with me. So those and maybe my coffee machine! FAVOURITE KARAOKE SONG? Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.

Lady Gaga — Edge of Glory, Vampire Weekend — Diane Young, and anything by Fleetwood Mac. Edge of Glory was my pre-race pump-up song and in my retirement race - when I was supposed to ski slowly - it was played on the PA. I won by two seconds. They should have stuck to classical. LAST FILM YOU SAW? Rising from the Ashes — a great documentary about the Rwanda cycling team. LAST BOOK YOU READ? I’m reading Unbroken. It’s about Louis Zamperini, a survivor from a prisoner of war camp in the Second World War. When it comes to music, Alcott is a big Lady gaga, Vampire Weekend and Fleetwood Mac fan . WHICH THREE PEOPLE WOULD YOU INVITE TO A DINNER PARTY AND WHY? Madonna - she would have the most incredible stories. Part of me would say someone like Hitler! But then I think Muhammad Ali to talk and offer security. YOUR FAVOURITE HOLIDAY DESTINATION? Maui in terms of indulgence but I’ve got an amazing relationship with Africa. That’s where my honeymoon was and where I’ve done a lot of charity work. IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE, WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY YOU? Blake Lively. I’ve got a massive girl-crush on her. But I’d do the stunts. I’ve always felt I could do a job as a Bond girl if they ever need one for a skiing scene… . Chemmy's girl crush is Blake Lively, and the skier thinks she'd be handy on a Bond film set . TELL US A SECRET... I’m the world-record holder for beer-mat flipping.

"Bishop Larry Trotter posted a picture of himself in the bath with his granddaughter earlier in the week and ignited an internet storm. The high-profile senior pastor of the huge, 8,000-member Sweet Holy Spirit Church in Chicago began to publicly defend himself on Thursday after receiving hundreds of abusive messages on social media. Trotter says the photograph was completely innocent, but the bishop was described online as a 'child molester' and a 'pedophile.' 'The vulgarities have been terrible,' the pastor said. Storm in a bathtub? This picture posted by Bishop Larry Trotter of him in the bath with his granddaughter has created huge debate online . Trotter called into the John Hannah Morning Show to explain himself and explain how the previous days had been dark ones for his family. The bishop told the radio show hosts that his granddaughter and her parents had been visiting, and he was taking a bubble bath, wearing swimming trunks, when the four-year-old wandered into the bathroom. When the girl, also wearing trunks, asked if she should get into the bath, her mother placed her in the tub for a few minutes and snapped the family photo. Trotter explains that another family member with access to his Instagram account posted the picture online, where the scandal immediately flared. It is not the first time that Bishop Trotter has experienced controversy involving his granddaughter. In September 2012 he staged her mock crucifixion to protest a teachers' strike . Showman: Bishop Trotter is the senior pastor of the 8,000-member Sweet Holy Spirit Church in Chicago . While Trotter deleted the picture within minutes, it was too late. The photo appeared on the Obnoxious TV blog and as reported by Madame Noire it quickly proliferated online. Next it featured on the Facebook account of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad Teachings Testimonial Page on Wednesday night, with the caption: . 'NO SIR BISHOP TROTTER!!! No man should ever ever ever take a bath with a female in his family or friends. That’s only for a man and his WIFE! This is totally inappropriate behavior!' Facebook and Twitter users went further, describing the photo as 'disgusting', 'sick', and suggesting that child protection authorities should get involved. Trotter claimed to have 1,200 hate mails on his personal Facebook page. Bishop Trotter describes his granddaughter as the 'first lady' of his life. The Sweet Holy Spirit Church is a megachurch in the south side of Chicago . The bishop added: 'I’m not ashamed of what I did. I am ashamed and hurt that it is going . out all over the world and people have called me everything from a child . molester to a pedophile to a nasty old man and how I should get out of . the ministry.' It is not the first time that Trotter has had controversy involving his granddaughter, who he describes as ‘first lady’ of his life on the official church page. In September 2012 he staged a mock execution - men just held up the girl in front of a cross - to protest against a Chicago teachers' strike. 'My grandbaby's on this cross to symbolize the 400,000 children who now for the seventh day are being crucified of their education and their safety,' he told ABC.","Bishop Larry Trotter of Chicago claims the picture was innocent and both he and and his grandaughter were wearing trunks .

"Mike Ashley holds the key to the future of convicted rapist Ched Evans. Oldham Athletic stalled on signing the 26-year-old former Sheffield United striker on Monday, stating that they would ‘continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the PFA’ before making a decision. But two club sponsors immediately threatened to withdraw their backing if the League One club signed Evans — who was due to report for training on Monday but in the end did not show — and on Monday night Newcastle United owner Ashley came under pressure to withdraw Sports Direct’s sponsorship as well.

"A top skier has said she is determined to return to the slopes despite breaking her back while training in Sweden. Charlie Guest, 20, suffered fractured vertebrae after landing on a boulder while skiing in a remote area of the country. She spent eight hours on a spinal board and endured a 155-mile  journey to hospital in Ostersund following the accident. British No 1 slalom skier Charlie Guest is back in Scotland after she suffered fractured vertebrae . Name: Charlie (Charlotte) Guest . Born: 30/12/1993 . Hometown: Perth, Scotland . Teams: Delancey British Senior Alpine Squad . Squad: Scottish Ski Club . British ranking:  No 1 slalom skier,  No 2 giant slalom skier . Honours . Australia New Zealand Cup Giant Slalom Champion 2013 . British Giant Slalom Champion . British Slalom Champion . British U21 Giant Slalom Champion . British U21 Slalom Champion . The British number one slalom skier has been told she will not suffer any long-term damage, though she will have to take some time out to recover. On the day of the accident she was wearing her back protector for only around the third time in giant slalom training, and she believes it saved her from worse injury. Guest, from Perth, said: 'The accident happened in quite a remote area, so after eight hours strapped down to a board and a 250km ambulance journey I was pretty terrified about how serious my injuries were. 'Whilst I'm devastated that I am going to have to take time out to recover, I realise how extremely lucky I am that my injuries are not more severe. I owe my coach Stefan the biggest thank-you of my life for his insistence that I wear my back protector.' She added: 'This was a massive reality check for me. I won't be skiing again without wearing the correct safety gear. As someone who spends so much time dedicating myself to my sport, it is easy to forget just how dangerous skiing can be. 'It is so important to think about safety and I want to help other people avoid career-ending and even life-threatening injuries. It could so easily have been a different story for me.' Guest broke her back while training in a remote part of Sweden after landing on a boulder . She now wants to see back protection become a compulsory safety requirement for all skiers across the disciplines. The accident happened on November 22 while Guest was training in Funasdalen in Sweden. Her coach, Stefan Moser, said she was lucky to have escaped worse injury. He said: 'Safety should come first, ahead of anything else, and I began to insist that Charlie wore her back protector, no excuses. I saw Charlie's accident and I know she is very fortunate to be looking at a full recovery, even if it keeps her out of action for some time.' Guest (pictured in March) says her injury would have been worse if she wasn't wearing her back protector . The skier has now returned to Scotland, where she is under the care of the medical team at the Scottish Institute of Sport. The institute's medical team also cared for Charline Joiner, the Scottish cyclist who fractured her spine after coming off her bike in a collision with another bicycle on a Team Scotland training camp in Spain at the start of this year. She recovered in time to compete in the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. The cyclist has been giving the skier moral support as they met at a cycling event in the autumn. The 20-year-old (here in January) now wants back protectors to become compulsory for all skiers . Writing on her blog, Guest said she is now fully focused on her recovery. She said: 'I don't want to rule out world champs in February; I'm just going to take everything day by day and see when I'm fit to be back on snow. 'Pre-season training will not be wasted. Physically I will come back much stronger and mentally the next few months will be tough, but I am confident that I will at least be skiing and training properly by the end of the season.'

"Geoffrey Boycott says he is saddened that a conviction for assaulting a former lover has apparently stopped him being awarded a knighthood, claiming he is being blocked by 'something he didn't do'. The Yorkshire and England cricketer criticised the French courts amid reports that his conviction against a former lover had scuppered plans for him to be honoured. A group of cricket-loving MPs, including Theresa May, had led a campaign to see the batsman named Sir Geoffrey. Geoffrey Boycott (left and right) has said he is 'saddened' that an attempt for him to be honoured was blocked because of his conviction for assaulting a former lover . The 74-year-old batsman took to Twitter to say he had been blocked from having a knighthood 'for something I didn't do' But the bid to honour was vetoed by the Cabinet Office officials, reportedly due to Boycott's conviction, which dates back 18 years. Speaking out for the first time about the knighthood furore, Boycott said it was 'sad' that he could be blocked for 'something he didn't do' but said he has 'to live with this injustice'. Writing to his 57,000 Twitter followers, he said: 'I'm delighted that so many people thought I deserved a knighthood and sad that it can be blocked for something I didn't do.' He added: 'Unfortunately, 18 yrs ago I was wrongly accused. 'I tried to clear my name in France but under Napoleonic law once accused you are guilty until you can definitively prove your innocence. This is the opposite of English Law. I have to live with this injustice - and I do. 'I am frank and forthright but don't have and never will have a history of violence. Thank you again to all my supporters.' The batsman had received a three-month suspended sentence and £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for pinning down Margaret Moore and punching her in the face. Boycott denies ever hitting Ms Moore, insisting that she slipped and injured herself after flying into a rage when he told her he was 'not the marrying kind'. The former England captain fought a costly two-year-legal battle to clear his name after his initial conviction at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes. He and Ms Moore had spent the evening together drinking champagne with the American singer, Billy Joel, before she said he hit her 20 times during an argument. He denied striking her and said bruising around her face was caused when she slipped after flying into a rage when he refused to marry her. Boycott received a three-month suspended sentence and £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for pinning down his then lover, Margaret Moore (pictured at the time, left, and in 2000, right) and punching her in the face . However he was unable to convince judges at either a retrial or appeal, where the conviction was upheld. Speaking to The Telegraph about the controversy, Boycott said he had moved on with his life and tried to put the incident behind him. He said: 'I have accepted that there was an injustice you have to deal with it.' He added: 'It's nice that lots of people have written in. It's nice that people admire you and say nice things about you.' According to Whitehall guidelines, a criminal record should not in itself prevent a person from being considered for a knighthood as long as there is no 'outstanding issue'. Boycott played 108 tests and became the first England cricketer to pass 8,000 Test runs. He is still number six on England's all-time run scoring list.","An attempt to knight Geoffrey Boycott was blocked by the Cabinet Office .

"He’s not been in charge 24 hours, but West Brom are already showing the standard Tony Pulis qualities. Fight, grit and stubbornness; it was like Pulis had been in charge for years as the Baggies produced a gutsy display to hold West Ham to a draw at Upton Park. Perhaps, under sacked Alan Irvine, this West Brom side would have crumbled after going behind after 10 minutes to Diafra Sakho’s header. No such chance with Pulis at the helm, Saido Berahino securing a valuable point for the Midlands club. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats .

Diafra Sakho heads the ball past goalkeeper Ben Foster to open the scoring for West Ham . Sakho celebrates his and West Ham's first goal of 2015 with defender Carl Jenkinson as the home side took the lead against West Brom . West Ham's Diafra Sakho has scored eight goals from just 14 shots on target in the Premier League since arriving last summer. The Welshman's appointment as Irvine’s successor was confirmed on Thursday morning, and Pulis, who has been out of football since leaving Crystal Palace in August, wasted no time getting into the swing of things. Pulis, together with his assistant David Kemp, were in situ in the stands well before kick-off as they started the process of trying to safeguard their record of never being relegated. Keith Downing and Rob Kelly were on the touchline for the Baggies, but there was no escaping Pulis’ presence. ‘I’m sure it (Pulis’ presence) had an effect,’ admitted coach Kelly. ‘He introduced himself to the players this morning, he popped in at half time and after the game as well. ‘But he let us get on with it today. Anyone who knows Alan [Irvine] knows how organised he is, so we had an outline and we did most of the work on the team with Alan.

He [Kemp] came down to the touchline with one or two suggestions. ‘But the players are very professional so all the preparation was done beforehand.’ Pulis, however, was powerless as he watched his new side fall behind as Sakho glanced home Aaron Cresswell’s cross from the left after an excellent Hammers move. Ben Foster prevented the visitors from falling further behind just two minutes later, saving Stewart Downing’s fierce effort after the former Liverpool forward tormented Gareth McAuley. It was just the start Sam Allardyce was after following two consecutive losses, albeit against Chelsea and Arsenal. However, WBA could have drawn level in the 23rd minute with what would have been one of the goals of the season. Chris Baird directed a brilliant first-time volley from Youssouf Mulumbu’s cross straight towards the top left-hand corner, only for Adrian to deny him with an excellent one-handed stop. Pulis was taking note, gesturing to Kemp and chairman Jeremy Peace at regular intervals; though he wouldn’t have been impressed by Stephane Sessegnon’s finishing in the 26th minute as the forward fired wide from a good position. However, he would have been heartened with the way the Baggies fought back into the encounter after their dismal start. West Ham hadn’t pushed on following their early opener. Indeed, Allardyce admitted after the game that his side were feeling the impact of playing three games in six days.

Keith Downing took charge of West Brom as caretaker manager for the final time as Pulis prepares to take over . Chris Brunt slides in to tackle Morgan Amalfitano and wins the ball in one of the midfield exchanges at Upton Park . Allardyce cut an anxious figure in his technical area, he had reason to be, too. In true Pulis style, West Brom were making life terribly uncomfortable for the hosts. And in the 42nd minute, they were level after a rapid counter attack which saw Sessegnon travel half the length of the pitch before locating the unmarked Berahino, who cooly fired past Adrian. The move had Pulis applauding; tangible evidence that in Berahino, he has a bona-fide Premier League goalscorer. And the striker picked up where he left off as the second-half got underway, his deflected shot from the edge of the box well saved by Adrian. Mulumbu, two minutes later, had the visiting fans celebrating, rippling the net with a fierce angled shot – but the effort actually hit the side-netting.

Sakho grimaces as he leaves the field injured to be replaced by fellow striker Enner Valencia . After their quickfire start, West Ham were on the ropes. Allardyce threw on Matt Jarvis in place of Morgan Amalfitano in an attempt to re-invigorate his team and the move nearly paid instant dividends as the impressive Cresswell hit the post with a superbly executed 25-yard free-kick. With 30 minutes left to play, Kemp made his way down to the dug-out to pass on instructions to Downing and Kelly. If there was any doubt, the Pulis era was already in full swing. Had Sakho, who moments later limped off with a back problem that leaves his place in Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations squad in doubt, converted Downing’s low cross then Pulis would have needed to devise a new game plan. But the Baggies were defending doggedly, Joleon Lescott and McAuley pillars of strength in the heart of their back four. In the end, West Brom held on, pretty comfortably, for a point as the home side were booed off. It seems Pulis is already working his magic.","New West Brom manager Tony Pulis watched from the stands as his side earned a point at Upton Park .

"An Australian man says he was devastated after learning he had been involved in a high-profile Bigfoot hoax. Last December, Andrew Clacy left his home in Victoria to join Rick Dyer, a used car salesman from Texas who calls himself the ‘master tracker of Bigfoot.’ Mr Dyer claimed online to have killed the legendary Sasquatch and packaged him in a glass case. He provided a number of images as documentation. Lying through his teeth: Rick Dyer, posing with the phony Bigfoot he used for the hoax . Andrew Clacy left his home in Victoria last December to join Rick Dyer, in a national tour of America with purported body of Bigfoot . Mr Clacy flew over to join him in an American tour to promote the purported body of Bigfoot. Dyer had previously been involved in a popular Bigfoot hoax. In 2008, he was exposed by an internet Halloween costumer retailer, who found that one of his costumes had been used by Dyer. However, Mr Clacy still decided that was an authentic body, Nine MSN reported. He says that throughout the three months he and Mr Dyer toured together, he had no idea that the body was phony, even after physically touching the foot of the animal. Clacy said 'It felt slimy and like a dog's paw.’ Clacy says throughout the three months he and Rick Dyer toured together, he had no idea the body was phony, even after physically touching the body of the animal . Clacy ended up spending $12,000 touring with Dyer, as well as arriving back home to a torrent of ridicule from his family and friends . In March, Mr Clacy learned that he had Dyer was behind a second Bigfoot hoax when he posted on his Facebook page: . ‘Coming clean about everything is necessary for a new start! From this moment on I will speak the truth! No more lies, tall tales or wild goose chases to mess with the haters!’ Clacy returned back home, but not without a serious toll: he was $12,000 out of pocket. He had also damaged his business, and says he was subject to a torrent of ridicule. ‘I was broken-hearted when I came back to Australia,’ he told Nine MSN. ‘I felt like a fool.’ To make matters worse, Dyer has embarked upon an online campaign to boycott Clacy, alleging on his blog that Clacy knew about the hoax throughout the period he was promoting it. He has even allegedly been hacking the Victorian’s emails. ‘He is actively trying to destroy me,’ Clacy said. The Bigfoot model was eventually sold to the Mr Happy Wellness Centre in Colorado, a medical marijuana dispensary . Clacy says the Texan even  brought a phony doctor in to confirm to the them that the beast was real. 'There were much smarter guys than me who believed it,' he said. ‘I thought I was part of something huge, I thought I was going to be part of history.’ The model was eventually sold to the Mr Happy Wellness Centre in Colorado, a medical marijuana dispensary.","Andrew Clacy travelled America for three months with a phony Bigfoot body .

"He has been patiently waiting in the shadows for the right time to strike. Now Agent 47 has finally made his move, but does he still deliver that killer blow? Thankfully, within 15 minutes of soaking up the sights from the Glacier 2 engine, it’s clear 47 has lost none of his edge. Licence to kill: Missions are varied and are teeming with interesting and life-like characters. Hitman: Blood Money had a slightly cartoon-feel to it, with samey looking characters populating worlds that lacked soul and character. But realism is paramount in Absolution, with levels inhabited with NPCs that have personality. You’ll hear people talking about arguments with their wives, playing guitars in their hotel rooms, confiding in friends – this is a living, breathing world like no other. This serves as a wonderful contrast to the death and destruction – and, disturbingly, reinforces a sense that you are taking a ‘life’ rather than eliminating a lifeless ‘bot’. Environments are sumptuous, too, the highly-saturated colour palette giving the entire game a Hollywood-style sheen. Whether it's walking along the sun-kissed . balcony of a beach-side villa, or exploring the dank, underground sewers below . a nightclub, Absolution brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb. The narrative is so strong (involving a kidnap), that there’s a reason for the variation, too – and loses that fragmented feel of its predecessor. Indeed, this is perhaps the closest thing to playing Liam Neeson’s Taken that you’re going to get. Gameplay has also had a significant overhaul. You are still awarded points for creative kills but there is now much more choice. Want to snipe a target? You can. Fancy getting up close and stabbing him in the back? That's possible, too - although it's very difficult. You are encouraged to steal other people’s clothes, but NPCs can often see through them. Agent 47 can use his ‘instinct’ to camouflage himself slightly, but characters are very hard to trick. Initially, early levels may consist primarily of trial and error, as you get used to the rather ruthless AI. They also react realistically to your actions. In Blood Money, you were quickly shot in the head for going into an ‘out of bounds’ kitchen. Here, you’ll be warned off and given time to walk away. Only if you stand there staring blankly at someone will they get angry and try to arrest you. This is made all the more convincing by the voice acting. Although not uncommon to hear characters mutter the same phrases, as much care and attention has been put into the NPCs’ dialogue as it has the game’s key players. Waiting in the shadows: Agent 47 can use disguises but sometimes stealth is the best approach . Agent 47 can also use his instinct to see through walls and identify targets. It generally works well, and is put to brilliant use in the point shooting mechanic. Here, when multiple takedowns are needed, you can mark and execute targets – similar to in Splinter Cell: Conviction. Indeed, there’s no sense of a mission being a failure if you’re forced to use your weapons – unlike its predecessor which often resulted in a bloodbath if a hit didn’t go to plan. Often killing the character who has sussed you out results in enemy suspicion and alertness to decrease or vanish. Longevity is helped through each missions’ carefully-intertwined sub-challenges. These range from collecting new weapons, to acquiring all of the disguises. They work well, although you never feel punished if you finish a level without all the loot available.The campaign mode will take most players around 10 hours, but thankfully Contracts mode offers plenty more thrills. Here, you play through the levels and assign three targets. You then compete online to get the highest score by assassinating them in whichever way you wish. Take a risk or play it safe? Sometimes the most obvious path is the most dangerous. Thankfully, levels offer lots of different ways to slip past potential threats unnoticed. But given the strength of Absolution’s campaign, it’s hard for this not to feel slightly tacked on. Still, this is the deadliest Hitman yet that's destined to be a hit.

"At first glance, it would be easy to see Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 as 'just' another yearly update of the long-running and oft controversial series. Indeed, developers Treyarch could have played it safe, delivering predictable thrills, gameplay and multiplayer that still would have guaranteed sales in the millions. Lifelike: Harper is one of the game's main characters. What is immediately noticeable are the improvements in the NPC's animation and facial expressions. This is backed up with some brilliant voice acting. But interestingly, this is not the case. And while aesthetically the game is similar to the others, Treyarch have tried to bring something new to series - and have largely succeeded. You play (for the most part) David Mason, son of Alex Mason - the main character in the original. The year's 2025 and you're sent on a mission to take down a terrorist called Raul Menendez - a psychotic, megalomaniac who you empathise  with one minute, and detest the next. Although a slightly routine plot, it's how BLOP2 tells the tale that makes it stand out. There's an element of choice never before seen in the series. Whether you kill someone or succeed in a mission may come back to haunt you later on. This is particularly evident in the Strike Force missions. The outcome directly impacts the game's narrative - the often terrible consequences serving as an emotive reminder of your actions. The futuristic setting also lends itself to drone warfare, which adds another element to predominately run-and-gun gameplay. Although some missions force you to use robotic warriors, certain sections (for example, guiding the enormous CLAW) give you much more tactical freedom. You can use it for cover, or to draw fire while you flank enemies. Although behind the smoke and mirrors level design is still rather linear, the element of consequence makes the story feel less like a bunch of loosely connected set pieces and more of a virtual Hollywood-style blockbuster. This is helped by enhancements in the graphics. Although using the same engine as the original, lighting has been improved, and draw distances seem more impressive - adequately dealing with the more ambitious scale. Taking the plunge: As expected, there are plenty of set pieces on show in Black Ops 2. One level in the desert on horseback, in particular, acts as showcase in just how far the aging graphics engine has come. But it is the facial animations and character models that steal the show.  All the characters boast perfect lip synching and wonderfully-emotive expressions. It's mesmeric watching Harper, David Mason's battle-hardened teammate - suddenly be hit by panic and fear - his eyes widening and body tensing up. Then seeing his cheekiness and swagger when chatting up a woman later in the game. These are real people - which makes the often graphic deaths that much more shocking when you witness them. It's helped along by some brilliant voice acting. Although purists may notice Ed Harris no longer voices Jason Hudson, Tony Todd (better known as the Candyman) lends his likeness and voice to Commander Briggs, playing the role with menace and conviction. But for many, COD's campaign plays second fiddle to its multiplayer, and thankfully, Treyarch have delivered - particularly with their Pick 10 system. This gives you ten points to modify weapons and items of your choice. This allows you to create specifically tuned loadouts that are tailored to your playing style. Run and gun: Most of the game is first person, but there are well-rendered cut-scenes which help break up the action, while also reinforcing the narrative. Further welcome modifications such as the revised Score Streak replacing the Kill Streak mean that it's now much easier to rack up high scores. Changes to Prestiging means that there are no stat resets when you reach a certain level - so you keep your weapon experience and challenge progress. The usual multiplayer modes make a welcome return (albeit with a few tweaks), while Combat Training (against bots) provides to perfect place to hone your skills and rise up the XP ranks. Then there is Zombies mode, which is the deepest one yet. It's incredibly fun taking on waves of the undead, made even more so by a number of gameplay tweaks. There are lots of items that can be found and turned into defensive weapons, while the Tranzit world gives you much more freedom and scale to make your last stand as fun as possible. There's no denying that some critics will write this off as yet another Call Of Duty 'mod'. But do so at your peril, because Treyarch have done to Call Of Duty, what Daniel Craig did for James Bond. Defied the norm, evolved the series and kick-started a lagging franchise.

"Plans: A development being built in Rottingdean, East Sussex, part-funded by Brighton and Hove city council, will feature toilets that do not use the words 'men' or 'ladies' but have symbols denoting that they can be used by anybody (stock image) A council is planning to replace traditional male and female lavatories with 'gender neutral' toilets in an attempt to facilitate the transgender community. The facilities will avoid using the words 'men' and 'ladies', instead using symbols that indicate they can be used by people of any sex. But the plans to change signage on the toilets, which will be used by both adults and children, have attracted criticism and been described as 'political correctness'. Brighton and Hove city council chiefs said that they wished to 'promote the term gender neutral' in emails discussing the proposed block on Rottingdean seafront, East Sussex. The £140,000 development, which will include a cafe and four lavatories, is being joint-funded by a Rottingdean Parish Council  and the city council. Conservative councillor Lynda Hyde expressed her dissatisfaction at the development, with construction set to commence this week, describing the plans as 'unnecessary bureaucracy'. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'Local residents, particularly women with children, would much prefer to use separate facilities as apart from anything else, it is safer. 'If the male/female symbols, rather than any text, are to be used on the toilet then this avoids any confusion, so why is the council muddying the waters by insisting they are called gender neutral, which will mean nothing to most people?' The councillor from the Rottingdean ward claimed that the city council were planning to gradually phase out single-sex lavatories. Promote: Brighton and Hove city council chiefs said that they wished to 'promote the term gender neutral' in emails discussing the proposed . Brighton has a gay, lesbian and transgender population of approximately 40,000. The development, due to take 12 weeks to complete, follows the creation of a city council working group 'into making it fairer for trans people to live, work and . socialise in Brighton and Hove'. Mrs Hyde added: 'The parish council, which is part funding this toilet, actually wanted to have separate male and female toilets, which would also have been my preference and, I suspect, the preference of most local residents. 'However, the city council in their wisdom, decided otherwise.' Parish councillor Frank Considine said a sign will shortly be placed on the fencing around the site describing the toilets as 'gender neutral'. An image of a male, female and child will also be fitted to the doors when complete. A city council spokesman said: 'When producing signs for public toilets in the city we use standard images rather than words. This is particularly beneficial to the many tourists from overseas visiting our city.'","A new development will include toilets that can be used by any adult or child .

"Realism has always been paramount in the Football Manager series, and while the inclusion of a user-friendly 'Classic Mode' may not be to everybody's tastes, the full-fat game has more depth than ever. Although tempting to write this off as simple update, the glossy menus and cleaner user interface suggest otherwise. Attention to detail: There are so many variables to manage, however, this is helped through clear and user-friendly menus . Sports Interactive have streamlined the entire experience, making it more efficient than ever before. Notably, the pop-up menus are a useful addition, and even the loading screens are packed with information regarding fixtures and news. There has also been an overhaul in the match-day experience. Menus are cleaner, while information about players' conditions and their ratings appears between highlights. Your assistant manager provides you with match intel through a specific data feed, and in-game commands are now much more simple to execute. Interestingly, the press conference system now allows you to respond to questions in a variety of tones - however, there are only a limited amount of generic answers, so this may start to grate after a while. The training mode has had a complete overhaul, too, offering an extra layer of depth. All of these aspects can be assigned to an assistant manager, though, if they become too overwhelming. Thankfully, if management of countless variables is too daunting a task, then Classic Mode offers nearly all of the same thrills at a fraction of the stress. Wonder strike: The match-day interface has been overhauled - making it more efficient and easier to tell what is going on . Indeed, the mode captures a sense of fun and accessibility not often associated with the series. There's still enough depth there to please hardcore fans, but with a much-needed hint of arcade, pick-up-and-play gameplay. Another great addition is the Challenge Mode, which is essentially crisis management. Here you are given a team facing a dilemma - for example, on the brink of relegation - and have to steer them through to calmer waters. Looks can be deceiving: Football Manager 2013 is not just a simple update . Again, Sports Interactive have made the experience as user-friendly as possible. Success or failure is determined within hours, not weeks, making it a perfect companion on a rainy afternoon. To stop things getting stale, there are plenty of  achievements to be unlocked and an in-game store. Online multiplayer is playable . through Steam, where you can challenge other FM fans from around the . world, with leaderboards showing how you compare. There is no doubt that this is the most detailed and well-rounded football management game ever created.

"Inter Milan believe they have struck a deal to sign Lukas Podolski on a six-month loan deal but not until after Arsenal have played at Southampton on New Year's Day. Representatives of the Italian club were in London on Saturday for meetings and are confident they will soon have Podolski in their ranks, who was an unused substitute in the Gunners' 2-1 win at West Ham on Sunday. Inter will pay a loan fee of £1.5million. The unsettled Germany forward has one year on his Arsenal contract at the end of this season and may not return if his loan is successful. Inter Milan believe they have struck a deal to sign Arsenal forward Lukas Podolski on a six-month loan deal . Wenger was not willing to allow Podolski out before the game against Saints because Olivier Giroud is banned after his red card on Boxing Day. 'At the moment, nobody goes out,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We have Mesut Ozil back at the beginning of January, so we have a lot of competition up front.' Podolski has flourished in Europe this season but has been given limited opportunities in the Premier League. The 29-year-old has scored three goals and all have come in the Champions League.

"The children who escaped last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut are returning to classes on Thursday at a refurbished school renamed after their old one, school officials said Wednesday. Newtown Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson announced that the students' new school, the former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, has been renamed after a decision was taken by staff from the previous Sandy Hook school. ‘That's who they are. They're the Sandy Hook family,’ Robinson said after a news conference at a park in Monroe a few miles from the school, which opens for classes on Thursday morning. An open house was held for parents and students on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Keeping them close: A woman hugs a young boy, who had attended Sandy Hook school, before he boards a bus to a newly set-up school in neighboring Monroe, Connecticut . School superintendent Janet Robinson said the decision to re-name the new school as Sandy Hook Elementary School was taken by the teachers from the previous school . Robinson added that renaming the Chalk Hill school will allow staff and students to keep ‘their identity and a comfort level.’ The school where the shootings occurred remains closed and guarded by police. Newtown officials haven't decided yet on the building's future. It's been nearly three weeks since the Dec. 14 massacre, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 students and six educators. Lanza also killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before the school shootings, which ended when Lanza fatally shot himself as police arrived. Police haven't released any details about a motive. One parent took the opportunity during Wednesday's open house to thank a teacher for helping protect his son. Vinny Alvarez said the teacher, Courtney Martin, locked her classroom door and kept the children in a corner until it was safe to leave the building. Numerous police officers on Wednesday guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about seven miles from the old school. Asked about the level of security at the new school, Monroe police Lt. Keith White said, ‘I think right now it has to be the safest school in America.’ Anxious: Parents wave goodbye as they see their children on to the bus for school for the first time since the shooting on December 14 in Newtown . Sensitive: Sandy Hook students were invited to attend Chalk Hill middle school Wednesday ahead of classes on Thursday. The building has been re-purposed for them as they return to school for the first time since last month's shooting . Robinson said Chalk Hill School has been transformed into a ‘cheerful’ place for the surviving students to resume normal school routines. She said mental health counselors continue to be available for anyone who needs them. ‘They're so excited to see the teachers,’ Robinson said about the open house attendees. Several signs welcoming the Sandy Hook students to their new school were posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly residential neighborhood. One said ‘Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,’ while a similar sign added ‘You are in our prayers.’ Teams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the Chalk Hill school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets. The students' desks, backpacks and other belongings that were left behind following the shooting were taken to the new school to make them feel at home. Support: A sign is seen along the route to the Chalk Hill School where the Sandy Hook Elementary School children will attend classes in Monroe, Connecticut . Early days: Teachers and volunteers have worked to remodel the middle school to appear as close as possible to Sandy Hook in order to reassure the children . Counselors say it's important for children to get back to a normal routine and for teachers and parents to offer sensitive reassurances. When classes start, Robinson said teachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children. ‘We want to get back to teaching and learning,’ she said. ‘We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.’ Acting Sandy Hook principal Donna Page wrote on the school's website: 'Be assured that the towns of Monroe and Newtown are working night and day to ensure the facility is safe, secure and fully operational for our return.' Watchful: Children are seen on a school bus driving toward Chalk Hill School as they return to class for the first time since the December 14 tragedy . In remembrance: A green and white ribbon, the colors of Sandy Hook Elementary School, is seen attached to a bus on the first day that students returned . Friendly town: A sign is seen along the route to the Chalk Hill School in Monroe which has been turned over to Sandy Hook survivors . Familiarity: Classes will resume at a re-purposed school in the neighboring town of Monroe, where measures have been put in place to make as many things as possible familiar to the children . Memorial: Local volunteers installed 26 stars on the roof of the Newtown fire house on January 1st in honor of the victims of the shooting . Ms Page took on the role after the elementary school's principal Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the attack. She added that parents who wanted to come with their children to the first day of classes on Thursday would be made welcome. Sandy Hook school in Newtown remains closed and has no date scheduled for reopening. It remains a crime scene following the December massacre. Father David Connors said his eight-year-old triplets have suffered nightmares, jumped at noises and clung to their parents since they escaped the shooting. Mr Connors said: 'I'm nervous about it. It's unchartered waters for us. I know it's going to be difficult.' Connors, a 40-year-old engineer, said he felt reassured after recently visiting the new setup. He said his children were excited to see their backpacks and coats, and that the family was greeted by a police officer at the door and grief counselors in the hallways. Never forget: One of the many memorials for the 20 Sandy Hook students killed in Newtown on December 14 along with six teaching staff . Devastation: Sandy Hook Elementary School, home . to 700 students, was attacked by a crazed gunman on Friday, December 14, . and changed the course of history . Teachers will try to make it as normal a school day as possible for the children, schools Superintendent Robinson said. 'We want to get back to teaching and learning,' she said. 'We will obviously take time out from the academics for any conversations that need to take place, and there will be a lot of support there. All in all, we want the kids to reconnect with their friends and classroom teachers, and I think that's going to be the healthiest thing.' Teachers are returning as well, and . some have already been working on their classrooms. At some point, all . those will be honored, but officials are still working out how and when . to do so, Robinson said. 'Everyone was part and parcel of getting as many kids out of there safely as they could,' she said. 'Almost everybody did something to . save kids. One art teacher locked her kids in the kiln room, and I got a . message from her on my cellphone saying she wouldn't come out until she . saw a police badge.' After the evacuation, teachers . grouped their children at a nearby fire station, Robinson said. One sang . songs, while others read to the students, she said. Julian Ford, a clinical psychologist . at the University of Connecticut who helped counsel families in the days . immediately following the shooting, recommended addressing it as . questions come up but otherwise focusing on regular school work. Back to class: Superintendent Janet Robinson said they will try to make everything as normal as possible for the children and welcome them to the new school . Fear: Parents are apprehensive about their children returning to school following the Sandy Hook shooting . Victims: . Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, . Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner. Second row: (L-R) Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, . Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski. Third row: (L-R) Daniel . Barden, Jack Pinto, Catherine Hubbard, Dylan Hockley, Benjamin Wheeler. Fourth row: (L-R) Grace McDonnell, James Mattioli, Avielle Richman, . Rachel Davino, Anne Marie Murphy. Fifth row: (L-R) Lauren Rousseau, Mary . Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza . 'Kids just spontaneously make associations and will start talking about something that reminds them of someone, or that reminds them of some of the scary parts of the experience,' Ford said. 'They don't need a lot of words; they need a few selective words that are thoughtful and sensitive, like, ''We're going to be OK,'' and ''We really miss this person, but we'll always be able to think about her or him in ways that are really nice.''' It will be important for parents and teachers to listen and be observant, Ford said. 'Each of the boys and girls are going to have different reactions to different aspects of the environment, different little things that will be reminders to them,' he said. Parents might have a harder time with fear than children, Ford said. Before the shooting, a babysitter would take Mr Connors' children to the bus stop. But Connors said he'll probably take the third-graders to the bus the first few days. 'I think that they need to get back into a normal routine as quickly as possible,' Connors said. 'If you're hovering over them at all times, it almost intensifies the fear for them.'","Chalk Hill middle school in Monroe altered for elementary school pupils .

"Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud claims Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo has asked to join the French club on loan. The 21-year old is behind a plethora of attacking options in the pecking order at Arsenal with Alexis Sanchez, Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck and Theo Walcott all vying for a starting spot. Arsene Wenger is happy for the former Auxerre striker to head out on loan but would much prefer Sanogo, who has only featured six times for the Gunners this season and has struggled with injuries, to play for a Premier League outfit. Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo celebrating his goal in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund . 'Sanogo wants to come to Bordeaux on loan', Triaud told Gold FM. 'And he has informed Arsene Wenger [about his wish]. We've asked for Arsenal to give us a response on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.' Bordeaux manager Willy Sagnol, the former France and Bayern Munich right back, wants to bring Sanogo to the Stade Chaban-Delmas with his side sixth in Ligue 1 and ten points off Marseille at the top.

"A celebrity wannabe dubbed the 'vainest man in Britain' claims to have been punched in a nightclub for being a Joey Essex imitator. Sam Barton, 22, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, suffered a bruised lip after allegedly being attacked in a nightclub in Romford, Greater London, on Friday night. During the altercation, the suspect allegedly shouted: 'You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you' in reference to Mr Barton's £5,000 nose job which he got done for free on the NHS earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Sam Barton suffered a bruised lip (left) after allegedly being punched in a nightclub in Romford, Greater London, for 'being a Joey Essex wannabe'. Mr Barton had a nose job to look like the The Only Way Is Essex star  (right) Mr Barton, who is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton, said: 'It started in the queue when four lads and girls started verbally assaulting me. 'They said there was only one thing worse than Joey Essex and that was a Joey Essex wannabe. 'They pursued me for over an hour in the club before another lad joined them and said: ""You will need a new nose job before I have finished with you"" - and then he hit me. 'Fortunately, he didn't hit my nose. He just left me with a cut lip but it was still a very nasty shock.' Mr Barton, who claims to be best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee, has been clubbing in Essex on a number of occasions with friends who live in the county. However, the celebrity lifestyle seeker said it was the first time he had been out since revealing he was set to apply for free Botox and another nose job on the NHS. Earlier this year, Mr Barton had a nose job on the NHS and last month he told doctors he needed more free cosmetic treatment to help combat symptoms of sweating caused by anxiety due to his 'new-found fame' The celebrity lifestyle seeker referred to the incident to his 23,000 followers on Twitter over the weekend . He added: 'I will visit my friend again in Essex but I won't be going out again at night there. 'I have never had any problem on nights out in Birmingham. Everyone is really friendly to me here. 'I realise I am controversial and perhaps rub some people up the wrong way but there is no need to verbally or physically assault me.' Last month, Mr Barton told doctors he needed further free cosmetic treatment to combat symptoms of sweating caused by anxiety due to his 'new-found fame'. He is expected to meet with medics for a consultation later this month. If he is given the go-ahead from the NHS, the Botox treatment will cost around £3,000 per year for six injections every two months. Mr Barton had the £5,000 nose job on the NHS (left) to look like 'the perfect man' and now hopes to receive more free cosmetic surgery, including a £3,000-a-year Botox treatment plan, to 'help combat a sweat problem' Mr Barton, who works part-time in a bar and a supermarket, previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man'. But he has amassed hefty credit card debts of £25,000 in just four years in search of the glamorous Joey Essex look he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. He has also had a nose job and a procedure to straighten his nose, together worth £10,400, although one was done for free on the NHS.","Sam Barton suffered bruised lip after allegedly being punched in nightclub .

"A man who paid to have his pregnant mistress beaten up to get rid of their unborn child has today been jailed for seven years. Jamie Smith, 23, conspired with two friends to get rid of the child  after learning Jessica Santos, 18, had become pregnant during their affair. Smith planned to lure Miss Santos to a park in Peterborough, Cambs, on the pretence of discussing the pregnancy, where Steven Blades and a third man would attack her with a knife and crowbar. Scroll down for video . Jamie Smith, 23 (left), has been jailed for seven years after plotting to have his mistress attacked so she would lose their unborn child. Steven Blades, 23 (right), was jailed for a year after agreeing to carry out the assault . Smith got Jessica Santos, 18 (left), pregnant while both of them were in other relationships. After she refused to abort the baby, he began planning the assault . Smith, who was in a relationship with another girl, wanted to make the attack look like a robbery and also intended to be injured. The knife would be used to threaten him and Miss Santos before both were assaulted. But his twisted plot was foiled when the third man refused to get involved and alerted police. Smith and Blades were arrested on February 21, the day the attack was set to take place. Smith, of Peterborough, was charged with conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm but tried to claim others had hatched the plan. Miss Santos met Smith on Facebook where the pair started talking, before the first met shortly before Christmas last year . However he was unanimously convicted after a five-day trial at Peterborough Crown Court and jailed for seven years. Blades, of Peterborough, admitted the same charge and was jailed for 12 months. Both men were both given a 10 year restraining order against the victim by Judge Sean Enright. Outside court Miss Santos - who is now eight months pregnant - said: 'Part of me wants to believe that he was put up to this by someone, but deep down I know that is not the case. 'It hurts a lot to know that someone I felt so close to could plan this behind my back, yet so still be so nice to my face. It's just evil. 'Nobody has the right to say whether someone, especially a baby, should live or die. 'If Jamie did not want to get involved with the baby he didn't have to and he knew this. This makes what he arranged even harder to understand. 'When my child is old enough I will tell them about this and let them decide if they want a relationship with Jamie - until then I will do everything I need to do to protect my child.' After the case Detective Constable Vicky Speirs said: 'This was a sickening and extremely dangerous plot to cause a young woman to lose her unborn child. 'It is incomprehensible how anyone would want to carry out such a hurtful and violent act. 'It was an incredibly selfish act by Smith who gave no thought as to what effect his actions could potentially have on the victim. 'Given the level of violence they were prepared to use, we could quite easily have been dealing with a murder. 'Thankfully, one of those men recruited by Smith to carry out his dirty work saw sense and contacted the police so we could intervene and prevent such a serious incident taking place.' Smith met victim Jessica Santos at an after school disco in 2011 and they began messaging on Facebook. The pair met up shortly before Christmas 2013 despite both being in relationships with other people. Smith, 23, got the 18 year-old pregnant on the only occasion they had sex, in his black Toyota. Smith then demanded his lover terminate their unborn child but after she refused he vowed to have no contact with his baby. Smith then planned the attack - even visiting the secluded park in Peterborough, Cambs.,where the assault was due to take place. Smith planned to coax Miss Santos to a remote park in Peterborough, Cambs, where they would both be attacked with a crowbar and a knife so as not to arouse suspicion . He paid two men to attack both he and Miss Santos with a crowbar and a knife which he hoped would end her pregnancy. Michael Proctor, prosecuting, said: 'Smith made it clear he didn't want anything to do with the child and didn't want his name to appear on the birth certificate. 'In fact at that time he made it clear he wanted her to terminate the pregnancy. He effectively came up with a plan for Jessica Santos to lose her unborn child. 'The plan was for him and Jessica to be out walking by a rowing lake and then to be attacked by two men armed with a wheel brace and knife. 'Jessica was to be grabbed, held down and the wheel brace used to cause injuries to cause her to miscarry.' But the plot was foiled when the third man contacted police and Blades tried to pull out of the sick conspiracy. Sentencing Smith, Judge Enright said: 'You have no previous convictions and are of good character but that is a sham. 'The victim impact statement shows the very great distress you have caused to this girl. 'A weapon would have been used and it did not take place through any effort of yours to stop it.' Also jailing father-of-two Blades, 23, Judge Enright said he would reduce his sentence in light of his early guilty plea and the fact he tried to pull out of the attack at the last moment. Michael Proctor, prosecuting, said the plan was for Miss Santos to be held down and for her to be beaten with a crowbar 'to cause injuries to cause her to miscarry' Speaking outside court, Miss Santos described Smith as 'evil', saying: 'Nobody has the right to say whether someone, especially a baby, should live or die.' He also said Blades would receive a reduction after being physically assaulted in prison as a result of standing as a prosecution witness. Jude Enright also said that Blades was 'not of a earthy state of mind' at the time of the incident. Jenni Dempster, mitigating for Blades, revealed he was suicidal at the time of the incident after the breakup of his engagement to Charlotte Desmond, 21. She said: 'Blades realised to embark on this entire was nothing short of terrible. He was at a point in his life where he was significantly depressed. He was at a place where he felt there was no reason to carry on with his life.' Neil Corries, mitigating for Smith, said victim Miss Santos has a 'bigger reason not to trust anyone again' after being attacked. He said: 'She describes the affect on her emotional state as getting angry easily and bursting into tears. 'She said when her child is old enough to understand he will have to tell them about this and let them decide whether they want a relationship with their father.' Mr Corries said Smith was of previous good character and that his actions had caused great distress to his family. He added: 'Jamie Smith has caused distress to his family as well and this is one of the many consequences of his offending. 'For them it is so out of character that they find it difficult to imagine how he got into this position. 'He understands he has got to be positive about this sentence that he is going to serve.' Victim Jessica, 18, whose family are from Portugal, has opted not to find out the sex of her baby until it is born.","Jamie Smith, 23, plotted to have mistress Jessica Santos, 18, attacked .

"The Royal baby will have the title His Royal Highness Prince [first name] of Cambridge, or Her Royal Highness Princess [first name] of Cambridge. The official title of William and Kate's first child, thought to be due on Saturday, 13 July, will be His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess [first name] of Cambridge, following the Dukedom gifted to William and his wife by the Queen as a wedding present in 2011. The baby will be born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, where William was born in 1982. The Royal couple's first child is due on Saturday, and will hold the title of Prince or Princess of Cambridge . The Mayor of Cambridge said it was a 'great honour' for the historic city (pictured: King's College Chapel in Cambridge) The Mayor of Cambridge, Councillor Paul Saunders, said it was a 'great honour' for the historic city. 'It is a great honour and I'm sure the people of Cambridge will appreciate it greatly,' he said. 'I think it's lovely to continue the close link with the Royal family. I think anything which helps to keep Cambridge in the public eye is a good thing as we rely on tourism.' Former Cambridge mayor Cllr Sheila Stewart, who met Kate on the royal visit to the city last year, added: 'It can only be good news for Cambridge. Everyone is so excited about it. The whole country is waiting for the birth.' The Dukedom of Cambridge was bestowed upon Prince William by the Queen on his wedding day, 29 April, 2011. Kate and William, pictured at the Trooping the Colour in London, currently have the title of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . On 22 June 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth, the previous day, of Prince William - the same will happen this year with his child . On 31 December, the Queen declared all the Duke's children would be princes and princesses, with the style Royal Highness. A palace spokesman said: 'The royal couple's child will officially be known as His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess [first name] of Cambridge.' He said any other children the couple have will also be known by the same title. Kate will give birth at St Mary's Hospital in London, the same hospital in which William was born . In addition, the child will be called after the dukedom of Cambridge, making them Prince or Princess of Cambridge. William also received the titles Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus when he married. These are gifts from the Queen, chosen by her and based on both historical significance and personal preference. The Queen is permitted to choose whichever title she wishes to give, though it cannot be in use by another member of the family or aristocracy. It is possible that she chose Cambridge for William and Kate due to its ancient links with the Royal family. Speaking to MailOnline, St James's Palace said: . 'Cambridge and Strathern have had Royal connections since the fourteenth century in the peerages of England and Scotland, and were both available. 'Prince William is descended from the son of George III, who was created Duke of Cambridge in 1801 through Queen Mary. ‘Carrickfergus is a town in Northern Ireland, and Country Antrim's oldest town, with one of the best-preserved castles in Ireland.' Anticipation is mounting around the imminent birth, with photographers already camped out outside St Mary's Hospital. Once the baby has been safely delivered, Prince William's first call will be to the Queen on an encrypted phone. At the same time, the Royal couple's private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton will inform Prime Minister David Cameron and a small number of other highly-placed individuals, including the Archbishop of Canterbury. Back at Buckingham Palace, officials will notify the head of each of the 54 Commonwealth countries and the First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. For the public, an official notice announcing the birth will be placed in a glass-fronted easel and attached to the gates of the Palace. Prince George of Cambridge . The royal baby will not be the first Prince or Princess of Cambridge. The last royals to hold the title were Prince George, Princess Augusta and Princess Mary of Cambridge, the grandchildren of George III, in the 19th century. The children were born to Prince Adolphus - the tenth child of King George III - and his wife Princess Augusta, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. All their children, born in 1819, 1822, 1833 were born His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess of Cambridge. The title Duke of Cambridge is part of the peerage, a legal system of largely hereditary titles in the United Kingdom. In modern practice, only members of the Royal Family are granted new hereditary peerages (the last non-royal hereditary peerages were created under the Thatcher government) The ranks of the English peerage are, from highest to lowest, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount and Baron. The Dukedom of Cornwall, created in 1337, is always held by eldest son, and heir apparent, of the monarch, and is currently held by Prince Charles, with his wife Camilla becoming the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Harry will most likely also be gifted a peerage by the Queen in the future. Peerages, like all modern British honours, are created by the British monarch and take effect when letters patent are affixed with the Great Seal of the Realm. Her Majesty's Government advises the Sovereign on a new peerage. The Great Seal of the Realm, which makes the bestowed title official, is an ancient seal used to symbolise the Sovereign's approval of important state documents and legitimatise them. Sisters Mary (right) and Augusta (left) were both born Princess of Cambridge . The wax is melted in a metal mould and pressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes to make official. The British Royal Family has created the Dukedom of Cambridge numerous times in its history. It was first used as a designation for Charles Stuart (1660–1661), the eldest son of James, Duke of York (later King James II). The first royal family member to have the peerage Duke of Cambridge bestowed upon him was in James Stuart, son of the Duke of York, in 1664. James, Duke of Cambridge died young and without heirs, and the title became extinct. The following two creations of the title had similar bad luck. Edgar Stuwart and Charles Stewart, who received the title in 1667 and 1677, respectively, both died young, having neither married or had children, meaning the title died out for several years. The Great Seal of the Relm, which makes the bestowed title official, is an ancient seal that is used to symbolise the Sovereign's approval of important state documents .","Royal baby will hold title HRHPrince or Princess [first name] of Cambridge .

"Muammar Gadaffi bedded at least four women just hours before meeting Prince Andrew for trade talks, it was claimed today. The Libyan dictator had a voracious sexual appetite and was so addicted to anti-impotence Viagra pills a nurse told him to cut down his intake. The sordid world of the despot who was killed last month in the country's uprising, has been revealed by his manservant of seven years. Voracious: Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi lived a life of extravagance and sexual addiction . Faisal, a young chef, cooked Andrew a 'traditional' dinner of tabouli, hummus and couscous when the prince met the Arab leader at the villa of one of his female friends. Later Andrew, who's office has confirmed he dined with Gadaffi in November 2008, told Faisal it was the finest meal he had ever had and posed for a picture with him. Trade ambassador: Prince Andrew had a meal with Gadaffi in 2008 . The aide, now 29, said the royal trade ambassador discussed relations between Libya and Britain and an oil contract. What Andrew was unaware of was Gaddafi's penchant for young women - many of whom were his bodyguards, according to Faisal. He said: There were four or sometimes five women each day. They had just become a habit to Gadaffi. 'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.' Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'. He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.' Faisal claimed that some of the women he bedded suffered so badly 'they went immediately from his bedroom to the hospital' to be treated for internal injuries. His addiction to Viagra, said the aide, was so extensive that his Ukrainian nurse urged to him to reduce the number of pills he swallowed every day. Gadaffi picked up victims at his former alma mater, Tripoli University, where he gave lectures and then led the young women to a nearby room whose only furniture was a double bed. Faisal claimed that another aide was once sent to a sex district of Paris, to buy a machine that Gadaffi used to apparently lengthen his penis. The despot was vain about his looks and demanded the aide dye his hair,  cover up his baldness and use make-up and treatments with green tea to hide his wrinkles. Faisal, who became a favourite of the dictator with his own house and car, sprayed a French-made lotion on the front of Gadaffi's head so his receding hairline would not be obvious. The aide was forced to be his servant after death threats were made against his family unless he obeyed. Faisal was captured by anti-Gadaffi forces but is unlike to be charged.","Aide who dyed dictator's hair claims: 'He would have his way with them like he had just blown his nose'

"English Heritage is hoping to recruit an army of volunteers to help survey some of the country's 345,000 Grade II listed buildings in a bid to stop further damage being inflicted on dozens of structures each year. From next year, the organisation hopes that volunteers will cover every building of interest from barns to libraries, private homes and factories, in a bid to compile the first ever comprehensive list detailing the condition of all England's listed heritage. English Heritage announced the drive to recruit people as it launched its 2013 Heritage at Risk Register. Under threat: Sandycombe Lodge in Twickenham, south west London, has been put on the English Heritage at Risk Register and is in need of a £2million pound refit. Historic: The listed house was built by painter JMW Turner as a country retreat for him and his father . Tired: The building has been declared at risk of decay or neglect by the English Heritage and needs an urgent refit . The register reveals that 5,700 listed buildings are at risk from decay or neglect. That number has fallen by 131 since last year, but English Heritage wants to remove a quarter of the entries from the list by 2015. A pilot scheme using 350 volunteers in areas including Whitehaven, South Tyneside, Hartlepool, Leeds and Worcester, saw some 5,000 Grade II buildings visually surveyed. Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said volunteering was a chance to help save a historic building or improve a conservation area. He said: 'For English Heritage it means we will eventually get, for the first time, a complete picture of the condition of all England's listed heritage. 'We can use this information to decide how best to deploy our national expertise to help owners and all those tackling heritage at risk on the ground.' Important role: Sandycombe Lodge was built in 1813 and later served as a 'shadow factory' producing airmen's uniforms . In need of attention: Some restoration on the damaged home has already begun with English Heritage hoping to reduce its at risk register by 25 per cent by 2015 . At risk: Oldknow's Limekilns in Marple, Greater Manchester, dating from 1800, but now derelict, has been added to the English Heritage under threat list this year . Buildings added to the at risk register this year include Sandycombe Lodge, in Richmond, south-west London, currently undergoing restoration, which was built by the artist JMW Turner for his father in 1813 and later served as a 'shadow factory' producing airmen's uniforms. Other sites added this year to the register include Oldknow's Limekilns in Marple, Greater Manchester, dating from 1800, but now derelict, and Green Lane Works in Sheffield, empty since 2009 but now with a 'promising' future as it undergoes a £13 million redevelopment. Baker's Hole, a palaeolithic site in Dartford, Kent, home to the earliest Neanderthals in Britain and later a chalk quarry, and described as 'overgrown and overrun with animals', is also added to the register. Under the sea: The wreck of HMS Invincibles, which sank in the 18th Century of the Hampshire coast is also listed as at risk . English Heritage said a partnership between itself and Natural England had led to the rescue and removal of 97 sites from the risk register in the last year. These include the remains of lead mines in County Durham and Cumbria, the largest and most important Roman town in northern East Anglia, a 13th century moated manor in Staffordshire and the park and gardens of a country house in Dorset. Other sites taken off the register include St Barnabas Church in Erdington, Birmingham, ravaged by fire in 2007 but now brought back to life by a 'determined' local community; Townhead Mansion in Slaidburn, Lancashire, now successfully restored after years of neglect; and Holy Well at Trellil, Helston, Cornwall, dating back to the 15th century and now restored and repaired.

"Over a glittering football career, Phil Neville won six Premier League titles with Manchester United and won 59 caps for England. Yet despite a lifetime of sporting achievements that would be the envy of anyone, the 37-year-old football ace-turned-pundit has been forced to admit he never learned to make a cup of instant coffee. Neville sensationally revealed he was caught out by Daily Mail sports journalist who came to his house just before Christmas for an interview. Scroll down for video . How much milk? Phil Neville sits in the living room where he received SportsMail journalist Matt Lawton - and served coffee for the first time in his life - after first phoning his wife to ask her how the hot drink is made . He told listeners on BBC radio how he panicked after asking Matt Lawton if he would like a drink. 'When he replied coffee, my heart sank because I thought: ""how do I do that?"",' Neville was quoted as saying by the Telegraph. 'I ran into the kitchen and I thought I am not going to poison this guy so I rang my wife. 'The problem I then had was how much milk to put in. I forgot to ask my wife how much. 'To be fair, he [the journalist] is still alive.' Mr Lawton's feature interview revealed how he sat in the football star's living room at 11.30am on a Monday morning and the former player told him he had just made coffee for the first time in his life. Mr Lawton told MailOnline today that the hot drink was up to scratch. He said: 'For a first attempt it was very good, but I had no idea he was in the kitchen ringing his wife for instructions.' Elsewhere in Neville's extensive chat with Mr Lawton, the former player told how legendary cricket pundit Geoffrey Boycott helped him improve his commentating skills after his attempts during the World Cup led to complaints to the BBC. Glittering career: Neville won six Premier League titles with Manchester United and won 59 caps for England, but apparently failed to pick up everyday life skills such as how to make a hot drink for his guests . ‘After I got back from Brazil I went to the cricket to do a Test Match Special with Jonathan Agnew,’ said Neville. ‘And Geoff Boycott was there. “Come ‘ere son,” he says, and for the next hour he took me into all the different broadcasting boxes and introduced me to everyone. And then we sat down and talked and, without really knowing it, he gave me an hour’s masterclass on commentary and working in the media. ‘”What you need to do lad is get on that radio,” he says. I started laughing. I thought he was trying to tell me I had a face for radio. ‘But he said, “Find your voice, get your confidence”. And he made the point that it’s that bit easier to make a mistake on the radio, because if you describe something wrong the guy driving down the M6 won’t know. There’s a bit more of a safety net and a chance to gain some confidence. So I’ve done loads of radio since then, and if there was a bit of lingering nervousness at the BBC it soon started to lift.’","Football ace caught out at his home by SportsMail journalist Matt Lawton .

"An attempt to honour cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott was blocked because of his conviction for assaulting a former lover . For decades he has been known to fans of his dogged cricketing style as ‘Sir’ Geoffrey Boycott. But an attempt by Home Secretary Theresa May to turn the affectionate tribute into a genuine knighthood was blocked by Government officials because of Boycott’s conviction for assaulting a former lover, The Mail on Sunday has learned. The bid to honour the former England captain in the New Year Honours list was vetoed by the Cabinet Office because of a furore dating back nearly two decades. The Yorkshire batsman received a three-month suspended sentence and £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for pinning down his then lover, Margaret Moore, and punching her in the face. Boycott, now 74, denies ever hitting Ms Moore, insisting that she slipped and injured herself after flying into a rage when he told her he was ‘not the marrying kind’. According to Whitehall guidelines, a criminal record should not in itself prevent a person from being considered for a knighthood as long as there is no ‘outstanding issue’. Mrs May lent her name to the campaign to honour Boycott, which was led by a group of cricket-loving Tory MPs, only for it to be scuppered by officials. The MPs, including Henry Bellingham and fellow Yorkshireman Nigel Adams, sent letters to the Cabinet Office saying that Boycott’s record entitled him to join the pantheon of cricketing knights including Sir Len Hutton. Mrs May, David Cameron and Ed Miliband have all recently joined Boycott on separate occasions to watch top-flight matches. Boycott was the first Englishman to score more than 8,000 Test runs and still ranks as the country’s sixth highest run scorer ever. Boycott received a three-month suspended sentence and £5,300 fine from a French court in 1996 for pinning down his then lover, Margaret Moore (pictured at the time, left, and in 2000, right) and punching her in the face . The Cabinet Office is also believed to have received a submission on Boycott’s behalf from within Sajid Javid’s Culture Department, but an official intervened to prevent it from being considered by the sporting honours committee, which is chaired by Lord Coe. Boycott’s allies point out that Sir Ian Botham received a knighthood in 2007 despite receiving a three-month suspension from cricket after being arrested for smoking cannabis in 1986 – although he was never charged with any offence. Last night, Mr Adams said: ‘People in Yorkshire have been calling him “Sir Geoffrey” for years, and I am hopeful that he will receive his due in future rounds. Plenty of knights have been honoured after a brush with the English, let alone Napoleonic, law. Boycott was the first Englishman to score more than 8,000 Test runs and still ranks as the country’s sixth highest run scorer ever . 'He has done a tremendous amount of work for charity and has a lot of support on the floor of the Commons, at Cabinet level and in the Opposition, but it sounds as if some jobsworth numpty who doesn’t understand Geoffrey’s contribution to sport has let his pen get carried away.’ Boycott – who did become the marrying kind when he married long-term lover Rachael Swinglehurst in 2003 – has been involved with cancer charities since fighting the disease a decade ago. Boycott, who lived with his mother until he was 38, was in an on-off relationship with Rachael for more than three decades before they married. In a memoir published last year he said that he would not have survived his throat cancer without Rachael ‘being there for me’. During his playing days, Boycott took part in 108 Tests and captained England four times, although his stubborn style of play and blunt manner often irritated his colleagues. Botham described him as ‘totally, almost insanely, selfish’, and Boycott once found himself dropped after scoring 246 – for batting too slowly. After retiring he became a cricket pundit, but was sacked in the wake of the French conviction. However, he has since rebuilt his career and now works on BBC radio. On the night of his argument with Ms Moore, the couple had spent the evening drinking champagne with singer Billy Joel at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes. The cricketer later failed to have his conviction set aside by a higher French court, but said afterwards: ‘I am not guilty of hitting Margaret Moore and hope that the public have come to realise this.’ Ms Moore reacted to the decision by saying she would be ‘drinking champagne tonight’. The Cabinet Office said: ‘We can only comment on people who are on the Honours List, not on names that don’t appear.’ Boycott did not respond to requests for comment.","An attempt to knight Geoffrey Boycott was blocked by the Cabinet Office .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez and defender Phil Jagielka both hope Romelu Lukaku's last-gasp equaliser against West Ham will prove a turning point for the under-pressure Toffees after they avoided an early FA Cup exit. Everton have slumped to 13th in the Barclays Premier League after losing six of their last eight matches and Martinez's men looked set for more disappointment after James Collins' 56th-minute header put West Ham ahead at Goodison Park. The hosts still trailed by that goal heading into stoppage time but Lukaku's thumping close-range finish salvaged a 1-1 draw for Everton and a third-round replay at Upton Park. Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku scored a deserved equaliser in injury time at the end of the second half . The former Chelsea striker said he hoped this result could be the start of a decent run of games . Martinez hailed his side's 'phenomenal reaction' following their disappointing recent results and hopes it will spark a change in fortune for the Merseyside club. He told BT Sport: 'I'm very very pleased, I'm proud of the character. It wasn't an easy game once you concede a goal and it would have been a crime if we'd gone out of the cup just by a dead-ball situation. 'I'm more pleased than anything with the character, with the reaction that we showed, the never-give-up attitude. In the middle of a period where we are low in confidence, it was a phonomenal reaction and it could easily be a turning point in our season.' Martinez, who also thought the referee made a mistake in disallowing Lukaku's second-half header, added of the late leveller: 'Just delighted that at the end the goal arrived and I thought it was the true reward that the players deserved.' Everton defender Jagielka added: 'We still would've liked a win today, we haven't got enough wins this season, but we put a battling performance on and it was about getting something today. 'It will be a difficult one at Upton Park but if you'd offered us with five minutes to go a chance to stay in it we'd have taken it, and hopefully that will give us a kick-start to the new year.'

"For some managers it's an absolute Godsend - a chance to sign much-needed reinforcements and salvage an ailing season before it's too late. And in the last five campaigns it's been Newcastle United who are the most likely to get out the chequebook in the January transfer window. Forty-four per cent of the Tyneside club's transfer activity during that time has come in the first month of the year - the highest percentage in the Premier League. Hatem Ben Arfa is one of the many January signings made by Newcastle United in the last five years . Newcastle also acquired Mathieu Debuchy - one of six signings made in January 2013 . The window in January 2010 saw them bring in Danny Simpson, Wayne Routledge, Mike Williamson and Leon Best. Twelve months later they added Hatem Ben Arfa to their squad. Newcastle splashed out £9million on Papiss Cisse to boost their attack in January 2012 and signed six players - Mathieu Debuchy, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, Yoan Gouffran, Massadio Haidara, Moussa Sissoko and Kevin Mbabu - in 2013. The general trend in January, understandably, sees clubs struggling at the bottom end of the table reaching deep into their pockets while those challenging at the top keep their squad settled. West Ham signed Demba Ba from Hoffenheim in January 2011 and are second-most likely to buy in winter . QPR bought Loic Remy from Marseille for £8m in the January transfer window in 2013 . In the past five seasons, West Ham have done 37 per cent of their transfer business in January, while Queens Park Rangers have completed 36 per cent. Hull have done 31 per cent during the winter window, while Leicester, Crystal Palace and Southampton all stand at 29 per cent. The research by the Liverpool Echo comes as clubs everywhere begin the search for bargains that will improve their chances of success in the second-half of the season. David Moyes brought in Juan Mata 12 months ago in a bid to save Manchester United's season . The most expensive January transfer was Fernando Torres's £50m switch from Liverpool to Chelsea in 2011 . Their statistics show West Brom are the least likely to do their transfer business in January at just 12 per cent, though that might be about to change if Tony Pulis shakes up his squad. Manchester City (15 per cent), Man United (20), Liverpool (20), Tottenham (21) and Arsenal (21) are keen to make most additions to their squad in the summer window. Memorable January transfer window acquisitions include Fernando Torres swapping Liverpool for Chelsea in a £50m deal in 2011 and Luis Suarez moving from Ajax to Liverpool for £22.5m in the same year.","Newcastle United complete 44 per cent of transfer business in January .

"Hatem Ben Arfa has claimed that he would have turned down Real Madrid such was his desire for a move to Nice. The French winger’s contract at Newcastle United was terminated by mutual consent last weekend after his attitude and fitness came under question as he fell out of favour with former manager Alan Pardew on Tyneside. The same issues appeared to emerge during his previous loan at Hull City. Hatem Ben Arfa is surrounded by journalists as he leaves a training session at the Allianz Riviera stadium .

Ben Arfa will wear the number four jersey with his new side and he said: ‘Within 10 minutes, my choice was made. Even if Real had come calling, I’d have said yes to Nice.’ Ben Arfa, 27, showed flashes of his considerable talent during a four year spell in England and he scored several spectacular goals in a Newcastle shirt. On suggestions that he possesses a special talent, Ben Arfa said: ‘Me, a genius? This comes from the journalists. I am only a player who tries to work hard and enjoy myself. Ben Arfa (left) takes part in his first training session with the Ligue 1 club following his move from Newcastle . ‘Nice is a club with a great identity.

"Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has told David Templeton he should not be scared of giving the ball away. The former Hearts winger was back in the Ibrox side's line up on Saturday for the first time since the middle of November. The 3-1 win over Dumbarton was just his seventh start of the campaign - a poor return for a player who cost the Glasgow giants £700,000 when he moved from Tynecastle in 2012. David Templeton made his first start for Rangers in almost two months against Dumbarton on Saturday . McDowall - who picked up his first win as Gers boss since replacing Ally McCoist - admits the 25-year-old has suffered a crisis of confidence after being reduced to the role of an impact sub for most of the season. But after seeing him impress against the Sons, McDowall says Templeton must be given the licence to take on defender - and reassured him he will not be criticised if he gives away possession. He said: 'David did well on Saturday. He's short on a bit of confidence but I told him to just go and express himself. 'He's a flair player. He can't be afraid to go and lose possession. He's the type of boy who has to be allowed to do that. 'As much as you would like him to keep it, that's what they do - they entertain and try to take people on. He gets a wee bit more scope to do that than other people.' Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall says the winger should not be worried about losing possession . Meanwhile, Jon Daly hopes his Ibrox equaliser will be enough for him to keep hold of his own starting slot. McDowall made three changes to the team humiliated by last week's 4-0 thrashing from Hibernian. Ian Black - who had to be replaced after just half an hour in the capital as he flirted with a red card - was dropped to the bench along side Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark. Kyle Hutton, Templeton and Daly were the men brought in to spice up Rangers faltering season and the Irish frontman made the most of his chance after two games on the bench as he cancelled out Andy Graham's shock opener for Dumbarton. McDowall is looking to give the £700,000 signing renewed confidence as he returns to the Rangers team . Lee Wallace and Dean Shiels ensured Rangers got the win which trims Hearts' Scottish Championship lead back to 13 points and now Daly hopes his part in a winning display will have been picked up by the interim manager. He said: 'You need games as a striker. I'm sure the other front lads at the club will tell you they need a run of games just to find your match sharpness firstly, then to try and get your eye in with the goals. 'It's been frustrating for me personally. It wasn't ideal starting the season with an operation. Striker Jon Daly, who scored in the win over Dumbarton, hopes his goal will lead to more time on the pitch . 'There are a lot of quality strikers at the club and I knew I had to be patient. But hopefully I did enough on Saturday to give myself the opportunity to play the next game. 'I'm sure the manager will go with the team that he thinks has the best chance of beating Alloa next week, so that is why it's important at a club like Rangers to take your chances when they come along.'","Kenny McDowall handed David Templeton first start since November .

"New Zealand's Kane Williamson inched towards his ninth Test century as he combined with BJ Watling to stave off Sri Lanka's push for victory at the close of the third day's play in the second Test at the Basin Reserve on Monday. Williamson was 80 not out, his 16th Test half century, and shared in an unbroken 94-run partnership with Watling (48 not out) to take the hosts to 253 for five at the close, a lead of 118 runs with two days left to play.

Williamson was put down on 29 by Rangana Herath in a caught and bowled opportunity with the score 132 for four, then dropped in the final session by Nuwan Pradeep at deep backward square leg on 60, just three overs before the second new ball was due. Sri Lanka had put the hosts on the back foot with three wickets before lunch and then seized control when they reduced them to 159 for five, with the home side holding a 24-run lead and their last recognised pair at the crease.

"Michael Schumacher filmed the skiing accident which left him in a critical condition in hospital using a helmet camera which investigators hope may provide clues as to the cause of the crash, it is believed. The seven times Formula One world champion remains in an induced coma in hospital in Grenoble, France, where he has undergone two operations to remove blood clots and relieve pressure on his brain. Schumacher's family have given investigators the mini Go-Pro camera which was attached to his ski helmet and may contain crucial footage of the moment he lost control and hit his head on a rock. Scroll down for video . Investigators are examining footage from a video camera attached to Michael Schumacher's skiing helmet, which they hope could help the determine the cause of the crash which has left him fighting for his life in hospital . The cameras, which are popular among extreme sports enthusiasts, have wide angle lenses that take in much of the view and can show parts of the user's body including the face depending on how it is mounted. The latest models can take up to 30 images a second for six hours. If there are usable images they should shed light on the circumstances of the accident on a small off-piste section located between two ski slopes - one classed as easy and the other as intermediate. A spokeswoman denied some reports that his family had been reluctant to hand over the camera - taken by authorities on Friday - because of privacy reasons. 'Michael's helmet camera was voluntarily given to the investigating authorities by the family,' said spokewoman Sabine Kehm in a statement. 'That this should have been done against the wishes of the family is untrue.' It was not known whether the camera filmed the champion's descent down the slope or whether the images have been damaged by the impact on the rock. Schumacher's family had believed that the small GoPro camera had been broken but some of the footage was intact . Investigators also interviewed . Schumacher's son Mick, 14, son, who was with his father at the time of . the accident on the slopes of the French resort of Meribel last Sunday. Conflicting . statements have emerged, notably about how fast Schumacher was going . when he crashed. Albertville prosecutors and the ski resort say . Schumacher was skiing at great speed. Kehm has challenged that, saying . he could not have been going fast 'because it appears he helped a friend . who had just fallen'. Investigators . are tasked with determining responsibility in the accident, with high . stakes possibly involved regarding any insurance compensation. Prosecutors . are also looking at whether the limits of the pistes next to the . accident site were correctly marked, and whether the safety releases on . Schumacher's skis operated properly. 'I . don't think it's normal that between two marked slopes there would be . this passage with rocks showing that is not fenced off,' said Philippe . Streiff, a former French racing driver, in the French sports daily . L'Equipe. Although . Schumacher was conscious when airlifted from the unmarked run in the . Meribel resort, where he owns a property, he was agitated and soon fell . into a coma, prompting his transfer to the Grenoble hospital.He has undergone two operations to remove blood and pressure from his brain. Schumacher, . who holds an unbeaten record of 91 race victories in a career spanning . more than two decades, is understood to have been travelling off-piste . at speed when he crashed, hitting his head on a boulder with such force . that his helmet cracked in two. Rescue scene: A picture released on Thursday shows a helicopter waiting to fly Schumacher to hospital . His family had initially believed that . the camera had also been broken, but a subsequent investigation . revealed some of the footage was intact. Schumacher was initially conscious before deteriorating into a critical condition. Rescuers were on hand within minutes of the accident and he was airlifted to Grenoble hospital. Doctors . have said the impact caused numerous brain injuries including . intracranial hematomas (multiple blood clots), bilateral lesions and . bruising of the brain. Today Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said he remains in a critical but stable condition. It is believed he lost . control after hitting a boulder which had been concealed by snow that had . fallen the night before and was 'catapulted' headfirst into three other . rocks. An initial operation carried out on Sunday to . reduce swelling was followed by a second to remove the largest of a . number of clots in his brain. Theory: It is believed Schumacher lost control after hitting a boulder which had been concealed by snow that had fallen the night before and was 'catapulted' headfirst into three other rocks . Schumacher is understood to have been travelling off-piste at speed when he crashed, hitting his head on a boulder with such force that his helmet cracked in two . Yesterday . Schumacher's family say they have been 'utterly overwhelmed' and moved . to tears by a birthday vigil held by scores of fans and well-wishers . outside the hospital where he is being treated. Schumacher should have been celebrating his 45th birthday with his family on Friday. Some 200 people from Ferrari fan clubs . based around Europe made the trip to the hospital, where a tribute was . held in support of the seven-time Formula One world champion. The scores of well-wishers also held a one-minute silence on Friday afternoon, the racer's 45th birthday. Schumacher's . family, who on Thursday said Michael 'is a fighter and will not give . up' his fight for life, expressed their sincere appreciation following . Friday's tributes, which were largely co-ordinated by Ferrari, with whom . the German driver won five of his seven world titles. 'The incredible sympathies shown today by the Ferrari fans outside the hospital has utterly overwhemed us and moved us all to tears,' Schumacher's family said in a statement on his official website. 'We are deeply grateful for it and also for all the heartwarming and heartfelt wishes for Michael to get well soon, which have reached us from all over the world.' Strained: Michael Schumacher's wife, Corinna, arrives at Grenoble . Hospital yesterday to spend a fifth day by his bedside as her husband fights . for life after his horrific skiing accident in the French Alps . Worried: Mrs Schumacher, who has shown unwavering support for her husband in their 18 years of marriage, was said to be struggling to cope with his battle to survive . Schumacher's family - wife Corinna and . their two children, father Rolf and brother Ralf - have maintained a . presence at his bedside since tlast weekend. Schumacher . enjoys a special place in the hearts of all Ferrari fans, having won . the world drivers' title for five successive years between 2000 and 2004 . while driving for the team. Seventy-two of his record 91 grand prix wins also came at the wheel of Ferrari cars. A Ferrari statement read: 'This is a special day for Ferrari and all its fans as it is Michael Schumacher's birthday.'At the moment, he is tackling the most important fight of his life and therefore we want to send him very special wishes. 'Everyone . at Ferrari, from president Luca di Montezemolo and team principal . Stefano Domenicali, who are in touch all the time with Michael's family . and those closest to him, are continuously watching how his situation . evolves. Exhausted: Mrs Schumacher was joined by the F1 star's father Rolf (right) for the vigil at his hospital bedside . Influence: Rolf Schumacher started his son's lifelong passion for driving when he introduced him to kart racing at the age of four . Support: Michael Schumacher's brother Ralf also arrives at the hospital. His family has released their first statement since the accident, saying the seven-time champion was a fighter 'who will not give up' 'Obviously, today there are double the reasons to wish him all the best. 'Forza Michael!' No update was given on Schumacher's condition by the hospital or his management on Thursday and that remained the case on Friday. Schumacher suffered major brain trauma in the accident which occurred when skiing off-piste in the resort of Meribel in France. It is believed that his life was saved by his skiing helmet, which split on impact. Loyal support: The Ferrari team, with whom Schumacher won a record five . titles in a row from 2000, has provided about 20 coaches across Italy to . bus in fans for the vigil to mark Schumacher's 45th birthday . Tribute: Schumacher's fans put signs with messages of support outside the hospital to mark his 45th birthday . Concern: The gathering is certain to be a sombre and poignant occasion although those present will hope the day will bring encouraging news on the German . In his honour: Ferrari fans from France, Italy and Germany attend a silent 45th birthday tribute to seven-times former Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher . Messages of support appeared on Twitter from Schumacher's former team mates on Friday. 'Happy Birthday my brother Michael! Be strong!! Be strong!! Don't give up!! We are praying for you,' wrote former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa who in 2009 spent several days in an induced coma after being hit by a bouncing spring from another car.

"England head to Australia on Tuesday for what they hope will be a victorious World Cup campaign, and quick bowler James Anderson says they have to forget about former captain Alastair Cook. The Test skipper lost his one-day job last month after five straight losses, with Eoin Morgan stepping up to lead the team down under.

'To change the captain so close to the World Cup was a big call but the selectors clearly felt Cooky's form with the bat had been too poor for too long. 'Whether it was the correct decision remains to be seen. If we win the tournament then, obviously, the decision will have been vindicated.

It is thought he has agreed a two-year deal, with an an announcement planned on his move from west Wales in the next few days. Priestland, 27, has won 32 Wales caps, but is currently behind Ospreys star Dan Biggar in the fly-half pecking order. Rhys Priestland is set to leave Scarlets for Bath after the World Cup on a two-year contract . He would become Aviva Premiership title contenders Bath's second major signing for next term, joining Fiji scrum-half Niko Matawalu, while it is thought that South Africa Test number eight Duane Vermeulen remains a key recruitment target. Priestland joined the Scarlets in 2005, graduating to the first team via their academy system. He would provide important back-up for England's current fly-half George Ford at the Recreation Ground. Priestland is an experienced international, representing Wales on 32 occasions, but is no longer first choice . Priestland is not among the current group of Wales internationals to be offered national dual contracts - deals funded by the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regions from a £3.3million pot. Six players have so far signed up - Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Jake Ball, Rhodri Jones, Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan - with more set to follow this month. With Dan Biggar currently ahead of Priestland in the pecking order, he has not been offered a dual contract .","Rhys Priestland will join Bath after the World Cup .

"Christian Wade may be a London boy but the Wasps winger looked right at home in Coventry with a performance against Sale to suggest that he is back to his best. His game had everything but a try as the England hopeful danced around two-footed Sharks defenders to inspire the Ricoh Arena journeymen to another dominant victory at their new base in the Midlands. The 23-year-old has spent the majority of the last 12 months on the sidelines and used his spare time to work on upper body strength, with director of rugby Dai Young suggesting the speedster should be right in contention for the Six Nations. Christian Wade of Wasps was in fine form as the home side thrashed Sale Sharks on Sunday afternoon . Wasps scrum-half Jose Simpson celebrates one of his tries during the comprehensive win over Sale . ‘It’s not for me to say who should and shouldn’t be selected, but I wouldn’t swap him for anyone,’ said Young. ‘He is by far one of the most exciting wingers with ball in hand and he’s as good a finisher as anyone, but he doesn’t always get the credit he deserves for creating opportunities. He was outstanding for us.’ Wade caused problems from the start, jinking past two defenders to make valuable yards, before Andy Goode kicked his side ahead with a third minute penalty. Wasps were simply too quick and, after three points from Joe Ford to level the score, Wade again played a major role in the opening try. Ben Jacobs set the one-cap international free with a sublime no-look pass and skipper James Haskell was on hand to finish the move. Few players offer the same levels of entertainment as Wade, who will no doubt be a major selling point if his club are going to maintain the healthy crowds that have turned out for their first two fixtures in Coventry – with 15,343 in attendance on Sunday. Alex Lozowski collects the ball in mid-air as Wasps dominated Sale at the Ricoh Arena on Sunday . ‘The crowd were excellent, so we need to give performances that they want to keep coming back to,’ said Young. ‘We want to turn this place into a real fortress.’ Nathan Hughes extended the lead with a try just before the end of the first quarter, but Ford’s accuracy with the boot helped keep his side in the game. The No 10 kicked nine points inside the opening 23 minutes, before the floodgates opened. Goode added a dropped goal and Joe Simpson sniped over just before half time, finishing a bizarre play that saw full-back Mike Haley ripped in mid-air after being held by Wade and Bradley Davies. Wasps fly-half Andy Goode, taking a conversion on Sunday, impressed again with his kicking for the home side . Simpson goes over for a try during the 41-16 victory over Sale at the Ricoh Arena to go fourth in the table . Second rower Andrei Ostrikov (left) scored a late try for Sale but it turned out to only be a consolation . ‘We were given a good hiding really,’ said Steve Diamond, the Sale director of rugby. ‘We weren’t the abrasive side that we normally are and we will have to look at that in training.’ Not even the second-half introduction of Danny Cipriani, who Young singled out for praise in his programme notes, could stem the flow of attack. Simpson sealed the bonus point with his second try following some standoffish tackling, before Ashley Johnson scored off a driving line-out to break the 40-point barrier. With James Gaskell in the sin-bin, Sale added some respect to the scoreline with a 75th minute try from Andrei Ostrikov, but Wasps were home and dry with an easy win to move them into fourth place. Danny Cipriani (centre), came on from the bench at the Ricoh Arena but couldn't inspire a fightback for Sale .

"Newly appointed MBE and Rugby World Cup winner Sarah Hunter believes 2014 was the most significant year yet for closing the gender equality gap in sport. Despite only two players from England women’s 2014 world champion side being recognised on the Queen’s New Year’s Honours List - compared to all of the winning men’s squad in 2003 - Hunter feels that the unprecedented success will prove a turning point for the profile of female competition. ‘I think 2014 might have been the year to push female sport into a different level,’ said Hunter. ‘All the accolades in women’s sport last year have been a massive turning point. Sarah Hunter MBE says women's sport went 'to a different level' in 2014 with England's rugby triumph . The England women's team celebrate their victory in the World Cup final over Canada in Paris . 'Lizzy Yarnold at the Winter Olympics, Jo Pavey at the Commonwealth Games and Charlotte Dujardin becoming a world champion rider; the list goes on.’ Hunter, who linked up with the England squad on Saturday for their first camp ahead of the Six Nations, added: ‘We had 40,000 people turn out to watch England’s women play football at Wembley and I think that’s set the tone for just how great women’s sport is in the UK. ‘Now we need to keep up this momentum and level of coverage.’ A record crowd of 45,619 turned out to watch a women's friendly between England and Germany .","Sarah Hunter was one of two England World Cup winners to be given MBE .

"A lifelong dream becomes reality for Chris Cork in Buenos Aires on Sunday, as the former punk rocker from High Wycombe sits on his bike to begin the world’s most punishing motorsport event. The 43-year-old Englishman, a builder by trade, will put his bike, body and possibly even his life on the line during the Dakar, the 5,500-mile race across the Andes and the Atacama desert. He has left his partner and two sons, including three-month-old Oliver, behind and even sold their farm to fund his ride of a lifetime. Chris Cork is set to embark on the the 5,500-mile Dakar race across the Andes and the Atacama desert . Cork, a builder by trade, has left his partner and two sons to embark on his race of a lifetime . ‘He’s always wanted to do the Dakar, it’s been a dream of his,’ said partner Mel, who remains confident, if a little anxious. ‘He’s quite a safe rider, it’s just everything else that goes into the equation that worries me. It’s a bit of a mixed bag because I’m excited for him but obviously it’s a bit tricky here for the next three weeks with two young kids.’ And that’s also the hardest part for Cork, who once upon a time played drums and bass in punk bands Chineapple Punx and Blossom, but nowadays is found doting on Mel and the children. ‘I have pictures of my two sons with me at all times and I miss them greatly,’ he said. Thoughts of home will disappear on Sunday, however, when Cork lines up at the start of one of the most gruelling and dangerous of all races. A total of 665 competitors will leave Buenos Aires in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles. British interest is restricted to a mere eight racers, a far cry from the heyday of the old Paris-Dakar when dozens of home hopefuls would cross the Channel and begin the epic journey down to Dakar in Senegal. Cork will be one of 665 competitors racing in in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles . Cork, whose preparations for the rally have not been ideal - he broke his wrist in August and crashed out of the Rally of Morocco in October - is Britain’s only amateur rider this year, though Paul Round from Huddersfield and Mike Jones, from Sandbach, founders of Rally Raid UK, continue to fly the flag in all categories, taking four cars, two trucks and two bikes. Crossing the barren terrain of Argentina, Chile and Bolivia sounds daunting enough, but Jones paints an even scarier picture. ‘The Dakar is an addiction, it takes over your life,’ he explained. ‘The organisation are out to break you and your vehicle, simple as that. ‘Some of the terrain looks mind blowing when you see it and you never believe a vehicle can cross it, let alone at speed. ‘You can be 3km off track and still be classed as on course, yet a 10-metre deviation in the desert can be a smooth fast track or a 500ft-deep canyon. The route designer puts secret waypoints that must be passed by into the most devilish places, at the top of the steepest dunes and the bottom of the biggest holes and sand pits. ‘In the daylight it is difficult, when the sun goes down it really sorts the men from the boys or the girls from the women.’ 43-year-old's preparations have been far from ideal having broken a wrist in August . Of the eight British competitors at Dakar this year it is with Cork’s sole compatriot in the bike category, Sam Sunderland, where British hopes lie. Sunderland, 25, has secured a ride with the dominant KTM squad, on the back of taking the second stage win riding a works Honda in last year’s Dakar. For Cork, however, ambitions are more modest. Given what lies ahead, the endless tests over unyielding surfaces, in extreme temperatures, from sea level to the peaks of the Andes and back, he speaks for the majority when he says: ‘My expectation is simply to finish.’ Britain's Sam Sunderland will be riding at Dakar with the dominant KTM squad .","The Dakar  is a 5,500-mile race across the Andes and the Atacama desert .

"George Boyd wants Burnley to continue their good run of form in Monday's FA Cup tie against Tottenham. The Clarets will go into the third-round clash at Turf Moor on a high after fighting back to claim draws against Manchester City and Newcastle in the past week, scoring five goals in the process. Those two matches were preceded by narrow defeats against Liverpool and Tottenham and victory over Southampton meaning Burnley have emerged from what appeared to be a daunting run of matches with belief very much intact. Burnley forward George Boyd has called on his team-mates to carry on their good form . Boyd is lifted in the air after scoring his side's third goal in their 3-3 draw with Newcastle on New Year's Day . Sean Dyche, pictured applauding Burnley's travelling fans, will be pleased with his side's recent form . Boyd, who scored against both City and Newcastle, has fond memories of the FA Cup having reached the final with Hull 12 months ago. Although survival in the top flight is clearly the Clarets' priority, Boyd sees the match as a great chance to post a victory over one of the Premier League's big boys. The midfielder told Burnley's official website: 'These were a tough run of fixtures and nobody expected us to get anything probably but we've shown our character again. 'We can go into our next run of games full of confidence now on the back of the last two results. 'It's a great game and hopefully there'll be a big crowd at Turf Moor to get behind us. 'The FA Cup still has that magic and I was lucky enough to get to the final last year with Hull City and that was a great occasion.' After naming the same side for six straight games, boss Sean Dyche will make changes. Sean Dyche is hoping to extend Manchester United defender Michael Keane's loan deal . His hand has been forced after both captain Jason Shackell and his replacement Kevin Long sustained injuries during the first half at St James' Park. Shackell's calf problem is not thought to be serious but Monday is likely to come too soon while Burnley were still waiting to hear whether Long's knee injury was as bad as first feared. Dyche, meanwhile, was negotiating with Manchester United over whether on-loan defender Michael Keane would be available. Keane's loan is due to end next weekend but the Clarets could well seek an extension with their defensive resources stretched and the 21-year-old having impressed. Even if Keane is permitted to play, Dyche could still need full-back Ben Mee to deputise in the middle of the defence, while midfielder Steven Reid would be another option. Striker Sam Vokes will hope to be given another run out as he continues to be eased back in following a long-term knee injury. The 25-year-old made his return after nine months out as a late substitute against Liverpool but was left out of the squad against City and Newcastle.","George Boyd has called on his Burnley team-mates to carry on good form .

"Drawing comparisons with his younger brother, Freddie Burns shows a rare moment of self-doubt. The Leicester No 10 has been keeping a close eye on his sibling, Billy, who is breaking through into the senior ranks at Gloucester. ‘He reminds me of myself a few years back,’ said Burns. ‘He’s got no fear and is full of confidence. ‘There’s a bit of a carefreeness and you can put mistakes down to naivety. Now any mistakes are punished because there’s an expectation level, but I’m happy with that.’ Freddie Burns hasn't had the start to life at Leicester he hoped for but is showing signs of confidence . Burns featured in England's tour of New Zealand but has fallen back in the pecking order for the No 10 . Confidence has never been an issue for Burns Snr, but the sometimes wizard-like fly-half admits there have been times of frustration since his summer move from Gloucester. After playing a prominent role in England’s end-of-season tour of New Zealand, the 24-year-old was overlooked for the autumn internationals. His slip down the England pecking order is linked to a stuttering start to life at Welford Road, where he has been named on the bench eight times in the last 11 games. ‘I’ve not quite hit the levels I wanted to, but it’s a long season and a lot can change,’ said Burns. ‘I’ve probably not played as much as I would have liked, so I just want a run of games to get my confidence back. Not that my confidence has gone… but it’s a different ball game when you’re starting every week.’ Owen Farrell was first-choice fly-half at the start of the autumn but has suffered a lack of game time . George Ford: The Bath youngster has shown that he is not too small for Test rugby and is enjoying a consistent run of good form. Can take the ball up to the gainline, but can also orchestrate play from deep. Owen Farrell: First choice at the start of the autumn, but a lack of form and game-time saw the Saracens No 10 dropped. A cool head with the boot and a solid defender, lacks attacking spark of his challengers. Stephen Myler: Hard to ignore the man who is helping to keep Northampton at the top of the table, but too conservative and would not scare the Southern Hemisphere big three. At 30, he offers a calm head with more experience than his rivals. Danny Cipriani: A popular choice after some impressive performances at Sale, but does not seem to be in Stuart Lancaster’s plans. Lacks consistency, but has the attacking wizardry to turn a game on its head from the bench. Freddie Burns: Similar to Cipriani in terms of his eccentric style but does not carry the weight of celebrity baggage. A major lack of game-time at Leicester means Burns has had little chance to turn the heads of the England selectors. Henry Slade: The uncapped wildcard has been compared to Dan Carter by Exeter Chiefs team-mate Dean Mumm. Can operate at No 10 or in the centres and seems to have the full attacking and defensive repertoire at club level. Expectation levels were high for Burns after his much-hyped arrival from the West Country. The five-cap international was expected to rediscover his mojo behind a dominant Tigers pack, become a Welford Road favourite and re-assert himself in the international set-up, where many had tipped him to become England’s next big success story. Yet Burns seems to have slipped temporarily out of Stuart Lancaster’s plans, with Sunday’s opponent George Ford being the man in firm possession of the No 10 jersey. Burns offers moments of flash-in-the-pan brilliance, but Ford has shown superior ability to consistently manage the game. Ford came out on top at The Rec in September, when Leicester were beaten 45-0 and Burns was left to reflect on one of the most painful defeats of his career. For the Tigers, revenge is very much on the cards. Burns' ability to produce moments of brilliance aren't in doubt but George Ford's been more reliable . Ford had Burns' number in September at The Rec when now second-placed Bath beat the Tigers 45-0 . ‘It was probably my worst day in a rugby shirt,’ said Burns. ‘My friends and family are all from Bath, so they pay a bit more attention to it. I took a fair bit of stick and rightly so. ‘It wasn’t fun to play in, but we feel like a much stronger team now. If you come off the pitch after losing 45-0, then it’s always going to be a pretty dark day. ‘Now we can use the result as motivation, but you can’t get too caught up in that way of thinking. I used to get too carried away with these games when I was at Gloucester, but you can’t let yourself do that. Now I just try and look at it as just another game… maybe with a little extra spice.’ As has been the case in most of Leicester’s recent big games, director of rugby Richard Cockerill has backed Welsh youngster Owen Williams to call the shots at No 10 this afternoon. It was a similar case last month, when Burns played in an A League fixture just two days after being left out of the starting XV for the Champions Cup tie with Toulon. Things may not be going to plan, yet his natural aura of confidence still comes through. Freddie's brother Billy Burns, who is playing for Gloucester, shows a no fear attitude and confidence . Freddie says the way Billy plays with freedom reminds him of himself a few years ago . ‘I didn’t see coming here as a quick fix,’ said Burns. ‘But I back my own skills and I believe I’m good enough to be in and around that England mix. ‘I like to think that, the majority of time I’ve played for England, I’ve performed reasonably well. ‘I know I’m capable and I’ve got full confidence in my ability. I didn’t expect to come to Leicester and for someone to wave a magic wand, make me England’s number one and suddenly it’s all rosy. I knew I would have to compete for my place. ‘It’s a different way of life up here and it’s a long-term process. Everyone would like to change club, hit the ground running and be starting for England, but that’s not how it works. If I’m starting for Leicester week in, week out, then I’ve got full confidence that I can be around that squad.’","Leicester's Freddie Burns takes on Bath's George Ford on Sunday .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was singing Mark Schwarzer's praises after he left the club to join Leicester on a free transfer. The 42-year-old will end an 18 month stint at the west London club, indicating that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least. Schwarzer's arrival to the King Power Stadium will be a welcome addition whilst current first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel recovers from a broken metatarsal. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho's tribute to Mark Schwarzer . Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has left Chelsea for Leicester City on a free transfer . Leicester's first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel (right) is currently out injured with a broken foot . 'As a goalkeeper, when we needed (Schwarzer), he was there for us, and as a person and a professional he was an amazing guy in our group,' Mourinho said. 'On behalf of myself, my staff and my players I want to say we are going to miss the big guy and we wish him all the best in his new life at Leicester.' With young shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois cementing his place in the first team following his return to the club and Petr Cech staying with the Blues after the summer transfer window, Schwarzer's place status in the Chelsea squad meant he became surplus to requirements for Jose Mourinho's team. Furthermore, Mourinho sees Schwarzer's departure as an opportunity to give homegrown goalkeeper Jamal Blackman some playing time. 'We'll bring Jamal back from Middlesbrough. He was on loan there but he wasn't playing so for them it's not a problem. 'For us, he's a young, English goalkeeper. He can work with Courtois and Cech so for him it's a good experience.'

"West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has completed a loan move to London rivals Queens Park Rangers. The 27-year-old, who joined the Hammers from Argentine side Velez Sarsfield in the summer, has failed to land himself a first-team spot at Upton Park. QPR manager Harry Redknapp unveiled his latest signing on Tuesday afternoon. West Ham forward Mauro Zarate has penned a loan deal at Queens Park Rangers this month . The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot . 'We're really pleased to bring Mauro in. He's a good footballer, someone with great ability who can play as a No 10,' Redknapp said. 'He's a more than capable player, he's already shown that, and hopefully he can come in here and do well for us.' Redknapp has made no secret of his desire to add at least one more striker to his squad in January and the Rangers manager believes Zarate fits the bill. Redknapp recently said: 'It's important to have options up front. You need somebody else to weigh in with goals. We can't rely on Charlie (Austin) getting all the goals.' Zarate has scored two goals in seven league appearances for West Ham this season but has struggled for a starting spot ahead of Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce recently responded to claims he had treated Zarate unfairly by insisting the 27-year-old had simply not been good enough to secure a regular place in the side.

"Stoke City are set to secure German defender Philipp Wollscheid on a six month loan deal. The Potters can activate a buyout clause at the end of the season should they wish to. But who is the imminent new signing from Bayer Leverkusen? VIDEO Scroll down to see Philipp Wollscheid hit presenter Jessica Kastrop with a ball . Who's Philipp Wollscheid then? At just 25 years old, Wollscheid is already something of a Bundesliga journeyman. After his breakthrough at Nuremberg, the centre back moved to Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2012. Despite a strong start at his new club, Wollscheid eventually fell out of favour, and was loaned to Mainz 05 last summer in a bid to get more playing time. Stoke are close to signing Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid on loan until the end of the season . Did that not work out? So far, Wollscheid only made five appearances for Kasper Hjulmand's side in the first half of this season, and three of those were as a substitute. That means he's only player about 200 minutes of league football since last season. Injuries have held him back, but even bad luck cannot hide the fact that he was fourth choice centre back, behind Stefan Bell, Gonzalo Jara and Niko Bungert. Wollscheid (left) has only made five appearances for Mainz since joining on loan from Leverkusen this term . So Stoke aren't getting a superstar? Not quite. But there are similarities between Wollscheid and the Potters' star signing of the summer Bojan Krkic. Both were tipped for great things, but didn't quite make the cut for the highest level early in their careers. In his first season at Leverkusen, Wollscheid established himself in the starting line up, playing a full ninety minutes in 31 of the 34 Bundesliga fixtures. His form paid off, and Joachim Low nominated him for the Germany squad which toured the Americas in 2013. The tour was a bit of a disaster, and many young players like Wollscheid have not played for their country since. In the following season, Wollscheid also lost his place in Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen side. Wollscheid's (top) form has dipped since his Leverkusen debut season  where he played 31 of 34 league games . Tell me more about the way he plays. At 6'4, Wollscheid may come to share the nickname 'BFG' with his compatriot Per Mertesacker. Like Mertesacker, Wollscheid may be big, but he will not strike the fear of God into opposing strikers. At his best, he is a gifted all round defender, with excellent positioning and relatively secure heading and tackling. He can play with both feet, and can mark equally well man to man or zonally, although he can be prone to losses of concentration. The 6'4 defender (centre) has excellent positional sense but can be prone to losses of concentration . Will Stoke be desperate to buy him in the summer? That depends on two things. Firstly, how well he settles, and secondly, how much faith Mark Hughes shows in him. If Wollscheid gets regular game time, he is definitely up to becoming a strong addition to Stoke's defence, and well worth his £4m price tag. If he is underused, as has been at Mainz, he may struggle to fight for his place, and will probably return to Germany. Valued at £4million, Wollscheid (right) could prove a strong addition to Stoke's defence if given opportunities . Anything else we should know? Wollscheid gave the nation something to laugh about when he embarrassed Sky TV presenter Jessica Kastrop. During the pre-match warm up, The defender's misplaced pass struck Kastrop in the head while she was speaking into the camera. It was the second time Kastrop had been hit by a loose ball on live TV.","Stoke are close to signing Bayer Leverkusen's Philipp Wollscheid on loan .

"Rangers have taken out a crisis loan to avoid being wound up by HM Revenue and Customs, it is understood. It is believed the Scottish Championship club were handed a seven-day notice letter at the end of December relating to non-payment of National Insurance. On Monday morning, the troubled Ibrox outfit announced shareholder and football board chairman Sandy Easdale has handed over a loan of £500,000 for 'general working capital purposes over the next few days'. Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale is pictured taking his seat Hibernian's Easter Road stadium last month . In 2012, Rangers were placed in administration then liquidated amid crippling debts, including unpaid tax. Newco Rangers subsequently took a place on the bottom rung of Scottish football and have since reached the second tier. This latest loan – after previous cash injections from Newcastle United owner and Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley - has been secured against the £800,000 fee received from the transfer this month of 20-year-old Scotland international midfielder Lewis Macleod to Brentford. Rangers also confirmed on Monday morning it has received an £18million takeover approach from American businessman Robert Sarver. The owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team, Sarver has until February 2 to make a firm offer for the Glasgow club. But separate moves recently by the Three Bears consortium led by Douglas Park and by former Rangers director Dave King to make share purchases in the club mean the US tycoon is unlikely to succeed in his takeover – at least as originally planned. But the US financier may be prepared to back King and The Three Bears in their bid to seize control of the club. Announcing the latest crisis loan to the Stock Exchange, a Rangers statement said: 'The facility is being provided by Alexander Easdale, a shareholder in the company and director of The Rangers Football Club Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of RIFC. American businessman Robert Sarver has made an £18million takeover approach for Rangers . 'The facility will be used by the company for general working capital purposes over the next few days. Alexander Easdale will make available to the company up to £500,000 on a fee and interest free basis and it will be secured against the income from the sale of player announced on 2 January 2015. 'The directors of Rangers, having taken advice from their nominated adviser, WH Ireland plc, believe that the terms of the facility are fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned.' Rangers have promised a further announcement in relation to Sarver's interest in the club. 'There can be no certainty that an offer will be made, nor as to the terms on which an offer may be made,' said a statement. Dave King (centre) pictured at the Champions League clash between Liverpool and Real Madrid last year . It also pointed out that should he make bid, he 'will be required to clarify his intentions (by February 2).' A spokesman for Sandy and brother James Easdale, who has a seat on the plc board, declared the latest loan had been the only option for Rangers. Jack Irvine, an Easdale family adviser, said: 'Once again Sandy has stepped up to the plate with this half million pound loan from his own pocket. Whilst we welcomed the recent share purchases by Dave King and Douglas Park and his consortium, this unfortunately did not put any funds into the club. 'Sandy was the only option for this cash injection at such short notice. The Easdale family remain totally committed to achieving a satisfactory financial future for Rangers and they hope all parties can work together in the future with that common goal.'","Rangers have taken out a crisis loan from Sandy Easdale of £500,000 .

"Ched Evans's move to Oldham Athletic is set to collapse after manager Lee Johnson expressed grave reservations over signing the convicted rapist. The former Sheffield United striker, 26, was set to train with the Latics on Monday ahead of a press conference to announce his arrival at Boundary Park. However, Evans was not seen at the Chapel Road training ground and Sportsmail understands Latics boss Johnson has made known his concerns about going through with the controversial swoop. VIDEO Scroll down to watch fans discuss the potential signing of Ched Evans by Oldham .

A policeman is seen outside the training ground (left), while manager Lee Johnson gestures to his players . Oldham boss Johnson later spoke to reporters outside Boundary Park on Monday . Despite his own reservations, Johnson later publicly said that he will support whatever the decision taken by the board. He said: 'Very difficult circumstances for everyone, it's a board decision from now on. 'Very difficult situation, but of course we want what's best for the club and whatever the board decide, I'll support.' Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner, urged the club not to sign Evans. Lloyd  said: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club should not sign Ched Evans. 'Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract. 'All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence, but Ched Evans’ lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offence means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people.' Club sponsor Verlin said on Monday that it will terminate any involvement with Oldham should the club go through with the signing. Verling told Press Association Sport: 'The club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow Ched Evans to train we will be out of the door. 'We had a conversation with the club when they considered allowing Ched Evans to train with them six to eight weeks ago, and we were led to believe they had listened to the general input. 'But our sources have made it clear he will be training or signing for the club this week and it is not something we wish to be associated with.' Another Oldham sponsor, Mecca Bingo, also confirmed they would end their involvement with the club if Evans signed. The company tweeted: 'We can confirm will (sic) be ending our association with @OfficialOAFC if they sign Ched Evans.' Just hours after the news emerged on Sunday an online petition against the move became one of the fastest-growing ever and has attracted more than 24,000 signatures. More than one person per second signed the petition in the first thirty minutes after its launch. It is one of the quickest growing on change.org, according to i100.co.uk. Ex-Sheffield United striker Evans is without a club after being released from prison in October . An online petition has been started urging Oldham to not sign Evans and has received 24,000 signatures . Addressed to Simon Corney, the chairman of Oldham Athletic FC, the petition reads: 'We do believe he [Ched Evans] has the right to work. 'We believe that it does not have to be in a role where he influences views about sexual violence, and his presence on your pitch will do this.' Evans wants a return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011 but has protested his innocence. Senior officials at Oldham are understood to believe Evans' side of the story. They spoke to the player in late November but decided against making a move amid fears it would further tarnish the club's image following the signing of Lee Hughes in 2007. Hughes had served half of a six-year sentence for causing death by dangerous driving. Director Barry Owen, a former police officer instrumental in bringing Hughes to Oldham, is understood to have been heavily involved in the move for Evans. Since defeating Rochdale 3-0 on November 29 Oldham's season has suffered a dramatic downturn. Lee Johnson's side have lost four games in a row including a 4-0 home humbling by his dad's Yeovil Town and a 7-0 drubbing at MK Dons. Oldham offered Lee Hughes a way back into football in 2007 after he had served three years in prison . Hughes played for two years for Oldham, who are currently 14th in League One . Professional Footballer's Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon Taylor said there would be a press conference at an unnamed League One club to unveil Evans on Monday but Sportsmail understands those plans were put on hold on Sunday. Taylor told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme he would not be able to attend the press conference - an announcement that is thought to have disappointed Oldham officials who had hoped for his support. According to one board member of Trust Oldham, the official club supporters trust that has a stake in the club and even provides financial support that can extend to the payment of a player's wages, they have not been consulted about the possible recruitment of Evans. Ray Coverley told Sportsmail he knew nothing of Evans joining the club. Speaking personally and not on behalf of Trust Oldham, he did however argue that – having served his sentence for rape – Evans was entitled to return to work as a footballer. Maltese side Hibernians announced on Friday that they had offered Evans, who has had an investigation into his case by the Criminal Cases Review Commission fast-tracked, a deal but that move was blocked by the Ministry of Justice as Evans is not allowed to work abroad. He was initially given permission by Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of the PFA. But following a backlash from supporters, sponsors and patrons - with 160,000 people signing a petition opposing his return - the club retracted the offer. Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd, is calling on Oldham Athletic Football Club not to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Tony said: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club should not sign Ched Evans. 'Ched Evans is a convicted rapist and, whilst I strongly believe in the principle of rehabilitation, it will send out entirely the wrong message if they offer him a contract. 'All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence, but Ched Evans’ lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offence means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people.' Evans' attempts to return have so far been fruitless, with clubs turning down the chance to employ him .

"Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has revealed that Adnan Januzaj reminds him of Dutch legend Johan Cruyff. Despite the Scotsman's ill-fated tenure at Old Trafford, Moyes is credited with introducing the 19-year-old to the first team last season - when he made 35 appearances in all competitions and scored four goals before travelling to the 2014 World Cup with Belgium. Now manager of Real Sociedad, Moyes has been praising the youngster's talent and attitude since first beind impressed by him on United's 2013 pre-season tour. Adnan Januzaj's ability to run past people reminds David Moyes of Johan Cruyff, says David Moyes . Moyes is widely credited with bedding the 19-year-old into United's first team last seasonh . Speaking to FourFourTwo magazine, Moyes said: 'Some youngsters get overawed. Not Adnan. I realised that when he came to train with the first team soon after I joined. 'I decided to take him on tour with the first team within minutes of watching him. He wasn't timid but hungry to succeed. He was one of the tour's bright spots. 'He possesses a level of self-assured arrogance, which is a positive as he's not too arrogant. On the contrary, he's a bright lad who is mature for his age. 'He's a wonderfully gifted player with great balance and the ability to go past people. When I see his poise on the ball, he has characteristics of Johan Cruyff.' The Belgium international has seen his opportunities limited under Louis van Gaal this term . Januzaj takes the ball past Stoke's Erik Pieters (right) during a Premier League game on New Year's Day . By contrast, Januzaj  has started only four Premier League games under Louis van Gaal this season - leading to speculation that he could be tempted to find first team football elsewhere, with Paris Saint Germain the latest club expressing an interest in taking the starlet on loan. The French champions had a bid rejected for the young Belgium international last year and are keen to see if he will join on a temporary deal. Januzaj, who is also eligible to play in European competition, has interest from English clubs such as Everton and Hull while Inter Milan are also reportedly keen.

"Anyone who has witnessed the intensity of Wilfried Bony at close quarters will not be surprised that numerically he's been the most effective striker in the Premier League in 2014. But they might have been a little shocked to hear him say on Saturday that tallies do not always matter. ‘I really don’t care about statistics,’ he said in frustration after his 18th goal of the calendar year could only contribute to a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace. The wider context was a statement of the obvious that goals without wins mean less. But to underestimate how much goals and numbers mean to him would be a mistake. Wilfried Bony celebrates his goal against Crystal Palace at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . The Ivorian's strike made him the highest scorer in the Premier League this calendar year . Wilfried Bony - 18 . Sergio Aguero - 16 . Edin Dzeko - 14 . Yaya Toure - 14 . Daniel Sturridge - 13 . Wayne Rooney - 13 . In January of this year, when Sportsmail spent an hour with the Ivorian in a function room at the Liberty Stadium, he spelled out the point. The speech came in response to a question about the flawed public perception that Swansea’s £12million record signing that summer was an easy-going guy. 'I have to be in control,' he said. 'I must. It is very important.' At this point he brought his fist down against the table. 'I am a hard person - I am not an easy guy. I want always to be in control, everything I do in football and outside. 'At the end of the season I want to do this, after next season I want to do that. Goals, objectives. I know who can help me, who can't help me. The people who can help, from the beginning I talk to them - ""I want that and that - you have to help me. And if you help me, I help you"". 'I like to use my power. Wherever we go, in the disco or anywhere, I am always talking about this every day. 'I always tell my friends - Roland Lamah, (Wayne) Routledge, Jonathan de Guzman - if you have time to put in a cross do it because you know I am good with my head. You don't have to be in the box, give me the ball. Bony's strike past Julian Speroni was his 18th in the Premier League this calendar year . Bony, pictured scoring at Anfield last season, was the subject of interest from Liverpool this summer . VIDEO We are doing well - Monk . 'If I head the ball one time it can be a goal. I try to be there in the right place. If I am not there, it is my mistake. ‘Didier Drogba texts me to say, “Don't let anyone destroy your objectives”. My objective is 20 goals with Swansea this season, then the World Cup and in the future I want to play the Champions League. No one will destroy my objectives.’ So that is why goals matter to Bony. At the time of the interview he had 13, having struggled initially to get regular game time under Michael Laudrup, who had preferred other striking targets that summer. By the end of the season he had scored 25 and went to the World Cup. He has six goals already in this campaign. Will he get his move to the Champions League? That remains to be seen, but it would be naive to assume that the contract extension he signed last month signals an end to his ambitions. Bony left Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem in 2013 to join Swansea in a £12million move . Bony in action for Ivory Coast against Colombia at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Bony and his camp have been admirably and contentiously open about his intentions. Yes, he enjoys playing for Swansea in the Premier League and he will not agitate to leave as he did at Vitesse Arnhem before heading to South Wales. But if a big opportunity came along, it is understood that he would want to take it. At a time when answers are heavily scrutinised by supporters and media alike, it is risky for a player or associate to state what might sound like the obvious. But why should an Ivorian have an unbreakable bond with a club in South Wales? He likes the club, is happy there and is paid above the going rate for Swansea’s leading players. But those objectives he talks of will not be broken by a one-year extension to 2018, which was designed with the heavy objective of addressing the £19m buyout clause that would have landed a rival – most likely Liverpool – with a huge bargain. Sergio Aguero has scored 16 times in 2014 for Manchester City and helped them clinch the title . Yaya Toure scored his 14th goal of the calendar year during Manchester City's 3-0 win at Southampton . Edin Dzeko has scored 14 goals this calendar, including some key strikes in City's title challenge . As Swansea’s deal with Vitesse in 2013 included clauses of a further £1.75m, based on performances, it is safe to assume they might have only made a profit of £5.25m on such a revelatory signing. With extra security, Swansea can, in the event of an approach, expect a significant return for a proven goal scorer who only turns 26 later this month. The goals record of 30 in 75 games for Sparta Prague, 53 in 73 for Vitesse and 31 in 62 for Swansea would, quite conceivably, make him worth upwards of £30m. On the list of the 10 top scorers for 2014, he is the only player who finished last season in a club outside the top 10. Would his effectiveness and value go up in a bigger club? Daniel Sturridge has found the back of the net 13 times this year, but has struggled with injury problems . Wayne Rooney, who has scored 13 league goals in 2014, has found a new lease of life as United captain . Olivier Giroud has struggled with injury problems but scored 10 league goals in this calendar year . In that same interview, Bony detailed the resistance he faced from his father, a teacher, to his dream of being a footballer. He said: ‘He wanted me to continue in school. He paid for me to go to this school for a year but I said, ""I don't want that, I want to play football so don't pay anything"". 'He would say, ""Go to school and after that you can play. There are other people, like doctors, who play football"". ‘But I said, ""Dad, no. Everyone has a destiny"". He said, ""I understand that but this is your problem now"". Man, he went ******* crazy.’ Suffice to say, Bony was smart to keep his objectives. Cristiano Ronaldo - 33 . (Real Madrid) Lionel Messi - 30 . (Barcelona) Aritz Aduriz - 18 .

"Arsene Wenger is set to hand David Ospina the chance to stake his claim for Arsenal’s No 1 jersey this weekend following Wojciech Szczesny’s double blunder against Southampton. And Szczesny is facing a fresh fight to save his Gunners career with the club seeking a new goalkeeper for next season. Szczesny is expected to drop to the bench for Sunday’s FA Cup clash against Hull City, with Colombia international Ospina taking his place. And Ospina has the chance to replace Szczesny as first-choice keeper until at least the end of the campaign if he performs well, starting in the re-run of last season’s FA Cup final.

"Sepp Blatter has clinched crucial Asian support in his attempt to hold on to power despite the crisis enveloping Fifa over the World Cup anti-corruption probe. In a major blow to the FA and UEFA who want to see the back of Blatter and are pushing for change at the top, FIFA's veteran Swiss president has been given a massive boost in his attempt to fend off rivals and win a controversial fifth term next May. Sepp Blatter has clinched crucial Asian support in his attempt to hold on to power . Blatter was among the guests invited to Sunday's 60th anniversary of the Asian Football Confederation in Manila and in a letter to all 47 Asian federation presidents, AFC chief Salman bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa urged delegates to get behind him. 'President Blatter has proven to be a strong leader and a true supporters of Asian football,' Salman's letter, seen by the Mail on Sunday, said. 'I therefore ask you to join me in supporting the FIFa president and to carry on developing our prosperous collaboration in years to come.'

"Japan coach Javier Aguirre denied on Saturday any involvement in match-fixing in Spain and called for calm from the team's supporters during their Asian Cup defence. The Mexican was among 41 people named by Spain's anti-corruption prosecutor in court this month following a probe into Real Zaragoza's 2-1 win at Levante on the final day of the 2010-11 campaign. The victory ensured Zaragoza, coached by Aguirre, avoided relegation. Javier Aguirre has denied allegations linking him to suspected match fixing during the 2010-2011 season . The former Real Zaragoza manager said he has never taken part in anything 'unethical or unprofessional' The Japan Football Association has sent a delegation to Spain to conduct a probe into the case but said Aguirre will remain in charge for next month's Asian Cup in Australia. Speaking through a translator, Aguirre said he believed Spanish soccer was clean and the investigation would not impact Japan's preparations for the tournament. 'I worked in Spain for 12 years and I have never done anything unethical or unprofessional,' Aguirre told reporters at the JFA's headquarters in Tokyo on Saturday. 'I would like to tell our supporters to stay calm during this investigation. We need their support to take the Asian Cup title. The current Japan coach has asked for national fans to remain calm as they look to win the Asian Cup title . 'I will be concentrating and preparing for the Japan team to win the Asian Cup.' The 56-year-old Aguirre replaced Italian Alberto Zaccheroni, who stepped down after Japan were eliminated in the first round of this year's World Cup in Brazil. The prosecutor in Spain alleges the Levante players were paid a total of 965,000 euros to deliberately lose the game. 'I will be cooperating with the Spanish authorities and seeing this case through to the end,' Aguirre added.

"FA chairman Greg Dyke held surprise clear-the-air talks with FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich this week. The two are understood to have had a convivial private conversation for about 45 minutes at FIFA headquarters, where Dyke was attending a gathering of the governing body’s fair play and social responsibility committee. Greg Dyke had a private meeting with FIFA president Sepp Blatter in Zurich . Such a meeting had seemed highly unlikely. In June Blatter accused British media of ‘racism’ for demanding an investigation into allegations of corruption over Qatar’s 2022 World Cup bid. Dyke said the comments were ‘offensive and completely unacceptable’ and that the FIFA chief should ‘stop attacking the messenger’. Dyke has since made clear his distaste for FIFA and instead has concentrated on building relationships with UEFA — until Wednesday’s meeting instigated by Blatter’s UK advisor. Meanwhile, Jordan’s Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, FIFA vice-president for Asia, has emerged as a possible candidate to stand against Blatter for the presidency. UEFA, who want a credible rival to emerge from somewhere in the world, would certainly consider supporting an Asian bid. Roy Keane’s book-tour jibes about former players who propagate a Disney-style ‘Man United-land with f****** Mickey Mouse running around’ have been given extra mileage by former captain Bryan Robson. A paid Manchester United ambassador, Robson (right) is among the old boys Keane ridicules for their ‘propaganda’. Robson asked a Soccerex forum in Barbados: ‘Is it necessary? If you are going to come out with a book, why not talk about what you have done in the game, the good things, rather than criticise people when there is no need?’ But he conveniently ignored the fact that former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had been just as critical about Keane — and others — in his own best-sellers. Chairman Bruce Buck missed the end of Chelsea's 6-0 demolition of Maribor . When Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck failed to return after leaving the directors’ box during Tuesday’s Champions League match against Maribor, many suspected he had been summoned to arrange the exit of marginalised chief executive Ron Gourlay. In fact, Buck had prearranged to talk to Surrey Chambers of Commerce. In any case, Chelsea insist Gourlay made his own decision to leave, despite being due to represent the club at a conference in Moscow next month. Baker barb stings BT . BT Sport have paid the best part of £1billion for the Champions League next season. So they will not be impressed with Danny Baker, one of their star presenters, slating the tournament. Baker’s numerous tweets included: ‘Wouldn’t bother me so much if TV didn’t treat Champions League like some elite night. This bulls*** is just like the early rounds of FA Cup... It’s got like Eurovision where any nutcase can join in… Might as well let Sunderland into the precious CL next year.’ Wales’ reputation as a rugby-obsessed nation is not reflected in current ticket sales for the 2015 World Cup. Record demand has seen 23 out of 48 games sold out, but seats are still available for all eight matches at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium. Sport England’s upcoming £10million lottery-funded campaign to persuade more women to enjoy sport, revealed by Sports Agenda on Thursday, may seem excessive.

NFL cool Wembley fever . Hopes for an NFL franchise at Wembley have been raised, with departing FA general secretary Alex Horne calling it a priority and Chancellor George Osborne promising tax breaks. But the NFL will not be bounced into taking a permanent home at Wembley.

"Different year same old problems for Arsenal as 2015 opened amid the sort of defensive chaos which has become an unwelcome trademark of Arsene Wenger's team. Wojciech Szczesny was the chief culprit by the Solent, directly responsible for both goals, as Southampton strengthened their grip on a place in the top-four with a deserved victory. Szczesny abandoned his goal with a mindless charge for the first which was quite magnificently converted from a tight angle by Sadio Mane and, for the second, the keeper toed the ball straight to Dusan Tadic in another manic moment.

Ronald Koeman described Tadic's strike as a 'New Year gift' and, after conceding it, Szczesny reached for his water bottle and took a long swig, perhaps wishing it contained something stronger. 'It's unfortunate but I don't want to make too much of it today,' said Wenger, although he did confirm back-up keeper David Ospina would start in the FA Cup tie against Hull on Sunday. This had always been the plan, apparently. Szczesny might be grateful for the mental break from keeping goal behind a team which folded to surrender a three-goal lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League and again to concede a late equaliser at Liverpool last month. Alexis Sanchez, played up front in the absence of Danny Welbeck and Olivier Giroud, tries to escape the attentions of Steven Davis . Calum Chambers, deployed in a holding midfield role against his former club, tries to stop a cross from Ryan Bertrand . Francis Coquelin started in the Arsenal midfield for the second game in a row, and battles with Southampton's Vincent Wanyama . Injuries and instability have not helped but the mishaps at Southampton came with a first-choice back four in position - and the defeat could easily have been heavier. Graziano Pelle dominated Laurent Koscielny throughout the game. Twice Pelle hit the woodwork and was also thwarted by a goal-line clearance by Mathieu Debuchy after Tadic had intercepted an under-hit Koscielny back-pass which left Szczesny scrambling around on his hands and knees yet again. Southampton's midfield were too strong for Francis Coquelin and Calum Chambers, the inexperienced pair who did not perform badly but lacked the authority and confidence to convert possession into quick and efficient service for the front four. Arsenal offered very little beyond a 10-minute flurry at the end and the ever-impressive menace of Alexis Sanchez – and yet they had clear chances at key moments which might have changed the game's outcome. It was still goalless when Tomas Rosicky set up Santi Cazorla, who was unmarked in front of goal but unable to angle his effort away from Fraser Forster, who pushed it clear. Early in the second half, the Saints keeper made an even better save, low to his left, to deny Sanchez an equaliser. 'The defence was outstanding and Fraser made great saves,' purred Koeman, after reinforcing his team's unexpected position inside the top four. At the other end of the pitch, Szczesny's goal was under attack from the opening minutes when Pelle beat Koscielny in the air to reach a cross from Tadic and nod it against the post. Moments later, the big Italian striker outfoxed Koscielny again but his effort was blocked. Mathieu Debuchy beats Wanyama to the ball and puts a cross in but Arsenal failed to create many chances at St Mary's . Wanywama holds off Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during a first half that lacked quality with the exception of Mane's well-taken goal . Wojciech Szczesny storms out of his goal to confront Sadio Mane, before getting caught out of position for the Saints' first goal . Szczesny, whose rush of blood left Arsenal exposed for the goal, looks on as Per Mertesacker lies on the floor disappointed . This was Mathieu Debuchy’s first defeat in 13 games as an Arsenal player. Southampton took the lead 11 minutes before half-time. Mane displayed terrific pace and determination to evade Koscielny and win the race to a long pass from James Ward-Prowse, which had inexplicably also lured Szczesny out of his goal. From where he collected the pass, wide on the right, Mane checked the ball onto his left foot, ignored the calls from Pelle in the centre, and took aim with a curling shot which just evaded the outstretched leg of Per Mertesacker as he raced back towards his own goal. It was a delightful, precision finish, tarnished somewhat when Mane's right knee seemed to buckle under a mob of jubilant team-mates. The Senegal forward tried to continue but had to be replaced before half-time by Harrison Reed. 'He was in too much pain,' said Koeman. 'We had to change him but we don't know exactly what is wrong, or if he will be available for the Sunday in the FA Cup or for the Africa Cup of Nations for his country.' In the few minutes while playing on lame, Mane still managed to create a chance for Ward-Prowse to extend the lead, but Szczesny went some way towards making amends for his earlier mistake by blocking the low drive with his feet. The Southampton goalscorer had to go off soon after opening the scoring, picking up an injury in his celebration . Sanchez is crowded out as Tadic and Bertrand combine to tackle the Chile forward, who was frustrated by the home defence . Sanchez gets a shot away but Fraser Forster was equal to everything Arsenal could throw at him in the Southampton goal . The approach for Southampton's second was much like the first with a long pass into the channel between left back Kieran Gibbs and centre half Koscielny. It was delivered on this occasion by Victor Wanyama and expertly brought under control by Steven Davis, who then applied a second touch even better than his first by rolling an inviting low cross into the Arsenal goalmouth. Davis might as well have rolled a live grenade across the turf, the way panic descended. Debuchy cut out the cross but dropped the ball dead in front of goal and froze as Sczcesny blundered in, attempting to clear but only stabbing a pass to Tadic, who scored. Pelle hit the woodwork again, beating Koscielny at the near post to another fine cross from Ryan Bertrand on the left, and Ward-Prowse smashed the rebound over. Graziano Pelle holds off Chambers and Coquelin as Southampton extended their lead over the Gunners in the Premier League table . Debuchy clears acrobatically for the Gunners but the visitors were undone by defensive errors during the disappointing defeat . Debuchy then cleared off his own line before Arsenal summoned their too-little-too-late finish. Sanchez charged forward and drew a foul from Florin Gardos, which could easily have been interpreted by referee Craig Pawson as a denial of a clear goal-scoring opportunity. Gardos got lucky, took a yellow card and Sanchez glanced the top of the net from the free-kick. 'It was a definite red card,' said Wenger. 'Only the referee can explain why he did not give it.' This decision was not, however, the reason for Arsenal's fifth defeat of the Barclays Premier League campaign or the reason why they have ground to make up to extend their 17-year run in the Champions League. Tadic runs to the fans after scoring Southampton's second goal, which came after Szczesny had prodded the ball into his path . Sanchez's free kick, which landed on the roof of the net, was the closest Arsenal came to scoring in a really poor performance .","Sadio Mane finishes well after Wojciech Szczesny makes poor decision to charge out of his goal .

"The exodus of African and Asian players will accelerate this week with more than 30 expected to depart English clubs for major international tournaments. The Asia Cup in Australia begins on January 9 and the Africa Cup of Nations starts in Equatorial Guinea eight days later, with both competitions providing a route to the Confederations Cup in Russia in the summer of 2017. Manchester City are still involved in negotiations about precisely when Yaya Toure must be released. Yaya Toure will be a huge miss for Manchester City when he is released for international duty next month . Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing Seamus Coleman . Manuel Pellegrini claimed on Sunday that it was yet to be decided if the midfielder could play against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup on Sunday. Most African players are expected to leave before the weekend but clubs will be busily involved in similar talks. Newcastle would have liked to keep Papiss Cisse, Mehdi Abeid and Cheick Tiote until after the tricky FA Cup third-round tie at Leicester, for whom Nigel Pearson would prefer to have wide midfielders Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez available. It was among the reasons why the two Barclays Premier League teams agreed to play on Saturday when 16 top-flight clubs moved their third-round ties to offer players more recovery time after the fixtures on Thursday. Leicester’s flexibility was limited by the fact Leicester Tigers rugby team are at home to Bath on Sunday and police would not agree to both games on the same day. The question of Cisse’s availability will become irrelevant as he faces a violent conduct charge for throwing an elbow at Seamus Coleman which is likely to result in a ban. West Ham will be missing top scorer Diafra Sakho throughout January due to the Africa Cup of Nations . As well as his brother Yaya, Kolo Toure is also set to represent Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations . All clubs are subject to FIFA’s 14-day rule but some nations can be more accommodating than others with their big-name stars. There is no longer much bleating by club managers about losing players to a tournament which is clearly fixed in the international calendar, although the Africa Cup of Nations has been moved from Morocco, who pulled out after this year’s ebola crisis. West Ham will be among those who feel the pinch. Sam Allardyce will lose top scorer Diafra Sakho and midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate after the game at home to West Bromwich Albion on Thursday. They will not be available for the FA Cup tie at Everton next Tuesday, but Allardyce has been boosted by Cameroon’s decision to omit Alex Song from the squad. West Ham’s Guy Demel has retired from international football so is not in the provisional Ghana squad named by manager Avram Grant. Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto’o and Steven Pienaar are also in international retirement. Nabil Bentaleb - in action for Tottenham against Leicester on Boxing Day - will join up with the Algeria squad . Mile Jedinak put in a sterling performance for Crystal Palace as they secured a hard-earned point at QPR . Palace winger Yannick Bolasie won't be joining up with the Congo squad until his wife has given birth . John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Victor Wanyama (Kenya) and Stephane Sessegnon (Benin) are also not involved because their countries did not qualify. Hull’s Mo Diame has been ruled out by a knee injury. Tottenham, who play at Burnley in the FA Cup on Monday, will release Nabil Bentaleb after facing Chelsea on New Year’s Day and Swansea, who play League Two Tranmere on Saturday, will release Wilfried Bony after their game against QPR on Thursday. Ki Sung-yueng will also be available for Garry Monk against QPR before he joins the South Korea squad in Australia for the Asia Cup. Bolton’s Lee Chung-yong is also in the South Korea squad. Australia refused Crystal Palace’s request to keep captain Mile Jedinak until after their Aston Villa game on New Year’s Day. ‘They’re not necessarily pleased but they accept it,’ said Jedinak. At least Palace won’t lose winger Yannick Bolasie - who has said he won’t join up with Congo until after his wife has given birth. PREMIER LEAGUE: .

"Juventus have been told to stump up £16million if they want to sign Galatasaray playmaker Wesley Sneijder. According to Italian publication Tuttosport, the Serie A leaders are interested in a move for the Holland international as they look to strengthen their midfield options. The 30-year-old was linked with a move to Premier League outfit Southampton last month after looking for a move away from the Turkish club. Juventus will have to pay £16million if they want to sign Galatasaray's Wesley Sneijder, according to Italy's Tuttosport (left), while  L'Equipe lead with Grenoble's shock French Cup win over Ligue 1 leaders Marseille .

Real's 2-1 loss at rivals Valencia saw Carlo Ancelotti's side lose for the first time since August.

"Gianfranco Zola admitted his Serie A coaching debut was 'not one of the best starts' after his struggling Cagliari side were thrashed 5-0 by Palermo on Tuesday. Zola, an outstanding talent in his playing days, has previously coached West Ham United and Watford in England and was assistant coach of Italy's under-21 team, but this is his first venture into the topsy-turvy world of Serie A. 'It's not been one of the best starts. We expected a difficult match, but not that difficult,' Zola told reporters after a terrible afternoon in Sicily. Former West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola was making his managerial debut in Serie A . Palermo forward Paulo Dybala scores from the penalty spot during the Serie A clash in Sicily . 'We'll certainly learn from today's game and work hard to improve. Of course, in a situation like this, everything seems more difficult but there is no point in crying about this, we have to react.' Cagliari found themselves 2-0 down after 10 minutes as goals by Michel Morganella and Ezequiel Munoz got Palermo off to a flying start. Any hopes of a comeback ended when captain Daniele Conti was sent off before the half hour after picking up two needless yellow cards in eight minutes. 'We fell behind quickly, we reacted but after Conti's sending-off, the game changed again,' lamented Zola. Cagliari, who have not won any of their last nine league games, have 12 points, four adrift of Atalanta who are the lowest-placed team outside the drop zone after their 2-2 draw at Genoa. Former Chelsea forward Zola looks dejected as his side are crushed in his first game in charge . Dybala celebrates with Michel Morganella and Ezequiel Munoz after scoring against Cagliari . However, the 48-year-old said he did not regret taking the plunge in Serie A at the club where he ended his playing career. 'I live in England but I've found that Cagliari has the right conditions, there are good players in the squad and the club does things the right way,' he said. Zola had two seasons at West Ham, doing better than expected in the first, when the team played some bright football, but struggling in the second. He joined second tier Watford in July 2012 and led them to the promotion playoffs where they lost to Crystal Palace. He quit the club just over one year ago.","Gianfranco Zola suffered heavy loss in Serie A coaching debut .

"Arsene Wenger is considering turning to Alexis Sanchez to solve Arsenal's striker crisis again at Southampton on New Year's Day. As reported by Sportsmail on Wednesday, the Gunners manager has a selection dilemma up front with Olivier Giroud suspended and Danny Welbeck doubtful with a thigh problem. Welbeck continued to have treatment on Wednesday and looks set to miss the trip to St Mary's. Alexis Sanchez (right) may play centre forward against Southampton in the absence of Olivier Giroud (left) The Chilean, pictured in training on New Year's Eve, has been in fine form for the Gunners since his arrival . Out-of-favour Lukas Podolski is nursing a slight groin issue, which if aggravated could have consequences for his proposed loan switch to Inter Milan. Yaya Sanogo is suffering from a hamstring problem, though Theo Walcott is fit again but has only just returned from knee and groin issues that has resulted in the forward not starting a game for close to 12 months. And that has seen Wenger consider utilising summer signing Sanchez as his side's centre forward against the Saints on New Year's Day. Arsenal are currently struggling with injuries and suspensions in their front line ahead of New Year's Day . Joel Campbell may play a part against Southampton, but Sanchez is likely to be preferred in the centre . Wenger will make a late decision on his team selection on Thursday as he awaits news on his injured players. Joel Campbell is also being considered but the Chilean looks to be favourite to fill the striker void. Meanwhile, the Gunners are set to move for Atletico Madrid midfielder Mario Suarez on loan next month.

The Gunners are set to move for Atletico Madrid midfielder Mario Suarez (pictured) on loan next month . Wenger is on the look out for a holding central midfielder and the 27-year-old is emerging as an option for the Gunners. Suarez has fallen behind Gabi, Yiago, Raul Garcia and Saul Niguez in the midfield pecking order and could be available on loan until the end of the season. Wenger still has designs on signing Morgan Schneiderlin or William Carvalho for the defensive midfield role in the summer, but views Suarez as a suitable stop-gap until then.","Olivier Giroud is suspended, while Danny Welbeck is a doubt for Arsenal .

The 27-year-old had been lined up as a short-term option to replace Alex Song, who was expected to line up for Cameroon at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.

Allardyce has admitted that Reid has 'no future' at West Ham and expects the defender to leave when his contract ends in the summer.

"Former Everton forward Tim Cahill thinks he could continue playing for another four seasons into his 40th year - and admits a return to England may be on the cards. With his weight and body fat ratio unchanged since he was 17, Cahill said he would be looking for a two or three year contract when his deal with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls expires next year. The 35-year-old, in Australia to prepare for next month's Asian Cup, said he could yet return to the English Premier League, where he spent nine years with Everton before making the switch stateside. Tim Cahill (centre) interacts with fans during the launch of the Football Fan Park in Sydney on Saturday . Cahill poses with the Asian cup mascot Nutmeg at Sydney's Customs House during the weekend . 'The future's bright,' Cahill told the Australian Associated Press. 'I've got another year left on my New York Red Bulls contract. The main feeling for me is every time I'm at a club, I like to be there for a long time. 'To be totally honest, I could have gone back to the Premier League on loan after the World Cup and I decided to stay with Red Bulls for the remainder of the season and still (have) options to go back to the Premier League if it's the right one for me. 'So when you put everything into one, the decision I make will be a methodical one, like I've always made it. It will take a month or so but I think people will be quietly impressed with what I'm trying to do.' Veteran Socceroo Cahill interacts with fans during the launch of the Football Fan Park . Cahill signs an Australia shirt for a young fan in Sydney ahead of next month's Asian Cup . Playing for his country, for whom he has scored at the last three World Cup and 36 goals in total, remains a key factor in his considerations over where to play. 'I've gone to the MLS because that allows me to play internationally,' he added. 'The next decision that I make will still allow me to play internationally. I average 30 or 40 games every season since I was 17 years old and nothing's changed.' Cahill's importance to the Socceroos is borne out by the fact that he has been responsible for eight of the 12 goals Australia have scored since coach Ange Postecoglou took over in 2013. The host nation will be looking to Cahill for a good few more from January 9-31 as the Socceroos look to win Asia's biggest tournament for the first time at the third attempt.

"India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin frustrated Australia's push for victory on day five of the third test in Melbourne on Tuesday, but the draw was enough for the hosts to complete an emphatic 2-0 series win with a game in hand. With Australia needing seven wickets from the final session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, their bowlers could only manage three as Dhoni and Ashwin survived a nervous final hour to push India to safety. Australia have added left-arm spinner Ashton Agar to their squad for the fourth Test. Ryan Harris (centre) celebrates taking the wicket of in-form India batsman Virat Kohli (right) India's Ajinkya Rahane arches his back to evade a bouncer from Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson . Rahane (left) battled for 48 from 117 balls in the second innings while Kohli (right) scored 54 to go with his outstanding first innings knock of 169 . After withstanding an onslaught from the Aussie quicks Rahane was out pulling to Josh Hazlewood (right) India were 174 for six when Australia captain Steven Smith conceded the draw with four overs remaining, with Dhoni unbeaten on 24 and Ashwin on eight. The tourists were 210 short of their victory target. Australia declared on 318-9 at lunch, setting India 384 to win in 70 overs. For a time after lunch, that appeared more than adequate for the hosts, whose pacemen scythed through India's top order with three wickets in the first nine overs of their innings. Opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan was out lbw for a duck off Ryan Harris in the second over and Lokesh Rahul, surprisingly sent in at number three, was caught in the next over for one by Shane Watson who bolted back from the slips when the nervous debutant sent a top edge high from a poor pull shot. Smith dives spectacularly to the right to save a certain boundary after an edge from Cheteshwar Pujara . Australia's newly appointed captain Steven Smith called the match a draw with four overs remaining . Opener Murali Vijay was dismissed lbw for 11, somewhat harshly by umpire Kumar Dharmasena, off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood before Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane steadied to take the tourists to 104-3 at tea, 280 runs short of their victory target. Harris removed India's tenacious Kohli for 54 on the first ball after tea to open the door, but a stubborn Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara dug in for a valuable hour before Mitchell Johnson struck with 19 overs remaining to break the partnership. He rattled Pujara with a ball that struck him clean on the grill of his helmet, then bowled him two balls later with a slower delivery that jagged back viciously off the seam to have him out for 21. Harris appeals as he claims the LBW wicket of Shikhar Dhawan, the first India batsman to fall on day five . Mitchell Johnson (left) celebrates taking the wicket of Lokesh Rahul, surprisingly sent in at number three . Murali Vijay trudges off after being harshly adjudged LBW off the bowling of Josh Hazlewood for 11 . India fans show their support despite the chance of their team winning being a long shot . Perhaps unnerved by the loss of India's last specialist batsman, Rahane became jumpy, and nearly played on to his stumps off Watson the next ball. He was out a few overs later, throwing away his wicket for 48 with a horrible pull off Hazlewood that floated straight to Shaun Marsh at midwicket. Joining Dhoni at the wicket, number eight batsman Ashwin was nearly caught behind on one by Shane Watson who dived across from first slip but put down a sharp one-handed chance. Both batsmen survived a number of false shots but showed grit to play out the remaining overs. Australia may ponder the wisdom of their relatively late declaration, having already constructed a lead of 326 runs by stumps on day four, but were in no mood to hurry proceedings with only a draw needed to make the Sydney test starting on Jan. 6 a dead rubber.","Australia 530 and 318 for 9 draw with India 465 and 174 for 6 at the MCG .

'BCCI, while respecting the decision of MS Dhoni to retire from Test cricket, wishes to thank him for his enormous contribution to Test cricket and the laurels that he has brought to India.' Dhoni seems to have lost interest in Test cricket over the past few months, with the defeat in Australia preceded by a loss in England after being ahead in the series. He also lost to England in India in 2012, the first time his nation had lost a home Test series for eight years. India were, however, the No 1 Test side in the world for 18 months until 2011 (when they were thrashed 4-0 by England) and it statistics back up what a fine leader he was. His Test win percentage of 45 per cent is the highest of any Indian captain who led the side for at least five matches. And he hit the most runs by an Indian Test captain, 3,454. The great opener Sunil Gavaskar hit 3,449. His final innings was the 24 not out which salvaged a draw against Australia in Melbourne.

"Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be remembered as one of the most significant cricketers in history but his retirement from Test cricket on Tuesday may just be the boost the ultimate form of the game needs in its most influential country. Dhoni, who stepped down at the end of the drawn third Test in Melbourne, is hugely significant because he became the symbol of modern Indian cricket during the era when they emerged as the richest and most powerful of them all. Yet his decision to concentrate on limited-overs cricket is welcome because for the last three years at least he has been a negative, indifferent presence at the helm of a side he once led to the top of the Test rankings as well as a World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni retires from test cricket . MS Dhoni hits out on the final day of the drawn third Test with Australia after which he retired from Tests . Dhoni (left) smiles after surviving the final session of the Test at the MCG with Ravi Ashwin . Dhoni became the symbol of modern Indian cricket in the era they emerged as the sport's richest nation . It is no exaggeration to say that Dhoni’s attitude in England last summer was little short of a disgrace as a rare away Test victory at Lord’s was followed by the cricketing equivalent of throwing in the towel in three successive matches. Tests: 60 . Won: 27 . Lost: 18 . Drawn: 15 . Win rate: 45% . Yet as soon as white clothing was replaced by blue Dhoni sprang to life and again became the dynamic, swashbuckling batsman and captain who has become a God-like figure in his homeland. Perhaps we should not be surprised that Dhoni should prioritise the shorter game as it is one-day and Twenty20 cricket that has made him fabulously wealthy, with annual earnings of around $30million (£19.3m) a year. No-one has had a bigger workload than Dhoni in world cricket – he has played in a staggering 398 matches since the start of 2008 - and something had to give but that does not excuse the uninterested way he has led India. Dhoni shows innovation and skill with an agility testing sweep during the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne . Virat Kohli (right) will take over permanently from Dhoni as India skipper in the ultimate form of the game . Dhoni (fourth from right) shakes hands with the Australian players after Steven Smith conceded the draw . Tests 90 Runs 4876 . Highest Score 224 Average 38.09 . Hundreds 6 Fifties 33 . Catches 256 Stumpings 38 . Dhoni only survived the 4-0 thumpings by both England and Australia three years ago because of his close association with the discredited former India board president N Srinivasan but he should have gone after England’s 3-1 win. As it was he staggered on until his heir apparent Virat Kohli finally started to replicate his prolific one-day form in Test cricket, hitting three centuries against Australia in a series India trail 2-0 with one game to play. The gifted and feisty Kohli will take over for the dead rubber in Sydney in the new year and beyond and it is his style of leadership that provides hope that India may again treat Test cricket as seriously as they do the shorter stuff. Kohli will be positive, as he was when he stood in for Dhoni in Adelaide at the start of the series, and is likely to display none of the conservatism that marked his predecessor as one of the most unimaginative modern leaders. Dhoni (right) celebrates victory in the 2011 World Cup with Sachin Tendulkar (centre) and Yuvraj Singh (left) Dhoni watches a Kevin Pietersen ramp shot go over his head during a 2011 series in Kolkata . India will hope, though, that he can control a temper that has seen him clash with at least one Australian virtually every day of the current series, enhancing his reputation as one of the game’s biggest and most volatile sledgers. At least life will never be dull under Kohli, who will be as interesting in public as Dhoni was dull, as demonstrated when the new captain said he didn’t respect Mitchell Johnson because the fast bowler showed scant respect for him. Dhoni’s departure was typical of a man who has had little time for the media. He made no reference to his fate during the post-Test press conferences yet 15 minutes later a release confirmed that he would step down. There will be little of the criticism that Graeme Swann attracted when he retired mid-series because Dhoni is largely fawned upon in India and attracts the sort of adulation that is barely credible for cricketers outside his country. Virat Kohli is ideally poised to lead India in Test cricket and is unlikely to show the negativity of Dhoni . The ability of Kohli (right) with the bat is in no doubt, though his temper and discipline may be a worry . Kohli (centre) has hit three centuries in this series against Australia and stepped in for Dhoni in the first Test . A visit to his home town of Ranchi for a one-day international against England two years ago was to see extraordinary levels of devotion and attention, something that, to be fair, Dhoni has dealt with calmly and with dignity. Now, at 33, he will have more time to devote to his beloved motor bikes, his fascination with all things military and his support of Manchester United – he showed much more enthusiasm for India’s games of football during practice before each day’s play last summer than he did once he was out in the middle. But MS Dhoni will be around for some time yet in the one-day arena where he can be expected to make both a big impact and huge amounts of money. Yes, a significant cricketer but he was some way short of being a great one.","MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket after the drawn match against Australia .

Captain Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealander to hit 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year when he made a rapid 195 in the first innings in Christchurch. But he was not needed in the second as Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor knocked off the runs required once opening pair Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford had been dismissed. New Zealand's captain Brendon McCullum continued his rich Test scoring streak with 195 against Sri Lanka . That put the hosts 1-0 up in the two-match series to complete a remarkable year for the side and particularly McCullum, who hit 302 and 224 against India in February and 202 against Pakistan in Sharjah last month. With his century in Christchurch coming in 74 balls, he beat his own record for the fastest Test ton by a Kiwi. He was close to smashing the record for the fastest double ton by any player when he was caught trying to hit his 134th ball for six. West Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul at the crease during their Test match against South Africa . West Indies are toiling in the first Test against South Africa in Port Elizabeth after losing seven wickets for only 44 runs. They are 275 for nine in their first innings at the end of the fourth day, still 142 runs behind — despite Kraigg Brathwaite and Marlon Samuels both hitting centuries. Morne Morkel had four for 69 when play was ended by rain, which could prove to be the Windies’ saviour. At the end of day four in Melbourne Australia moved 326 runs ahead of India, with three wickets remaining in their second innings. Chris Rogers scored 69 and Shaun Marsh was unbeaten on 62.

"India will face a steep run chase to stay alive in their Test series with Australia after the hosts piled on the runs  in Melbourne. After conceding a first-innings deficit of 65, India were unable to rip through Australia's batting order second time around and the Baggy Green closed day four on 261 for seven, a lead of 326. Even that could prove to be beyond an Indian side which has folded under pressure already on this tour and, if that proves to be the case again, the series - which they trail 2-0 with one Test left - will be gone. Chris Rogers fired 69 for Australia as the hosts asserted their dominance over India in the third test . Shaun Marsh also made a useful 62 and finished unbeaten at the end of day four in Melbourne . Chris Rogers and Shaun Marsh kept them at bay on Monday, scoring 69 and 62 not out respectively, and if the latter adds some quick runs on Tuesday, India could end up chasing closer to 400. Resuming themselves on 462 for eight, they did not hang around long before being all out, Mitchell Johnson taking the quick wickets of Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav. Australia's lead gave them some comfort but, considering the way Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane batted first time out for India, they knew they needed to amass a more sizeable advantage. David Warner and Rogers set about doing that, the former making 40 before he went leg before to Ravichandran Ashwin. Shane Watson went in and added 17 until he nicked Ishant Sharma behind, while captain Steve Smith - with three hundreds in a row - made just 14. Ishant Sharma (second left) celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Joe Burns (second right) Off-break bowler Ravichandran Ashwin (centre) dismissed opening batsman David Warner for lbw for 40 . Rogers continued along and got his 50 off 81 balls but when he went leg before to Ashwin, and debutant Joe Burns followed for nine, Australia were teetering on 176 for five and with a lead of 241. Marsh was at hand and started to tick over, although Brad Haddin failed to stick with him, Yadav having him taken behind for 13. But Mitchell Johnson hung around for 15 and when he went to Shami, Ryan Harris made an unbeaten eight to give Marsh company as he looked to build on his 112-ball half-century.","Chris Rogers and Shaun Marsh spearhead Australia's second innings .

"A four-year-old Israeli boy has been killed by rocket fire from Gaza today - the fourth Israeli civilian to be killed in the latest round of the conflict. The boy died just before sundown in the village of Nahal Oz near the Gaza border after the rocket struck a kibbutz - or communal farm - where he lived. Charred vehicles were seen where the shell landed. The latest death in the conflict prompted harsh words from Israeli prime minister Bejamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Hamas would pay a 'heavy price' for the attack. Scroll down for video . Mortar strike: The boy was killed by a shell fired from Gaza into a Kibbutz (communal farm) not far from the border . Emergency: The boy is the fourth Israeli civilian to die in the conflict . Blasts: Explosions were seen in Gaza today as Israeli shelling continued in the wake of the boy's death . Blasts: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore Hamas would pay a 'heavy price' for the latest Israeli death . It came as violence in Gaza itself intensified, with Hamas killing 18 people whom it described as Israeli spies. Six of the alleged informants were lined up behind a mosque and shot dead after midday prayers. The . Hamas-run website Al Rai suggested the killings were in retaliation for the deaths of three high-ranking military leaders killed in an Israeli air strike yesterday. It portrayed the killings as the . beginning of a new crackdown, under the rallying cry of 'choking the . necks of the collaborators.' The executions came as Israeli rescue officials said a four-year-old boy was killed in a mortar attack near the border with the Gaza Strip. Six of the alleged spies were grabbed from among hundreds of worshippers leaving the city's largest mosque, by men in the uniform of Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades. One of the masked men shouted: 'This is the final moment of the Zionist enemy collaborators' then the gunmen sprayed them with bullets. Rounded up: Hamas fighters grab Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel before executing them in apparent revenge for the deaths of three of leaders . On death row: The victims, their heads covered and hands tied, were shot dead by masked gunmen in front of a crowd of worshippers outside a mosque after prayers . Accused: Another 11 people suspected of collaborating with Israel were killed by gunmen at an abandoned police station in Gaza, Hamas security officials said . Revenge: Hamas media portrayed the killings as the beginning of a new crackdown, under the rallying cry of 'choking the necks of the collaborators' Earlier, another witness saw 11 people . shot dead in a square near the remains of Gaza police headquarters, . which had been bombed by Israeli warplanes. An 18th person was shot in front of bystanders in a separate incident nearby. Two . of those killed were women, according to the Palestinian Center for . Human Rights, which called for an immediate halt to what it said were . 'extra-judicial executions.' A Gaza security official said the suspected informants were killed after they had previously been sentenced by Gaza courts. Al Rai, however, said they were killed after the completion of 'legal procedures', suggesting a hastily arranged hearing. Death sentence: Another witness saw 11 people shot dead in a square near the remains of Gaza police headquarters, which had been bombed by Israeli warplanes . Public executions: Palestinians watch as Hamas militants shoot dead Gazans suspected of collaborating with Israel after rounding them up in broad daylight . Suspects: Palestinian medics carry the body of an alleged collaborator with Israel as another corpse lies in the ambulance after they were executed in Gaza City . The . killings marked the third time since the outbreak of the Gaza war six . weeks ago that Hamas has announced the killing of alleged collaborators. On Thursday, it said seven people had been arrested and that three of them had been killed on suspicion of working with Israel. In pinpointing the whereabouts of the Hamas commanders, Israel likely relied to some extent on local informers. Israel . has maintained a network of informers despite its withdrawal from Gaza . in 2005, at times using blackmail or the lure of exit permits to win . co-operation.

Meanwhile, a rocket fired from Gaza hit a synagogue in the Israeli city of Ashdod on Friday, wounding three people, police said. 'There is damage at the scene and a number of people were injured by shrapnel,' police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The attack came shortly before evening prayers ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. Ashdod is around 30 km (20 miles) from Gaza. Earlier, an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza farm killed two Palestinians today, a Gaza health official said, as fighting continued for a third day after the collapse of Egyptian-led cease-fire talks. The renewed exchanges have dashed hopes for a lasting truce after a month-long war that has already killed over 2,000 people. By . mid morning Friday, Israel had launched about 20 airstrikes at Gaza, . while Gaza militants fired two rockets at Israel, the Israeli military . said. Earlier this week, . Hamas rejected an Egyptian truce proposal under which Israel would . gradually ease its blockade of Gaza, without giving specific . commitments.

Yesterday, thousands of Palestinians marched . through Gaza today firing guns, waving flags of different militant . groups and chanting religious slogans in a funeral procession for the three leaders. The . bodies of Mohammed Abu Shamaleh, Mohammed Barhoum and Raed al-Attar . were carried aloft through the crowd on stretchers wrapped in green . Hamas flag before being buried in a cemetery.

Incoming: Smoke trails rise above Gaza from rockets being being fired by Palestinian militants towards Israel . Since . Israel-Hamas fighting erupted on July 8, at least 2,086 Palestinians . were killed, according to Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra. Nearly a quarter of the dead - 469 - are children, according to the top UNICEF field officer in Gaza, Pernilla Ironside. Of . the more than 10,400 Palestinians wounded, nearly a third are children, . according to UNICEF figures, while some 100,000 Gazans have been left . homeless. Responding . to their deaths, senior Hamas political leader Ismail . Haniyeh said late Thursday that his group would not budge from its . demands. 'We will not . accept anything less than an end to the (Israeli) aggression and an end . to the blockade,' Haniyeh said in a statement posted by the . Hamas-affiliated Al Rai news service.

One of Friday's airstrikes hit a livestock farm where two workers were killed, al-Kidra said. Three Palestinains were wounded in that strike. The Israeli military said its strikes targeted concealed rocket launchers and weapons sites.

Two Palestinian women and a nine-year-old girl (pictured) arrived at the clinic in Westerstede, Germany, for free emergency treatment as part of an initiative by the Palestinian surgeon Muneer Deeb . Israel said the three Hamas senior figures killed on Thursday had played a key role in expanding the militants' military capabilities in recent years, including digging attack tunnels leading to Israel, training fighters and smuggling weapons to Gaza. One of the trio also played a role in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit in 2006. After being held captive in Gaza for more than five years, Schalit was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011. Israel says the Gaza blockade is needed to prevent Hamas and other militant groups from getting weapons. The restrictions prevent most Gazans from traveling outside the crowded coastal strip and bar most exports.","The boy was killed when the shell fired from Gaza struck a kibbutz - communal farm - in Nahal Oz near the border .

"Louis van Gaal has told Manchester United fans 2015 will be a year to remember - for all the right reasons. As United head into the New Year their supporters will reflect on a roller-coaster 12-month period that has seen them hit more lows than highs. For the first time in 28 years, the club fired their manager. David Moyes' six-year contract was ripped up after just 10 months and United went on to finish seventh in the Barclays Premier League. Van Gaal gives a wry smile as he speaks to the press at United's Aon Training Complex on Tuesday . The board turned to Van Gaal to revive the club's fortunes, and the early signs were not good as United won just one of their opening six games and crashed out of the Capital One Cup to Sky Bet League One side MK Dons. The Dutchman has slowly started turning things round though and at the half way stage United are third in the table following a run of seven wins and two draws in their last nine matches. Van Gaal strives for perfection though so he is not happy with United's current plight and is hoping there will be a better year ahead for the club's fans. Van Gaal has stabilised the Manchester United side alongside Ryan Giggs as they seek a strong 2015 . Manchester United have climbed up the table after a torrid start to the Premier League season . 'We are improving every week and we shall be better in 2015. Just watch,' the United manager said. 'We are still in a process. I think the players understand the philosophy, and that's why we are improving - but we can improve more when we have all the players available. 'I think the fans were fantastic because we were in a moment with 10 matches and 13 points - that is not good, I think more weak than good. 'They have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team. Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris makes himself big to deny Robin van Persie during the goalless draw last weekend . 'We were not always ahead in matches but they have fought to the end and a lot of times with good success, so I think we can be satisfied about the points now - 36. 'We are in our goal, I think. What I have already said, we are improving every week. We can see 2015 with open eyes.' After almost six months in the job, Van Gaal is now settled in Manchester. 'English life is fantastic,' the Dutchman said with a smile. 'I have met only friendly people on the streets and in the restaurants where I go. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal speaks during a press conference on Tuesday . 'I have very nice neighbours; they are all older than me but very nice. I live in a surrounding environment [that is] fantastic.' And the 63-year-old has even found a local eatery that suits his palate in Manchester city centre. He said: 'My favourite food is Chinese food, and the restaurant is Wing's. 'The food is fantastic because when I came to England everybody said the food is not good, but [it is] fantastic. Also, the wine list is fantastic.' Van Gaal's first assignment of 2015 is to stretch United's unbeaten run to 10 games at Stoke on New Year's Day. Club record signing Angel di Maria could feature against Stoke on New Year's Day . Van Gaal has made his anger clear at fixture planners for organising United's game at Tottenham less than 48 hours after their Boxing Day victory over Newcastle. As a result, the 63-year-old is expected to rotate his team for the match at the Britannia Stadium. Luke Shaw and Rafael could start after suffering no reaction when they made their injury comeback at White Hart Lane last Sunday. Adnan Januzaj, Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria are back in training and could feature, but Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Marouane Fellaini are likely to miss out. United have only lost once in 20 years at the Britannia Stadium, but Mark Hughes' team have won their last two games and Van Gaal is bracing himself for a tough test, partly because of the 'difficult' surface he expects to find at the Potters' ground. 'I hear from (assistant manager) Ryan [Giggs] that Stoke City is a very difficult pitch,' Van Gaal said.","The Dutchman feels settled into life at Manchester after six months .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes English football’s tradition of playing back to back games over Christmas and New Year is in danger of damaging the image of the Barclays Premier League. Van Gaal’s United team looked like a team badly in need of a rest as they struggled to break down Tottenham on Sunday and are now preparing for vital games at Stoke City on New Year’s Day and in the FA Cup at Yeovil on Sunday. The Dutch veteran understands that his rivals at the top end of the Premier League have the same problems but claimed on Tuesday that the English way has a direct and negative impact on the football that is shown all around the world at this time of year.

'Therefore, there is a rule at UEFA and FIFA that you cannot play the games so close. Okay, that I have said. 'That’s scientifically proven, I have said that also. 'Everybody knows that and in spite of that, we have to play. 'It’s the culture of England. I don’t mind but it is not good for the players, for the health of the players and what I say now is it is not good for the game because I think that the FA, but also the fans, want attractive games. 'But it doesn’t happen. 'You have seen the second half at Tottenham. You have seen the second half of Chelsea against Southampton. 'The football was not good.” With United encouraged by the fact that neither Chelsea or Manchester City managed to better their own draw at the weekend, Van Gaal believes there is better to come for his improving team. Van Gaal gives a wry smile as he speaks to the press at United's Aon Training Complex on Tuesday . Key players such as Anders Herrera and Angel di Maria are not yet ready to return but defenders Chris Smalling, Rafael da Silva and Luke Shaw are available for starting berths now.

"If West Ham really are serious top-four contenders, Sunday’s game against Arsenal will determine just how far they can go. The Hammers spent Christmas Day in dreamland; fourth in the Premier League for the first time ever and their highest league position during the festive period since 1985, when they memorably went on to finish third with Messrs McAvennie, Cottee and Co. But on Boxing Day they crash landed and dropped to fifth in the table behind Southampton after champions-elect Chelsea cruised to a comfortable victory. James Tomkins has said that the hectic festive fixtures will give a good indication of West Ham's ability . Tomkins competes for a headed ball with Swansea's Icelandic attacking midfielder Gylfi Sugurdsson . James Tomkins was missing at Stamford Bridge with a slight hamstring problem. But the 25-year-old is battling to be fit for the London derby at Upton Park, for what will be his 200th appearance for the club he has proudly played for since the age of eight. Win against Arsenal and local Basildon boy Tomkins insists the result will go a long way to underlining West Ham’s European credentials. Yet if they lose, there’s a danger they could fall by the wayside. ‘The league doesn’t really lie and I think the performances that we’ve put on against the top teams have been exceptional like against Manchester City and Liverpool,’ he says. ‘But this Christmas period is important and you’re going to see some teams fall by the wayside. ‘That just goes to show how important the squad is, especially at this time of year because you will pick up injuries and suspensions. ‘I’ve been here since I was eight-years-old and, in a way, it’s like a dream because West Ham are not really meant to be up there - or so some people say. But we’ve got a very good team and we expect a lot from ourselves. We deserve to be there though. Then again, I don’t think we expected to be where are to be honest with you. Sportsmail's Matt Lawless (left) talks to the 25-year-old defender ahead of the Hammers' clash with Arsenal . Tomkins celebrates with former Newcastle striker Andy Carroll after the latter scored against Swansea City . ‘The position of where we are in the league has been great. It’s probably been the best in the league since I started playing here but also the performances. They’ve been some of the best we’ve played as a team and as individuals. ‘If we keep heading in the way that we are at the moment then obviously we need to have that ambition to push for Europe.’ European football is not the only ambition for Tomkins. He’s desperate the play for England, completing an international journey that has seen him represent his country at every age level - and for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics - bar the senior squad. His form this season has been outstanding. He scored his first goal in over two years against West Brom earlier this month and Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson must now be an admirer. But Tomkins knows he must continue to help West Ham perform above expectations in the league if he is to stand any chance. Sunday’s potential duel with Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez represents the perfect opportunity for him. And as an aficionado of the beautiful game - he’s an avid viewer of La Liga and all things football - Tomkins is under no illusions about the task ahead. ‘It would be nice to one day get that call-up but one thing’s for sure, you need to keep playing well for your club,’ he says. The central defender scored his first goal in over two years against West Brom in early December . The 25-year-old's Hammers team-mates gather round to congratulate him after his goal against the Baggies . ‘I’ve seen Arsenal play quite a lot this season and I like to watch Spanish football so, I’ve seen Sanchez play for Barcelona and know what he’s about. He’s a proven player but has come and shown that in this league, which isn’t always easy to do. ‘But you can’t just focus on one man’s attributes because Arsenal have quality all over the team. We’re fully aware of how they are and it’s a matter of not worrying too much about them and focus on ourselves. You have to focus our your performances on the pitch and that’s what we have done so far this season and the results have been unbelievable. ‘I’m 25 now but I feel I am still learning, experience-wise. I feel that the more games I’ve played, the better I’m getting. I’ve been having a good run in the team at the moment and it’s been nice to get some momentum going into each game.’ Fifth or fourth in the league, it still remains a major fillip for manager Sam Allardyce who this time last year faced strong calls from supporters to be sacked. And in light of the criticism Sunday’s opposing manager Arsene Wenger has endured this season, Tomkins is quick to identify West Ham’s incredible rise up the table as proof to why clubs must stand by their manager - although he is still keen to crank up the pressure. ‘Arsenal have conceded goals more than should be doing for a team of that calibre and that’s where we can hurt them because we’ve got goals in abundance. Sam Allardyce faced heavy criticism at points last season but has won over the disgruntled supporters . The full interview with Tomkins can be read in the matchday programme (left), available online for £3.50 . ‘But sometimes you can see managers come and go too quickly. ‘There’s been cases where there are two or three managers at some clubs in a year and that’s far too many. They need time to settle in. ‘Arsenal fans, just like any other fans, expect a lot from their team and expect trophies and to win games. Wenger’s done a great job there and I don’t think that will ever be forgotten. So it’s nice to see a team put their faith into their manager. He’s been the longest-serving manager in the Premier League. ‘When a manager’s doing all that he can and it’s up to the players on the pitch to show what they can do. ‘With the bigger clubs that can be difficult because the expectations are higher. With ourselves, it’s nice that the owners showed their faith in the Gaffer, because look at what he’s done and what we’ve achieved so far this season.’ It’s not over yet and Tomkins knows it. But if it has anything to do with him, West Ham will be marching on a European tour next year.

"Sam Allardyce claims Arsene Wenger is the ultimate manager as he prepares to take on Arsenal on Sunday. The West Ham manager has the greatest respect for Wenger, who oversaw Arsenal’s move to the Emirates Stadium without sacrificing Champions League football. Allardyce, planning for West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, said: ‘He’s been manager, accountant and financial director, there is no doubt about that. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats for West Ham vs Arsenal . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has come out in praise of Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Allardyce said Wenger had to be much more than just a manager during the move to the Emirates Stadium . ‘The man set out a fantastic team before they decided to move and then built a couple of brilliant young teams based on the fact that the same amount of finance didn’t appear to be available to him. ‘Now he has almost got the Emirates paid off. That’s his achievement and it is a massive factor considering it was a massive investment for them [Arsenal].’ Allardyce added: ‘The one thing we have got to our advantage is that we don’t have to pay £450 million for our new stadium, which is the best bit of business ever done in football by a set of owners.’ West Ham dropped to fifth in the Premier League after their 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on Boxing Day, but Allardyce insists Arsenal will not relish visiting Upton Park. ‘We have turned it into a real fortress again and I hope that is going to be the case against Arsenal,’ he said.

"Less than half an hour after the final whistle, Chelsea’s assistant first team coach Steve Holland was overseeing an impromptu training session on the playing surface at Stamford Bridge. ‘The players had two training sessions scheduled for Saturday, but they were crying so much in the dressing room I’ve decided to make a change,’ revealed Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. This is the reward for success, an extra hour or two with the kids at their homes in lead Cobham before the make their way into the training centre to prepare for Sunday’s clash with Southampton. John Terry fires Chelsea ahead early in the game against West Ham . Chelsea are programmed to win football matches and Mourinho is behind the software. He is football’s equivalent of Steve Jobs. The hardware is out on the pitch, with John Terry, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa in a four-way battle for the club’s player of the year award. Terry is very much the spare man these days, passing over the man-marking duties to his central defensive partner Gary Cahill. On Friday, in this piercing victory over four-placed - but one-paced West Ham team - they delivered towering performances for the leaders. Nemanja Matic played a key role for Chelsea as they maintained their lead at the . Terry, without a goal in the Barclays Premier League in his previous 37 matches before Monday’s trip to the Britannia, has now scored in two successive matches. This is a vintage Terry year. Matic has come on strong, the protective cloak in front of the back four. He snarls, he bites and he won the tackles that mattered against Kevin Nolan, Cheikhou Kouyate and Mark Noble. Then there is Fabregas, entering Toni Kroos’ exclusive club by taking 142 touches on the ball and sending 103 passes into the path of his willing team-mates. He makes this team tick. Costa, who looked like a man playing with two left foots on his feet in the first half, dutifully scored his 13th goal in the league since his arrival from Atletico Madrid in the second half. Cesc Fabregas was influential in the centre of midfield for Chelsea . To put that into context it took Fernando Torres 62 games in a Chelsea shirt to reach that number. Costa is a goal-muncher. Everybody is buying in to the team ethic and there was only a smidgen of frustration when the subdued figure of Oscar was substituted in the 82nd minute. So what has changed in the make-up of this team? ‘We are much better when we have the ball and although we were strong defensively last year, with good organisation, we lacked a bit of creativity,’ admitted Mourinho. ‘The challenge this season was to bring the creativity and dynamic without losing the defensive qualities. Diego Costa was on the scoresheet again for Chelsea in another impressive display . ‘At the beginning of the season there was a bit of conflict between these ideas and we made defensive mistakes, like the three goals at Everton. ‘Now the team is happy to have the ball. We are a very good team.’ The only problem they have is the inevitable fixture congestion that will come with so much success, but Mourinho has yet to confront these issues. In time, he is sure to. He has accepted the Christmas schedule, but there are further tests ahead with the FA Cup, a two-legged Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool and the Champions League clashes with Paris St Germain. ‘My players are human, but the point is that every match for us is fundamental,’ added Mourinho. Chelsea’s manager was certainly pleased with this one, making a cut-throat gesture in Sam Allardyce’s direction a minute or so before Michael Oliver blew for time. When they play like this, they can finish off whatever team they want.","Chelsea beat London rivals West Ham 2-0 at Stamford Bridge .

"London Welsh captain Tom May and Irish replacement Dan Leo were sent off as Welsh went down to their 11th league defeat. May lashed out with a swinging elbow and though Leo initially appeared to be defending himself, having grappled May to the floor he punched the opposition centre. Welsh head coach Justin Burnell was frustrated that a game which was close for a long time slid away from his side in the second half. Referee Greg Garner shows a red card to London Welsh's Tom May and London Irish's Daniel Leo (2nd right) Welsh captain May was sent off for a swinging elbow on Leo, and Leo was marched for retaliating . He said: ‘We are bitterly disappointed because at certain stages, I thought we could win. We were in contention at half-time and at 17-9 down midway through the second half we were still well in the game.’ Welsh battled harder than in recent weeks but tries from Tom Court, Geoff Cross and Alex Lewington rewarded a dominant Irish pack. Tom Homer converted all three and kicked a penalty, with three penalties from Will Robinson being the only response from the visitors. Alex Lewington crosses for the first of Irish's three tries in their victory over the wooden spoon favourites . Such was the dominance of the home eight that they should have picked up a bonus point, which their director of rugby, Brian Smith, accepted. He said: ‘I am relieved but I have mixed emotions as with 10 minutes left I thought we could have squeezed out a bonus point. The win was obtained purely on the back of our forwards but you could see how difficult conditions were as it was raining heavily and the pitch was very slippy.’ The major talking point was the double dismissal of May and Leo in the 34th minute. Burnell said: ‘We saw the incident involving (Northampton hooker) Dylan Hartley last week and there is obviously a similarity for the referee to consider. ‘Tom is distraught as it’s probably the first time in his career that he’s been dismissed and he feels he’s let his team-mates down.’ Piri Weepu offloads for Welsh as they slumped to an 11th Premiership defeat . Smith also alluded to the Hartley incident, saying: ‘It certainly shone a light so the match officials had to make a call based on that. As a result the offence became topical but the issuing of cards needs to be proportional. Dan is very upset and not a thug so we will be strongly defending our boy as we believe he may have been hard done by.’ The first Irish try came after 29 minutes when a chip ahead by Shane Geraghty should have been dealt with by the visitors’ defence but a favourable bounce saw Fergus Mulchrone collect to send in Lewington. Irish players celebrate a try claimed by Geoff Cross in their Aviva Premiership win over Welsh . Robinson kicked his second penalty for Welsh but the hosts looked to have extended their lead when another chip from Geraghty was pounced upon by Topsy Ojo for the wing to touch down. However, the replay showed Ojo to have been just in front of the kicker so the TMO ruled no try, leaving Irish with a 10-6 lead at the interval. The Irish pack continued to dominate after the break and were rewarded when prop Cross forced his way over from close range. Robinson kicked his third penalty to make it 17-9 at the end of the third quarter but Irish clinched victory when Court finished off a line-out drive to ensure Welsh remain winless and slipping ever closer to relegation.","London Welsh's Tom May sent off for a swinging elbow on Dan Leo .

Meanwhile, winger Lavezzi and midfielder Rabiot are frustrated at a lack of first-team football and Cavani is not happy at playing wide to accommodate Ibrahimovic.

"Yohan Cabaye ensured Zlatan Ibrahimovic was able to get one over on his old boss Roberto Mancini in the Qatar Winter Tour match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan. The French midfielder calmly slotted home in the 57th minute to give PSG a deserved 1-0 victory at Le Grand Stade in Marrakech, Morocco, on Tuesday night.

Subs not used: Berni, Jonathan, Obi, Palazzi . Having enjoyed success by winning Serie A titles under the stewardship of Mancini during the Italian's first reign at the San Siro, Ibrahimovic proved a thorn in his ex-mentor's side. After a dour opening 25 minutes, the talismanic forward tested Samir Handanovic by sliding in to connect with a low cross - but the Slovenian stopper was equal to it. That effort sprung Paris into life, and it was Adrien Rabiot who next sent an effort goalwards. The midfielder's strike, from 20 yards, was once again parried by Handanovic, however. And Inter themselves finally conjured a chance of note in the 43rd minute, when Zdravko Kuzmanovic slid a delicious ball through to release Mauro Icardi. Icardi then tried to delicately chip Nicolas Douchez in the PSG goal, but he could only find the side netting.

That miss would prove costly as PSG came out far the better side after the break.

CLICK HERE to read the full match report by Sportsmail's Chris Waugh. Host commentator . That concludes tonight's friendlies. Thank you for following all the action live on Sportsmail. Goodbye. The referee brings a close to the friendly. In truth it was a rather lackluster affair and both sides will be pleased that they come away from the match without any injuries. We're into injury time... 88 mins: Just two minutes remain and it seems PSG will hold to a narrow win. Ibrahima Mbaye comes close to levelling the scores but his header is well saved by Douchez. 82 mins: It may take a long-range shot to get Inter back into this and they nearly do so through Andrea Palazzi's swerving effort. Unfortunately for the youngster his shot flies just wide of the post. 80 mins: There are just 10 minutes remaining. Inter are starting to push for an equaliser but the French side are still looking relatively comfortable in defence. 72 mins: Less than 20 minutes are remaining in this friendly and Inter look short of ideas at present as PSG dominate. Can Mancini do anything to change the outcome of the match? 67 mins: On chances created it should be 4-1 to PSG after they squander another opportunity. Van der Wiel again marauds down the right-flank and picks out Rabiot but he he can only blaze a shot high and wide from eight-yards out. 63 mins: Cabaye's goal has given PSG real confidence. they're knocking the ball about with confidence now. Explosive winger Lucas Moura is now on the pitch too - just to make things harder for Inter. 57 mins: AT LAST THE DEADLOCK IS BROKEN! It wasn't a moment of magic, as predcited, but a well-worked goal nonetheless. Van der Wiel drives in a low cross down the right-hand flank which just evades the onrushing Matuidi. Following up though is Yohan Cabaye who sidefoots the cross with precision into the bottom corner. Will this spark a goalfest? 53 mins: Despite the early second half chance the match has fallen back into the same pattern as the first. At the moment it looks like a moment of genius will be needed to separate the two team teams. 46 mins: Once again they nearly do. Lucas Digne whips in a delightful early ball into the path of Ibrahimovic who's first time side-foot is denied brilliantly by Handanovic. The forward will be pleased to see the commanding goalkeeper replaced just moments later as both sides make changes. Both teams have emerged for the second half and PSG get the second half started. Will the fans in Morocco see a goal? The referee brings an end to first half proceedings here in Morocco. In truth it's been a rather dull affair with both sides creating little chances. Will there be a breakthrough in the second half? 45 mins: Serge Aurier goes down after winning a sliding challenge. Lucky for Laurent Blanc, his defender get back up to his feet after receiving some treatment from the medical team. Injuries in a meaningless game would infuriate the PSG boss. 43 mins: We mentioned Kovavic earlier in the build-up and the Croat midfielkder shows his class with a beautiful through ball into the path of Mauro Icardi. With only Nicolas Douchez to beat, the 21-year-old dinks his shot into the side netting. 37 mins: The French giants should be 2-0 ahead but instead it's goalless. After Ibrahimovic's miss earlier, Adrien Rabiot tries his luck from 20-yards out with a dipping left-footed volley. Handanovic can only parry the ball into the path of Blaise Matuidi who shoots straight at the Inter 'keeper with the goal at his mercy. 33 mins: Over half an hour has been played and sadly this friendly hasn't followed the same way as Real Madrid vs AC Milan earlier. Both teams have created little going forward, with Ibrahimovic's effort the closest so far. 26 mins: At last we get our first significant chance and it falls to the most dangerous man on the pitch. Gregory van der Wiel does brilliantly to cut back a cross to Ibrahimovic. From seven-yards out though the Sweden international can only scuff a shot that is kicked away by Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic. 19 mins: The opening 19 minutes of the match have seen both teams enjoy brief spells of early pressure. The momentum is once more with Inter. Midfielder Hernanes does brilliantly to weave his way into the PSG box but sees his cross-cum-shot blocked by Aurier for a corner. Sadly for the Italians nothing comes from the resulting set piece. 12 mins: PSG are starting to exert some pressure of their own into the match. Ibrahimovic is becoming increasingly more involved in the game and every time he touches the ball, the crowd go wild. 7 mins: Mancini will be pleased with his side's start to the match. They're pressing well - denying their opponents time and space on the ball. 5 mins: The opening stages have seen Inter start the brighter of the two teams. Just moments ago Zdravko Kuzmanovic came close to opening the scoring but saw his 25-yard pile driver just whistle past the post. Inter get proceedings underway... The stadium in Marrakech is far from full but both teams are out on to the pitch. Can we expect a similar scoreline to AC Milan 4-2 Real Madrid earlier? What more can you say about Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The maverick forward is a star attraction wherever he goes and he will want to put on a show against his former club. Mancini's counterpart Laurent Blanc has taken a different approach to tonight's friendly and has elected to field an experimental XI with right back Serge Aurier starting in the heart of central defence.PSG XI: Douchez; Van Der Wiel, Aurier, Camara, Digne; Verratti, Chantome, Matuidi, Cabaye, Rabiot; Ibrahimovic . Inter boss Roberto Mancini has named a strong line-up for today friendly by virtually naming his strongest possible 11. Talented Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic starts for the Italian giants. Inter XI: Handanovic; D'Ambrosio, Ranocchia, Andreolli, Juan Jesus; M'Vila, Kuzmanovic; Bonazzoli, Kovacic, Hernanes; Icardi . Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's coverage of Paris Saint-Germain's friendly against Inter Milan tonight.While the majority of Europe are enjoying a winter break, some glamour friendlies have been thrown up. Earlier today AC Milan won 4-2 against Real Madrid in Dubai. Their city rivals will dearly love a similar result against their French opponents.

"The power may have shifted but — 42 years on — the scoreline remained the same as Sunderland and Leeds met for the first time in the FA Cup since the famous final of 1973. Twenty-five places separated Don Revie’s cup holders and Bob Stokoe’s Second Division underdogs when they upset the Wembley odds thanks to the late Ian Porterfield’s goal and those heroes were back at the Stadium of Light yesterday. More than four decades on and 26 positions divide the sides, with Leeds’ demise leaves them fearing relegation to League One. Sunderland's Patrick van Aanholt celebrates firing his side into a first half lead . Van Aanholt helped give Premier League Sunderland the lead against their Championship opponents . Van Aanholt, right, runs off in celebration after putting Sunderland 1-0 up against Leeds .

Bookings: Murphy . Manager: Neil Redfearn 5 . Referee: Mike Dean 7 . Attendance: 30,302 . In that respect, there was perhaps mitigation for the seven changes made by Neil Redfearn. Gus Poyet, however, believes a cup run can facilitate momentum in the league. To that end, Poyet should be applauded for naming a strong XI and won through to the fourth round courtesy of Patrick van Aanholt’s sweet strike. ‘We made a few changes (six) but it was a good team,’ said Poyet, whose side had not won at home since October 4. ‘We needed to win at home and we need the cup. I love it. 'I don’t think it’s a distraction playing football. If you think it’s a distraction then you should go to the casino or the cinema.’ Van Aanholt’s goal arrived on 33 minutes, a first-time shot into the bottom corner after Steven Fletcher had rolled the ball into his path. The Dutch left back had not played for two months since dislocating his shoulder at Crystal Palace and Poyet admitted: ‘It was a big decision to play him. 'If something happened to him then you would all be killing me. 'But we didn’t think it was a crazy risk and he was probably the best player. We’ve missed him.’ Leeds could have nicked a replay when skipper Liam Cooper headed against the post in stoppage time. Redfearn reflected: ‘I thought we were the better team in the second half.’ Leeds were backed by 5,200 travelling fans and former Elland Road assistant Poyet was impressed. ‘That shows the kind of fans they have and where they should be,’ he said.

"Kasper Schmeichel has suffered a broken metatarsal and will be ruled out for at least a month in a huge blow for Leicester City. The Danish international goalkeeper sustained the stress fracture in his foot during training on Thursday morning and will undergo an operation on Friday. The injury is expected to keep Schmeichel from playing for about four weeks, but manager Nigel Pearson added that diagnosis was optimistic and it 'could be longer'. Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel has suffered a broken metatarsal and will be ruled out for at least a month . The injury is expected to keep Leicester goalkeeper Schmeichel from playing for between four weeks . Pearson admitted he may be forced into the transfer market to pick up another goalkeeper – with Ben Hamer set to play against champions Manchester City at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. 'Kasper is having an operation on a metatarsal that has broken this morning,' said Pearson. 'There was no contact, it's very unfortunate and clearly the lad's distressed about it. 'He will be a big miss for us but what you have to do is deal with it. I've got an idea (how long he will be out) – hopefully he'll have the operation tomorrow, optimistic view four to six weeks.' Pearson added: 'I couldn't honestly tell you (how he did it), apart from there was no contact. Normally what happens with those injuries is a stress situation, foot to the floor, I didn't see a twist or anything like that. These things happen. 'I don't know enough about the details apart from I was there and clearly the lad is in discomfort. There is not a great deal we can do at the moment. We'll have to wait and see.

Dallas-based fan Ashley Oldham - yes, really - made the long trip across the Atlantic to see her beloved League One side play in the flesh, only to find that the game had been called off due to opponents Rochdale still being in the FA Cup.

She turned up at the ground on Saturday lunchtime, only to find the gates locked and nobody at home. The Latics do have another home game next Saturday, a crunch mid-table clash against Doncaster Rovers. Hopefully Ms Oldham will still be on British soil to finally see her team.

"It was Everton's big moment: a press conference had been called for 7pm on Wednesday, July 30 at Finch Farm to unveil the player Roberto Martinez had 'saved up' for. Rather than go out and pick a £5million player here and an £8million player there, Martinez had let last January drift without doing any significant business so he had a substantial kitty to play with in the summer. He knew Romelu Lukaku was the man to spend it all on. The paperwork took longer than envisaged to complete but at 8.43pm Lukaku – all £28million of him – walked in to the media auditorium, accompanied by a beaming Martinez. This was what he had wanted; so enthused was the manager he later said he would have gone to £100million. Romelu Lukaku, pictured reacting against Hull, has struggled to hit top form for Everton this season . The Belgian, pictured in action against Newcastle, has now gone six Premier League games without a goal . On the back of his outstanding loan spell from Chelsea last season, when he scored 15 goals and helped Everton finish fifth in the Barclays Premier League, it was expected that Lukaku and his team would progress hand in hand. Nothing that balmy night suggested there would be a problem. Fast forward to mid-winter, though, and Lukaku has struggled to live up to his grand billing. Martinez had an inkling that, after being at the World Cup, it would take the 21-year-old time to reach top speed but should he still be waiting for him to get there in the first week of January? His performance numbers do not suggest major problems. Lukaku has scored six times, made two assists and has been regularly available for games. There have not been any underlying fitness issues and he has avoided the curse of the hamstring strain that has afflicted some of Everton's squad. Dig a little deeper and you will see the issue is that he is not getting involved enough in games. His six Premier League goals have come at conversion rate of every 14.3 shots. The average number for a top end Premier League striker is above 25. Is he actually being put into the positions to flourish? Toffees boss Roberto Martinez showed great faith in Lukaku when he spent a club record £28million on him . Lukaku celebrates scoring against Aston Villa - one of six Premier League goals he has netted this season . One former Everton player certainly doesn't think so. 'If I was Romelu Lukaku I would seriously be knocking on the gaffer's door and saying ""Seriously, is there any chance of me getting in the game more often? Because I never see the football"",' Andy Gray, a focal point of Everton's 1984-85 championship winning team, argued. 'I feel a little bit sorry for him. What's the point in paying £28m for a centre forward, who did ever so well last year because we got him more involved in the game than we are doing this year. He was a threat and he was a handful. 'But there is no point in having him up there if we are going to pass it along the back, into midfield, back again, into left back, across to right back, back again and he's doing little shuttles at the top end of the pitch wondering ""when is the ball going to arrive at me?""' Gray's words carry substance. There is a feeling Everton are now easy to play against, predictable almost. Certainly, there has been no game this year where Lukaku has been central to Martinez hatching a plan, such as when he played from the right and terrorised Arsenal at Goodison. Everton's players look dejected after conceding the first goal in their 2-0 defeat at Hull on New Year's Day . Lukaku celebrates scoring against Hull in December but he started on the bench against the Tigers last week . The Belgium international hasn't been able to get into Premier League games as much as last year . Lukaku, a hulking figure who honed his physique during adolescence by doing 150 sit ups a day, has the power to be a formidable target man and Everton could utilise his attributes by playing a more direct game. That, however, is never going to happen under Martinez. Yet sympathy for Lukaku can only stretch so far. He is only a young man and has to realise he can't sit and wait for the opportunities: Martinez didn't pay £28m for him to run on to balls – that fee was paid for the Belgian to energise Everton's forward line, to give them dynamism. Without a goal in his last six appearances, Lukaku must take that on board on Tuesday evening when West Ham arrive at Goodison and Everton's season precariously balanced. Now is the time for Lukaku, a man who does not lack for self-confidence, to show he was worth the wait.","Romelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in all competition this season .

"Sam Allardyce considers it the most inexperienced side he has ever put out in a competitive match - namely the West Ham United side full of teenagers who were demolished 5-0 by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round last season. Five of his starting XI were from the development squads and the seven on the bench, three of whom came on, were from there too. West Ham were only one behind against the Championship side at the break - through Djamel Abdoun's penalty - but Jamie Paterson hit a 14-minute hat-trick from the 65th minute and Andy Reid finished off the humiliating defeat in stoppage time. Hammers boss Allardyce admitted on Monday it was a 'dark, dark period' - especially as a 6-0 drubbing by Manchester City followed - before he finally sorted the side out and kept them up. It almost cost him his job. But what happened to the 12 youngsters who had their confidence crushed that Sunday afternoon? Sportsmail investigates... West Ham United players leave the pitch looking dejected after losing 5-0 to Nottingham Forest . Sam Allardyce (second right) and his coaching staff look on during the FA Cup loss last season . Youngster Danny Whitehead wipes his face and looks dejected after the exit in the FA Cup . THOSE WHO STARTED... Danny Whitehead, 21, midfielder . The hammering by Forest has not stopped Whitehead gaining more first-team experience. In July last year he appeared in senior pre-season friendlies against Stevenage, Wellington Pheonix and Sydney FC. Whitehead is playing in the development squad at the moment but is yet to feature for West Ham in a senior competitive tie since the Forest match. Whitehead has not appeared in a senior West Ham match since the 5-0 loss against Nottingham Forest . Sebastian Lletget, 22, midfielder . The American attacking midfielder, who was the first product of West Ham's international academy to sign a professional deal, scored three times in 19 appearances for the development squad last season, which earned him a place in the first team for pre-season friendlies against Ipswich Town and Schalke in July. Also yet to play for the senior team again in a competitive match. Sebastian Lletget (left) holds off the challenge of Forest's Andy Reid during the match last January . George Moncur, 21, midfielder . Moncur, son of former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham midfielder John Moncur, was shipped out on loan to Partick three weeks after the defeat by Forest. Then he went on loan to Colchester United at the start of this season before making the move permanent in November, signing a contract until 2017. He has scored four times in 28 games. George Moncur (right) fouls Forest's Jamie Paterson during the FA Cup third-round loss . Moncur (right) has since moved to Colchester United, originally in a loan deal and them permanently . Dan Potts, 20, defender . This game didn't do Potts, whose father Steve Potts came through the academy at West Ham and made more than 400 appearances for the club, any harm and he signed a new two-year deal last summer. He has played for the senior side this campaign when he started in West Ham's Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United, which they lost on penalties. Dan Potts (right), challenging Paterson of Forest, has played for West Ham's first team this season . Callum Driver, 22, defender . That match against Forest would be the only appearance Driver would ever make for the club. He was released last summer and briefly joined Conference South side Whitehawk, before being released in October and joining Conference team Dartford in November. He has made eight league appearances for them. Callum Driver's FA Cup match was his only game for West Ham before his release last summer . THE SUBS WHO CAME ON... Blair Turgott, 20, midfielder . (Came on for Stewart Downing in the 64th minute) Went out on loan to Rotherham United 12 days after the defeat, where he spent two months, but only managed one substitute appearance, then finished the season at League Two Dagenham & Redbridge, where he played five times. In 2011 the winger played alongside Raheem Sterling for England Under 17s when they reached the World Cup quarter-finals. He is playing for West Ham's Under 21 side this season. Blair Turgott has represented England at youth level (left) and was loaned out to Dagenham & Redbridge . Reece Burke, 18, defender . (Came on for Moncur in the 55th minute) Like Potts, the centre back has gone from strength to strength since that game. Last summer, he toured with the first team at the Schalke Cup where he played against Malaga and scored the winner in the Marathon Bet Cup 3-2 victory against UC Sampdoria. Burke also started in that defeat by Sheffield United at the start of the season. Reece Burke (right), challenging Henri Lansbury of Forest, has gone from strength to strength since the game . Burke (third left) celebrates scoring the winning goal in the friendly with Sampdoria in August . Matthias Fanimo, 20, midfielder . (Came on for Alou Diarra in the 55th minute) The winger continued to perform for the Under 21 side last season where he scored three times in 17 appearances. But that defeat was the last match he has featured in for the senior team to date. Fanimo, who joined West Ham aged six, moved to Tranmere Rovers on loan in September, but has made just one substitute appearance back in September in a 1-0 defeat by Carlisle United. Matthias Fanimo came on against Forest and was loaned out to Tranmere Rovers earlier this season . THE SUBS WHO DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT ON... Raphael Spiegel, 22, goalkeeper . The towering goalkeeper, from Switzerland, is yet to play for West Ham. He spent six weeks on loan at Crawley Town last summer but did not make an appearance, then he spent a month at Barnet from November but only made one appearance after suffering an injury. He is back with West Ham. Raphael Spiegel did not come off the bench against Forest and is yet to make a first-team appearance . Elliott Lee, 20, forward . The stocky striker, son of former England, West Ham, Charlton Athletic and Newcastle United midfielder Rob Lee, finished with a return of eight goals in 14 Under 21 games last season. He is currently on loan at League Two Southend United, where he has been since the end of October, but injury has prevented him from featuring. There have been high hopes for the forward since he made a substitute appearance in the Premier League in a 1-0 defeat to Stoke City when he was just 18. Elliott Lee, son of former Hammers midfielder Rob, has been sent out on loan to Southend United . Sean Maguire, 20, forward . Maguire is finding success on loan at Accrington Stanley, where he has netted four goals in 15 appearances since he moved in September. Maguire also played more than 20 first-team games on loan at League of Ireland Premier Division side Sligo Rovers last summer, including two Europa League matches against Rosenborg. Sean Maguire (left) is finding success on loan at Accrington Stanley, having scored four times . Jaanai Gordon, 19, forward . The forward had just signed for West Ham from Peterborough United on New Year's Day 2014, just 72 hours before that dreaded game. He was loaned to Conference South side Chelmsford City in December, where he has been on fire. Gordon scored on his debut against Ebbsfleet United, has netted five goals in four appearances and set up two more.

"It’s great Steven Gerrard is contemplating a move to the MLS, for him and the game in America. I have been out in the U.S. with Portland Timbers for half a season and loved every second. You can relax and enjoy a calm way of life. Stevie would have gone out in Liverpool and been asked for pictures and autographs but will be able to walk around whichever city he choses in relative anonymity. I can understand if he goes for LA Galaxy. We played there last season and were able to go out on the beach the day before the game as people went rollerblading up and down. What better way to spend your remaining years? Steven Gerrard has decided to leave Liverpool and his most likely destination appears to be the MLS . Gerrard kisses the 2005 Champions League trophy alongside Jamie Carragher but will leave the club . Liam Ridgewell says it's a great move for Gerrard and the MLS that he is contemplating a move . He could probably play on for another two years in the Premier League, so it is an indication of how much the MLS has grown that he would think about joining. It is a complement to the league. David Beckham and Thierry Henry have paved the way and he can create just as big an impression. He is a Premier League great and his presence will only bring the MLS on again. There will be more interest in England and highlights every time he scores. People may think Americans are only interested in sports like baseball and the NFL, but the fans at football matches are fantastic. They will tailgate for hours before kick-off and create atmospheres like English derbies every time. They bounce and sing for 90 minutes. Coming from Anfield, Stevie will like that. I’ve been able to explore Portland, a quirky city I would never have seen otherwise, live by a lake and spend afternoons chilling out on my boat, and get right into American fantasy football. Stevie should come over with his family and get the experience too. Ridgewell says Gerrard should definitely move across the pond to experience life in America .","Steven Gerrard has made the decision to leave Liverpool .

"England Under-21 international Nathaniel Chalobah looks destined to return to Chelsea when his loan at Burnley expires next month after Sean Dyche suggested the 19-year-old may be finding it difficult to adapt to the top flight. Chalobah arrived at Turf Moor on transfer deadline day hoping to impress Blues boss Jose Mourinho and show he could break the mould by being a Chelsea academy product worthy of regular first-team consideration. But in the week that 18-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek's senior debut earned so much attention, a man who once made the Chelsea bench at 15 is struggling to build on the early hype which surrounded him. Nathaniel Chalobah (centre), currently on loan at Burnley, looks set to return to Chelsea in January . Chalobah is yet to start a game under Dyche and has played just 66 minutes in total, 45 of which came in the 4-0 drubbing at West Brom. He has played no part in the Clarets' last five games and after confirming there is no injury concern over Chalobah, Dyche admitted the Barclays Premier League's unforgiving nature has limited the teenager's opportunities. 'He's a young player learning, earning his spurs and developing, and this is a tough league to do all those things in and do them every week,' said the Clarets manager. 'Behind the scenes he's working hard and should he get his chance, he'll be ready to take it.' Yet when asked whether Chalobah would be returning to Stamford Bridge when his loan culminates in January, Dyche simply replied: 'We'll wait and see. We'll stumble across that bridge when we have to.' Sean Dyche suggested that Chalobah was perhaps not quite ready for Premier League football at this stage . Chalobah's England Under-21 team-mate Michael Keane has made more of an impression during his loan stay, though. The Manchester United defender initially had to bide his time to break into the line-up but, with Michael Duff sidelined by a calf injury, Keane has now started three games in a row. However, while Dyche may be interested in extending Keane's stay beyond January, the injury crisis which has blighted his parent club could mean Louis van Gaal is reluctant to agree to such terms. 'For a young man going into the Premier League he's done well and I thought he was very good at QPR,' Dyche added. 'With Duffo - he's done well this season - so it was a case of picking on form. Now Keano comes in and he's done well, so it will be interesting when we've got everyone fit.' Chalobah has 21 caps for the England Under 21 side, and has also played for the Under 16, 17 and 19 sides . It is in central midfield, Chalobah's usual position, that Dyche has pinpointed as an area he will target when the transfer window opens up again. The likes of Henri Lansbury and Craig Bryson were linked with the Clarets over the summer but both signed new deals at their respective clubs and Dyche is ready to go looking for another midfield maestro. 'We're looking to strengthen with the right players,' he said. 'There's certain areas that we possibly need to build further than others. We've not got great depth in central midfield. 'It's supply and demand, availability of players and the ones that fit the team but also the financial model of the club. 'There will be finance, we know that, but we've already seen the finance involved in the Premier League is considerable and it's how far the club want to go towards affecting the situation, if and when the right player comes available.' Chalobah headed to Burnley looking to impress Jose Mourinho but has only played 66 minutes in total .","Nathaniel Chalobah is on loan at Burnley from Chelsea .

"Roberto Martinez insists Everton have not received any offers for Ross Barkley and will not sell him during the January window. Manchester City, who have a long-term interest in the England international, have once again been linked with a big-money move for Barkley but Martinez has made it clear Everton will not be cashing in. Everton have endured their worst run of form for nine years and Martinez is more concerned about addressing how they recapture last season's sparkle than losing Barkley in the coming weeks. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley (left), pictured in action against Hull, is a target for Manchester City . Barkley has struggled for form this season after suffering a serious knee injury before Everton's first game . Barkley signed a new long-term contract in the summer and though he has only shown sporadic flashes of his talent this year, his manager has attempted to put an end to the speculation ahead of Tuesday's FA Cup third-round tie with West Ham. Martinez said: 'We have not received any approach. This January it is vital we recapture our best form and regain some momentum. If our best performers get compliments, we enjoy hearing those compliments and that is good but nobody will be leaving. 'Ross is someone with real passion for the game. You would always pay a good entrance fee to watch someone like him. But we are just concentrating on getting the result against West Ham. This is a real important moment in our season to make progress in another competition. 'The players and everyone at the club are only thinking about what we can do. The talent is there. We have been through a difficult period of bad results and we need to make sure we fulfil our potential. That is where we are. This is the most important game of the season. Roberto Martinez insists Everton have not received any offers for Barkley and will not sell him in January . Ex-Everton striker Nikica Jelavic (left) helped condemn his old club to a 2-0 defeat at Hull on New Year's Day . 'January is always an opportunity to see if there are opportunities so you can help the other players at the club. We have got a good group and we want to be ready for the challenges that we are going to face in the second half of the season. We are not going to bring anyone in just for the sake of it.' If Everton do sign anyone this month, the priority will be a goalkeeper as Tim Howard faces another 'six or seven weeks' on the sidelines and Joel Robles is the only keeper with top-flight experience at the club. But the FA Cup is a more pressing concern. Beating West Ham, however, is likely to prove easier said than done. Everton have lost their last four matches in the Barclays Premier League and Martinez is wary of the threat Sam Allardyce's side pose. 'It could be a pivotal moment and that is the way we are looking at it,' said Martinez. 'I admire West Ham and Southampton for the way they have done things in the Premier League, they have been phenomenal. Everton's players appear dejected after conceding the first goal to Hull at the KC Stadium . 'We have been disappointed with the results, because we had high hopes and expectations. We have got three games at home and we need to get the positive result that will trigger that momentum. I am very much looking forward to that game.' Given they began the season with great expectations, Martinez – who will again be without the hamstrung James McCarthy – has found himself coming under fire from frustrated Evertonians but he understands why he finds himself under pressure. 'That is normal,' said Martinez. 'We are here to win football games and build something for the future. The fans know we are all together. When you have adversity, you have to find a way of making sure you become a winning side. It is time to help each other and we will get our rewards.'","Ross Barkley is a target for Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is confident he has the 'many solutions' in attack needed to secure a successful end to the season, but warned against expecting too much too soon from Theo Walcott. The Gunners secured a place in the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 2-0 win over Hull on Sunday, the team they defeated in the 2014 final at Wembley. Chile forward Alexis Sanchez impressed again, stroking home his 16th goal of the season with eight minutes left, while on another day Walcott - making a first start since the serious knee injury which kept him out for almost a year - would have netted a brace himself but for some rusty finishing. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez (right) scores his side's second goal against Hull on Sunday evening . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) celebrates Sanchez's 16th goal of the season in all competitions . With Olivier Giroud having now completed his three-match suspension and England forward Danny Welbeck expected to shake off his thigh injury ahead of the visit of Stoke on Sunday, which could also see German playmaker Mesut Ozil involved after three months out, Wenger certainly has plenty of options going forwards. The Gunners boss, who has allowed Lukas Podolski to join Inter Milan, said on Arsenal Player: 'We have many options when you think of the players who still have not played (against Hull), we have many solutions up front. 'It is a very important period now. We have had many injuries until now and hopefully everybody will be back.' Wenger, though, will be cautious with Walcott's rehabilitation. Theo Walcott started against Hull but Wenger has warned fans not too expect too much from him yet . Striker Olivier Giroud will return from a three-game suspension against Stoke this weekend . 'You cannot expect much [from Walcott yet], but fitness-wise he was good,' the Gunners boss said. 'Theo had good chances, made some good runs. He has to get used to contact again and that will take a little bit of time.' Arsenal are expected to add to the squad in the January transfer window, with Saint-Etienne defender Loic Perrin having claimed contact has already been made over a potential move. France under-21 forward Yaya Sanogo could be allowed to leave on loan to get some match experience, and Wenger may also decide to add more attacking cover, although already has back-up in Joel Campbell and 19-year-old Chuba Akpom, who has come off the bench in the last two matches. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger believes he has enough attacking options to have a successful season . Danny Welbeck (right), pictured celebrating against West Ham, is expected to shake off a thigh injury . Wenger reported after Sunday's win that midfielders Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey both had a chance to be involved for the Stoke game following their respective injury lay-offs. Captain Mikel Arteta, however, remains sidelined by a niggling calf problem which saw the Spaniard limp out of the Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund on November 26. Writing in his programme notes, Arteta said: 'I have started running this week, so let's see where this progress is going to take me. 'My aim is always to play and be on the pitch as quickly as possible, because I really miss it. 'I love competing, I love being out there and it has been a difficult time for me.'

"QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes Mauro Zarate can be the answer to his striker shortage but insists a deal has not yet been completed for the West Ham forward. Zarate, who joined the Hammers from Argentine side Velez Sarsfield in the summer, reportedly underwent a medical at Rangers on Tuesday after struggling to establish himself at Upton Park. Redknapp has made no secret of his desire to add at least one more striker to his squad in January and the Rangers manager believes Zarate fits the bill. QPP boss Harry Redknapp has admitted he is keen on loaning West Ham forward Mauro Zarate . The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot . 'He's a player we've been talking about loaning, it's not done yet though,' Redknapp said. 'He's a No 10, a clever player who can open the door. 'I first came across him at Birmingham a few years back when he played under Alex McLeish. 'It's not done and dusted it's just something we're interested in - we are looking to loan a player or two.' Zarate has scored two goals in seven league appearances for West Ham this season but has struggled for a starting spot ahead of Diafra Sakho, Enner Valencia and Andy Carroll. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce responded to claims he had treated Zarate unfairly by insisting the 27-year-old had simply not been good enough to secure a regular place in the side. Redknapp said: 'Sam said he's done well enough but you can see why he hasn't played - they've got Sakho, Valencia, Carroll, Carlton Cole and Zarate - they've got five strikers. 'They're good players and they've been in great form, they're a threat to anybody so it's been difficult for Zarate to get in. 'Maybe Sam prefers the others and they've been in great form so you can see why.' Redknapp is hoping to bolster his attacking options to avoid relying on Charlie Austin . QPR boss Redknapp has labelled West Ham outcast Zarate a 'clever No 10' Redknapp added: 'It's important to have options up front. You need somebody else to weigh in with goals. 'We can't rely on Charlie (Austin) getting all the goals. 'It's an area we're looking at but it's difficult, who is going to loan you a striker who will score 10 to 12 goals before the end of the season? Everyone is looking for a striker.' A goalless draw at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday leaves QPR 15th in the table and two points above the relegation zone. Redknapp's side host Swansea on New Year's Day, hoping to continue their excellent form at Loftus Road which includes three wins in their last four home matches. 'Our home form has been fantastic for us, we've been difficult to beat at home,' Redknapp said. 'We now play all the top teams at home in the second half of the season and we go away to the bottom teams.' Redknapp added: 'Swansea are a good side, Garry Monk has done a great job with them and he's just carried on from where they were. 'They've had great managers in the last few years, who have gone on to do great things and he's another in that line.'","Mauro Zarate is expected to join Queens Park Rangers on loan .

"Manchester City midfielder-turned-striker James Milner intends to use a few days to recharge before the title quest resumes at the weekend. Milner spared City's blushes at the end of their festive programme by striking twice to edge out battling Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup third round. City toiled against the  Championship side at the Etihad Stadium, needing Milner's second-half double, which included an injury-time winner, to scrape through 2-1. Manchester City midfielder James Milner is looking forward to a mini-break after festive fixture fun . It brought the busy Christmas spell, which saw City pull level with Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League, to a successful conclusion and left them looking ahead with plenty of optimism. There was the blemish of a 2-2 draw with Burnley on December 28, but City are still unbeaten in 13 and in good shape for a tough month that culminates with a trip to Stamford Bridge. They return to league action with a trip to Everton on Saturday and then host Arsenal the following week. England international Milner told City TV: 'It is nice to have a spare week with the amount of games we have had and some of the injuries. Some of the lads have had to play a lot of games. 'It is important we recover now, and we use this week to refresh. 'It slows down a bit now but I think it has been a pretty successful festive period - we have closed the gap. We had one blip but have been on a pretty good run, even though we have had a few injuries.' Milner (right) scored both of City's goal in their 2-1 comeback win against Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup . Injuries to strikers Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic saw midfielder Milner pressed into action as a makeshift centre-forward in December. Jovetic is now back in action but so ineffective were City in the first half against the Owls that Milner was pushed back up front after the break. He responded on what was his 29th birthday by cancelling out Adthe Nuhiu's 14th-minute strike after 65 minutes, although it also needed the double introduction of Samir Nasri and David Silva to spark City into life. Wednesday remained well organised and went close to securing a replay but Milner was in the right place in the first minute of injury time to turn in a Jesus Navas cross. Striker Stevan Jovetic (centre) started Sunday's FA Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday . Milner said: 'The manager changed it at half-time and asked me to go through the middle and it seemed to work, so good decision from him. It's just nice that he's asked me to go up there and I've managed to do a job. 'It's a bit different but I played there when I was a bit younger and I think it is just about understanding the role. 'Sometimes it is about occupying the centre-halves and giving the likes of Samir and David and Yaya (Toure) a bit more room to get in the holes and get on the ball. 'If someone can do that, with their ability they are going to cause all sorts of problems.' Milner (centre) moved up front and proved to be City's hero, after Jovetic was substituted in the second half . City had been expected to cruise through against opponents they thrashed 7-0 when they met in the Capital One Cup in September. It proved a tough encounter for what was, despite six changes, a strong City side but Milner was just pleased to get the job done. He said: 'We didn't play well at all but the FA Cup is about getting results and we managed to do that. We were under no illusions it was going to be a tough game, but we were coming off the run of a lot of games. It is nice to have a free week now.'","Manchester City beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 in the FA Cup third round .

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has confirmed Mauro Zarate is set to complete a loan move to QPR after the forward hit out at his lack of opportunities at Upton Park. The 27-year-old joined the Hammers in the summer from Velez Sarsfield but has made just eight first-team appearances since - with his last start coming against West Brom on December 2. Zarate was the first of nine signings made by West Ham during the summer transfer window but, with fellow forward recruits Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho hitting the ground running and Stewart Downing enjoying a renaissance in a No 10 role, the former Birmingham loanee has struggled for a sustained run in the side. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says Mauro Zarate is having a medical at QPR ahead of a loan move . The Argentine was the first of nine signings made by West Ham in the summer but hasn't nailed down a spot . And he voiced his displeasure on Monday as a move across London to relegation candidates QPR moved closer - citing the fact he was brought in by co-chairman David Sullivan rather than Allardyce as the reason behind his lack of chances. 'I respect the other strikers at the club who have done a good job,' Zarate was quoted as saying. 'But I believe my record entitles me to respect and I have not had that from the manager. The chairman has confidence in me. I know this because he brought me to the club. Zarate says he's out of favour with Sam Allardyce because he was brought in by co-chairman David Sullivan . Zarate has also been the victim of the excellent form of fellow new signings such as Enner Valencia . Diafra Sakho (left) also got off to a flyer with eight goals in 10 games but hasn't scored in the last four . 'But for this reason the manager has refused to play me. He did not want me. I made it clear many weeks ago that I wanted to leave.' When asked at his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's New Year's Day clash with West Brom, Allardyce revealed Zarate was undergoing a medical at QPR. Allardyce also stated that he expected the forward to join Harry Redknapp's side on loan for the remainder of the season when the transfer window opens.","West Ham forward Mauro Zarate set to be loaned to QPR .

"Jim McColl has handed over his 10,000-share stake in Rangers to fans group Rangers First. The multi-millionaire Clyde Blowers boss tried to topple the Light Blues board 12 months ago when he backed Paul Murray's 'requisitioners'. But the 62-year-old has kept a low profile since failing to oust the likes of Football board chairman Sandy Easdale and his PLC counterpart David Somers at the 2013 AGM. The Ibrox faithful have been given more power after fans group Rangers First were handed 10,000-share stake . The club has stumbled from one crisis to another in the months that have followed but, while the club is still dangerously short of cash, hopes have risen amongst the Gers faithful since Dave King and the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - grabbed control of around 34 per cent of the club with two surprise share purchases last week. Anti-board campaigners are now trying to pull together a coalition of shareholders who will be able to finally secure power and lead the ailing Glasgow giants to safety. Now McColl has shown his hand by donating his total shareholding to Rangers First, a community-interest company who plan to use a similar scheme to the one which rescued Hearts from administration to save the Ibrox outfit. Rangers are still in financial turmoil but Rangers First are working hard to save the Ibrox outfit . In a statement, McColl - one of Scotland's richest men - urged his fellow fans to follow his lead, as he said: 'I was happy with the aims of Rangers First in uniting the fan shareholders and I have gifted my shares to Rangers First. 'I encourage other supporters to look at their aims and decide for themselves.' McColl's move is another boost for Rangers First, who have seen a surge in interest since last week. The group has already bought up 600,000 shares - around 0.75 per cent of the club's total equity which has been mostly paid for by donations and monthly subscriptions from its 2,000-plus contributors. Businessman Dave King bought around a 15 per cent share in Rangers last week . Since news of King's 14.57 per cent purchase on New Year's Eve, they have signed up another 424 members including a dozen fans who have splashed out £500 for life-time packages. They now plan to snap up another 40,000 shares in the coming days. A Rangers First spokesperson said: 'The Rangers First support are committing to the future of the club. 'Players and directors come and go, but the fans are the one constant. More and more fans are now stepping up everyday. The fans will always be there.'","Jim McColl has handed over 10,000 share-stake to Rangers First group .

"Marc Marquez has won the 2014 MotoGP world title for the second year in a row after his second-place finish in the Japanese Grand Prix. The 21-year-old Spaniard stretched his championship lead over compatriot Dani Pedrosa and Italian veteran Valentino Rossi to an unassailable 82 points - with just three races of the season remaining - after finishing runner-up to Jorge Lorenzo at the Motegi circuit on Sunday.

Elsewhere, Niklas Ajo failed to finish after crashing during the final event on Sunday. Six-time MotoGP champion Rossi claimed the final podium place on his Yamaha but the day belonged to Marquez as he retained his title in emphatic style. Marquez, who became the first person since Kenny Roberts in 1978 to accomplish the premier class title in his first season last year, is now the youngest back-to-back champion. Despite working his way up after starting fourth on the grid, Marquez was unable to catch Yamaha's Lorenzo, who claimed his second successive victory after his triumph in Aragon two weeks ago. Nevertheless, it was a good return to form for Marquez after poor results in San Marino and Aragon in his last two outings. Marquez, whose title triumph was largely down to winning 11 of the first 12 grands prix, said on MotoGP's official website: 'You know, the race doesn't really matter today! Maybe I wasn't riding like always, as I felt a little different. Marquwz, Lorenzo and third-placed Valentino Rossi stand on the podium after the race . 'It was hard to overtake and I didn't want a mistake. I had two mistakes in the last races but we got the title. It's incredible to take it at home. 'Just two years in MotoGP with two titles is incredible. Maybe for the people it looks easy because I'm always smiling, but there is a lot of pressure. 'Misano and Aragon we made some mistakes so it was important to focus here for Honda. I'm really happy with my team and family and fans, they're all pushing me. It's like a dream right now.' Rossi (right) and Marquez (in the distance) were involved in a close battle for second place . Rossi - who will be battling for second place in the championship with Pedrosa, with whom he is level on points - paid tribute to Marquez. 'I had a small chance to keep the championship party open, I wanted to keep it open another race. Marc's advantage was very big, but maybe we could keep it open still,' he said. 'I tried my maximum, especially with Pedrosa behind me at the end. I had a good pace but Marquez had something a little extra so it was impossible. 'I think that Marc deserves the championship; he won a lot of races and in a lot of conditions. He doesn't make mistakes and he improved his level so congratulations to Marc.'","Niklas Ajo crashed during the final race of the MotoGP Championship .

"For 93 minutes David Raya Martin kept Southport in the Cup with a virtuoso display of shot stopping his compatriot David De Gea would be proud of. On what might be his final appearance for the Conference club, the 19-year-old on loan from Blackburn Rovers launched himself every which way to thwart Championship high flyers Derby. ‘He was outstanding, just magnificent,’ said Rams manager Steve McClaren, ‘The way he was saving shots and we were missing them I thought the game would only be decided with a penalty.’ Chris Martin of Derby (centre) celebrates after scoring the winning goal from the penalty spot . Martin converted from the spot after Johnny Russell had been fouled in the 93rd minute . Derby: Roos 6; Shotton 5.5 (Russell 62' 6), Buxton 6, Keogh 6, Naylor 6; Ward 6.5 (Ibe 62' 6), Mascarell 5.5, Bryson 6, Coutts 6, Dawkins 6.5; Best 6 (Martin 62' 7) Subs not used: Forsyth, Hughes, Calero, Mitchell .

Subs not used: Roberts, Marsden, Mitchell . Referee: Graham Scott . Attendance: 20,201 . Player ratings by Martha Kelner at iPro Stadium . Deep into stoppage time, in a rare display of indiscipline, Southport captain Luke Foster brought down Johnny Russell in the box. Nobody had any complaints when referee Graham Scott awarded a penalty, and substitute Chris Martin duly buried the winner from the spot — with Derby’s 23rd shot on goal. ‘It was a cruel way to lose,’ said Southport manager Gary Brabin, ‘but we’ve left with what we wanted, pride and a lot of new friends from Derby. The whole club is class, their supporters were excellent, their team applauded us off the pitch at the end.’ There was no sign of the magic of the Cup having diminished for the 2,652 who bought Southport’s entire ticket allocation and packed one corner of the iPro stadium. The away support, including 261 youth players paid to attend by club chairman Charlie Clapham, filled 15 coaches compared to the usual one and headed for the east midlands full of hope for their side’s first third round FA Cup tie since 1999.

"Lizzy Yarnold surged to victory in the first race of the World Cup skeleton season in Lake Placid on Friday. In her first race since claiming Olympic gold in Sochi in February, Yarnold finished 0.77 seconds clear of Canadian World Cup debutant Elisabeth Vathje after recording the fastest time in each of her two runs. Yarnold is the hot favourite to retain her overall World Cup title following the retirement of her closest rival, American Noelle Pikus-Pace, in the wake of the Sochi Games. Lizzie Yarnold celebrates after winning Olympic gold in Sochi in February of this year . Yarnold finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on Day Seven of the Winger Olympics in Russia . But Yarnold said: 'With it being the start of the season I was a bit apprehensive that I wouldn't be quick enough or think quick enough. 'There have been so many retirements that it's not the same as before, but these younger athletes are so good so I knew I had to bring my best performance, which I did.' Yarnold now faces a flight back across the Atlantic in order to be present for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in Glasgow on Sunday night, for which she is one of 10 nominees.

"Marc Marquez endured a race-long battle with Jorge Lorenzo from start to finish before claiming victory in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The 21-year-old Spaniard on his Repsol Honda, who started the race from pole position, dropped into second on the opening lap as his compatriot took charge. But the lead changed hands between the duo a number of times after championship leader Marquez went in front with seven laps to go. Tense battle: Jorge Lorenzo fights to hold off Marquez but his fellow Spaniard eventually got past . Celebration: Marquez enjoys his eleventh win of the season at the British Grand Prix . Marquez was pushed back to second but fought back hard and after shoulder-barging and a touch with Movistar Yamaha’s Lorenzo, he came out on top to pick up an impressive 11th win of this season’s MotoGP World Championship in 40 minutes 51.835 seconds, with Lorenzo’s team-mate Valentino Rossi coming home third. After Lorenzo took the early lead, Marquez put him under increasing pressure as the race moved on and the front-running two were being tracked by Andrea Dovizioso on his Ducati, Rossi, Honda’s Dani Pedrosa and Britain’s Bradley Smith in sixth on his Yamaha. Rossi began to make inroads and moved into third five laps in, with Pedrosa also overtaking Dovizioso. Rossi was put under pressure four laps later by Pedrosa, who took third back. At the same time Smith looked in trouble and started to drop down the field before pitting with what turned out to be a rear tyre problem, with fellow Briton Scott Redding (Honda) moving up to 12th at the halfway stage. Siverware: The dominant Spaniard is already getting used to piking up trophies on race weekends . The fight for third was still going strong between Pedrosa, Rossi and Dovizioso before six-times world champion Rossi took advantage of the Spaniard going wide to reclaim third with fellow Italian Dovizioso moving up to fourth as Smith rejoined the race. The battle at the front began to heat up with seven laps to go as Marquez finally made his move and took the lead from Lorenzo moments after setting the fastest lap of race with a time of 2mins 01.980secs. Yet the Yamaha rider did not give up and reclaimed the lead as Marquez ran wide, to the delight of the crowds in the grandstand who roared approval. Lower down the field, Redding moved up to 11th after taking Ducati’s Yonny Hernandez and fellow Briton Cal Crutchlow moved up to 13th. With three laps remaining, Lorenzo was being pushed hard and - after a fight for track position where the riders looked to have touched - Marquez came out on top and held the lead to clinch his 11th win of the season, 0.732secs ahead of Lorenzo. Behind the top three were Pedrosa, Dovizioso, Pol Espargaro on his Yamaha, Stefan Bradl (Honda), Andrea Iannone (Ducati) and Aleix Espargaro (Yamaha). Redding rounded out the top 10 in his home race, while Crutchlow claimed 12th.

"Winter Olympic skeleton gold medalist Lizzy Yarnold has pulled out of the second World Cup event of the season in Calgary this week under medical advice. The 26-year-old from Kent, who was shortlisted for this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year award which went to Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton on Sunday, experienced symptoms of dizziness during her victory at the season opener in Lake Placid on Friday and will not compete in Calgary. British skeleton's performance adviser Andi Schmid confirmed the news, saying: 'It is better that Lizzy sits out the second World Cup. Lizzie Yarnold celebrates after winning Olympic gold in Sochi in February of this year . Yarnold finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on Day Seven of the Winger Olympics in Russia . 'The forces experienced by sliders are considerable during their runs down the track. We must make sure that she is fully fit before racing again'. Yarnold proved untouchable on the world skeleton circuit this season finishing top of the rankings in the World Cup before powering to gold in Sochi in February. Yarnold promised she would come back stronger for the trips to Europe early in the new year with Altenberg, Konigsee and St Moritz all hosting events in the World Cup series next month.

I enjoyed getting back into the mindset last week and winning. 'I felt dizzy at the end of the first run in Lake Placid but felt okay before the second run and knew that I could go for it but in our sport where we are travelling at such high speeds these things happen and we have to look after ourselves.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen for England to protect his teenage prodigy Raheem Sterling for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and San Marino. Rodgers has already lost two of his players Daniel Sturridge and Emre Can to injuries sustained on international duty and does not see the need for Sterling, the rising star of English football, to play the full 180 minutes against two nations Roy Hodgson’s men can be expected to beat comfortably. The Liverpool manager was critical of the way England handled Sturridge during the last international break when the striker returned to Merseyside with a thigh injury. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to protect his teenage prodigy Raheem Sterling . Choosing his words carefully so he could not be accused of telling Hodgson which team to pick, Rodgers said about Sterling: ‘It is easy to say he is 19 and can play every day of the week but it doesn’t work like that. ‘Human beings don’t work like that. It is nature there will come periods when they need the rest. I would think that Roy and his staff would have a look at things. ‘He’ll want to ensure the games are won but I am sure it [protecting players] will be an objective when you are winning a game comfortably. ‘We lost the young boy Emre Can when Germany under-21s were 6-0 up against Romania on an awful pitch. ‘The England manager, the England staff, they get paid their salary, they make the decisions. I think they are clever enough to hopefully work with the clubs and they can get success from having fit players. ‘I am not here to tell the England staff how to do their job. It is one of the biggest jobs as a manager, maximising the available talent, managing them on and off the field. It is probably something I am sure will happen.’ Sterling has gained a big international reputation since his performances at the World Cup and was followed everywhere on the pitch during Liverpool’s Champions League win against Ludogorets – something he can expect to happen again when the European campaign continues in Basle on Wednesday night. Rodgers is determined the youngster does not fall victim to burn-out or foul play, hence fears over the limited but physical defenders of San Marino, whom England face at Wembley on October 9, three days before the game in Estonia. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was critical of the way England handled Daniel Sturridge . ‘It is pretty clear from the games this season, and I saw it in pre-season, that he sometimes has two and three men around him. Is it affecting his performances? Not really. He has been brilliant so far and he’ll hopefully continue to keep that consistency in his game,’ added the Liverpool boss. Behind Rodgers’ concerns over Sterling’s next get-together with England is what happened to Sturridge. The Liverpool boss disclosed that England’s sports science and medical team had spent three-and-a-half hours with club specialists discussing the injury record and recovery time required for each Anfield player. But despite the planning, 25-year-old Sturridge then aggravated a thigh problem during an England training session Rodgers clearly felt was unwise for him to participate in. Sturridge subsequently missed England’s opening Euro 2016 qualifying win away to Switzerland. Rodgers said pointedly: ‘We put time into trying to help the associations when they want it. Obviously, we would hope then that that could be respected.’","Brendan Rodgers has already lost two of his players Daniel Sturridge and Emre Can to injuries on international duty .

"It is one of Australia's biggest sporting mysteries, but now Cathy Freeman's missing bodysuit from the 2000 Sydney Olympics games may well have been found. The suit disappeared 14 years ago from Freeman's dressing room after the opening ceremony, and initials thoughts were that it had either been stolen or accidentally removed by officials. The suit was last week mailed anonymously to the National Sports Museum in Australia, but it has not been confirmed whether it is the real suit from the games. Cathy Freeman's bodysuit went missing in September 2000 from her dressing room at Stadium Australia . The sporting champion wore it while she lit the Olympic torch at the games, where she later won a gold medal . The moment that aboriginal runner Freeman lit the Olympic cauldron in Sydney is seen as a defining moment in the country's history. And now, the designer behind the suit has revealed a crucial identifying feature on her creation which could ultimately clarify if the garment is the original. Jennifer Irwin has admitted that she had sewn the Olympic rings onto Freeman's suit upside down while rushing its completion the night before it was meant to be worn. 'I sewed the suit up around midnight when I was told who would be wearing it,' Ms Irwin told News.com.au. The suit (not pictured) has now been found, but it is not yet confirmed whether it is the original item . 'On the original one I sewed the Olympic rings upside down.' After the suit disappeared from Freeman's dressing room at Stadium Australia in September 2000, where the former athlete lit the Olympic torch in the white garment, Ms Irwin created a replica for display purposes. However, the minute detail could be crucial in identifying whether the item that was anonymously handed in to the Melbourne Cricket Club this week is the historical suit that mysteriously went missing over a decade ago. 'It has been a great mystery since 2000 and it is a suit that we all want to see again,' Australian Olympic Committee secretary-general Fiona de Jong told News.com.au. 'This is a pretty unique item of clothing. If it can be validated, we would like to see it celebrated and allow all Australians to see it.' Freeman reacts after winning the Olympic gold medal int he 400m final in the Sydney games in 2000 . The aboriginal athlete lighting the Olympic torch was seen as a historic moment for the country . A Victoria police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an item had been handed over to them by a representative of the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne East station. 'The article was alleged to have been stolen in NSW in the year 2000,' he said. 'Police are attempting to confirm the authenticity of the item and are liaising with the NSW Police.' The Australian Olympic Committee have released a statement about the find. They said the MCC staff member had 'received it anonymously' and it would hopefully settle a lot of unanswered questions. 'On that night, Cathy was soaked while standing under a waterfall after a mechanical fault delayed the lighting of the cauldron,' the statement said. 'She removed the suit after the ceremony and it has not been seen since. 'What happened to the suit has been the subject of much debate over the years as it is a major part of Australia's Olympic history. 'We are hoping the item of clothing handed to the MCC Museum is authentic and the mystery is finally solved.'","The bodysuit was worn by Cathy Freeman when she lit the Olympic torch .

"The dreaded phrase 'unexpected item in the bagging area' could soon be a thing of the past at thousands of self-service checkouts in high street supermarkets around the UK, according to a new report. For a new hi-tech camera system is being designed to end the necessity of the robotic message that sends Britain's time-strapped shoppers into a fury as it brings their transaction to a shuddering halt. Trade magazine The Grocer reported yesterday that the shopping frustration breakthrough could come from the company that installed the UK's first self-service checkout 12 years ago. Scroll down for video . Please wait for assistance: Cameras to see when you have accidentally left another item in the bagging area are set to hit supermarkets across the country - but not for about a year . It says that checkout specialist NCR, which first installed a self-scan system in a Marks & Spencer store in 2002, is looking to develop technology that will use cameras to identify when a customer has inadvertently rested their wallet, phone or umbrella in the bagging area. This will allow the till to continue the checkout process without the need for a member of the store staff to intervene. NCR retail division's general manager of self-checkout solutions, Dusty Lutz, told The Grocer that the system was about a year away from being rolled out. He said: 'At the moment, the systems are generally quite one-dimensional and only work by recognising the weight of the products that are supposed to be in the bagging area. 'It would really speed up the process if we had a camera which could quickly spot whether the extra weight was a customer's purse rather than these false alarms.' As well as traditional self-scan systems, which are designed for smaller shopping trips, NCR has developed bigger systems that allow shoppers to place a full weekly shop on a conveyor belt and use 360-degree scanners to process the full order at once. The technology is currently being trialled by Tesco and Asda but Mr Lutz said it would be at least a further four or five years before such systems became commonplace in UK supermarkets. A survey of UK shoppers found that 89 per cent of consumers said they use self-checkouts to some degree, while 39 per cent of them either 'strongly agree' or 'agree' that retailers offering the technology provide better customer service.","Cameras which recognise what is in bagging area could end dreaded phrase .

"Jose  Callejon's first-half strike helped ease the pressure on Napoli manager Rafael Benitez with a 1-0 win away at Sassuolo in Serie A - hours after the Spanish boss was backed to continue in his job by a member of the club's board. The former Liverpool and Chelsea manager picked up just his second league win of the season against the minnows who just escaped relegation last year, and seems to have the support of at least some of the club's hierarchy. Fans have stayed away from the Gli Azzurri's Stadio San Paolo home this season, frustrated at the team's lacklustre performances and failure to qualify for the Champions League. The pressure hanging over Rafael Benitez at Napoli has been eased by a 1-0 win away at Sassuolo . Jose Callejon scored the only goal of the game to defeat Sassuolo and give Benitez hope for his job . Callejon celebrates his strike after latching on to Gonzalo Higuain's expertly-executed cross . But Benitez received a double-boost this weekend with the news of Riccardo Bigon's backing - and taking three points from the trip to the Mapei Stadium. 'Benitez is a coach of immense experience and excellent results. He has won several trophies at clubs without huge tradition,' Napoli director Bigon said. 'Obviously at this moment he is very concentrated and is perhaps not too focused on speaking to the media. In these situations, the best thing is to lock down with the team and work. 'His career and his working methods cannot be put in doubt.' Marek Hamsik offers his congratulations to Callejon in a game Napoli were perhaps lucky to win . The Napoli players show their togetherness on the field as they celebrate the only goal of the game . Spanish striker Callejon scored the only goal of the game in Sassuolo, knocking in a brilliant cross from Gonzalo Higuain at the back post just before the half-hour mark. Federico Peluso has a shot deflected onto the crossbar for the hosts late on but Napoli clung on to claim just their second league win of the season. Higuain was at the heart of everything good for the Naples outfit and assisted the winner for Callejon . 'Our team over the last two seasons has been attack-minded and in fact we are the only side that plays regularly with four forwards,' Bigon added, speaking to Sky Sport Italy. 'Last season we scored 104 goals. Balance is important and we are a little forward-heavy, but that just means we have to do even better.' Saphir Taider grabs hold of Walter Gargano as things get a little heated during a tight match at the Mapei .

"A young Australian jihadist in Syria may have left his old playboy lifestyle in Melbourne behind but he’s still keeping up with friends via Facebook. Mahmoud Abdullatif fled the country four months ago, turning his back on the nightclubs, flash cars and motorbikes that he and his friends used to enjoy. Now, instead of posing with women he poses with rifles on Twitter and Instagram. The social media savvy jihadist’s Facebook page features his name spelled out in bullets and a photo of a dead child’s hand. Scroll down for video . Mahmoud Abdullatif has posed with rifles on Twitter after arriving in Syria . One bloody image accuses the US and Israel of being ‘child killers’. In August, his friend posted on old photo of them together as children, dressed up for a family wedding. ‘Remember this pic makes me laugh everytime. Hope ur safe and hope to see u soon inshallah. (""""Wait for me at da gates"""") love u kuzzii [sic],’ he wrote. Another friend commented: ‘Missing you Mahmoud Abdullatif xox.’ Back in February, when he is still believed to have been living in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg, Abdullatif commented on a photo of his friends dressed in suits for a wedding. As the men stood by a white Maserati sports car, Abdullatif wrote: ‘Thanks sis, I need a wife! Lol [sic].’ Abdullatif has only recently changed his name on Facebook and limited who can see his profile. Before he freely posted under his real name to his 1,042 friends on the site. Even now, despite being in Syria, he is still adding new friends. He belongs to trance night clubbing groups on Facebook and a group called ‘i wonder if i've ever aten a Mcdonalds burger that has been spat in [sic]’. He left his home in Melbourne for Syria four months ago and is believed to now be part of the Islamic State . His ‘likes’ include a page about Swedish girls and one that says ‘Turkish girls are gorgeous’, a page called ‘Trying to convince all 46 b**ches you talk to that you're not a player’ and ‘If She Roll A Good Blunt, Wife That B**tch.’ He’s also a fan of the sexist page ‘High heels were invented so women could put away dishes on the top shelf’. At some point this year, Abdullatif’s thoughts turned from women and partying in nightclubs to joining the murderous Islamic State group in Syria. A friend told the Herald Sun that they believe he was indoctrinated via social media and that the family didn’t know about his extremist views until he got to Syria. One post on his Facebook page shows the type of social media propaganda that he has been influenced by. Taking aim at the 'Kuffar', the Arabic word for 'nonbelievers', one of his profile picture says: 'When you're against a group of Muslims and the Kuffar are against them too, then know that you've aligned yourself with the Kuffar against your own brothers. 'And know that if that's the case, there is definitely something wrong with your view.. 'If you want to see where the most righteous of Muslims are, then look at where the arrows of the Kuffar are pointing.' One of the pictures on his Facebook page shows his name spelled out in bullets . His family and friends have reportedly tried to persuade him to come back but they don’t believe he is actually fighting in Syria yet. ‘He is always with little kids there. If you were fighting there would not be little kids, maybe the gun is a protection thing but everybody has guns over there,’ the friend said. Abdullatif’s Lebanese family reportedly live near the Syrian border and have witnessed the country’s brutal civil war. Meanwhile, his uncle by marriage is a former Operation Pendennis terror suspect who attempted to sue the Victorian Government because of the way he was allegedly treated while he was held in a maximum security jail. Hany Taha was acquitted of a plot to blow up the MCG stadium and the Crown Casino in Melbourne after being charged with being a member of a terrorist group and attempting to make funds available to it. He was held on remand from November 2005 to September 2008.","Mahmoud Abdullatif fled Australia four months ago and is now in Syria .

"His Sydney fashion show hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. And on Wednesday morning designer Alex Perry told Today Show hosts Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic that he shouldn't have put models like Cassi Van Den Dungen on the runway. Alex, who said he 'recoiled' as he was shown the images from Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week on Monday, admitted: 'It's not an image I think is good to put forward.' Scroll down for video . Courting controversy: Model Cassi Van Den Dungen faced a recent backlash after looking gaunt at Alex Perry's Australian Fashion Week show . 'It was a serious lack of judgement on my part that I let that happen. 'I'm not excusing it at all because I don't think it's right, but 14 hours days, you try to get everything finished in time. 'I got distracted. I chatted to Cassi I've known her for a long time. I should have made that call. I was off the ball.' Holding his hands up: Designer Alex Perry said he was wrong to put models like Cassi on the catwalk . He added: 'I'm putting my hands up, it was wrong, it was the wrong image to present.' But he added that everyone in the fashion industry needs to work together to make a difference. 'A lot of people are complicit in that. We've all got a hand in it.' Just hours after Alex spoke out Cassi appeared on Dion Lee's catwalk show in baggy trousers and a long-armed white jumper. Instead Alex said there should be more models like Alessandra Ambrosio: 'Alessandra is the right image for women to see because she's aspirational and beautiful.' Big debate: Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic have been passionate about the skinny models debate . Shock: The 21-year-old's skeletal frame drew more than one concerned eye as she displayed her thin thighs and protruding elbow joints at Alex Perry's runway show . However Alex said he wasn't going to shy away from his responsibility. 'I'll cop that because I shouldn't have promoted that image. When I saw it after the show I knew immediately that it was wrong,' he said. Alex later appeared on Mornings where he reiterated his feelings to Sonia Kruger and David Campbell saying: 'I had to put my hands up because it was wrong. I will do what I can to change things as long as everyone else does too. I won't drop the ball again.' Gaunt: The second placing reality star, who was dubbed 'the next Kate Moss' on the competition series, revealed her  sunken cheeks and gaunt facial features . Cassi caused no shortage of controversy as a fresh faced 16-year-old on Australia's Next Top Model. But 21-year-old mother-of-one looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and gaunt and sunken cheeks, hit back at claims she is too skinny. Posting two photos of food on her Instagram account the next on Tuesday, Cassi left a string of hashtag references defending her skeletal physique. Before: Cassi had a much fuller face when she appeared on the show in 2009 . Love my job, love food, I am who I am, deal with it' (sic) she wrote alongside a photo of a buffet filled with yogurt, fresh fruit and pastries. A second image posted minutes earlier shows a rucksack filled with Starburst and Haribo sweets, two butter croissants, a banana, a can of energy drink and bottle of water which she boasts is her breakfast for the day. Taking to the runway at Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase on Monday, Cassi was one of a host of worryingly thin models prompting seasoned front row spectators to voice concern. Defending her frame: Cassi posted two images of food on her Instagram page on Tuesday morning writing, 'Love food, I am who I am, deal with it.' Mia Freedman, the creator of Mamma Mia,  dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health. 'When I saw those legs I nearly died,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 'I rang the model agent and said, ""Why is that girl walking down the runway when she's clearly not healthy?""' On Sunrise this morning Jackie continued the debate, telling David Koch and Samantha Armytage: 'Models are genetically blessed, they are thinner, longer, leaner than most average people but I want to draw a line in the sand and I think that the industry needs to as well.' The fashion industry has long come under fire for their tiny sample sizes which promote the development of unhealthy eating habits. Models feel intense pressure to fit the sizes or face loosing their livelihood. Brazilian stunner and Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's runway on Monday and speaking to Today on Tuesday morning said she enjoys eating bacon and egg sandwiches before her shows. The striking Victoria's Secret alum cut a much healthier and athletic figure as she walked alongside the skeletal Australian models. Good role model: Alex posed with Alessandra Ambrosio who he said has the right image for women to aspire to . Healthier figure: Brazilian stunner Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase and flaunted a much healthier, athletically slim figure . Cassi was the runner up in the 2009 cycle of Australia's Next Top Model which was won by Tahnee Atkinson, who in contrast is known for her curvy and voluminous figure. The young model drew media attention for her angry, foul mouthed outbursts and smoking habit on the show, and famously turned down a modelling contract with a New York agency. Since finishing the popular competition series, she has been working locally and internationally, appearing at the Melbourne Fashion Festival and walking for up-market brands such as Miu Miu in Paris. She is also mother to her nearly three-year-old son Drake who was born with a cleft lip and palate.","Says he was working 14 hour days and got distracted .

"During a month filled with dropped points and squandered chances, Liverpool have missed an absent striker and, after Everton’s visit, they do so once more. Liverpool, of course, are a different proposition without Luis Suarez but the player they could have done with most in the 223rd Merseyside derby was his sidekick. Daniel Sturridge’s injury has proven damaging. Sturridge has spent most of September with a thigh problem sustained, much to Brendan Rodgers’ anger, on England duty; the longer he has been out, the clearer his importance has become. Liverpool have taken one point from a possible nine without him and need his speed and ruthlessness. Daniel Sturridge is suited (not booted) as he is guided to his seat in the stands ahead of the Merseyside derby . Sturridge was injured on England duty and has been out for most of September . LIVERPOOL (4-2-3-1): Mignolet 5.5; Manquillo 7, Skrtel 7.5, Lovren 7, Moreno 7.5; Gerrard 8, Henderson 8.5; Lallana 7.5, Sterling 8, Markovic 5 (Coutinho 60min, 6); Balotelli 6 (Lambert 88). Subs not used: Jones, Toure, Lucas, Suso, Enrique. Scorer: Gerrard 64. Booked: Gerrard, Moreno. EVERTON (4-3-3): Howard 5.5; Hibbert 5.5 (Browning 73, 6), Stones 7, Jagielka 8, Baines 6.5; McCarthy 7.5, Besic 6.5 (Eto’o 80), Barry 5; Mirallas 6 (McGeady 31, 6), Naismith 6, Lukaku 5. Subs not used: Robles, Gibson, Osman, Alcaraz. Scorer: Jagielka 90. Booked: Barry. Man of the match: Jordan Henderson. Referee: Martin Atkinson 7. Had Sturridge, rather than Mario Balotelli, provided the spear to Liverpool’s attack on Saturday, the game would surely have been taken away from Everton’s grasp long before Phil Jagielka slammed in an extraordinary injury-time effort to cancel out Steven Gerrard’s free-kick. Balotelli had two glorious opportunities, either side of half-time, from around six yards but fluffed both. The second miss in the 67th minute, with the goal almost at his mercy, left Rodgers screaming in frustration. Sturridge would not have been so wasteful. The sooner he can come back, the better for Rodgers and Liverpool. Sturridge was in training on Sunday and joined by the Liverpool manager, who also took part in a series of sprints, slaloms, jogs and agility drills using rope ladders under the eye of two of the club’s coaching staff. Mario Balotelli missed two good chances on Saturday, including this effort which was saved by Tim Howard . Basle defender Taulant Xhaka scored his first goal of the season but the weekend Superleague pace-setters could only draw 1-1 with Thun after Berat Sadik equalised in the final minute. Liverpool and Basle have met twice before, both times in the group phase of the Champions League in 2002-03. Both matches ended in draws. The forward looked pain-free as he completed the workout but the midweek Champions League trip to Basle may be too soon. ‘We needed to see if he was going to train on the Friday to get him through to the Saturday but the message on Thursday was that he would struggle,’ said Rodgers. ‘He wasn’t close to playing. I will see how he is (for Basle). 'He wasn’t far away but not close enough to be on the bench. That pace (Sturridge has) through the middle can help, as you know. But whatever part of the game he comes on, he is a top talent. We want to score goals but as the season goes on it will become better and better. Sturridge celebrates scoring against Southampton in Liverpool's Premier League opener . Steven Gerrard is now the highest scorer in Merseyside derbies in the Premier League with nine goals. Ian Rush (13) holds the record in league games. Merseyside derby appearances . Neville Southall 41 . Ian Rush 36 . Bruce Grobbelaar 34 . Alan Hansen 33 . Kevin Ratcliffe 32 . Steven Gerrard 32 . ‘I think the game against Everton was a step towards that. It was an excellent performance against a very good side and a game in which we were clearly the better team.’ For Everton manager Roberto Martinez there was feeling a season that has stuttered might turn on the missile Jagielka launched into the Kop End net. ‘We needed something like that,’ said Martinez. ‘When you are 2-0 up against Arsenal at home and draw and then at Leicester you draw when the ball gets deflected and ends up in your net, it shatters the confidence. This is an incredible moment. Football’s Gods gave us something back.’ Mamadou Sakho is likely to be fined after he stormed out of Anfield having been dropped from Liverpool’s 18-man squad.","Liverpool missed Daniel Sturridge in 1-1 draw with Everton .

"Brendan Rodgers praised Mario Balotelli's attitude during his first Merseyside derby. The Italian, who had a Liver bird sculpted into his hair for the occasion, is yet to score a Barclays Premier League goal for the Reds and could not take advantage of a number of decent opportunities. Balotelli, who was pictured out in Manchester after the game, should have made it 2-0 moments after Steven Gerrard opened the scoring but he hit the bar from close range and Everton went on to secure a 1-1 draw through Phil Jagielka's stunning late strike. Mario Balotelli enjoyed a night out at Panacea and Club Liv with his minder in Manchester after the draw . Balotelli had a night out in Manchester after playing his part in Saturday's Merseyside derby draw . Mario Balotelli had a frustrating afternoon for Liverpool against Everton but didn't lose his temper at Anfield . Balotelli was sporting the double-denim look while his new haircut peaked out from under his hat . Balotelli was the subject of some pretty physical challenges - such as this one from Everton's John Stones . The Italian striker was willing to stick a foot in too, as shown her against Muhamed Besic . Balotelli has a reputation as a hot-head and was the target of a number of robust challenges but did not react and was heavily involved in the game. Rodgers said: 'He needs to focus on the game and I made that point beforehand. This is a game where emotions are high and it can be difficult. But you're going to be in with a greater chance to win as long as you've got 11 players on the field. 'And I think overall in his time here he's responded very, very well. I thought his work-rate was excellent. His pressure, his physique at the top end of the field for us was very good and he looked like he could get a goal. 'I was disappointed he didn't score but, as long as he's working well and working hard, he will get goals.' Brendan Rodgers was impressed watching on as his new £16million man led the line at Anfield . There were a number of impressive Liverpool performers, with Alberto Moreno, Gerrard, Jordan Henderon and Raheem Sterling all standing out along with boyhood Everton fan Adam Lallana. The midfielder was also making his Merseyside derby debut and would have opened the scoring early on but for a fine save from Tim Howard. Lallana was a constant thorn in Everton's side, and Rodgers said: 'I thought he was outstanding. 'To come into his first derby game and play with that quality and that intensity. And he played the whole game during the week against Middlesbrough, penalties and all, so to deliver that performance was great because it shows he's getting fitter and fitter with each game.' Adam Lallana was another who was praised by Rodgers as he led Liverpool in midfield . Balotelli missed a chance to double the lead before the equaliser but Rodgers says the goals will come . Everton boss Roberto Martinez sprang a surprise ahead of the game by naming veteran full-back Tony Hibbert in the starting line-up, with Seamus Coleman still not recovered from a head injury. It was the first time the 33-year-old had started a Premier League game for close to two years, and when Martinez deemed he had run out of legs he sent on 20-year-old Tyias Browning for his debut. The Spaniard praised both, saying: 'Tony played in the Capital One Cup and he played 90 minutes. Obviously it's a matter of having the match fitness. He's fully fit. He's been working really hard on the training ground and I think we needed his experience. Rodgers and Roberto Martinez - two of the Premier League's top young managers - watch on at Anfield . 'Seamus Coleman had a late fitness test, we gave him until the last second, and it was just the right opportunity for Tony to bring a bit of understanding, a bit of knowhow. 'Once he ran out of steam, Tyias Browning on his full debut showed incredible composure, great pace, phenomenal defending and I thought he gave us real penetration down that side. Between Tony and Tyias, they did a terrific job for us.' Browning has been at Everton since he was 10 and hopes he showed enough to earn more chances in the near future. Balotelli manages to see the funny side of an incident late in the game as Liverpool sought three points . 'It was more nerves than anything,' he said of his debut. 'It's a big game to come into. But I think I did well when I came on and it's a good result for us in the end. 'I was just pleased that the manager trusted me to do a job. It's been 10 years. Hopefully there's many more to come.' Tyias Browning made his debut for the Toffees, coming on as a substitute for veteran Tony Hibbert . The game had an unexpected denouement when centre-back Jagielka let fly from 25 yards with an unstoppable shot into the top corner. Browning admitted he was shocked to see Jagielka's effort arrow past Simon Mignolet, saying: 'I couldn't even celebrate. I didn't know what to do. I don't think Jags knew what he was doing either. 'He deserved it. He's helped the team a lot and I was happy for him.' Phil Jagielka stole the show on the day with this blistering 30-yard stoppage-time strike to level proceedings .","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was pleased with his signing's attitude .
