"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 1:24 PM on 26th October 2011 . America’s most powerful nuclear bomb was reduced to bits yesterday after nearly 50 years of service. The B53 was capable of releasing nine megatons of energy – 600 times more than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. On explosion, the 9,000lb ‘bunker buster’ would have caused lethal burns to anyone within 18 miles, destroyed all buildings within nine miles and was even able to penetrate up to 230m underground. From this: A B53 nuclear bomb at the Pantex nuclear weapons storage facility outside Amarillo, Texas . To this: High explosives from a B53 nuclear weapon are detonated during an event commemoration the dismantling of the final B53 . And this: The shredded remains of the B53 . But the last one was taken apart at . America’s only nuclear weapons facility, the Pantex plant near Amarillo . in Texas before its explosives detonated. The completion of the dismantling program is a year ahead of schedule, according to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, and aligns with President Barack Obama's goal of reducing the number of nuclear weapons. Thomas D'Agostino, the nuclear administration's chief, called the bomb's elimination a 'significant milestone'. First put into service in 1962, when Cold War tensions peaked during the Cuban missile crisis, the B53 weighed 10,000lbs and was the size of a minivan. It was kept airborne on B52 bombers round the clock until 1968 as a nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union. Hans Kristensen, director of the organisation's Nuclear Information Project: 'It’s the end of the era of monster weapons, if you will. Decommissioned: Workers unload the B53 bomb at the Pantex Plant near Amarillo . End of an era: Production technicians conduct a training class on the B53 bomb before it is dismantled . Signed, sealed, delivered: Obama and Medvedev shake hands over historic deal to reduce nuclear arms . Height of the Cold War: A long line of Soviet Army rockets move into Moscow's Red Square towards St Basil's Cathedral during a parade marking the 46th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1963 . The Hiroshima bomb, nicknamed 'Little Boy', released a mix of shockwaves, heat rays and radiation, killing thousands instantly. Around 600 to 860 milligrams of matter in the bomb was converted into the active energy of heat and radiation. It exploded with an energy between 13 and 18 kilotons of TNT. In comparison, the B53 had 9,000 kilotons of explosives on board. According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured. By . the end of 1945, the death toll had risen to some 140,000 out of an . estimated population of 350,000. Thousands more died of illness and . injuries later. Three . days after the Hiroshima attack, on August 9, 1945, the United States . dropped a second nuclear bomb on the city of Nagasaki in southern Japan. Japan surrendered six days later, ending the military aggression that . brought it into World War Two. 'Its accuracy was horrendous,' he added. 'It was one heck of a whopper. 'We have nothing that comes close to it . in the stockpile anymore, and neither does Russia. It's the end of an . era.' The B53 was designed to destroy facilities deep underground, and it was carried by B-52 bombers. Since it was made using older technology by engineers who have since retired or died, developing a disassembly process took time. Engineers had to develop complex tools and new procedures to ensure safety. 'We knew going in that this was going to be a challenging project, and we put together an outstanding team with all of our partners to develop a way to achieve this objective safely and efficiently,' said John Woolery, the plant's general manager. Despite being hugely destructive, the 9,000 kiloton B53 was by no means the most deadly nuclear weapon America has built. Between 1945 and 1990, more than 70,000 total warheads were developed, in over 65 different varieties, ranging in yield from around .01 kilotons to the 25 megaton B41 bomb. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 the U.S. has been steadily reducing its stockpile. In April last year, President Barack Obama signed a historic treaty with Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev to reduce the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the former Cold War enemies. The landmark agreement in the Czech capital Prague committed the superpowers to reducing the number of strategic warheads to 1,550 each - 30 per cent lower than the previous cap. It also limited the number of deployed launchers - ballistic missiles and heavy bombers - to 700 each. Many of the B53s were disassembled in the 1980s, but a significant number remained in the U.S. arsenal until they were retired from the stockpile in 1997. Pantex spokesman Greg Cunningham said he couldn't comment on how many of the bombs have been disassembled at the Texas plant. The weapon is considered dismantled when the roughly 300lbs of high explosives inside are separated from the special nuclear material, known as the pit. The uranium pits from bombs dismantled at Pantex will be stored on an interim basis at the plant, Cunningham said. The material and components are then processed, which includes sanitising, recycling and disposal, the National Nuclear Security Administration said last autumn when it announced the Texas plant's role in the B53 dismantling. The plant will play a large role in similar projects as older weapons are retired from the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal.","Built during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 .

A man said to have faked his own death in Britain for a £1.25million life insurance payout has been found living in Australia. Alfredo Sanchez was tracked down to Sydney after months of speculation that he was somewhere in the country with his four children. Sanchez, 47, whose fingerprints were found on his own death certificate, had been surviving on takeaway chicken and chips under the alias of Hugo Sanchez. His 44-year-old wife Sophie is serving . a two-year jail term in Britain for her role in the fraud for which her . husband is wanted. Police in Australia were last night reported to be liaising with their British counterparts. When challenged about the alleged . fraud, Sanchez said he was aware of reports in the UK claiming that he . and his wife had defrauded an insurance company, but he issued a denial. ‘I know, I know (about the article),’ he said, adding ‘not true’. He insisted his wife was not serving a jail . sentence but was in England ‘visiting family’ and would be back in . Australia next year. ‘Sophie is not in jail, she is with family, that’s all,’ he declared. Discovered: Alfredo Sanchez, who has also been calling himself Hugo, was found living in Sydney, Australia . Ecuador-born Sanchez shrugged when . asked how he could have the same surname as the wanted man, look the . same, share the same date of birth and have a wife with the same name, . yet deny he was the fugitive. ‘Excuse me, I am innocent until proven guilty,’ he said. ‘I have not done anything. If they want me, they can come and get me.’ Sanchez and his wife, who had been . living in Farnham, Surrey, had run into debt and he allegedly persuaded . his wife to tell his employers at HMV that he had died while abroad. Jailed: Sophie Sanchez is currently serving two years for her role in fraud. She was caught after flying home for her sister's wedding last year . She told the authorities that he had been cremated. The couple are thought to have moved . to Australia with their  children soon after receiving a life insurance . lump sum payout in 2005. But when someone continued to  use the ‘dead . man’s’ HMV staff discount card, authorities became suspicious. Evidence built up against Sanchez in the UK when detectives found his fingerprints on his death certificate. Mrs Sanchez was arrested in September last year when she flew to the UK from Australia for her sister’s wedding. She told police that her husband was indeed alive. Prosecutors said the fraud was ‘not very professional’ but had been ‘planned and carried out over a period of time’. A court heard that Mrs Sanchez was . ‘genuinely very remorseful’ for what had happened and that she had not . tried to sidestep responsibility for her actions which had been . motivated by the amount of debt her husband had accrued. Mrs Sanchez admitted six offences of fraud but denied seven others which will lie on file. Until several weeks ago her husband . owned a tattoo parlour in Sydney, but he had to shut for good after the . business was firebombed for a second time.","Alfredo Sanchez, 47, found living under alias of Hugo .

"By . Tom Kelly . Last updated at 8:46 AM on 27th October 2011 . St Paul’s Cathedral is to reopen tomorrow, a week after it closed because of anti-capitalist protesters – but its dome and galleries will remain shut. Church officials did a U-turn after locking the cathedral doors for the first time since the Blitz as the number of tents in the ramshackle camp in its churchyard doubled to 200. The move came as the Corporation of London announced that it is about to begin legal action to evict the demonstrators. The decision to shut St Paul’s last Friday is believed to have cost the cathedral more than £100,000 in lost tourist revenue. Officials blamed it on health and safety concerns caused by the camp, which included fire hazards and the spread of rats because of poor hygiene among the demonstrators. But the Dean of St Paul’s, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, said yesterday that the crypt and ground floor areas should reopen tomorrow afternoon after protesters agreed to move tents near one of the entrances back by 10ft, which cleared fire escape routes. Do not pass go: Protesters have been whiling away the hours playing monopoly outside St Paul's Cathedral . He said: ‘The staff here have been working flat out with the police, fire brigade and health and safety officers to try to ensure that we have confidence in the safety of our worshippers, visitors and staff which will allow us to reopen. Being a full-time protester might sound exciting but day-to-day it can get, well, a bit dull. So . to pass the time demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral have . acquired a giant Monopoly board to help them wile away the . hours. It is believed that street artist Banksy is behind the art installation at the Occupy London movement's camp who delivered it to the protest as a gift. The . three dimensional depiction of the famous board includes Mr Money Bags begging with his top hat and the playing pieces include a sports car . to represent the bankers. The board also includes names of places where other Occupy protests are being hosted. In . addition there is a red plastic house adorned with the Tox tag which could . represent toxic mortgage lending which triggered the financial meltdown . in Britain, or it might be a reference to recently convicted graffiti artist . 'We have wide statutory obligations to . ensure the safety of our staff, congregation, visitors and pilgrims and . final checks will be made tomorrow. 'A . passageway allowing evacuation procedures to be improved has been . created; the kitchen providing food for those in the camp has been moved . from close proximity to the building; bicycles chained to the railings . have been shifted and a clear pathway restored.' But he said that ‘for the time being’ the . galleries and 365ft high dome will remain closed because large fire . engines would still struggle to get to St Paul’s in an emergency, a . decision which is likely to continue to hit the cathedral’s tourist . trade. He . added: 'We will revisit the risk assessment in the light of any . overnight developments and subject to us getting the green light we hope . to reopen in time for the 1230 Eucharist on Friday to which everyone is . welcome.' ‘We reiterate our basic belief in the . right to protest as well as requesting that those living in the tents . now leave the site peacefully. 'We want the site to be fully open to . members of the public to have open access over the area as well as for . those wanting to visit St Paul's. 'The . mission of the cathedral is committed to the Christian Gospel message . of justice, dignity and peace. The debate about social justice and . economic policy will remain at the heart of the work of the St Paul's . Institute.' The board has large scale models of playing pieces, including a sports car (to represent bankers) and a red plastic house with a Tox tag sprayed onto it to represent the toxic mortgages that started the recession . It is believed that street artist Banksy is behind the Monopoly art installation at the Occupy London movement's camp . The decision to attempt to reopen the Cathedral comes after the Bishop of London called on the protesters to leave. Richard . Chartres, the third most senior cleric in the Church of England, said . in a statement: 'The time has come for the protesters to leave, before . the camp's presence threatens to eclipse entirely the issues that it was . set up to address. 'The . Dean and the Chapter, who are responsible for St Paul's, have already . made clear that the protest should come to an end and I fully support . that view.' The closure . of St Paul’s descended into farce after the Mail revealed that the camp . was made up of part-time protesters and is virtually deserted at night. Right Rev Knowles said he was optimistic that the Cathedral would reopen following changes to the layout of tents used by anti-capitalist protesters . There . had been growing calls for it to reopen after visitors noted that the . camp was not blocking the steps to its main entrance. The Corporation of London said it expected to announce plans for legal action to evict the protesters following a meeting tomorrow. St Paul’s declined to comment on whether it would join the legal action, but the corporation has always said it would not start court proceedings alone because the camp straddles land belonging to both groups. Lone protest: Just three tents are occupied, as shown by the yellow and red from the thermal imaging camera. Behind, similar colours highlight warmer shops and their windows. Empty tents are in purple . Returning to life: Same view of the camp looking busier in daylight yesterday . The cathedral was last closed in September 1940 – for four days – after a time-delayed Luftwaffe bomb crashed through its south-west tower. Yesterday Dennis Pinfold, believed to be the last remaining member of the bomb disposal team that cleared the device, called for the protesters to leave the site. Mr Pinfold, 90, from Leicestershire, said: ‘I believe in the right to peaceful protest, but I also believe in respect and I do not believe these protesters are showing it.’ This image was taken at about 1am this morning, showing considerably more activity than when the thermal images were taken. The bright light is from the floodlit shops of Paternoster Square . Security: A dog stands guard at the entrance to a tent near the cathedral steps at the front of the occupation camp . The former Royal Engineer was just 19 when he took part in the operation which saved the cathedral from obliteration. ‘I can’t pretend it wasn’t frightening,’ he said. After deactivating the bomb, the team took it to Hackney Marshes where it was detonated, leaving a 100ft crater. Naomi Colvin, an Occupy London Stock . Exchange spokeswoman, said: 'The overriding principle is a civil . liberties one. The right to protest and participate in politics in a . free society is sacrosanct. Tent city: A couple walk by the damp protest shanty town last night, lit by the glare of the street lights . 'We . are very keen to work with St Paul's and the Corporation of London to . address their concerns. The channels of communication from our . perspective are always open. 'It . would be a shame if the Corporation of London were to launch legal . action against a democratic and entirely peaceful protest when it's . entirely unnecessary. 'We . are concerned that any move to evict us could be the result of a . political decision not related to health and safety and that would be . very worrying.' John Cooper . QC, who has previously been shortlisted for Human Rights Barrister of . the Year by campaign group Justice, said he would defend the protesters . free of charge in any legal action.",Demonstrators play on giant Monopoly board as 'gift from Banksy'

The father of artificial Intelligence - who inspired a million sci-fi fantasies that robots could one day live alongside humans - has died at the age of 84. John McCarthy's death was confirmed - fittingly for a man who also laid the foundations for the internet - on Twitter by Stanford University, where he was professor for four decades. His pioneering work in AI included creating the programming language much of modern AI is based on. Scroll down for video... Tribute: John McCarthy, the 'father of artificial Intelligence' who inspired a million sci-fi fantasies that robots could one day live alongside humans, has died at the age of 84 . He also prophesied the concept of e-commerce in the 1970s and made tremendous advances in computer time-sharing - which ultimately lowered the cost of using computers. The death of the Silicon Valley innovator follows those of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and C programming creator and UNIX co-developer Dennis Ritchie earlier this month. McCarthy, renowned as an AI world leader who coined the term in a 1955 research proposal, once said: 'Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.' He went on to create the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Lab and then the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, serving as its director from 1965 to 1980. Inspiration: Prof McCarthy's work on AI spawned countless sci-fi films and books on the topic, including the Steven Spielberg movie AI, starring Haley Joel Osment (left) and Jude Law (right) Professor McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence' - but while it's spawned a million robot monsters in popular culture, the reality is around us all the time. Artificial intelligence refers to computers taking a 'human-like' approach to problems, looking at their environments and finding the 'best' solution to a problem. It is used in applications from computer chess programmes that can outperform human players, to video game characters that react 'intelligently' to the player. Apple's Siri voice-control software can imitate human response convincingly across a huge range of language, using very complex algorithms. None of these are truly 'intelligent' in the human sense - but they can emulate human behaviours well enough that we find it easier to deal with the computers beneath. In 1958, he invented the programming language Lisp, which paved the way for voice recognition technology, including Siri, the personal assistant application on the newest iPhone 4s. Prof McCarthy also developed the concept of computer time-sharing, which allowed multiple users to interact with a single computer. It was a major development for the 1960s and let several people draw at the same time from a single computer course, like a mainframe, without having to buy one. By lowering costs, it allowed more people to use computers and laid the groundwork for the interactive - and cloud - computing of today. Born in Boston on September 4, 1927, McCarthy moved west to pursue a maths degree at the California Institute of Technology. He received a doctorate in Maths from Princeton University in 1951, becoming a professor there until 1953. He also worked at MIT and Dartmouth before settling at Stanford in 1962 until his retirement at the end of 2000. In the 1970s he prophesied what would become e-commerce. 'He presented a paper in France on buying and selling by computer, what is now called electronic commerce,' said Whitfield Diffie, an internet security expert who worked as his researcher at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In the 1960s and 1970s the Stanford lab played a vital role in creating the systems that mimic many human skills - including vision, listening, reasoning and the movement of limbs in robots. RIP: The death of John McCarthy comes in the same month that C programming creator Dennis Ritchie (left) and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (right), died . In 1972 journalist Stewart Brand wrote about the group in Rolling Stone magazine under the headline 'SPACEWAR: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums.' He described a group of researchers free to create their own virtual worlds. He wrote: 'Ready or not, computers are coming to the people.' It was during the 1970s that McCarthy invited the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley hobbyist group, to meet at the Stanford lab. Among the members were Steve Jobs and Steven Wozniak, who would go on to found Apple. Ed Feigenbaum, professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford and a colleague recruited by McCarthy in the 1960s, said: 'He could be blunt, but John was always kind and generous with his time, especially with students, and he was sharp until the end. 'He was always focused on the future. Always inventing, inventing, inventing.' The father-of three won the A.M. Turing Award in 1971, the highest recognition in computer science, for his contributions to AI. He was also honoured with the Kyoto Prize in 1988 and the National Medal of Science in 1990. He died at home in Palo Alto, California, on Monday and is survived by his third wife, Carolyn Talcott. McCarthy's second wife, Vera Watson, died in 1978 in a mountain-climbing accident attempting to scale Annapurna in Nepal.","Professor John McCarthy's death confirmed on Twitter .

Large numbers of News Corp shareholders have registered their anger over the phone-hacking scandal by opposing the re-election of James and Lachlan Murdoch to the board of directors. Most shareholders not affiliated with the family are against having one of Rupert Murdoch's children taking control of the company when he steps down, results from last week's annual meeting suggest. Around 35 per cent voted against James Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corp. International, and 34 per cent voted against Lachlan. Unpopular: More than a third of News Corp shareholders voted against Lachlan (left) and James Murdoch (right) being re-elected to the board of directors . Another 14 per cent of shareholder votes were cast against 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch, who founded the company with a single newspaper in Australia in 1952 and grew it into a media behemoth that owns The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and the 20th Century Fox film studio. Tom Watson, a Labour MP who attended the meeting in Los Angeles, said yesterday: 'This is the autumn of the patriarch. 'The investors have chosen to send a signal that this company needs to be run on proper lines rather than like a family firm.' The votes against his two sons represent more than half of the cast ballots outside the control of either the Murdoch family trust - which has about 38 per cent of the outstanding shares - or the family's key backer, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who has 7 per cent. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has come under fire since the details of the extent of its phone-hacking practices emerged . 'Clear message': British MP Tom Watson talks to reporters during a protest in front of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles. He said the shareholder vote showed the company could no longer be run like a family firm . James Murdoch is to give evidence for a second time to a parliamentary investigation into phone-hacking on November 10. He will face fresh questions about the hacking scandal which has consumed News International for months. At an appearance before the cross-party Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, he and his father Rupert repeatedly rebutted suggestions of personal wrongdoing in relation to the hacking scandal. It is understood that the committee is unsatisfied with some of Mr Murdoch's answers and he has been recalled to explain himself further. The announcement came after Mr Murdoch's predecessor Les Hinton was grilled by video-link . Mr Hinton, the most senior casualty of the hacking scandal so far, told MPs there was 'no reason' why Mr Murdoch should resign from his post at News International (NI). A close lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who had worked with the News Corp chief for more than 50 years, Mr Hinton quit as CEO of the company's Dow Jones subsidiary in July as the scale of hacking which took place under his watch at NI-owned News of the World became apparent. Mr Hinton acknowledged that some of the evidence previously given to the committee by NI executives, when they insisted that hacking at the Sunday tabloid was limited to a single rogue reporter, had turned out to be 'not accurate'. But he challenged MPs' suggestions that this meant executives had been 'untruthful', insisting that events had become clear only over the past couple of years and the full picture of what happened was still not known. And he told them: 'I see no reason why James Murdoch should resign.' Ballots representing about 17 per cent of the company's voting shares were not cast. News Corp has come under fire following . revelations of widespread phone-hacking at its British tabloid, the News . of the World, including the mobile phone of missing 13-year-old . girl Milly Dowler being targeted. A private investigator hired by the paper deleted Milly's voicemails, giving the family and police false hope . that she was alive, though she was later found murdered. The company is also being investigated on allegations of police bribery and computer hacking. The scandal also forced the resignation of two of London's top police officers, ousted top executives such as Dow Jones & Co chief executive Les Hinton and claimed the job of Prime Minister David Cameron's former spokesman, Andy Coulson - an ex-News of the World editor. Under the weight of criticism, News Corp closed the tabloid and dropped its $12billion bid for full control of British Sky Broadcasting. Shareholders did show support for executives charged with cleaning up the scandal. Around 96 per cent backed Joel Klein, a former U.S. assistant attorney general who became a company executive in July and who is directing the company's internal investigation. Nearly 99 per cent backed new board member James Breyer, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who also serves on the boards of Facebook, Dell Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Several corporate governance experts have criticized News Corp.'s two classes of shares - voting and non-voting - which allow the Murdoch family to control the company even though their voting shares account for less than 15 percent of the company's total $44 billion market value. News Corp.'s shares rose 20 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to close at $17.40 yesterday. That's still down about 3 per cent since the phone hacking scandal broke in early July.",MPs say James Murdoch will give evidence to phone hacking investigation for second time .

Because three extremely rare Sumatran tiger cubs were wowing both young and old visitors on their debut appearance at Taronga Zoo, in Sydney. Two of the cute triplets were curious at all the human eyes tracked on them as they happily played beside their mother. But one big scaredy cat was so timid it had to hide behind some foliage, away from the many camera flashes and excited children looking in to the enclosure. Scroll down for a video of the triplets at Taronga Zoo . Scaredy cat: One of the two-month-old cubs hides in the foliage, away from the flashes of cameras at Taronga Zoo . With wide eyes the two-month-old cub wonders who on earth all the people taking photos are . Mummy's favourite: Two of the more curious cubs perch by their mother, under the gaze of the many viewers . The mother, Jumilah, took the attention in her stride, and perhaps her two-month-old cubs have been keeping her busy as at one point she produced a yawn which showed her huge mouth. She gave birth to the two male and one female cubs on August 20, after mating with father Satu. And the cubs will only be on show for short periods of time, as they tire very quickly for the moment, but as they age, they will spend more time on view in their enclosure. Sumatran tigers can only be found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra - the only remaining stronghold for tigers in the country. Experts estimate that there are just 400 such tigers left in the wild - and only 7 per cent of their original habitat remains, which is why these triplets are so important.

Louise Ginman, carnivore supervisor at Taronga Zoo, said she was purring with delight that all three tigers are healthy and strong, after Satu had been flowing in from Europe to breed with Jumilah. 'Satu was brought to Taronga from Germany . as part of the international zoo breeding program for Sumatran tigers . to mate with our Taronga-born female Jumilah and introduce new genetics . to our region,' she told Manly Daily. 'The female cub is really cheeky, with a lot of attitude and is the first one to check out new things. 'The boys are more cautious, but they’re growing in confidence and body size each day, now tipping the scales over 6kg each.' Ms Ginman continued: 'There are only about 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild, so to see them here at Taronga and know that they are part of a safety-net in case wild populations go extinct is pretty remarkable.'","Trio born in August after father flown in especially from Germany .

Controversial Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to step down after negotiating a deal with coalition allies, it was reported today - just hours ahead of a crucial European Union meeting. Berlusconi, 75, is said to have made the agreement with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, after he agreed to a deal on pension reforms as part of a package to reassure Europe Italy was doing its best to handle the financial crisis. Steeped in several scandals, many have questioned whether Berlusconi is able to steer the third largest economy in the Eurozone to safety and avoid a Greek-style bailout to save it plunging over the abyss. Has Silvio Berlusconi agreed to resign? It was reported today that the Italian Prime Minister has made an agreement to step down . According to respected daily La Repubblica, Berlusconi is said to have told Bossi: 'Let's avoid an embarrassment in Brussels and I promise you there will be elections in March.' La Repubblica also added that Berlusconi had even agreed to step down by January at the latest, in return for Bossi accepting to agreeing for the pension age to be raised to 67 years old. However, the reports of his intended . resignation were denied by his spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti and also by . Northern League spokeswoman Nicoletta Maggi who said: 'There is no truth . in the reports at all.' Mr Berlusconi's resignation is said to be part of a deal with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi (pictured yesterday) Another source close to Berlusconi also dismissed the reports and said: 'This is all part of the theatre of politics and there is nothing in it at all - it is all fantasy.' La Repubblica added that in exchange for resigning Berlusconi would also accept Northern League demands for liberlisation and privitisation - elements that they have campaigned for and have proved issues between them in the past. If true, it will be the second time that Berlusconi's hand has been forced by the Northern League - in 1994 he was famously 'stabbed in the back' by Bossi when his government was just eight month old and it collapsed. But there is growing feeling that Berlusconi is not able to deal with the crisis and there were reports earlier this year that said he wanted to 'throw in the towel' and escape to the Caribbean where he has a holiday home.

However, a property tycoon at the centre of a £750 million fraud ran his office from a basement with just 'two and a half computers', a court was told. Despite projecting an image of success and prosperity, Atlas Management Corporation was operating as if it was about to go bankrupt, with keys even falling off one computer keyboard as staff typed, it was claimed. Millionaire Achilleas Kallakis - allegedly at the company's helm - and his 'right hand man' Alex Williams are accused of using forged documents to con banks out of money to amass a property empire. Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Kallakis - who claims to come from a wealth Greek shipping dynasty dating back 200 years - asked accountants to cash cheques for him, for up to £20,000 at a time. It is thought Kallakis was using the . cash to fund . his 'very expensive lifestyle' of chauffeur-driven cars, private planes . and the upkeep of his own yacht, the court heard. Kallakis and Williams - both aged 43 - are alleged to have bought 16 landmark properties on the back of the cash, which was mainly forked out by Allied Irish Bank (AIB). However, AIB lost £56million when Atlas Management Corporation - which was based on forgeries - went bust. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting the case, said money was coming in but 'almost immediately coming out again.' The court today heard how Rodney Rezler, who was appointed chief accountant at the company, revealed how he was led to a basement room on his first day where there was only one working computer. Chartered account Mr Rezler told the court: 'On the day I arrived I was led to a small basement room where there was one and a half working computers. They were not networked. 'I managed after a few days to scrounge a computer for myself. This was a laptop where the keys would fall off as I typed. 'There was no company system as such. There were little pools of information sitting on individual computers some of which had been in the accounts office and had now moved to unknown places.' Kallakis and Alex Williams are accused of conning banks out of cash using forged documents to amass a property empire. Their trial is being heard at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) Mr Rezler said the accounts were so 'scattered' it was 'impossible' to check the rents were being paid on properties the company owned. Asked how the company's finances were, he said: 'It was catastrophic. We were constantly bombarded, as I put the phone down the phone would ring again from another creditor asking where their money was. It was almost impossible to work. 'The company wasn't paying its bills. It was behaviour normally expected in companies that were about to go bankrupt.' Mr Rezler said he told Mr Williams this but added: 'His basic view was that future financial ease would be coming. Large amounts of money were promised to follow through down the line and the problems would be dealt with.' 'The company was absorbing more money than it was producing' When asked about Kallakis, Mr Rezler replied: 'Mr Kallakis was rarely in the office. One would often know if he had been in the office as he had a tendency to smoke cigars when he was around so one detected cigar smoke but not Mr Kallakis. 'Three months in I spoke to him about the accounts when I found that the situation had got worse because Mr Kallakis, having felt the property managers was not doing their job properly, had decided to review all the invoices personally. This created a bigger and bigger backlog. 'The company was actually absorbing more money than it was producing. It seemed money was being supplied into the company but there was not sufficient money coming in from rents to pay back loans. 'Mr Kallakis had a very expensive lifestyle. It was clear that a lot of money that went out was to pay for monthly requirements to run things because he had the yacht, the plane, accommodation costs.' Asked by Mr Temple if he had ever been told anything about Kallakis' claim he was a Greek shipping heir, Mr Rezler said: 'Yes, he said the business had been in the family for about 200 years. 'My impression was it was an extremely wealthy shipping company that had been underpinning the establishment of the property business and that the property business itself was in control of about one billion dollars worth of assets.' Mr Rezler told the court he had seen other accountants being asked to sign blank cheques on occasion. Earlier chartered account Alf Burgess, who worked for Kallakis for almost six years, said: 'It could be anything from £2,000 or £20,000, but that [£20,000] was a one-off.' Asked by Mr Temple who asked him to do that, Mr Burgess replied: 'Mr Kallakis.' 'Did you ever query that with Mr Kallakis?' asked Mr Temple. 'No, Mr Kallakis was the boss. He told me what to do,' Mr Burgess said. Mr Rezler eventually resigned from the company before it went into liquidation as he was concerned Atlas Management was trading illegallym the court heard. Kallakis and Williams deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud, 13 counts of forgery, five counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception. The trial continues.","Millionaire accused of using forged documents to con banks .

"By . Simon Neville . Last updated at 3:03 PM on 11th October 2011 . TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has sparked outrage after claiming eating puppy meat is no worse than eating a pork chop. The River Cottage star, who regards himself as a ‘real food campaigner’, suggested that society has unfairly dictated which animals can be farmed and which can be kept as pets. His comments were criticised by animal charities as ‘wholly unacceptable’. 'Gimmicky'? The TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall - star of River Cottage - admitted he would only eat cats and dogs if he was 'on the point of starvation' Fearnley-Whittingstall told the Radio Times: ‘In principle, but not in practice, I have no objection to a high-welfare organic puppy farm. ‘You can’t object, unless you also object to the farming of pigs. ‘It’s an artificial construct of our society, a cultural decision, to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs. ‘Both animals could be used the other way round – although pigs probably do make better meat than dogs and dogs better pets than pigs. But it’s not a foregone conclusion.’ However, the 46-year-old did admit he would only eat loin of labrador or cat liver if ‘I was on the point of starvation’. Last night a Dogs Trust spokesman said: ‘We believe that the concept of breeding dogs for food in any conditions, high welfare or not, is wholly unacceptable. Too cute to eat: The chef said it was an artificial construct of society, a cultural decision, to make pets out of dogs and meat out of pigs . 'Better meat than dogs': Fearnley-Whittingstall said you can't object to eating dog meat unless you also object to the farming of pigs . ‘Dogs are companion animals and as man’s best friend they provide immeasurable love, comfort and support to owners all over the world. ‘They have an innate ability to form real bonds with humans and their loyalty is unquestionable. ‘They also contribute so much to society through their vital roles with our armed forces and the police, and they help people in need such as those who are sight and hearing impaired or otherwise disabled.’ The full interview is available in the latest edition of the Radio Times . An RSPCA spokesman said the chef’s comments ‘were made in a crude way’, adding: ‘Our concerns are with the farming of any animal, dog or otherwise, and his comments may seem sensible but are actually quite controversial – especially when dogs are our most popular and loved pet.’ Fearnley-Whittingstall has spent the past five months not eating meat for his latest TV series and for a vegetarian cookbook. When asked if his new-found vegetarianism was a gimmick for the £1.9million publishing deal, he said: ‘That money is for a series of eight or nine River Cottage handbooks, which I don’t write so the money is shared. But I don’t think we’re gimmicky. ‘I started by looking at where food came from, rearing our animals and growing our food.’ It is not the first time Fearnley-Whittingstall  has caused controversy over his food ideas. He has eaten curried fruit bat, giraffe and calf testicles in the past. In 1998 he fell foul of broadcasting rules when his show TV Dinners saw people cooking and eating human placenta. He said at the time: ‘People need to be shocked to make them think about the issues in eating food.’","River Cottage star says people offended by the idea of eating dogs should also object to pig farming .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 9:28 AM on 26th October 2011 . A documentary filmmaker has revealed the nightmares he witnessed after he was arrested and interrogated by the Syrian authorities. Sean McAllister was working for Channel 4 News covering the rebellion in the country when he was detained in a Damascus cafe last week. He said he and his local activist contact Jihad were blindfolded and driven at speed to a prison in the city. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Sean McAllister described the horrific sights and sounds he witnessed inside a Syrian jail . He said: 'I was placed on a seat in an empty room on my own. Outside I could hear beatings in a neighbouring room. People being slapped and wailing painfully as they were being whacked.' Mr McAllister, from south London, was held with opponents of Bashar al-Assad's regime and described how they were treated. 'When they are taken out of the cell they are blindfolded and their hands are tied', he said speaking on Channel 4 News. 'They are taken down the corridor to this, well, they don't know where they are going, the whole thing, having been blindfolded for a little bit, the disorientation, of never seeing and the person you keep meeting is just a voice that you hear and you have to see him on one knee, you are forced to kneel on one knee. 'It's a very awkward position to be in for maybe an hour of interrogation. Sean McAllister and his activist contact were blindfolded and driven to a prison in Damascus (pictured) 'If they are not satisfied with the . info, you would be brought out at three in the morning into the torture . chamber and whipped with the cable or there was like a hundred leather . belts, like a big ball of leather belts, in the corner'. His . account reveals an insight into how dissent is handled amid the ongoing . rebellion. He also told of his fears for those Syrians who had assisted . him who he said are now likely targets for the regime. He said: 'I'd seen these things that they'd use, because the cable was next to my bed one night. 'It was so heavy, it was so awful, it must have been broken bones. 'And the howling, the noise of a human being hit with that is something that just, you know, you shiver and shake. 'You hear a sound that you've never heard before. I've never heard before. 'And I've seen people dead. And I've seen people dying. And I've seen people decapitated, but this sound hearing a man cry, is just like, awful, there's nothing to compare it with.' Opponents of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad are repeatedly targeted by Government forces . Syrian protesters burn a poster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, left, and his father Hafez Assad in April. Despite public feeling against him, Assad is still in power . Mr McAllister said he did not know what happened to Jihad, and feared for the safety of others who had been helping him film. 'I didn't realise exactly what those guys are risking until I went into that experience and my God those guys are brave. Too brave', he added. His revelations come as Amnesty International claims the Syrian government is using hospitals in its war on dissidents. The human rights group says wounded patients in at least four government-run hospitals have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including by medical workers.One video, aired on Syrian state television and posted on YouTube in April, appears to show a medic hitting an injured protestor.Videos like this are impossible to verify independently, because Syria won’t allow Western journalists into the country. But Cilina Nasser of Amnesty says the evidence she has gathered is overwhelming. 'Even before I came across this video, we received consistent testimonies from wounded persons who were subjected to physical abuse at the hands of health professionals. And also testimonies from health professionals who are outraged by the conduct of their colleagues,' she said. This video, which can be seen below, apparently to show dead and injured protestors at a private clinic in the coastal city of Banias. Amnesty says the day after it was posted on YouTube in May, government forces raided the hospital looking for an alleged armed field commander opposed to the government. The UN says more than 2,900 people have been killed in the crackdown on anti-government protests since they began in March.","Government forces are using hospitals to repress dissidents, claims Amnesty International ."
"By . Chris Slack . Last updated at 8:25 PM on 25th October 2011 . Jailed: Edmund Bruton has been sentenced to a minimum of seven and a half years after driving his car into his ex-girlfriend's home in a suicide bid . A spurned lover who drank a bottle of antifreeze before driving his car at 80mph into his ex-girlfriend's home in an attempted suicide has been jailed indefinitely. Edmund Bruton, 42, from Wembley, said he wanted to 'go out causing as much damage as he could' when he drove his Peugeot into the home of former partner Tara Lavery in Caversham, Berkshire. Inner London Crown Court also heard that Bruton had wedged a 'garden fork' into the steering wheel of the car in an attempt to kill himself during the impact. Police also found a screwdriver in the foot-well of the car, which Bruton claimed he had lodged into the sun visor. The jury also heard Bruton texted his former partner minutes before the crash Bruton saying: 'I will be waiting for you in hell' and 'you could have avoided this if you answered me.' The impact destroyed the garden brick . wall and the front bay window before the car stopped in Mrs Lavery's front . room. It caused £62,000 of damage to the house. He was found of guilty of damaging property with intent to endanger life and dangerous driving. He was jailed for a minimum term of seven and half years and disqualified from driving for life. In passing sentence Judge Lindsay Burn said the Bruton had manipulated the 'extreme form of domestic abuse' as a suicide attempt after his six month relationship with Mrs Lavery came to an end. Judge Burn said it was merely by chance that more damage was done to the occupants of the house. Scene: Bruton drove through a wall and bay window at the home in Caversham before coming to a rest in the living room. The crash caused more than £60,000 of damage . He said: 'This is a most disturbing and worrying case. On the evidence heard by the jury you were at the end of a relationship with the former partner and the relationship was being ended by her. 'You could not accept that the relationship was over. You became more and more depressed. 'Your ex-partner did everything in her power to help you during this time meeting with you and talking with you. Escape: Tara Lavery, Bruton's ex-partner, was left uninjured by the impact. The couple were together for six months . 'Your response to all this was to set out in a meticulously planned way to not only plan your own death but planned to cause serious and endanger the life of your ex-partner and the children. 'This was planned not just over a few hours but over days. You went to the lengths of arranging your will, fashioning a garden fork, of buying anti-freeze and went to the length of conducting a reconnaissance visit the night before in the middle of the night. 'Your intention was not only to take your own life but to do as much damage and endanger the life of your ex-partner.' Judge Burn added he did not believe the two puncture wounds in his neck were caused by the impact but instead were self-inflicted before the crash. He added the anti-freeze he drank and the puncture wounds he had inflicted would have been enough to take his life. He said: 'You knew you were going to die before driving in the way you did. But you deliberately drove into her house, knowing that she was inside and you intended to do so in a way that endangered life.' 'It is merely by chance that no more damage was done to the occupants of the house and that their injuries were not more serious or in fact fatal.' Bruton begged the judge to take in consideration his sick mother who was in the 'last throes of her life' and even made reference to the human rights act. He said he bore his ex-partner no animosity and wished her and the family well. He said: 'I apologise for the pain I have caused Tara and her family and I apologise to her without reservation.'","Edmund Bruton said he wanted to 'go out causing as much damage as he could'

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 8:38 PM on 26th October 2011 . A married couple say they are facing financial ruin after they were landed with a £73,000 electricity bill in error - and were ordered to pay it. Despite their electricity supplier . admitting to the mistake, Sean and Catherine Coleman have been told an astronomical underpayment must be met after they were undercharged for five . years. The couple, who run a bar in Leeds, were unknowingly undercharged by a British Gas consumption meter for five years - an error to which the company has admitted. Astronomical: Sean Coleman with the electricity bill which, he says, will ruin his business if they are forced to pay it . However, the energy company has insisted the underpayment must be met - despite the fact it was its fault. Sean, who runs the Sandbar in the Horsforth area of Leeds, West Yorks., said: 'It's an amount we can't afford and it's not our error.' The dad-of-three said they had been paying more than £4,000 a year broken up into quarters for the past five years. He added: 'They were reasonable amounts of money we were paying, we weren't hiding behind £15 bills and just not saying anything. We didn't realise there was an issue.' The 44-year-old has been running the . bar for the past 11 years and in 2006 the business expanded. The changes . included the introduction of a new electricity meter. However . in August the couple received a received the ultimate red letter from . British Gas saying the meter readings taken over the five-year period . hadn't been used to create their bills. Error: The letter informing the Colemans there had been a mistake (left) and the bill (right) for almost £73,000 . The worried businessman said the bill for £72,788.04 had since been revised to £58,000, but said this was still 'unachievable'. Sean said: 'It's been terrible, stress, sleepless nights, it could put us out of business. Eleven years of hard work could be shattered. 'I have been with British Gas 11 years and to have this debt suddenly land on your doorstep is utterly amazing.' In its original letter to the Colemans, British Gas said: 'We're sorry there was a mistake with some of your invoices. 'As soon as we realised our mistake we put it right. The actual meter readings that have been provided were not used to create your bills. 'I understand that this additional . cost was unexpected so I want to make payment terms fair and as . hassle-free as possible. So interest charges will, of course, be . waived.' Sean said: . 'Apparently actual readings that have been phoned through by ourselves . and taken by official meter reading personnel have been ignored by . British Gas' central computer and have been continually estimated for . the past five years. Fears: The couple say they could end up losing the business they spent 11 years building up because of the error by British Gas . 'The data is imputed into the computer and it deems to estimate to be too high and produces a lower estimate, which we got. This happened every time over the past five years. 'If the bills had been correct they would have been involved in our cashflow and we'd have paid accordingly. 'They offered us two choices, either to pay up in full of over three years, but to pay the money back over that time is unachievable. 'They've made a mistake over the last five years. I think it would be only courtesy to offer us the same amount of time to pay back the debt, or maybe more. 'Catherine has taken time off work, suffered sleepless nights, stress, anxiety made trips to the doctor. I think I am putting a braver face on at the moment.' Catherine, 40, who lives with her husband and three daughters, Tiger-lily, seven, Leia, five and Natasha, three, said: 'It is an extremely worrying situation to be in for a small business during the recession. 'I'm anxious all the time about how we are going to pay this huge bill. We are trying to get through the recession and to have to concentrate on something like this on top, it feels like the last straw.' Sean said he was contacted by the the customer service department of British Gas who want to sent somebody round to inspect the meter and talk about the bill. A British Gas spokeswoman said: 'I am very sorry to hear about Mr Coleman's situation. 'We are investigating this case fully as a matter of urgency and we hope to come to a mutually acceptable arrangement with Mr Coleman following this investigation.'","Bar owners were undercharged by a consumption meter for five years .

David Cameron issued an apology to the families of the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster last night after apparently suggesting they were locked in a futile search for the truth. The Prime Minister was forced into the embarrassing move following the leak of the ‘grossly offensive’ comments. In them he also voiced frustration that ministers were not getting more credit for finally agreeing to the release of secret papers relating to the 1989 tragedy. 'Grossly offensive': Labour MP Lucianna Berger has asked David Cameron to apologise over remarks he made about the Hillsborough disaster . Mr Cameron told the Liverpool Daily . Post that the campaign for justice by the Hillsborough families was . ‘like a blind man, in a dark room, looking for a black cat that isn’t . there’. He also complained about the media . coverage Labour MP Andy Burnham was receiving, adding: ‘It was this . Government that agreed to release the Hillsborough documents.’ Labour MPs seized on the comments, which they claimed were disrespectful. Luciana Berger, Labour MP for . Liverpool Wavertree, yesterday called on Mr Cameron in the Commons to . ‘withdraw these grossly offensive remarks’. The Prime Minister ducked the issue, . telling her:  ‘It is this Government that has done the right thing by . opening up the Cabinet papers and trying to help those people find the . closure they seek.’ Tragedy: 96 people died during a crush in the Leppings Lane End at Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15, 1989 .

He didn’t in any way mean any offence. Encouragement: Alison McGovern asked the Prime Minister to call on to South Yorkshire Police to release its documents . ‘He was actually expressing his sympathy for how hard it can be to find closure coming to terms with grief.’ The tragedy, which cost 96 Liverpool fans their lives in1989, was also mentioned at PMQs by Labour Alison McGovern, who represents Wirral South. She called on Mr Cameron to encourage South Yorkshire Police - the force responsible for crowd control at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium on the day of the fatal FA Cup semi final - to release its documents. She called for an independent panel reviewing the tragedy to have 'unredacted access to all papers'.

"By . Rebecca English . Last updated at 3:14 PM on 25th October 2011 . The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken for the first time of the ‘horror’ she felt at watching her mother die from osteoporosis. Writing exclusively in the Daily Mail today, she describes her anguish at watching her beloved ‘Mama’, the Honourable Rosalind Shand, die a ‘crippling, slow and agonising death’ from the fragile-bone disease. It is dubbed the silent epidemic. Half of women and one in five men over the age of 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health. Beloved: Camilla with her mother in 1965, who died from osteoporosis age 72 in 1994 . Three million people have been officially diagnosed with the disease, including an increasing number of those in their 20s and 30s. Research suggests that an astonishing 1,150 sufferers die needlessly each month through a lack of early diagnosis and treatment.  Better care would save the NHS millions of pounds a day. Camilla, as president of the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS), has chosen ‘to put her head above the parapet’. She calls for an end to the huge variations of care throughout the country and for doctors to treat the condition more seriously and not just think of it as ‘that old woman’s disease’. The Duchess of Cornwall's grandmother Sonia Keppel also died from the disease . Her words are all the more thought- . provoking because, not only did she lose her mother, who passed away in . 1994 at the age of 72, to the debilitating hereditary disease, but her . maternal grandmother, Sonia Keppel, too, just eight years earlier. Camilla, 64, has never commented . publicly on her own health but it is understood that, thankfully, she . does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far. ‘Seeing someone you love die slowly, in . agony, and knowing nothing about the disease that killed them is . heart-breaking,’ she writes. ‘In those days osteoporosis, a crippling bone disease, was seldom discussed, rarely diagnosed and usually attributed to old women with so-called “Dowagers’ humps”. ‘My family and I watched in horror as my mother quite literally shrank in front of our eyes. She lost about eight inches in height and became so bent that she was unable to digest her food properly, leaving her with no appetite at all. ‘The local GP was kind and sympathetic but he, like us, was able to do little to alleviate the terrible pain Mama suffered so stoically. ‘In her later years she could not breathe without oxygen or totter around her beloved garden on her Zimmer frame. ‘I believe that the quality of her life became so dismal, and her suffering so unbearable, that she just gave up the fight and lost the will to live.’ The duchess explains that her own need for answers – not to mention the shocking ignorance of the medical profession – led her to the National Osteoporosis Society. DOMINIQUE JACKSON: Is it any wonder that when the supposed fairy tale romance of Prince Charles and Diana went seriously and shockingly wrong, that a dismayed and credulous British public went on a frenzied and hysterical witch hunt? They soon found their quarry; she had been as good as identified by Diana herself, in her tearful Panorama interview:  Camilla Parker Bowles. Yet slowly, Camilla has been gaining ground and her relationship with the new Duchess of Cambridge has been a key factor in this rehabilitation. Read more here . She was particularly surprised to learn that a simple bone density scan, known as a DXA, is all it takes to diagnose osteoporosis at the earliest possible stage. Worryingly, however, only one in ten women and one in 50 men who have suffered a broken bone are being offered the vital follow-up scan when they go into hospital for medical treatment. This is largely down to the UK’s infamous ‘postcode lottery’ health service and often depends on whether your health authority offers a fracture liaison service. The reason why these scans are so important is that, because they cannot feel their bones getting weaker, sufferers are often unaware they have a problem until they sustain their first fracture. Catching the onset of osteoporosis early . also allows sufferers to take simple steps to prevent its progression, . such as introducing a healthy, calcium-rich diet; incorporating gentle . load-bearing exercise into their daily routine such as walking and . dancing (the duchess is a particular advocate of hiking – ‘it’s what I . love to do – just get out there, walking’, she says); or, for those at . highest risk of fracture, beginning treatment with drugs. Camilla, 64, has never commented on her own health, but it is understood she does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far . The charity is also campaigning to bring down the shocking number of deaths each month as a result of fragile bones. Many of these 1,150 victims are elderly people who contract infections either before or after treatment or simply die before they can be operated on. During a meeting last week with . sufferers at Clarence House, Prince Charles’s London residence, to mark . the organisation’s 25th anniversary, Camilla spoke openly of her concern . that patients were getting a raw deal. ‘I find it very worrying indeed that people do not seem to be getting these DXA scans,’ she told the Mail. ‘It is such a simple way of diagnosing the disease at an early stage and yet the chances of you getting one often depend on where you live. ‘When we tried to speak to the doctors about my mother they just didn’t want to know. Their attitude was, “It’s just another old woman, just take another paracetamol”. It was incredibly frustrating. If it wasn’t for the NOS, I just wouldn’t have known what to do.’ The NOS are campaigning to reduce the number of people suffering unnecessarily because of fragile bones. For further information about its campaign for a break-free future visit www.nos.org.uk or call 01761 471771. The charity also runs a staffed helpline 9am – 5pm weekdays on 0845 450 0230. Camilla is celebrating her tenth year . as the president of the NOS, which is the only national charity to . campaign for better diagnosis and prevention of the disease. She added: . ‘Tragically, it was too late for my mother, but that shouldn’t be the . case now. As she spoke in the sun-dappled Garden Room, surrounded by family photographs including one of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and another of the recent christening of two of her five grandchildren, the duchess looked thoughtful. ‘You know, this has been a very personal journey for us as a family,’ she said. ‘It’s nothing to do with who I am now, it’s about watching someone very much loved die in front of you, in complete agony, and not be able to do a thing about it. ‘We really must do more to raise the profile of this hugely prevalent but ultimately preventable disease. Please do what you can to help us.’","Duchess in passionate plea for better diagnosis and treatment .

Cate Edwards made sure everything at her wedding was just as her late mother would have wanted - and that included banning her father John Edwards' mistress from being a part of the ceremony. The disgraced presidential candidate's daughter made it clear that Rielle Hunter was not welcome at her October 22 nuptials to college sweetheart Trevor Upham. She did however say her father's love child Frances Quinn could share in the celebration, but the three-year-old was notably absent. A source close to the family told the Enquirer: 'John had hoped that his two families could come together for this happy event. Bridal party: The wedding was a welcome celebration after a very difficult year for the family . 'But the last thing Cate wanted on . her wedding day was to see her father's mistress there - and she made it . very clear to him that Rielle was not welcome. 'Cate had no objections to Frances .

Miss Edwards married her surgical oncologist fiancé at a . local Methodist church in Chapel Hill, North Carolina - the ceremony . taking place beside an altar which had been lit in her mother . Elizabeth's memory after she died following a brave battle with breast . cancer last December, aged 61. According to the Enquirer, Elizabeth' favourite flowers, foods and poems were a part of the big day as a way . for her mother's spirit to be there as much as possible. John Edwards walked his daughter down the aisle to the tune of Trumpet Voluntary. When the minister asked, 'Who gives this woman to be wed?', he answered: 'Her mother and I do.' Cate - who wore a Monique Lhuillier dress - danced with Trevor to Wagon Wheel, the same song they danced to when they started dating, according to People magazine. She then danced with her father to The Temptations' My Girl. The source also told the magazine . that Cate wants to have a baby as a tribute to her late mother and also . to take the focus off her father's love child. John . Edwards, whose long-running affair hit the headlines while Elizabeth was . in the final stages of her battle with cancer, would be forgiven for . having felt a tiny bit uncomfortable during the ceremony. The initial plans were that he . would at least walk her down the aisle, but it is not known if he gave his daughter away. He avoided all the photographers - or attempted to at least - and was seen trying to make a . low-key exit via a back door of the venue. Cate . has been a vocal supporter of her father, who faces felony charges of . more than $1million in undisclosed payments allegedly paid to to cover . up an affair, but it was clear that his scandal was not going to . overshadow the wedding celebration.

In a public address in June, with Cate by his side, he said he had 'done wrong' but has not broken the law.

Emma was her maid of honour on Saturday, while Jack was a groomsman. 'They had a tough year, but they're doing well,' Cate added. Elizabeth Edwards' family members who visited Chapel Hill in North Carolina for the wedding celebrations also used it a an opportunity to visit her grave in nearby Raleigh. But they were horrified when they arrived to find it had no formal headstone and only a small angel statue to mark her resting place beside her son Wade, who died in a tragic car accident aged 16 in 1996. The source told the Enquirer: 'When Elizabeth's relatives discovered that her grave is still unmarked without a traditional headstone, they blamed John.

"'We had terrible phone calls and hate mail' says Mrs Madoff . Couple's son Mark hanged himself in his New York apartment last year . Wife of disgraced financier living in modest Florida flat and surviving on handouts from relatives . By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 1:22 AM on 27th October 2011 . Bernie Madoff and his wife tried to kill themselves together while he was awaiting justice for his $60billion Ponzi scheme. Ruth Madoff, in her first public comments on life with her husband, said they swallowed a large number of pills because they ‘couldn’t go on any more’. The couple lay down on their bed next to each other on Christmas Eve 2008 hoping to die, but woke up the next morning unharmed. Desperation: Ruth Madoff, wife of disgraced financier Bernie, has spoken for the first time about how they tried to kill themselves when the burden of his crimes became too much . Mrs Madoff, 68, said she and her husband, 73, had been driven to desperation by the abuse they received since he confessed earlier that month to being behind the world’s biggest ever financial crime. She told U.S TV network CBS: ‘I don’t know whose idea it was, but we decided to kill ourselves because it was so horrendous what was happening. ‘We had terrible phone calls. Hate mail, just beyond anything and I said: ‘I just can’t go on anymore.’ They did not drink alcohol for fear of vomiting but swallowed a number of pills. Disgraced: Bernie Madoff was sentenced to 150 years for his billion dollar scam . Mrs Madoff said: ‘I took what we had, he took more,’ adding that the fact it was Christmas Eve ‘added to the whole depression’. But the plan did not work. She said: ‘We took pills and woke up the next day… It was very impulsive and I am glad we woke up’. Before trying the kill themselves Mrs Madoff sent her son Andrew a package of sentimental items such as jewellery and when he later asked why, she revealed their plot to him. Mrs Madoff’s disclosure is the first time she has spoken in public about life with her husband, but she is unlikely to receive sympathy with many of Madoff’s victims - or some of his own family. Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years in a North Carolina jail for his crimes but the fallout on his family has been even more devastating. Last December his son Mark Madoff hanged himself in his Manhattan apartment on the second anniversary of his father’s arrest. He and brother Andrew had been the ones who turned him in but after years of negative headlines he was unable to move on, and took his own life at the age of 46. His widow Stephanie Madoff Mack recently broken her silence and told how if she saw her father-in-law again she would ‘spit in his face’. She added that she was still furious and accused him of ogling her when she was pregnant and being a hygiene freak. Mis Madoff Mack's book, The End Of Normal, also paints a deeply unflattering portrait of her mother-in-law as so obsessed with dieting she would pour salt all over her food to stop her eating too much. It also claimed Ruth Madoff has had two face lifts and would fish the carcass of the roast chicken out of the trash because she loved licking the bones. Happier days: Ruth Madoff, pictured centre, with her husband Bernie and son Mark, right. Mark Madoff relentlessly followed news coverage about his father's crimes and committed suicide last year . Revelations: Stephanie Madoff Mack, the Madoffs' daughter-in-law has released a book about life inside the family . The book from Miss Madoff Mack is the . first account from somebody inside the family of what it was like to be . caught up in the scandal. It . shows how despite appearing to be what she calls 'the perfect family', . there were dark secrets – and extremely unpleasant personalities.During . their first family holiday in Florida, Miss Madoff Mack writes how 'the . two of them (Ruth and Bernie) spent the entire time trash talking the . hired help'. Since Bernie Madoff was jailed his wife - who has stood by him - has exchanged the lifestyle of a billionaire for a modest £200,000 flat in Florida where she hands out meals to the homeless. She is also now so poor that relatives are giving her handouts and she has been reduced to driving around a rusty 14-year-old car. Three years on Madoff’s victims have finally started to receive some of their money back. More than 1,200 account holders earlier this month split the first $316million although that is a fraction of the $9billion that has been recovered.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:30 PM on 27th October 2011 . Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz, who has died at the age of 97, is believed to have been the last surviving Polish pilot from the Battle of Britain . A World War Two airman, believed to be the last surviving Polish pilot from the Battle of Britain, has died at the age of 97. Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz, credited with shooting down three German aircraft and much decorated for his valour, died on October 19 at a nursing home in Toronto, Canada. He is believed to be the last surviving pilot from the Polish Air Forces in Britain during World War Two. He fought in the 1940 Battle of Britain and served with the RAF  until early 1947. A spokesman for the RAF paid tribute, saying: 'There . is widespread admiration for the major contribution that the Polish . aircrew made to the Allied victory in World War Two and their commitment . in the face of significant losses, especially those who so bravely . fought in the Battle of Britain. 'Their vital contributions will be long . remembered.' Historian . Adam Zamoyski — author of 'The Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in . the Second World War' — told reporters that if Sawicz were the last . surviving Polish pilot from the 1940 battle it would bring an important chapter to a close. RAF fighter pilots go into battle in 1940 during the Battle of Britain . However he cautioned that there is no exact record of the pilots, who scattered around the world after the war. Sawicz moved to Canada in 1957 . and worked there in aviation. When war broke out in 1939 Sawicz fought in Poland's air defence against the invading Germans. At one point, he flew under German fire to carry orders to troops . defending Warsaw. Fighter aircraft in London's Horse Guards parade to mark the Battle Of Britain Anniversary in 1953 . Following the German invasion of Poland, many Polish pilots - a great number of whom had fought the Luftwaffe -  escaped and made their way to France and Britain. In June 1940 the Polish Government in Exile formed a Polish Air Force in the UK, with two . fighter squadrons - 302 and 303 - composed of Polish pilots and ground crews, with British . commanding officers. The two fighter squadrons went into . action in August. Most of the Polish pilots had . hundreds of hours of pre-war flying experience and were among the most . experienced in the battle. They had learned from combat experience to . fire from close range. Between them the Polish pilots claimed 201 aircraft shot down. 303 Squadron, in which Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz served, claimed the highest number of kills - 126 - of all Allied squadrons in the Battle of Britain. The Polish War Memorial on the . outskirts of RAF Northolt was dedicated in 1948 as a commemoration of . the Polish contribution to Allied arms. Following . the collapse of the city's defence on September 17, he joined Polish . pilots fighting in France. After the surrender of Paris in July 1940 he made . his way — along with tens of thousands of Polish airmen, soldiers and sailors — . to Britain, where they made up the largest foreign military force in the . country. Mr Zamoyski said that some 17,000 Poles — . pilots, mechanics and ground staff — served in the Polish air force in . Britain at the time. In the . summer of 1940, General Wladyslaw Sikorski — the head of Poland's . Government in Exile in London — signed an agreement to form a Polish Air Force in Britain. After . training on Hurricane fighter aircraft, Sawicz was incorporated into RAF . Polish squadron 303 and later into squadrons 316 and 315. On and off, he . served as a commander of the Polish wing. Sawicz was among the 145 Polish pilots . who fought in the Battle of Britain, 31 of whom died in action, and is credited with shooting down . three German aircraft. He was awarded Poland's highest . military . order - the Virtuti Military medal - and was also given the . Distinguished Flying Cross by Britain, the United States and the . Netherlands. Other . foreign pilots — from New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Czechoslovakia, . South Africa, the United States and Ireland — also flew with the RAF. A few British pilots from the battle are still alive, but it is not known how many of the international . aviators remain. In thanks: The Polish War Memorial at Northolt in west London was dedicated in 1948 . The . Battle of Britain pilots became known collectively as 'The Few' after . Winston Churchill said of them: 'Never in the field of human conflict . was so much owed by so many to so few.' Sawicz is survived by his wife Jadwiga. A service is planned for him at a later date in Warsaw.","Brigadier General Tadeusz Sawicz shot down three German aircraft .

She was celebrated as a heroic mother . who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men . who broke into her home in Early, Iowa, a decade ago and assaulted her. But mother-of-three Tracey Roberts now faces jail after a series of revelations over the night when she fired nine shots from two guns into neighbour Dustin Wehde, 20, leaving him dead in her home. Her murder trial begins . on Tuesday and questions will be asked over where she is . a manipulator leaving a trail of deceit, who planned the killing and concocted a hoax to let her get . away with murder. Murder trial: Tracey Roberts, now 45, left, fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, right, in 2001 - a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . Dustin Wehde was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at Tracey and Michael Roberts’ home in December 2001 in a pool of blood. A bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket. Tracey Roberts was heard screaming in the kitchen with her three children and deputies. Her report that two other intruders escaped sent deputies canvassing everywhere and fear spread in the town. She claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - Bert, Noah and Mason - when Dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door. Roberts said one of the men choked her . with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the . sound of Bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his . younger siblings. House: This photo shows the home of Tracey Roberts in Early, Iowa. In 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . She said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as Dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. When the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger. Then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted Dustin moving and fired at him. He stopped moving and the second man fled. She later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. An investigation remained open but no second intruder was found and no charges were filed as of late 2002. Then Mr Dustin’s father, Brett Wehde, walked to the grave where his son was buried. After Dustin was killed, he broke up with . his wife Mona and filed for divorce. Brett was distraught over the . crumbling of his family. At the graveside, he put a gun to his head and . pulled the trigger. Mona wanted answers. She filed a . wrongful death lawsuit attempting to hold Roberts accountable for . Dustin's death and to learn what happened that night. She wanted to know . why Roberts killed Dustin. Remembered: The grave site for Dustin Wehde in Holstein, Iowa. Seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone of his father, Brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after his son's death . Her attorney picked up on inconsistencies . in Roberts's story as she retold it. In different accounts, she said . she fired from different positions. But in the end she dropped the suit . just days before trial. 'J.P. wants me to get/force his ex T.R. to kill her son Burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails . Plan B is to make it appear as though T.R. had committed the murder of . her son & then committed suicide' Dustin Wehde's journal entry . This January, Sac County had a new prosecutor in Ben Smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against Roberts, who is now called Tracey Richter. A key piece of evidence had been found by investigators in Dustin's car. After months of speculation in town, prosecutors revealed this month it was a pink spiral notebook that claimed to be his diary. In Dustin's handwriting, it suggested he . had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named John Pitman . III, who was Tracey's first husband. They split up four years after . marrying in 1988. 'J.P. wants me to get/force his ex T.R. to kill her son Burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails . Plan B is to make it appear as though T.R. had committed the murder of . her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote. Investigation: Sac County prosecutor Ben Smith stands for a photo at his home in Lake View, Iowa, where he has spent hundreds of hours reviewing the Tracey Roberts case . But investigators never believed it was . credible. Dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and . he had never met Mr Pitman. They decided to keep the journal's . existence a secret. 'December 13, 2001, was a nightmare for Tracey. The nightmare is not over' Defence lawyer Scott Bandstra . Prosecutors suspect she had convinced Dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died. DCI Special Agent Trent Vileta took a . fresh look at his death in 2008 and told Mr Smith the last . three shots went through the back of Dustin's head while he was face . down on the ground. In 1996, Tracey married Australian businessman Michael Roberts before they divorced around eight years later. She tried to pin involvement in the home invasion and Dustin's death on him. But for all the complexity swirling around his client, defence lawyer Scott Bandstra said her self-defence case in the murder trial will actually be simple for jurors to understand. Mr Bandstra added: ‘December 13, 2001, was a nightmare for Tracey. The nightmare is not over.’ Now aged 45 and facing life in prison if convicted, she is being held on $1million bail.","Murder trial of Iowa mother-of-three Tracey Roberts, 45, begins on Tuesday .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 1:20 PM on 27th October 2011 . Accused: Rashpal Chana pictured at Nottingham Crown Court is accused of the manslaughter of Kristiana Logina . A two-year-old girl who died at her mother's home was probably held under a shower head or extremely hot water and was never taken for urgent medical treatment, a court heard. Kristiana Logina suffered 10 per cent burns to her body when she was held under a scalding hot water which could have reached a maximum of 58 degrees, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Her mother, Eva Logina, 25, and her then boyfriend, 49-year-old Rashpal Chana, applied creams and bandages to Kristiana's wounds but never took her to be assessed and treated by medical professionals. The court was told that had they sought medical treatment, the toddler's life could have been saved. Both are charged with her manslaughter on February 15 last year at the house they shared in Harborne, Birmingham. Logina, now of Smethwick in West Midlands, also faces a further charge of child cruelty on dates between February 15 2009 and February 15 2010. She and Chana, also of Smethwick, West Midlands, both deny all charges. At the start of their trial today, prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC told the jury of five women and seven men that Kristiana was injured between 10 days and a fortnight before her death and eventually died in the paediatric intensive care unit at Birmingham Children's Hospital. He said: 'It seems likely that the direct cause may very well have been the application by a shower head unit or extremely hot water. 'The nature and extent of the injuries that she sustained were such that it would have been, or should have been, instantly apparent that she required urgent medical treatment.' Both are charged with her manslaughter on February 15 last year at the house they shared in Harborne, Birmingham . Kristiana's burns were left untreated for such a long period of time that the damaged skin eventually died and began to decay, Mr Raggatt said. He added: 'The direct cause of her death was something known by the medical profession as septic shock. 'Septic shock means this - it is that your body becomes so infected and debilitated that your organs and vital systems stop working. 'That in its turn leads to infection, organ failure and death.' Logina, who is from Latvia and came to the UK in 2007 when she was pregnant with Kristiana, initially put her up for adoption after her birth, which led to her being in foster care for a short period. Mr Raggatt told the court: 'During that that time of foster care Kristiana was a normal happily developing girl. 'After she returned to her mother and after she spent some time with her mother the child deteriorated and went from a happy, bouncy child and went to one who was sullen, sad and depressed and one who was shown little care or affection.' The trial continues.","Kristiana Logina suffered 10 per cent burns to her body .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 10:51 PM on 27th October 2011 . An American-Israeli citizen locked up in a Cairo jail for allegedly spying was today embraced by his mother in an emotional reunion after Israel agreed to trade Egyptian prisoners for him. Israel released 25 jailed Egyptians, most of them smugglers, . for the 27-year-old American-born Ilan Grapel, who previously served in the . Israeli military and was arrested in Cairo in June. Israel's agreement highlights how brittle relations have . become between the two since the fall of Egypt's long-time leader Hosni Mubarak . - and that many on both sides want to preserve them. Freed: Ilan Grapel, left, greets his mother Irene, on the tarmac at an airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, on Thursday . The freed Egyptian prisoners passed into Sinai through a . land crossing from Israel and some of the Egyptian men kneeled to kiss the . asphalt after crossing through a blue metal gate at the border. Many Israelis scoffed at the need for a deal to free a . citizen arrested by a friendly nation on what were widely believed to be . trumped-up allegations. Israel Hasson, an Israeli lawmaker dispatched to Israel to . escort Mr Grapel from Egypt, said the Israeli government agreed to free . prisoners to ease recent tensions. ‘This event could have developed into a crisis and we don't . think either country needs that,’ he told Israel Radio. ‘This was not a . prisoner exchange. This was crisis prevention between Israel, the U.S. and . Egypt.’ In 1979, Israel and Egypt signed a U.S.-brokered peace . treaty, the first between Israel and an Arab state. Relations have always been . cool, but Mubarak carefully upheld the accord. Egypt's new military leaders have vowed to do the same, but have . taken a tougher stance on Israel and grown closer to its enemy, the Hamas . militant group ruling coastal Palestinian territory Gaza. Shaking hands: Mr Grapel, left, is greeted by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem . Posing: Mr Grapel, centre, in Jerusalem with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, third right, Israeli negotiator Yitzhak Molcho, second right, U.S ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro, right, Israeli Knesset member Yisrael Hasson, third left, U.S. Congressman Gary Ackerman, left, and Grapel's mother, second left . Egypt's improved ties with Hamas appear to have helped . secure a long-elusive prisoner swap last week, when Israel agreed to trade . more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for a single Israeli soldier. ‘This event could have developed into a crisis and we don't think either country needs that. This was not a prisoner exchange. This was crisis prevention between Israel, the U.S. and Egypt' Israel Hasson, Israeli lawmaker . That was Sergeant Gilad Schalit, who was captured and held . by Hamas in Gaza for more than five years. But Mr Grapel’s was a very different . case. He was volunteering at a legal aid group in Cairo when he . was arrested in early June on suspicion of spying for Israel during the grass . roots revolt that overthrew Mubarak. He was never charged. Mr Grapel made no secret of his Israeli background, entered . Egypt under his real name and his Facebook page had photos of him in an Israeli . military uniform. Such openness about his identity suggested he was not a spy, . and even in Egypt, where hostility toward Israel runs high, the arrest was . widely ridiculed. Mr Grapel was born in the U.S. and moved to Israel, where . his grandparents lived, as a young man. Ecstatic: Freed Egyptian prisoners react following their release from Israeli jails as part of prisoners exchange deal between Egypt and Israel, in Taba, Egypt, on Thursday . He did his compulsory military service in Israel during its . 2006 war with Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and was wounded in the fighting. He . later returned to the U.S. to study. 'The Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty is a vital . element of regional peace and stability, and we strongly support both . countries' sustained commitment to its provisions' State Department spokesman . After his legal internship in Cairo, he planned to return to . Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, for his final year of law school. A smiling Mr Grapel looked fit after his one-hour flight . from Cairo. On the tarmac at Ben-Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv, . he embraced his tearful mother, Irene. She had travelled to Israel from her home in Queens, New . York. He was also greeted by U.S. Representative Gary Ackerman - a . Democratic congressman from New York for whom Grapel interned in 2002 - and . U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro. The entourage then travelled to Jerusalem to meet with Prime . Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who warmly shook Mr Grapel's hand. Watching: An Egyptian soldier stands guard at the Taba crossing between Egypt and Israel earlier this week . Mr Grapel plans to remain in Israel for at least two days to . meet with Israeli and American officials before returning to the U.S. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo took the lead in Mr Grapel's case . because he entered Egypt with his U.S. passport, and Representative Ackerman . lobbied for his release. In Washington, State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland . said the U.S. ‘worked hard to bring (Mr Grapel) home.’ She added: ‘The Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty is a vital . element of regional peace and stability, and we strongly support both . countries' sustained commitment to its provisions.’ Israel denied the allegations against Mr Grapel, as did his . family and friends.","Ilan Grapel freed by Egypt as Israel agrees to release 25 of their prisoners .

'He would meet up with young people and he would dress like a woman, they would dress like a woman. 'It’s been at least 10 years since we had any sex.' Sheehan said there were never any women involved. 'He was into that, diapers, acting like a baby, or having someone else act like a baby. Ordeal drags on: Barbara Sheehan (left), pictured with her daughter Jennifer, faces the prospect of more jail time after being convicted of a weapons possession offence . 'He wanted me to watch him do things. He would do things to himself.' The interview airs tonight and tomorrow . A jury acquitted Sheehan early this month of murder, the New York Post reports. Her defense was that she fatally shot the former NYPD sergeant 11 times with two guns after decades of abuse because she feared that he was about to kill her. Her lawyer Michael had said in 2008 that Raymond’s intense 'self-loathing' and 'Irish sense of guilt' over his trysts with 'she-males' apparently caused him to be even more violent with his wife. He said that guilt would often send him into a rage. Sheehan says she now wants to find love and is taking college classes to one day become a social worker. But she was convicted of weapons possession in the case and faces three-and-a-half to 15 years in prison when she is sentenced on November 10. Behind the smiles: Barbara Sheehan's colleagues testified that she would sometimes turn up for work with facial injuries . Sheehan is already appealing the conviction. Because of the conviction Sheehan has lost her $50,000-a-year job as a secretary at IS 364 school in Brooklyn. There is a chance she could get her job back if she wins her appeal. Her school colleagues tesified during her trial about how she woould turn up for work with injuries. School safety officer Valerie Levant told how one day she followed Sheehan into the ladies room. 'She took off the shades, and she had two black eyes,' she said. Legal experts said the case was a test of the battered-woman defence. This is when the history of abuse is explored to explain a woman's mental state at the time she is accused of committing a crime. A sham marriage: On the day of the killing in February 2008 Raymond Sheehan threw boiling pasta sauce at his wife and punched her in the face . The issue is self-defence, which under New York state law justifies the use of lethal force in response to an immediate threat to life. Under the battered-woman defence, lethal force can sometimes be justified even if the threat may not appear immediate. Sheehan testified her husband smashed her head against a cinder-block wall when they were on holiday in 2007, reported the New York Times. On the day of the killing in February 2008 he allegedly threw boiling pasta sauce at her and punched her in the face. ‘She acted out of defence,’ her daughter Jennifer Joyce said. ‘There were no other options. He was pointing a gun to her head.’ Sheehan's son Ray added: ‘I don't think people understand how bad it was at home. ‘I don't think they understand how my father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he was doing that he'd kill us too.'","Former police officer loved wearing diapers and acting like a baby .

"By . Mark Duell and Louise Boyle . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 27th October 2011 . A mother who was once hailed a hero for protecting her family from intruders is now standing trial for the murder of her 20-year-old neighbour in an attempt to frame her ex-husband. Tracey Richter Roberts, 45, is accused of shooting Dustin Wehde nine times, including three times in the back of the head, at her home in Early, Iowa in December, 2001. The mother-of-three was arrested in July in Omaha, Nebraska after the case was reopened. She faces life in prison if found guilty. In cold blood? Tracey Richter Roberts is accused of shooting her neighbour nine times in 2001 at her home in Early, Iowa . It was originally thought that Wehde . broke into Roberts’ home with an accomplice and attacked her before she . broke free, made it to a gun safe in her bedroom and fired two pistols . to fend them off. She claimed she acted in self-defence and was hailed a hero by some gun rights advocates and TV personality Montel Williams, who applauded her story on national television. Prosecutors now claim that Roberts shot Wehde nine times in cold blood after luring him to her home on December 13 ten years ago, before planting a notebook in his car that implied her first husband, John Pitman, had hired the young man to kill her over a child-custody dispute. Prosecutor Douglas Hammerand told jurors at the court in Dodge City that Roberts forced Wehde to write in a pink spiral notebook that he was hired by a 'mysterious fellow' named John Pitman, who divorced the woman in 1996, to kill her and her 11-year-old son Bert. She allegedly killed Wehde, a special education student, because she felt she couldn't trust him to keep the secret of her plan to frame her ex-husband. Prosecutors also said Roberts made up the report of a second intruder. Mr Hammerand, assistant attorney general, said: 'The pink spiral notebook contained information only someone involved in the crime would know.' The details included the name of Pitman's divorce attorney, but the plastic surgeon from Virginia will testify he never met Wehde, the prosecutor said. Murder trial: Tracey Roberts, now 45, left, fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, right, in 2001 - a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . The first witness, Marie Friedman, said she was friends with Roberts because their husbands worked together. Mrs Friedman showed up at Roberts' home on December 13 planning to spend the night because their husbands . were travelling together on business. Roberts told her Wehde had been at the house earlier asking about work and she was glad . he left because he creeped her out. Mrs Friedman said she was surprised when Roberts cancelled their stay-over. The woman left after the pair had tea and a chat. Her husband Ray Friedman, recalled . how he and Roberts' husband Michael were driving home from Minneapolis . when they heard about the shooting. He said he let Mr Roberts drive his . car home because he could navigate dirt roads faster. The Friedmans, who now live in . Florida, said they saw the accused at the hospital and she was . distraught over the alleged home invasion and had red marks on her neck. Mrs Friedman said: 'Everything Tracey . told me, it appeared to be that way to me. There was no question in my . mind that she would not be telling the truth.' Lawyer for Roberts, Scott Bandstra, said . the prosecution never followed up on leads to find the second man and . that a forensic re-enactment last year by investigators is . consistent with her original statement. 'It's a travesty,' the lawyer said. 'She should be given a medal, not charges.' Mr Bandstra said the evidence will show Wehde had a history of mental health issues and aggressive behavior. House: This photo shows the home of Tracey Roberts in Early, Iowa. In 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . Roberts' brother, John Richter, a Chicago police detective said: 'Everything in their charges is theory, but a theory isn't based on fact. 'They could never find the second . suspect, so they assumed that her testimony was false. I should use that . at work the next time I can't find a suspect in a homicide.' Wehde was found slumped at the . bottom of a bed at Tracey and Michael Roberts’ home in a . pool of blood. A bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye . socket. Tracey Roberts was heard screaming in . the kitchen with her three children and deputies. Her report that two . other intruders escaped sent deputies canvassing everywhere and fear . spread in the town. She . claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her . three young children - Bert, Noah and Mason - when Dustin and another . man barged through her unlocked door. Remembered: The grave site for Dustin Wehde in Holstein, Iowa. Seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone of his father, Brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after his son's death . Roberts said one of the men choked her . with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the . sound of Bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his . younger siblings. She said she ran to the bedroom and . reached for the gun safe, as Wehde tugged at her hair and yanked on her . feet. When the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the . trigger. Then she said she grabbed a revolver, . spotted the young man moving and fired at him. He stopped moving and the second . man fled. She later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. An investigation remained open but no second intruder was found and no charges were filed as of late 2002. This year, Sac County, where the crime took place gained a new prosecutor, Ben Smith, who went over the old case files and had Roberts charged with first-degree murder in July. The trial continues.

"Last updated at 4:09 PM on 27th October 2011 . An inquest into the death of a former nurse who underwent a gastric bypass operation was told today that surgeons may have made a crucial miscalculation during her weight-loss surgery. Virginia Humphrey, from Brighton, lost ten stones in six months after the radical surgery at the University College Hospital London in August 2010. Brighton County Court heard how the mother-of-three, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, was admitted to the hospital 'with vomiting and extreme weight loss' in May. Tragic: Virginia Humphrey, pictured with her grandchild before the operation, was worried about having the gastric bypass . She was malnourished and her weight had dropped to eight stone by the time she was admitted for medical help. Two days after the 67-year-old was . admitted she died after the weight-loss procedure carried out at . University College London Hospital in August 2010. The inquest also heard that medics . monitoring her progress after the surgery considered that the she had been doing . well in the months following her treatment. But an expert witness explained that surgeons may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure. The inquest heard that it was possible that the common channel had been cut too short to be able to absorb food. Surgeon Marcus Reddy explained to the court how the routine operation would have been performed by disconnecting and cutting the stomach and creating a newer smaller stomach, known as the gastric pouch. Fatal operation: Virginia Humphrey died in hospital in Brighton after she lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation . He said this would allow food to bypass the original stomach completely but still be absorbed. However trainee surgeon, James Hewes, . who carried out the operation alongside consultant bariatric surgeon . Marco Adamo told the court that the operation had been carried out to . 'standard procedure' and that 'nothing unusual' took place. Coroner Victoria Hamilton-Deeley . added: 'It seems from all the evidence we've heard at the minute that . something in the operation has gone wrong and this has resulted in . malabsorption taking place and as a result Mrs Humphrey has died. 'It seems surgery in August had . effectively gone awry in a way that resulted in her being unable to . absorb nutrition appropriately or correctly.' During questioning, Mr Adamo said . that, if the operation had gone wrong, he would have expected Mrs . Humphrey, known as Ginny, to have shown symptoms, such as diarrhoea, . within weeks. The inquest heard that her post-operative progress was what would have been expected until December. Mrs Humphrey's GP, Dr Caroline . Roberts, told the hearing that, when she saw her for the first time in . March last year, her body mass index (BMI) was dangerously high at 47.6 . and, after talking to her about different ways of losing weight, she . referred her to UCHL. The retired Army nurse was then initially assessed by clinical specialist Emma Duke. University College Hospital London: The hospital where Mrs Humphrey underwent her gastric bypass surgery in August last year . She told the inquest she first met . Mrs Humphrey in May last year and felt that she did not fully understand . the operation that she would undergo. However after further consultations . with other experts at the hospital she was deemed to have passed the . assessment and was given the go-ahead for surgery. Mrs Duke said that divorcee Mrs . Humphrey weighed 18st 10lb before the operation and that following the . gastric bypass she passed on her mobile phone number and that of . another nurse should she experience any difficulties. At the same time she was given a timetable outlining how long she should consume only liquids and she could restart eating solids. The grandmother's GP said that her . patient had seemed 'very pleased with her surgery and very cheerful' and . that her blood pressure had dropped. Her son Kevin, 47, said at the time of his mother's death that she . had been desperate to lose weight before visiting her daughter in . America but was 'extremely reluctant' to go under the knife. The father-of-two said: 'She was questioning it right up until the last minute but eventually had it done.' 'She was being sick all the time. Everything she ate just came straight back up. It was heartbreaking to watch because she just kept trying to stay smiling and happy. 'She . was sure there was something wrong but when she was re-admitted to . hospital for a couple of weeks she came home saying they thought it was . in her imagination. 'Being . told there was nothing wrong, that it was a normal reaction to the . surgery, made her lose confidence in herself and feel like she couldn’t . keep asking.' A spokesman for the University . College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said shortly after her death: 'The trust very much . regrets Mrs Humphrey’s death and our sympathies are with her family.'","Medics may have made crucial miscalculation during operation says witness .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 8:39 AM on 27th October 2011 . Rising tensions in Italy's parliament came to a head today as MPs brawled - while controversial prime minister Silvio Berlusconi frantically tried to convince Europe he could save the country from financial meltdown. The punch up erupted as MPs from the Northern League took on members of the opposition FLI party - headed by Berlusconi's former ally Gianfranco Fini who split with the sleazy 75-year-old politician following his numerous sex scandals. The Northern League MPs saw red after Fini appeared on Italian TV to discuss Berlusconi's proposed pension reforms, which he had agreed with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi - allegedly in return for the prime minister to step down in January and make way for elections. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Anger: FLI deputy leader Claudio Barbaro, left, grabs Lega Nord's Fabio Rainieri, far right, by the throat as other politicians jump in . Speaking on a popular political show Fini had ridiculed Bossi and said that 'everyone knows his wife retired at 39' which prompted heckling in parliament from supporters of both men and which eventually led to blows being exchanged in amazing scenes. Marco Reguzzoni accused Fini of 'scandalous behaviour' and once he had finished speaking Claudio Barbaro of the FLI and Fabio Rainieri of the League squared up to each other and started trading punches as colleagues dived in to pull them apart. At one point both men had grabbed each other by the throat as two other MPs also tried to join in and the brawl was eventually broken up by ushers and deputy speaker Rosy Bindi was forced to suspend the session for several minutes until calm returned. Boiling point: Barbaro, left, screams and goes for Rainieri, far right, through a sea of police . The speaker was also forced to apologise to a group of children who were in parliament to see how MPs worked and who had to hear the air turn blue as insults were traded as well as punches and she added: 'I'm sorry you have had to see this very unedifying spectacle.' The fight took place as Berlusconi travelled to Brussels to assure European Union chiefs that he was working to balance Italy's book and that he would usher in reforms to promote economic growth in what is the third largest economy in the Eurozone. Italy has a debt of more than £1trillion - or 120% of its GDP - and there are real fears that it could head the same way as Greece and tumble into a financial abyss with Britain and others in Europe having to foot part of the bill for a bailout. Bossi has steadfastly refused to make big concessions to Berlusconi on the League's objections tochanging Italy's generous pension system as part of reforms demanded by European leaders but reports in Italy today said he had agreed if the prime minister resigned and held early elections. Hands-off! Rainieri, after being partially strangled, grabs the arms of Barbaro to defend himself . Broken-up: Deputy Speaker Rosy Bindi suspended the sitting for several minutes after the fight, apparently caused by comments on television . Berlusconi is said to have persuaded the League, whose support he needs to keep his coalition government afloat, to accept a gradual increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 and in return the 'pact' for him to step down by January was agreed, according to Italian newspaper reports. However the reports were denied by his spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti and by the Northern League with one ally of Berlusconi simply dismissing it as the 'usual theatre of politics that had no truth in it whatsoever' insisting that he would stay on until elections scheduled for 2013. The punch up came as Berlusconi travelled to Brussels with a 15 page letter of intent which he said outlined his plans to save Italy and would give details of proposed growth and further explanation of his belt tightening 54 billion Euro austerity package introduced in the summer. However political commentators have said that the proposals are simply not enough and are simply 'ideas' that have to be approved by parliament and are unlikely to get the go ahead as he has a slim working majority and 'will not be enough to assure Europe and the markets.'","Rival MPs grab each other by the throat as a group of school children watch .

Fawning letters from Prince Charles and Tony Blair to Colonel Gaddafi have been discovered at one of the despot’s palaces. Addressing the dictator as ‘Your Excellency’, the heir to the throne called for greater ties between Libya and the UK. It is the latest embarrassing link to emerge between the British Establishment  and Gaddafi’s regime, following revelations that Prince Andrew was also used as a go-between. In his letter to toe late Libyan leader, Prince Charles called for greater ties between Libya and the UK . Penned a letter: Prince Charles's 2007 letter to Colonel Gaddafi called for greater ties between the two nations . Prince Charles’s letter is dated June 7, 2007, and was discovered in a palace used by Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi’s London-educated playboy son. The prince praised the dictator for his work with Christians, Aids victims and the British Council, writing: ‘I just wanted to write to Your Excellency to say how heartened I am by the breadth of these developments.’ Charles’s letter was sent days after Tony Blair had visited Libya in his final weeks as Prime Minister to seek oil and defence deals for British companies. The prince went on to say he had been briefed on Mr Blair’s trip and ‘the positive way in which relations between Libya and the United Kingdom are developing’. Another letter to Gaddafi was sent by Mr Blair a month later, stressing the determination of his government to pursue deals with his regime. Former prime minister Tony Blair meets Colonel Gaddafi at his desert base outside Sirte south of Tripoli in 2004 . Both letters preceded an agreement to provide an air defence system which would have been designed to thwart the type of attacks with which Nato helped to unseat Gaddafi. Last month, Prince Andrew’s role was revealed in papers discovered at the British ambassador’s residence in Tripoli. Prince Andrew's role was revealed in papers discovered at the British ambassador's residence in Tripoli . The Duke of York was offered up to meet Gaddafi as the Labour government desperately tried to appease the unpredictable dictator. Royal sources insisted that Charles’s letter was nothing to do with defence contracts, and was part of an international campaign to free six Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in 1998 after being falsely accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV. ‘The charges were clearly trumped up and governments across the EU were involved in the campaign for their release,’ a royal source told the Daily Mail. ‘This was not something that the prince chose to do off his own back. It was a piece of international diplomacy at the request of the Government.’ A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Gaddafi was received in several European capitals, including Brussels, Rome and Paris. ‘There was, therefore, at that time no reason whatsoever for not continuing to engage with him, especially since Mr Blair in office had been responsible for getting Gaddafi to give up his chemical and nuclear weapons programme and renounce terrorism.’","The heir to the throne called for greater ties between Britain and Libya in his letter .

"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 6:12 PM on 26th October 2011 . When meeting the President, most people would be a little nervous. But one thing you couldn't accuse NBC producer Michele Tasoff of was holding back. The leggy brunette appeared to pay Barack Obama very special attention today as he filmed Jay Leno's Tonight Show. Flirty lady: NBC producer Michele Tasoff whispers to the President . Cosy: Mr Obama got close to NBC producer Michele Tasoff during the interview, where he joked he would wait until the Republican candidates had been voted off the island . In rehearsal: President Barack Obama shares a joke with The Tonight Show co-producer Michele Tasoff while filming the show in Burbank . Final preparations: Mr Obama is briefed before the filming starts . In between segments of the show, she . laughed, joked and whispered in his ear before Mr Obama got onto the . serious stuff and jokily side-stepped a question about the GOP . presidential candidates. Leno . had tried to get the President to talk about the Republican race, but . all Mr Obama offered was a gag referencing television's Survivor . programme. 'I'm going . to wait until everybody is voted off the island,' Mr Obama said of the . Republicans, provoking much laughter in the crowd at the studio in . Burbank, California. 'Once they narrow it down to one or . two, I'll start paying attention,' he added, according to clips of the . interview released by NBC. Mr Obama also discussed the toxic . political environment in Washington DC, telling Leno that: 'I think the . things that folks across the country are most fed up with  - whether you . are a Democrat, Republican, Independent - is putting party ahead of . country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation.' The Tonight Show interview of Mr Obama airs in its entirety at 11.30pm ET. Mr Obama also defended the U.S. role in bringing down Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, rejecting assessments that the international coalition he helped assemble amounted to 'leading from behind.' He said: 'We lead from the front.' President Barack Obama chats in between segments of an interview at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno . Fight night: Mr Obama has a laugh with the legendary host . Laying out an argument for his emerging foreign policy doctrine, Mr Obama distinguished the U.S. steps in Libya from the invasion and nine-year war in Iraq. He argued that by building a broad international alliance of European and Arab nations against Gadhafi, the United States saved American lives and money and achieved its goal.'Not a single U.S. troop was on the ground,' he said. 'Not a single U.S. troop was killed or injured, and that, I think, is a recipe for success in the future.'Nudged by Leno in a notably sober first segment, Obama reflected on the meaning of Gadhafi's death, a gruesome and chaotic demise recorded on cellphone video for all the world to see. The president argued that Gadhafi had had an opportunity to let Libya move on a path toward democracy peacefully. Waiting game: President Barack Obama, pictured during an interview on the 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno' at the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, today, said he would not comment on GOP nominees . Crying game: The President did not get the . warmest of reactions from all those at San Francisco International . Airport after recording the Tonight Show with Leno . 'He wouldn't do it,' Mr Obama said. 'And, obviously, you never like to see anybody come to the kind of end that he did, but I think it obviously sends a strong message around the world to dictators that people long to be free, and they need to respect the human rights and the universal aspirations of people.' Still, Mr Obama noted that the Pentagon never released photographs of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden after he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs. 'That's not something that I think we should relish,' the President said. 'You know, I think that there's a certain decorum with which you treat the dead even if it's somebody who has done terrible things.' Mr Obama's appearance on the Leno programme, taped extra early at NBC studios to satisfy his schedule, is his fourth on the show and his second as president. The appearance came in the middle of a lucrative three-day fundraising tour for the President even as he tries to bring attention to the plight of people suffering in a weak economy. Campaign: First Lady Michelle Obama and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel visit a Walgreens store in Chicago . The interview covered a range of topics, from foreign policy to Obama's jobs bill to television watching. The first segment, free of jokes or chitchat, focused on Libya, Iraq and al-Qaida. Mr Obama announced last week that U.S. troops would leave Iraq by the end of the year, effectively ending the war that began under the administration of President George W. Bush and that Mr Obama ran against as a candidate in 2008. Asked by Leno what the United States accomplished there, Mr Obama conceded that Saddam Hussein was gone and that Iraqis now have an opportunity to create their own democracy. He said he was 'cautiously optimistic' that they would resolve their conflicts with discussion and debate, not violence. 'But I also think that policymakers and future presidents need to understand what it is that we are getting ourselves into when we make some of these decisions,' he said. 'And there might have been other ways for us to accomplish those same goals.' Michelle Obama holds up a worm pulled from a compost bin during a tour with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel . Mrs Obama tours Iron Street Urban Farm, one of the Growing Power farms in Chicago . Mr Obama is the only sitting president to appear on 'The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,' a venue that Obama aides believe suits him well and gives him an opportunity to show a friendly face to the world. Indeed, Obama's personal approval ratings rank high even though his job approvals are in the low- to mid-40 per cent range. A poll this month found that 78 per cent found that the phrase 'he is a likable person' described Obama very well or somewhat well. 'He doesn't get enough opportunities to be lighthearted in a way he can be with Jay Leno,' presidential spokesman Jay Carney said. Leno averages 3.6 million viewers each night and Carney noted that Americans get their information in a variety of ways. 'We're interested in reaching people where they are.' Appearing comfortable and good humored, Obama bantered playfully out of earshot during a commercial break with Leno and one of Leno's producers, Michele Tasoff. He announced he had 'definitively' quit smoking. He confessed there were certain things that he would like to take in moderation: Republican presidential candidates, reality television, and healthy food during Halloween. Pressed to reveal what he thought of the Republican presidential debates, Obama cracked: 'I'm going to wait until everyone is voted off the island.' When Leno pressed Obama on his insistence that his daughters not watch reality television's 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians,' Obama acknowledged a bias against reality television. 'There's this program on C-SPAN called Congress,' he said. Asked about first lady Michelle Obama's anti-obesity and healthy eating campaign, the President said he warned his wife that if she insisted on giving fruit and raisins as treats on Halloween, trouble might follow. 'I told her the White House is going to get egged if this keeps up,' he said, suggesting that she might want to add 'a couple of Reese's Pieces or something.'","NBC exec advises him closely between segments on talk show .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:17 PM on 27th October 2011 . Four days after an earthquake changed their lives forever, a mother and daughter - whose rescue became a beacon of hope for thousands of earthquake-affected people - have been reunited. Semiha Karaduman could not contain her joy as a nurse handed her 16-day-old Azra, who made international headlines after being pulled naked from the rubble in Ercis 48 hours after a 7.2-magnitude quake devastated southeastern Turkey. Both were transported to an Ankara hospital, where they recovering from the affects of dehydration. Reunited: Earthquake survivor Semiha Karaduman is given her 16-day-old baby girl Azra at a hospital in Ankara. Azra became international news on Tuesday after being removed alive from a collapsed building . Dramatic rescue: A female doctor carries baby Azra Karaduman from a collapsed building in Ercis. Mother Semiha had to wait before she too was freed . Finally freed: Semiha and then her mother were freed from the building and taken to hospital . It comes as a teenager was pulled alive from the wreckage after 100 hours of being trapped underneath rubble. Eighteen-year-old Imdat was found by rescuers searching for survivors. He was lifted onto a stretcher by medical workers who carried him through cheering crowds crying 'Allahu Akbar!' to a waiting ambulance, which took him away to hospital. Rescue workers carry 18-year-old survivor Imdat from a collapsed building after surviving for more than 100 hours . Imdat Padak was placed on a stretcher and whisked off to hospital as crowds gathered to watch his remarkable rescue . Imdat Padak is carried into a waiting ambulance. The government's crisis response centre said the death toll from the 23 October quake, which devastated Van province, had risen to 534 . Sheltering thousands of homeless families became Turkey's priority today, as chances dwindled of finding more survivors four days after an earthquake struck the mainly Kurdish southeast province of Van. The death toll has risen to 534, with at least 1,650 injured and 185 rescued from the rubble after Sunday's 7.2 . magnitude quake, the country's biggest in more than a decade. More than . 600,000 have been affected by the quake. In . Ercis, the town hardest hit, rain and snow overnight dashed any hopes . of finding more survivors in the shattered buildings, and many of the . homeless complained about having to queue for tents. Hopes fading: Heavy rain and snow have hampered rescue operations in Ercis, and many crews have given up searching for survivors in the rubble . Freezing conditions: Powerful lighting shows the cold night air as rescuers attempt to pull more survivors from the rubble. The emphasis now is finding shelter for the thousands of homeless . Fetih Zengin, 38, an estate agent . whose house was  badly damaged in the quake, said: 'Everyone is getting . sick and wet. We have been waiting in line for four days like this and . still nothing. It gets to our turn and they say they have run out. 'We . slept under a piece of plastic erected on some wood boards we found. We . have 10 children in our family, they are getting sick. Everyone needs a . tent, snow is coming. It's a disaster. Searches for survivors continued at some sites but at others rescuers had given up hope. Exhausted relatives clung to hopes that loved ones would still be found, keeping vigil at the sites of their destroyed homes. Keeping vigil: A woman sits near a collapsed building in Ercis. Many are staying in the hope loved ones may emerge alive. In many other cases, people have nowhere else to go . However, while media coverage has centered on . tales of against-the-odds rescues - including a two-week-old baby girl who . was pulled alive from the rubble - most stories of the trapped have ended . with death and unfathomable pain for those . left behind. Murat Sonmez . knows only too well the horror of Ercis: his mother, wife and four . daughters were crushed to death in their home on Sunday. He named them as his 32-year-old wife . Meral, four daughters Nisa Nur, two, Meryem, . seven, 12-year-old Asli and 15-year-old Meral, and his 65-year-old mother, . Hatice. Indescribable pain: Murat Sonmez lost his mother, wife and his four children in the quake. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed poorly constructed buildings for the large-scale loss of life . Lapsing into long silences at times, . he said: 'I was not at home. God gave them, God took them away. I can't . find anything to say. I can't describe my pain.' He . stood by a ruined four-storey apartment building - he lived with his . family on the second floor. The third and fourth floors were occupied by . his brother and father, who both managed to escape. For thousands of others, the quake has left them without food, clothes or shelter. Overnight, groups of shell-shocked . people roamed aimlessly, with no home to go to, huddling around fires as . temperatures dropped to freezing. Others congregated in relief camps. Huddled together: Multiple families are forced to make a home together in the Red Crescent-provided tents. Many more, however, are left outside as the wether gets colder and colder . Although . some families were staying out in the open few were ready to leave . their land, preferring to bank on promises of temporary housing within . about six weeks. Zeki Yatkin, 46, said: 'They say we will get prefabricated houses in one-and-a-half months. We can't tolerate the cold, but what else could we do?' Orhan Ogunc, 37, was less optimistic, saying: 'After 15 days, half of the people here . will die, freeze to death.' Turkey's prime minister has said shoddy construction contributed to the high casualty toll in Turkey's earthquake. Queue for shelter: People affected by the earthquake queue up for tents to be distributed near a military base in Ercis. Many have complained about the shortage of shelter for the homeless . Help is on the way: Airport employees help load a prefabricated home onto a plane at Ben Gurion International airport near Tel Aviv before it departs for Turkey . Recep . Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had not learned enough from past earthquakes . that toppled poorly constructed buildings, trapping people inside. He said 'concrete virtually turned to sand' during the quake, and he compared the actions of irresponsible builders to murder. The disaster could be a chance for Mr Erdogan's government to show the Kurds how much it cares for their people. Having won a third consecutive term in a national election last June, Mr Erdogan aims to replace the constitution with one that will boost democratic values by, among other things, addressing some of the Kurdish minority's grievances. More than 40,000 people have been killed in a separatist insurgency that has lasted three decades, and last week militants killed 24 troops in neighbouring Hakkari province. The United States and the European Union, as well as Turkey, consider the PKK separatist guerrilla group to be a terrorist organisation. Some quake victims have blamed Mr Erdogan's AK party for a slow response and accused officials of handing aid to supporters. At one warehouse in Van, about 100 people looted Red Crescent trucks carrying food, blankets, carpets and clothes, while a handful of police appeared powerless to stop them. The British Government will provide emergency tents to house more than 5,500 people whose homes were destroyed by the Turkish earthquake, Home Secretary Theresa May announced today during a visit to the country. Following meetings with Turkish government ministers, the Home Secretary (pictured right)  announced that Britain would send 1,144 protective winter tents from the UK's warehouse in Dubai. The tents will be flown out to Turkey by the Department for International Development (DFID), which will co-ordinate the British efforts. In addition, a team of British experts are planning to visit the disaster area to check on humanitarian needs and ensure the best use of the tents. Mrs May said: 'The United Kingdom stands ready to help those affected by the recent earthquake. 'We are dispatching a plane-load of more than 1,000 tents for 5,500 people who are without shelter following a request from the Turkish government. A team of technical staff will accompany the tents to help with their deployment. 'We are also sending a humanitarian expert to assess what additional aid is needed following this devastating disaster.' International Development Minister Andrew Mitchell said: 'Britain's aid will help provide shelter for the thousands of families who are currently forced to sleep in freezing conditions after their homes were destroyed.' Turkish authorities estimated that around 20,000 homes have been destroyed and up to 600,000 people are sleeping out in freezing conditions, scared to return to their homes. The tents will arrive at the disaster zone in the coming days. Each tent can accommodate a family of five.","Death toll rises to 534, with 1,650 injured and 185 rescued .

"By . Eleanor Gower . Last updated at 3:54 PM on 27th October 2011 . While she is no stranger to being in cuffs, Lindsay Lohan has passed judgement on her own father's arrest. The 25-year-old actress, whose father Michael was taken into custody yesterday, told her fans 'it's about time'. Lindsay, who today completed the remaining eight hours of her work at the morgue, also told her mother Dina that she loved her in the tweet. She posted: 'Unfortunately.... Its about time he got 'served' I love you *mommy/calm*& @jazejazz7.' Morgue duty done: Lindsay Lohan was seen leaving the morgue today after completing her community service while she told her fans on Twitter it was 'about time' her father Michael was arrested . Around the same time her father emerged from jail after posting bail, Lindsay emerged from the LA County Morgue after working her second gruelling day shift. It's no surprising there is little love lost between Lindsay and her father after he recently accused her of taking crystal meth while discussing her court appearance on TV earlier this month. No love lost: Lindsay told her fans it was about time Michael Lohan was 'served' and told her mother Dina she loved her in the public Tweet . The Mean Girls actress undertook another day of community service at the LA County Morgue - and got back to work scrubbing toilets, washing floor and cleaning up after autopsies. She left the morgue with expensive handbag over her head as she returned home, probably thankful she has completed the 16 hours ordered before her next court appearance on November 2. And it appeared that one designer bag was not enough for the actress who took a £3,000 Fendi bag as well as a £1,000 YSL purse to her community service. Job done: Lindsay has now completed the 16 hours at the morgue that was required before her next court date on November 2 . Lindsay was pictured this morning reporting for duty, looking scruffy in a beanie hat, a green hoodie, black trousers and shades. It was a far cry from her glamorous day yesterday, when she stripped down for a reported $1m Playboy photoshoot at a Beverly Hills mansion. Back to work: Lindsay Lohan pictured outside the LA County Morgue today as she started her second day of community service . According to TMZ, Lindsay posed for full frontal shots for the magazine. Radar.com claims the actress only took part in the magazine spread because she is concerned about her dwindling finances and is desperate to earn more money. While Lindsay is seeking atonement by way of community service for shoplifting a necklace earlier this year, her father Michael was today hauled before a court on charges of domestic . violence after allegedly assaulting his live-in girlfriend Kate Major. A Florida judge set bail at $5,000 for . the 51-year-old, who police claim threatened to smash Major's cell phone and throw her from a fourth-floor balcony. Michael was seen leaving jail after posting bail and gave the 'thumbs up' sign to photographers. Meanwhile, the drama continues to unfold for Lindsay. Clothes back on: Lindsay looked scruffy in a green hoodie, teamed with black trousers and a beanie - a far cry from the glamour of yesterday's Playboy photoshoot . Mucking in: Duties included washing down autopsy tables, scrubbing toilets and cleaning floors . Pictures have emerged this morning of . the troubled star arriving back at her Venice Beach house last night . after celebrating her bumper pay day at Hollywood's Chateau Marmont. Lindsay was snapped sprawled across the floor after her garage door closed on her, sending her tumbling to the ground. However the actress managed to stay . on her cell phone during the entire mishap, as well as keep hold of her . black hat and cigarette. Lindsay's . ultra high wedge fringe boots probably didn't help the actress keep her . balance as she made her undignified trip, ending up next to a bicycle . and some boxes. Oops! Lindsay ended up sprawled on the floor outside her Los . Angeles home last night after being knocked down by her garage door - but managed to stay on her phone still . Ambling around: Lindsay tries to get to her feet after failing to keep her balance at her Venice home . She . looked a little worse for wear in black jeans and a white silk shirt, . with her bleached blonde hair pulled into a scruffy bun. In any case, she still managed a bright and early start this morning. At her court hearing last week, Lohan was ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue ahead of her next appearance on November 2. Taking a hit: The actress had been celebrating her Playboy shoot at West Hollywood swanky hotel Chateau Marmont before taking her spectacular trip . Garage incident: The garage, underneath Lindsay's Venice home where she ended up sprawled on the floor . Family tradition: Lindsay's father Michael was hauled before a Florida court today on domestic violence charges, exactly a week after his daughter's appearance before a judge in LA . It . came after Judge Stephanie Sautner revoked her probation in relation to . her necklace theft earlier this year because the actress failed to turn . up nine times to the Downtown Women's Center - a shelter for homeless . women where Lohan had been ordered to perform community service. Lohan still faces going back to jail when she next returns to court if the judge formally rules she breached her probation. The Mean Girls star did her first stint at the morgue on Friday, after arriving late and being turned away the day before. Yesterday Lindsay made her way to a swish Beverly Hills mansion for the racy photo shoot for Hugh Hefner's famous publication. The star was described by . onlookers as being in 'such a good mood' when she left the swanky . Château Marmont after spending five hours celebrating her Playboy shoot. Lindsay's mother Dina told X17Online.com that: 'The photo shoot went well.' Sources told TMZ that the shoot has been in the works for months, with Lindsay . refusing the initial $750,000 in favour of a higher price. The high-money offer is in stark . contrast to the gritty reality of scrubbing toilets and washing soiled . linens at the Los Angeles County morgue where she was this morning. Lindsay arrived at 6.50 am in a Cadillac with her assistant and driver, according to Rumorfix.com. Lindsay has been ordered to complete 16 hours between now and her next court appearance on November 2. Bills to pay: Lindsay spotted arriving for her Playboy photoshoot yesterday at a plush Beverly Hills mansion . Judge Stephanie Saunter ordered the punishment last Wednesday following the Lindsay's most recent court appearance. The . judge was riled after discovering the star had failed to complete 480 . hours of community service she was ordered to complete as part of her . sentence for the theft of a gold necklace earlier this year. Lindsay was handcuffed and taken into custody before later posting $100,000 bail.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:04 AM on 28th October 2011 . TV presenter Eamonn Holmes has been criticised for telling a rape victim: 'I hope you take taxis now.' Viewers of ITV's This Morning have reacted with outrage, claiming that Holmes appeared to blame the victim for making herself vulnerable. He made the controversial remarks during an interview with Hannah Cant, 20, who was raped by a stranger when she was 18. Controversial: Presenter Eamonn Holmes has been accused of 'victim blaming' following his remarks to rape victim Hannah Cant on live TV . She had been walking home from a night out in Chippenham, Wiltshire, when she was dragged into a car and subjected to a sex attack by soldier Jonathan Haynes. She had the presence of mind to tear out strands of her own hair and spit in the car to leave her DNA at the scene after seeing a similar tactic used on TV show CSI. She took the brave step of waiving her right to anonymity to appear on This Morning to speak about her ordeal a month after Haynes was jailed for at least 11 years. Holmes, 51, introduced the interview, saying: 'She was on her way home from a night out with her friends and walking home - didn't take a taxi. 'It's that old thing, I always say. Why were you tempted to walk home?' Brave: Hannah Cant appeared on This Morning to talk about being raped aged 18 . Miss Cant explained she had been with a friend and had walked the last two streets alone to her home as she had done many times before. She said: 'I thought it would be OK.' Holmes said: 'But it wasn't.' Miss Cant went on to speak of how she feared she would die during the ordeal, and then feared for her life after her attacker warned her not to go to the police. At the end of the interview, after thanking her for appearing, Holmes said: 'I hope you take taxis now. Everywhere you go, coming home at night.' He then turned and asked his wife and co-presenter Ruth Langsford: 'How many times do I tell people who I know to take taxis?' Hundreds of outraged viewers took to social media websites to protest, accusing the presenter of 'victim blaming'. Interview: Mr Holmes told Miss Cant she should have taken a taxi home before turning to wife Ruth Langsford, right, and asking 'How many times do I tell people to take taxis?' Philippa Willitts wrote on the blog of the women's rights site F-Word: 'The moral of the whole story was that, frankly, none of this would have happened if she hadn't dared to be outside, near her house, when a kidnapper and rapist was around. 'The victim-blaming attitude encompassed in that one sentence is as astounding as it is offensive. 'The truth is that women cannot win with attitudes like Eamonn Holmes's around. If we don't blame the perpetrator, things will never, ever change.' Others took to Twitter, expressing their views using the tags #victimblaming and #patronisingfatherfigure. @absinthetweets wrote: 'Hard to believe that Eamonn Holmes comment. Just hand-to-mouth-shocked-face awful.' Another commentator wrote online: 'I can't believe that they would ruin a brave woman's (most likely) harrowing interview by making such a flippant, dismissive and stupid comment.' Holmes apologised on air earlier this month after This Morning viewers complained at him branding celebrity guest Jonathan Wilkes 'retarded'. A spokesman for ITV confirmed they had received 26 complaints from viewers about Eamonn Holmes' comments since they were broadcast on Tuesday morning. But she said: 'Eamonn was in no way suggesting that the victim was in any way to blame for this horrific attack. 'His interview was carried out with the utmost care and compassion and his comments were intended to highlight safety advice. 'Hannah was happy with the interview and not in any way offended by Eammon's advice.'","ITV confirm his comments have sparked viewer outrage .

Screened: Ayesha Niles, now 18, was arrested at Miami International Airport after allegedly trying to smuggle 30lbs of cocaine in her luggage . A British teenager is facing 15 years in prison after being caught smuggling 30lb of cocaine into America. Ayesha Olivia Niles was picked out by customs officers at Miami Airport in Florida. Agents found the packs of cocaine stuffed into 24 boxes of cake mix. Niles, who turned 18 while being held in a juvenile detention centre, flew in from Jamaica last Friday.

Mr Alonzo's remarks were the first extended public comments from police about the case and some neighbouring parents had earlier told of their upset at the lack of information.

Eric Reeves, 68, shot five-month old Hartley after 'losing control' on August 8 at his home in Bradenham near Dereham, Norfolk. Reeves admitted a charge of causing unnecessary suffering but claimed he had not realised the cat belonged to his neighbour, Nicholas Townley. Guilty: Eric Reeves was ordered to do 100 hours' unpaid work and pay £400 in costs for the shooting . Tame: Five-month-old ginger cat Hartley managed to return home to his owner after he was shot . He said that he had thought the ginger and white cat was feral. The cat survived and managed to walk back to his owner's home, King's Lynn Magistrates court heard. Jonathan Eales, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA said: 'Mr Townley examined the cat and found bleeding coming from his right-hand side and when he tried to clean the wound the cat was sick. 'Mr Townley took the cat to see a vet who told him the cat had a puncture wound which would have been caused by a fall or an air gun pellet. 'As Mr Townley didn't think it was a pellet, the cat was given antibiotics', it was reported in The Daily Telegraph. An X-ray later revealed that the air gun pellet had punctured the cat's intestine. Mr Townley found his pet in distress the next morning and took it back to the veterinary surgery but it died on arrival. Reeves later went to see Mr Townley at his home where he admitted to the shooting. He explained that he shot the animal as he was having problems with feral cats scaring birds from his garden. The court heard that Reeves feeds wild birds that come to his garden and when he saw the cat, he 'lost it'. Ian Graham, defending said: 'He has shown a lot of remorse and is horrified by the pain the cat suffered. 'He is a bird lover and likes to spend his money on bird feed. 'He also used to have a cat himself. He has no bad attitude towards animals or cats and offered to pay for the vet bills but that offer was rejected.' Reeves was ordered to do 100 hours' unpaid work and pay £400 in costs. RSPCA inspector, Dave Padmore said: 'This sends out a clear message that it is unacceptable to go around shooting animals.'","Retired builder admitted 'losing control' before the shooting .

In the weeks after Brandon fell ill in June, parents Tonya and Raymond Rice have spoken out about the drug - known by various names, such as K2, Spice, Blaze and Vanilla Sky - in hopes to raise awareness about its potentially lethal side-effects. Tonya Rice told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper Brandon . was put on a respirator in June after smoking Spice fake cannabis, . which is said to be ten times more dangerous than cocaine. She said: 'He was smart. He was caring. He was a good baseball player. He loved to hunt. He . loved to fish. He was a fighter.'

Governor Tom Corbett signed legislation outlawing synthetic marijuana  a few days after the Brandon Rice became ill. The ban took effect in August. Pennsylvania became the 21st state to . ban the sale of synthetic drugs, which are known to cause agitation, . paranoia and hallucinations, according to the National Institutes of . Health.

Laboratory-made drugs have been around since the middle of the 20th century, when LSD was first studied. But synthetic marijuana - produced by spraying dried plant material with a chemical compound - has only been around for the last few years. Effects include paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, seizures and a rapid heartbeat and symptoms can last for days. Doctors usually treat overdoses with anti-anxiety drugs like Valium and Xanax which slow the heart rate. One patient told a doctor at the Carolinas Poison Center it was 'like being on cocaine, but ten times worse'. The drugs, legal in many states, are marketed as 'soothing' bath salts or incense and can be bought for as little as $10 a time. Cases relating to Spice and bath salts are becoming increasing frequent and have been implicated in at least ten deaths since last year, including the suicide of 18-year-old David Rozga, who shot himself after taking marijuana-like substance K2. In March, former Rutgers student William Parisio was charged with murdering his girlfriend after taking bath salts. In January, Neil Brown, from Missouri, used a hunting knife to slit his face and stomach after taking bath salts. Earlier this year in Kentucky, a . young woman who had taken bath salts became convinced her two-year-old . son was a demon when she was driving along the highway. A dozen students have also been expelled from the U.S. Naval Academy for taking or possessing the same drug, which can cause seizures, hallucinations and extreme paranoia. Synthetic drugs have surged in popularity particularly this year as they become more widely available. The synthetically-produced drugs can be snorted or smoked and are popular because they do not show up in drugs tests. Last year fake marijuana, known as Spice or K2 was the most popular . substance, but this year bath salts - sold under innocuous names like . Bliss or Ivory Wave - have taken over. Figures released by the American Association of Poison Control Centers released earlier this year show at least 2,700 people have fallen ill after taking the drugs since January, compared to just 3,200 in the whole of 2010. They have received 1,300 calls about synthetic marijuana this year alone - compared with 2,874 calls for the whole of 2010 - while calls for bath salts have rocketed, with 1,400 since January compared to just 301 last year.",Brandon Rice sustained chemical burns to his lungs .
"By . Sam Greenhill . Last updated at 1:00 AM on 29th October 2011 . Colonel Gaddafi’s fugitive son Saif al-Islam is trying to reach a safe haven in Zimbabwe while also negotiating to surrender, officials said yesterday. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague confirmed it was in ‘indirect’ talks with the London-educated playboy. Saif, 39 - who was Gaddafi’s heir apparent - has been indicted for war crimes and is on the run in the Sahara desert. He has laid down conditions for handing himself in for trial, including being found a safe country to live in if he is acquitted or after serving a prison sentence. But double-dealing Saif is also in talks with mercenaries willing to find him a safe haven under the protection of another African despot such as Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. ‘We are having informal conversations with Saif Gaddafi in order to see if he can be surrendered to the court,’ Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the ICC, said in The Netherlands yesterday. Remarkable turnaround: Libyans gather at a market today in the grounds of the Bab al-Aziziya compound, formerly the HQ of ousted leader Colonel Gaddafi . But he said Saif was also trying to reach a country that did not cooperate with handing over suspects to the ICC. ‘We know he has a different option, because apparently there is a group of mercenaries willing to move him to a country, probably Zimbabwe,’ the prosecutor said. Some of the mercenaries may be from South Africa, he said. He said the court was urging other countries to prevent Saif’s escape by denying any plane carrying him permission to fly through their air space. Will he put his hands up? Saif al-Islam went on TV in August (above) to declare he would not surrender. He is wanted on charges of inciting crowds to murder during the early stages of the Libyan revolution . He said Saif – who would use any trial to grandstand about his relationships with Western leaders such as Tony Blair and Lord Mandelson – was making all sorts of demands. Successful mission: Nato says it will be able to quickly wind down operations in Libya since the death of Saif's father Colonel Gaddafi . He was pressing for clarifications about his fate should he be acquitted, said Mr Moreno-Ocampo, who said he has made it clear to the fugitive that he could ask the judges to send him to a country other than Libya. ‘He says he is innocent and he will prove his innocence,’ said the prosecutor. Saif is deep in the desert, believed to have crossed from Libya to Niger with escorts from Toureg herdsmen. Niger has said it would hand him over to the ICC, so Saif is unlikely to stay there long. His co-fugitive, Libya’s former intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi, made the same journey a day earlier and ended up in eastern Mali, near Timbuktoo. But Mali’s Foreign Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga said yesterday: ‘Mali will respect its obligations in relation to the International Criminal Court. We are absolutely clear on that.’ In Libya, new Justice Minister Mohammed al-Lagi told the Daily Mail last night: ‘If Saif is captured in Libya, he will be tried in Libya.’","Nato says it will end air strikes on Monday .

Speaking at their home in Almocageme near Lisbon, Maria do Rosario Valente said that Wright suffers from glaucoma, 'very, very high' blood pressure caused by recent stress, and has complained of chest pains. She said: 'We're having a bunch of tests done to see what's his current health condition.' 'Unwell': Fugitive George Wright looks at his wife Maria do Rosario Valente in their kitchen at home in Almocageme, near Lisbon, on Friday. She claims he suffers from various health problems and should not be extradited from Portugal to the U.S. Wright's lawyer Manuel Luis Ferreira . said he intends to include his client's poor health in his legal . arguments against extradition. Mr Ferreira said: 'I didn't initially realise how bad he was. Now I've got to know him, I know his problems.' The U.S. wants Wright returned to serve the remainder of his 15- to 30-year sentence for a 1962 murder in New Jersey. The 68-year-old was on the run for 41 years until his . arrest in Portugal a month ago. He was convicted of the murder of Walter . Patterson, a service station worker in Wall Township, New Jersey. He broke out of . the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, in 1970 after serving . more than seven years. The FBI says Wright also was part of a . Black Liberation Army group that hijacked a U.S. plane from Detroit . Metropolitan Airport to Algeria in 1972. After that, Wright went on the . lam. The couple married in 1991 and have two children. Wright is currently under house arrest and wears an electronic tag as legal proceedings about his extradition take place . Walter Patterson's daughter, Ann Patterson, now 63, said she wants Wright extradited to serve the rest of his sentence. She said that recent weeks have caused her family sleepless nights. ""Our world has been turned upside down,"" she said. ""We've now had to grieve for our father for the second time when we never should have had to the first time."" She declined to comment on Wright's lawyer's plans to use his health condition as a reason to fight extradition. Ms Valente said her husband, who she has lived with for 20 years, regrets his criminal past and has become a more peaceful man since his days in the Black Liberation Army.

Wright, . a tall, slim man with his head shaved and wearing glasses, is not . allowed to discuss his extradition case due to Portugal's judicial . secrecy laws. 'He regrets . the choices he made,' Ms Valente said of her husband's past. 'If he . could, probably he'd have made different choices.' Many . locals in this hamlet near Lisbon describe Wright as a friendly, . church-going family man. He has a grown daughter and son with Valente. Some assumed he was from Africa when he moved here. Hijack: Dressed as a priest, Wright hijacked a plane bound for Detroit in 1972. FBI agents tried to negotiate with them before they escaped to Algeria with a $1million ransom .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 10:44 PM on 27th October 2011 . Intimate letters to a pen friend from Amanda Knox have revealed new details of the four years she spent in prison wrongly accused of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox, 24, received - and wrote - thousands of letters during her time in jail with many coming from male admirers who wanted to marry her and she only wrote back to people she knew in trusted. She was sensationally released earlier this month along with her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, after a year long appeal showed they had been convicted thanks to a botched police forensic investigation. Behind bars: Before her release Amanda Knox wrote and received thousands of letters . In the letters Knox speaks of her fear at spending the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did not commit and tells her friend - known only as Maurizio - of how she spends her time in jail listening to music, studying and have a cell mate give her a manicure. She wrote: 'I often think ""Why am I here ?"", ""Why can't I be with my mum"", ""Why am I in jail ? I am 20 years old, I have never committed a crime. There is no sense to this. How can they say I need to stay in prison because I am a danger to the people around me? When above all they do not know the truth!"" 'It is truly a torture and now I know the reason. I know the reason but I don't agree with it. It is a torture. I am being tortured and I do not agree with it. I'm sorry. As I say I am suffering so much in prison. I feel scared, lonely without hope, tired even though I am innocent.' Famous: Amanda Knox breaks down in tears after hearing the verdict that overturns her conviction, and she maintained her innocence throughout the letters . The letter was written in April 2008, shortly after Italy's Supreme Court overturned an application for bail and speaking of the ruling to keep her in jail she said: 'I don't understand how some judges can sleep at night. When they know a big mistake has been made. Ah...mamma mia... 'Anyway I am studying so much, I even started reading Italian poetry....I pass the time reading books and singing (I am still in isolation) so when I get my fresh air time I get plenty of sun but I am still so very, very white.' In another letter Knox wrote of how she was not allowed to accept books with a hardback cover and expressed her regret that one she had been sent was not given to her adding: 'I've asked for it to be kept - it would be a shame to ruin such a lovely book. I'll read it when I am out.' Not mentioned: Amanda Knox's letters never spoke about Meredith Kercher, the British girl she was wrongly convicted of killing . Knox never mentions Meredith - who was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared - in her letters, instead she insists repeatedly she is innocent of the murder she has been accused and later convicted of. Knox also describes her daily routine in jail and in one undated letter wrote: 'I'm happy that I am staying in Perugia (jail). I don't want to start all over again in a new place and I've heard the jails in Rome can be quote tough. 'I'm doing fine in my new cell. I swapped so that I could be with a girl my age. We joke, cook and give each other manicures. We listen to lots of music because we are allowed a radio.' In another letter written in November 2009 - just days before she was convicted of murder and given 26 years Knox wrote of her hopes that she would be released and said: 'I suppose you are still playing basketball. I'm terrible at basketball because I have small hands and I can't control the ball. 'All of my family will be in court tomorrow. My dad, mum, stepmother and my aunt. My three sisters are arriving on December 2. I hope so much that I can finally go home with them, at last. I can see it in my ''third eye'' I'm sitting on the plane between my mum and sisters. Maybe I am thinking too much about it.' The letters are always signed off by Beatles fan Knox the same way with a line from the Fab Four's hit Let It Be - 'Here comes the Sun' before she ends with the words: 'I know that I am not alone even when I am alone.' Home: Amanda Knox has kept a low-profile since returning to Seattle but was shown smiling during a walk holding chocolate and toothpaste earlier this month . Knox has kept a low profile since returning to her native Seattle earlier this month, while Sollecito has also remained in his home at Bisceglie near Bari although in a recent interview he said the couple 'wrote and spoke' to each other every day and he planned to visit her in the United States. Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal the verdict although nothing will happen until early next year when the appeal judge publishes his report into the the sentencing which will be studied intently to see on what grounds they can act on. However there is no obligation for Knox to return to Italy as the Supreme Court who would look at any eventual appeal will sit in Rome and examine the case to see if any mistakes were made in the application of the law and if they decide there were any than a new trial could be ordered. Free: Amanda Knox's ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito walking with his sister, father and father's girlfriend since his release. He has also spoken to Miss Knox and may visit . Technically they could request Knox's extradition but it is thought highly unlikely that the United States would hand her over for trial. Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was a Leeds University student who was in Perugia as part of her degree course and had only been in Italy for two months before she was murdered four years ago next week. Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede was convicted of her murder and sexual assault in 2008 and given 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal.","Notes reveal she spent her time in jail listening to music, studying and having manicures from cell mate .

"Brittany Norwood, 29, allegedly attacked with a foot-long metal bar from a merchandise stand . Victim Jayna Murray, 30, suffered 322 injuries . Miss Murray's trousers were cut to make it appear she had been sexually assaulted by an intruder . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 2:16 PM on 28th October 2011 . A yoga store worker is accused of beating her colleague to death with a foot-long metal bar that formed a merchandise stand at the shop. Brittany Norwood, 29, is said to have chased 30-year-old Jayna Murray through the Bethesda store and also attacked her with a hammer, wrench, knife and peg used to hold up a mannequin. The prosecution at the high-profile trial in Maryland has said that Miss Murray was dead in 15 minutes after 'a brutal and prolonged attack' that left the victim with hundreds of injuries. Colleagues: Brittany Norwood (left) is accused of killing co-worker Jayna Murray (right) at a yoga store in Bethesda, Maryland where they both worked . State’s attorney John McCarthy told the jury at Montgomery County Circuit Court in Rockville, Maryland that Norwood also tried to strangle Murray at Lululemon Athletica store. Mr McCarthy showed the court a bloodstained piece of rope, adding: 'And you can see the hair, Jayna’s hair, hanging on the rope.' At one point on that night, he said, . an employee at the Apple Store next door heard a woman’s voice cry . out,'Oh God, please help me'. The worker pounded on the wall but did not take further action. On the morning of March 12 this year, police discovered Miss Murray dead on the floor of the store and Norwood tied up in the bathroom. Brutal: A photograph inside the yoga shop in Maryland where Brittany Norwood is accused of bludgeoning her colleague to death before staging a robbery . The accused would later tell . detectives she had been attacked by masked men who slipped into the . store after closing time in order to rob them. Police at first considered Norwood a victim before their suspicions were aroused. The prosecution claim that Norwood staged a robbery and tossed . mops, brooms and chairs around the shop. She also cut the victim's trousers to make it appear that the young woman had been sexually assaulted. Mr McCarthy suggested that she used a pair of men’s shoes to track blood . around the store - trying to make it appear that a large man had been . there. An autopsy revealed that Miss Murray suffered 322 injuries, 107 of which were defensive wounds inflicted as she tried to . use parts of her body, including her hands and forearms, to shield . herself. Weapon: A 29-year-old women is said to have beaten her colleague over the head with a metal merchandise rack for around 15 minutes . Scene of the crime: Norwood is said to have staged a robbery at the yoga shop and tracked bloody footprints around the store to make it appear a man had been there . The medical examiner who performed the autopsy . said she had never seen so many defensive wounds, the prosecution said. Mr McCarthy said: 'On March the 11th of this year, she . savagely ended the life of Jayna Murray. 'Today we begin . the process of holding her accountable for the crime she committed... first-degree, premeditated murder.' Distraught: Phyllis Murray, mother of the murdered woman, attends Montgomery County Circuit Court in Rockville, Maryland . The prosecution called Miss Murray an 'extraordinary . young woman' pursuing two masters' degrees from Johns Hopkins University . at the time of her death. Norwood's defence lawyer Douglas Wood . said that a 'horrific' fight broke out between the two co-workers. Mr Wood said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, Brittany Norwood lost it. There’s no doubt about that. She lost it. She lost control.' He claimed that a fight between the women got out of hand and that Norwood never intended to murder her colleague. Norwood’s defence has claimed that she lost her mind that night. Mr Wood said: 'Things that Brittany Norwood did after this were totally inept. 'They show someone, we submit, who got . involved in a nightmarish situation, a nightmare, and had this sort of . imagination, or this explanation of what happened, and it was full of . holes because there was no premeditation, deliberation and willfulness.' The families of both women, including their . parents, were present in the courtroom. The trial is expected to last around eight days. In the state of Maryland, premeditated murder carries the possible sentence of life with no chance for parole. Second-degree murder carries a maximum of 30 years in prison with a chance of release after 15 years. The trial continues.","Brittany Norwood, 29, allegedly attacked with a foot-long metal bar from a merchandise stand .

Amazingly, church deacon Graeme Dust's loyal wife Nina today stood by him as he was sentenced at the Old Bailey. Dust, 46, had started an affair with a woman he met on his rounds as his marriage began to fail.

However, Nina Dust, 46, said it tasted bitter as she took a sip while they breakfasted in a cafe. She sent it back and the cafe owner noticed white powder at the bottom of the cup, said Richard Merz, prosecuting. Six months later, he asked a friend: 'Do you know anyone who can get rid of my wife?' The friend went to police and a meeting was arranged with an undercover officer, the Old Bailey heard. In a recording of the meeting in a car at a sports ground, Dust said: 'Did he tell you the stupid thing I did? 'I put something in her drink in a cafe and two people saw me. 'I put half a dozen sleeping pills in her drink. I thought I was going to knock her out and take her home and stick her in the car with a hose.' He said he wanted her death to look like suicide or an accident and was told it would cost £5,000. He left saying he wanted a couple of months to think about it. Dust and his wife had been married for 20 years and ran a window cleaning business, while Mrs Dust ran a cleaning firm. Dust, of Enfield, north London, pleaded guilty to soliciting murder and was jailed for four years. He also admitted administering poison involving the six sleeping tablets and was given a further two years in prison. Mrs Dust watched him being jailed from the public gallery. Jim Scobie, QC, said she had forgiven him and wanted him back. Dust would not have gone through with the plan which came about while he was depressed. Judge Stephen Kramer told Dust: 'It is said you committed these offences when you felt unloved.

Nowadays quirky weddings are all the rage, with couples being read their nuptials anywhere from hot-air balloons to under the ocean. But meet the Glaziers, who 20 years ago were ahead of their time with a bizarre marriage stunt. In 1991 Sue and Chris Glazier won a radio competition's 'mystery prize', meaning they spent the evening after they tied the knot circling the M25 in a huge bus. Chris and Sue Glazier who spent their wedding night driving around the M25 motorway in a coach . Their odd story has emerged in a BBC documentary about the M25 being screened on its 25th anniversary tomorrow. Today Mr Glazier, 44, a metal polisher from Lydd, Kent, spoke of their delight after they were picked for the unusual stunt. 'They told us the night before that we would be travelling at 50mph. 'My wife was thinking we were going to be on the Orient Express.' Instead, after their wedding in Ashford on March 27, 1991, they were driven to the newly opened Thurrock service station for the reception. Then came their big treat: a bus arrived to take them and their guests around the full 114-mile length of the M25. The wedding party on the happy day in March 1991 . Four hours and one complete circuit later, the guests were dropped off - and the happy couple were driven around the orbital twice more. 'There was a massive four-poster bed fitted into the bus, with a TV, video and ice box. It was a bumpy night ... but quiet,' said Mr Glazier. Eventually the bus pulled back into the service station where the couple enjoyed a hearty fry-up. Mrs Glazier, 43, a self-employed cleaner, said she was 'shocked' when they found out what lay in store on their wedding night. The love bus: The happy couple take to the wheel, in a quirky story which will be remembered in a documentary about the M25 . But she soon realised she'd be just as happy being Mrs Glazier on a bus as she would in a five-star hotel. 'As long as we were going to be together, that's all that mattered. 'Most people want to see the back of the M25 as quickly as possible. I just hope I'm never stuck on it. I don't want to tarnish the memories.' The M25 took more than 11 years to . build at a cost of £1 billion. It was opened by the then prime minister . Margaret Thatcher to a fanfare on October 29, 1986. Another £1 billion is now being spent on an expansion that will see the motorway grow to eight lanes wide in parts. The . documentary, The Road To Nowhere, tells how house prices have gone up . 300-400 per cent since the M25 opened, making huge profits for the . landowners whose farmland was snapped up by developers. Its construction saw a big influx of US companies attracted to American-style business parks that sprang up near the route. The M25 was also the centre of an illegal rave scene that developed shortly after it opened. 'All that everybody knew was these raves would happen somewhere on the periphery of the M25,' said DJ Judge Jules.

"By . Helen Weathers . Last updated at 10:13 AM on 27th October 2011 . Alex Hall: 'Haunted by Clarkson's fame for 20 years' Glamorous entrepreneur Alex Hall likes to describe herself as the wife who was ‘airbrushed’ out of Jeremy Clarkson’s life. There is no mention of her in the outspoken Top Gear star’s Who’s Who entry; not even a paragraph devoted to their brief 1989 marriage in his autobiography. In interviews, there is barely a mention of Wife Number One; only effusive praise for his second wife and manager Francie, mother to their three children. One can only ask: Why? Even though it was Alex who left Clarkson – long before he became a global celebrity – because, she told friends, he was a ‘lazy and opinionated slob’ who smoked heavily and ‘smelt of an ashtray’, his growing fame has seemingly cast a long shadow over her life ever since. ‘I have been haunted by his fame for the past 20 years,’ she told friends. ‘It is not easy when your ex suddenly becomes famous and is in the papers all the time. I am constantly reminded of him.’ She hinted that she regretted leaving Clarkson for one of his friends, and spoke of the difficulties to her second marriage caused by Clarkson’s fame and popularity. She spoke of an enduring friendship with her famous ex. Was this what Jeremy Clarkson was so worried about? It would certainly seem so. For we can now report that Alex Hall is claiming that far from divorce spelling the end of their relationship, it continued after Clarkson’s marriage to Francie. He denies the claims. Already dogged by rumours of infidelity, and then to be accused of conducting an affair with Wife Number One behind the back of Wife Number Two, it is perhaps not surprising that Clarkson fled to the High Court to suppress the claims with a super-injunction. It is perhaps no surprise either that Alex Hall might wish to tell her own life story, staking her rightful place in the colourful Jeremy Clarkson saga which he has – until yesterday – sought to suppress. Indeed, he reportedly produced evidence accusing her of trying to blackmail him when she told him of her plans by telephone. The super-injunction slapped on Alex last year meant she could go to jail just for talking about her relationship with Clarkson, despite the fact that she insisted hers was no ‘kiss and tell’, but a cathartic exercise. So who is Alex Hall, the first wife who effectively became a non-person after she walked out of Clarkson’s life? Who is this shadowy woman whose voice was silenced when she tried to drift back into Clarkson’s starry orbit and claim her place in his turbulent personal history? Convent-educated Alexandra James was 17 when she met Doncaster-born Clarkson; the public-school-educated son of a teacher and travelling salesman. He was three years her senior and although he was already opinionated and outspoken, Alex never imagined her mop-headed boyfriend might one day become famous. VERY close colleagues: With Phillipa Sage in Australia, left, and with long-suffering wife Francie, right . At just 19, Alex first revealed her entrepreneurial spirit when she set up her own company offering flexible secretarial services, which boasted three offices. Sharing a one-bedroom flat, she and Jeremy married seven years after they first met. It seems she did not consider him too much of a catch. Alex complained to friends that, apart from constantly stinking of cigarettes, he always wanted to be the centre of attention and when he was about, no one could get a word in edgeways. Even back then, she has told friends, he was ‘too big for his boots’ and didn’t care much who he upset. His presence was all-dominating. But intellectually he was very fast on his feet and woe betide anyone who couldn’t keep up. They had been married for less than two years when Alex claims she left Jeremy Clarkson for one of his friends, concluding that their relationship had become more like that of ‘brother and sister’ than husband and wife. Doorway clinch: Clarkson with Elaine Bedell . Clarkson, who had done four shows for Top Gear when Alex left him, was – according to his ex-wife – distraught. She claims he cut up all her clothes and lost five stone in weight. Alex went on to marry Stephen Hall, with whom she later had two children. The year was 1993; the same year that Jeremy Clarkson married Francie, his second wife; the woman he credits with shaping his fledgling TV career into what it is today. In interviews, Clarkson has spoken of how it was high-flying businesswoman Francie who was the driving force in their relationship. ‘Francie was keeping me,’ Clarkson has said of their early years. ‘We were living in her flat and I was up to my ears in debt. I didn’t tell her how bad my finances were or how I was so hideously overdrawn.’ Alex claims it is she who introduced Francie to Clarkson. The two women were apparently friends and Francie is believed to have attended the couple’s wedding. Consumed with guilt over leaving Jeremy, she has told some friends she was instrumental in getting them together. Furthermore, Alex has suggested privately that she believes it was Jeremy’s heartbreak over losing her that was the real force behind his later success, shaking up his life and giving him extra drive. She told another friend that she was the only person who had ‘ever broken his heart’. With the passage of time, and a second failed marriage under her belt, she can’t help wonder what might have been if she had stuck with Jeremy. Alex sold her secretarial company when she became a mother, at the age of 27. When she later separated from her second husband in 2001, she worked as a barmaid to help support her two children before launching her own company The Big O – selling packaged premium olives to bars. Alex claims that she and Jeremy have remained friends over the years, but that her friendship with Francie has petered out. Alex has told confidantes that she feels Francie might feel threatened by her status as Wife Number One. Certainly, long-suffering Francie had more than just a few reasons to look grim in April when the family’s holiday to a luxury tropical resort descended into chilly silences, after Clarkson was accused of having an affair with a younger woman. The Clarksons had just arrived in Barbados when the story broke that the Top Gear presenter was allegedly having an affair with Phillipa Sage, a 42-year-old events organiser who had been among the entourage of Clarkson’s International Top Gear Live Show. What people didn’t know, however, was that while Francie was having to deal with claims that Miss Sage spent nights with Clarkson as he travelled around Australia, South Africa and Norway, the pair sharing glasses of white wine together snuggled up under a blanket, she was also dealing with the controversy over the injunction her husband was using to silence his first wife. This was not the first time Clarkson had been in trouble either. Back in 2002, a red-top tabloid reported that the presenter had been seen passionately kissing television producer Elaine Bedell in a car and the pair were photographed cuddling in a doorway. So, knowing that Wife Number One was keen to write her life story – possibly warts and all – must have been a further weight on Francie’s shoulders. One she could not breathe a word about because of the super-injunction. On their return to Britain, Clarkson moved into a London flat – although Francie insisted they had not split up, and that he would be returning to the family home in the Cotswolds. And all the while, Alex Hall had to remain silent, alone with her thoughts on her ex-husband Jeremy Clarkson and quietly fuming at the seeming injustice of it all. With the super-injunction lifted, the first Mrs Jeremy Clarkson has her voice back. She is said to be considering writing a book. But what exactly does she intend to say and what on Earth will the second Mrs Clarkson make of it all? Last night Clarkson laughed at suggestions that he cut up Alex’s clothes and lost five stone after she left him. He said: ‘I beg of you, please print all those things. I so want my friends to read that because they do need cheering up.’","Alex Hall left Clarkson long before he became a global celebrity .

"By . Luke Salkeld and Andy Dolan . Last updated at 12:53 AM on 29th October 2011 . The parents of Joanna Yeates spoke of their regret that her killer could not be hanged yesterday after he was found guilty of murder. And they expressed the hope that Vincent Tabak would spend the rest of his days in ‘a living hell’. David and Teresa Yeates spoke out after it emerged that 33-year-old Tabak was a dangerous pervert who was sexually aroused by pornography depicting violence towards women. He regularly trawled the internet for films which showed girls being strangled. Grief: Joanna Yeates' parents, David and Teresa, wish Vincent Tabak could have been handed the death penalty after he was convicted of murdering their daughter . Yet evidence of his sick fixation was not put before the jury who rejected his plea of guilty to manslaughter, and nor were they told that he paid prostitutes for sex when he was on trips away from his live-in girlfriend. His victim’s parents wept at their home after learning that their daughter’s murderer had been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the ‘dreadful, evil act’ he committed on December 17 last year. For the first time in the three-week trial neither Mr Yeates, 64, nor his 59-year-old wife had attended Bristol Crown Court as the jury considered their verdict for a third day. Afterwards they said they regretted that capital punishment was not an option for the judge, and they hoped the rest of Tabak’s life ‘is a living hell, being the recipient of all the evils, deprivations and degradations that his situation can provide’. They said: ‘We have lost our daughter, and our son has lost his sister. ‘Our main sorrow is that Jo was not allowed to start her own family, have children and achieve her potential. 'We will never get over our loss, how she was murdered, and the total lack of respect with which her body was treated. We so miss hearing her happy voice and seeing her living life to the full.’ Strangled: Joanna Yeates (left) was attacked in . her own flat by neighbour Vincent Tabak - his actions following his despicable act have shocked many and led to Joanna's parents wishing for the death penalty . After meticulously researching the legal difference between murder and manslaughter, Tabak claimed he never intended to kill the 25-year-old landscape architect before bundling her body in the boot of his car, driving to Asda to do some shopping, then dumping the corpse by the side of a country road where it lay under snow undiscovered until Christmas morning. Jo’s parents David and Teresa Yeates, issued this statement yesterday. We attended the trial of Jo’s murderer not to see justice handed out to him, but to learn what we couldabout what really happened from the time when Jo disappeared to when Jo’s murderer was arrested. The last four weeks have been more stressful and intense than we ever imagined. Although we had been made aware of the nature of much of the evidence against Jo’s killer, some of the details which came out were a surprise. There was never any doubt in our minds that Jo had been murdered and that we fully expected him to lie when he went into the witness box. We came here with little hope or expectation of hearing what happened on the 17th of December, but needed to see him and to hear what he had to sayfirst hand. We saw no emotion or remorse or regret for what he did to Jo. We felt that all emotions expressed by him were false. All we heard were words of selfpity. Thus, it is with regret that capital punishment is not a possible option for his sentence. The best we can hope for him is that he spends the rest of his life incarcerated, where his life is a living hell, being the recipient of all evils, deprivations and degradations that his situation can provide. During the fatal attack he inflicted 43 injuries on his next-door neighbour, who was alone in her flat in Clifton, Bristol while her boyfriend Greg Reardon was away visiting family. Despite admitting squeezing her throat for 20 seconds he insisted he had meant only to stifle the screams heard by several witnesses outside, a claim rejected by the jury yesterday. He then moved her body into his car and drove to Asda, where he sent a text to his girlfriend to say he was ‘bored’ – and to create an alibi that he had been away from the flat. Carefully following the investigation into Miss Yeates’s disappearance, he looked at pornography after viewing websites featuring her image. Mr Justice Field told the murderer: . ‘When you entered her flat you did not even know her name and had . virtually nothing to do with her. ‘You . proceeded to strangle her, intending to kill her, a dreadful, evil act . committed against a vulnerable unsuspecting young woman in her own home. ‘That wicked act ended the life of a young woman who was entitled to expect a life of happiness and fulfilment. ‘In my judgment you are very dangerous and also thoroughly deceitful, dishonest and manipulative. ‘You . have caused devastation, heartache and distress to Joanna’s family and . her partner Greg Reardon, not only by taking Joanna’s life but also by . hiding her body with the result that they had to go through seven days . of anguish, wondering what happened to her.’ The judge added: ‘On your . own evidence and after an acquaintanceship lasting just a few minutes . you moved to kiss Joanna, and I’m quite sure you did not intend to stop . there and wanted to go much further. ‘It was because of her screams that your sexual purpose was frustrated. ‘You killed Joanna when she was alone in her own home where she was entitled to think she was safe and secure. Sickening: Theresa and David, front centre, have been put through an horrific ordeal following the discovery of their daughter's body . Together: Miss Yeates and her boyfriend Mr Reardon - Vincent Tabak put a cruel end to their happiness . ‘Joanna died a dreadful death at your hands. She died in pain, beset with fear, struggling desperately for her life. You went to Asda as cool as may be with her body in the boot of your car before hiding it under leaves in a country lane hoping it would decompose before it was discovered. ‘You attempted to divert attention away from yourself and cynically implicated your landlord, Christopher Jefferies in her murder.’ Tabak, in dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, stood with his hands clasped, closed his eyes and bowed as the verdict was announced by the jury who had deliberated for 13 hours and 56 minutes before announcing their 10-2 majority verdict. Tabak, an architectural engineer, could now face further criminal charges after it emerged that police were examining suspicious material on his computer hard drives. Court: An artist's impression shows Tabak holding his head in his hands, with Joanna's parents unable to look at the killer of their daughter . His girlfriend at the time of the murder, Tanja Morson, did not give evidence. Her father Geoffrey, who lives in Cambridge, said after the verdict: ‘Our immediate thoughts, as always, go out to the Yeates family. Our priority is that we have a daughter still.’ Ann Reddrop, head of the Complex Case Unit, said Tabak had used the internet to keep ‘one step ahead of the investigation prior to his arrest’ and then sought to cast Miss Yeates in an unfavourable light when giving evidence to the jury. Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones said Tabak would be behind bars for a long time but Joanna’s parents ‘still have to face each Christmas with the memory of a daughter taken from them’.",David and Teresa Yeates hope Tabak spends rest of his days in 'a living hell'
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 9:43 AM on 28th October 2011 . An actor playing Jesus Christ Superstar became a family's real-life saviour after he rescued them from a house fire. Levi James helped terrified Rebecca Hemmings, her partner Tom Dudley, both 19, and their 10-month-old daughter Phoebe to safety after a 15-foot-high blaze engulfed sheds outside their Bristol home. Flames were seen leaping up the front wall of the home as the drama unfolded on Tuesday night in the Patchway area of the city. Drama: The dramatic moment actor Levi James, who is currently playing Jesus Christ in a stage play, leaped through flames to rescue a family from a burning house in Bristol . In the picture Mr James, circled, can seen dwarfed by the flames as he tried to use a normal garden hose to douse the inferno. Arsonists had set alight to sheds outside Durban House flats, off Pretoria Road in Patchway, at around 11.30pm. The blaze, described as a 'towering inferno', threatened not only the house but also a car parked outside. Mr James spotted the flames from his bedroom window and leaped into action. Neighbours told him the family were inside and he saw the family's Ford Fiesta was in danger of being set alight too. Windows on the house had cracked and the paint on the side of the vehicle was starting to peel. He said: 'I ran past the fire and . hammered on the door. They came down with a baby but she was a bit . nervous and didn't know whether she could come out. 'The fire was hot, it was a towering inferno. I saw the car's petrol tank sizzling. 'I stood between her and the fire and shielded her from it.' Miss Hemmings' brother Jack, 22, was also in the house at the time and escaped. She said the fire was all . the more terrifying because her daughter was sleeping upstairs in . a cot next to the window where the fire broke out. Saviour: Actor Levi James is starring as Jesus Christ in a local play, and right, Rebecca Hemmings, her boyfriend Tom Dudley, both 19, and their daughter Phoebe, 10 months, who were rescued from the inferno . She said: 'There was a big bang and . all you could see was flames coming up. I didn't know whether the fire . had spread to the house. 'I got my brother, shut the doors and went into the living room.' Mr James tried to use a hose from his house to put out the fire but it wouldn't reach, so he unscrewed it and took it a house next door to the fire. He said: 'I started to try and get the fire under control. The fire service turned up a couple of minutes after that and I thought I'd probably let the big boys deal with it. 'I assumed it was a petrol bomb or some kind of arson.' The 38-year-old actor has been earning praise appearing in an amateur production of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Brave: Levi James outside the burned out sheds. He spotted the flames from his bedroom window when arsonists set them alight on Tuesday evening . Inferno: The sheds are seen fully ablaze. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that the fire was an arson attack and appealed for witnesses to come forward . He's now been dubbed 'our little saviour' by the family. The fire completely destroyed the sheds, which included a bike and a number of Phoebe's toys, but no-one was injured. Miss Hemmings said: 'None of us had shoes or socks on and my partner was just in his shorts. 'We got back into the house at around 1.30am but I didn't really get any sleep. 'They don't realise that every flat here has kids in. Her cot is by my window. If my car had gone up it would have smashed the windows.' Mr James, who last week played the title role in an adaptation of  Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar for the Thornbury Musical Theatre group, was humble about his part in the blaze drama. He said: 'I don't think of it as a big hero thing. You've just got to get your head down and solve the problem.' Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that the fire was an arson attack and appealed for witnesses to come forward. A spokesman said: 'A communal shed was set on fire, causing the shed to be completely burnt out, and causing heat damage to a vehicle parked nearby and a block of flats.'",Actor Levi James tried to use a garden hose to put out the blaze .
"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 11:40 AM on 28th October 2011 . Professional gardener Joe Hashman (pictured outside the tribunal in Southampton) claims he was sacked from a Dorset garden centre because of his anti-fox hunting beliefs . A garden centre worker who was sacked for his anti-fox hunting belief has won a five-figure pay-out. Joe Hashman, who has been an active animal rights campaigner for 30 years, was handed his P45 at Orchard Park Farm near Gillingham, Dorset, in September 2009, and he has been seeking justice ever since. Over two years later the 43-year-old has now succeeded in the landmark discrimination case which could pave the way for others to sue their former employers, if they have suffered in the work place because of their personal views. Mr Hashman had been looking for £50,000 for loss of earnings and injury to feelings from Orchard Park Farm garden centre. The managers sacked him two days after his covert filming had helped to convict the celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright of illegal hare coursing. He agreed an undisclosed settlement, believed to include a five figure payout, after a panel at Southampton Employment Tribunal ruled in his favour. As part of it, Orchard Park's directors issued a public apology to Mr Hashman, accepting that he had never sought to mislead them about his animal welfare activism. Married father-of-two Mr Hashman, of Shaftesbury, Dorset, successfully argued that his views on fox hunting should be placed on the same legal footing as religious beliefs. It was accepted that his concern about the environment, animal rights, veganism and, in particular, his opposition to fox hunting, amount to a philosophical belief under the Employment Equality (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003. Mr Hashman's solicitor Shah Qureshi, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'This is clearly a very positive tribunal decision for those who believe in animal rights. Mr Hashman claimed he felt less secure in his job after learning that the owners of Orchard Park Garden Centre (pictured) had a pro-hunting farm manager . 'This judgment vindicates Joe's decision to bring this case and fight for justice after he lost his livelihood. It is a welcome conclusion to a long-running saga. 'The judgment sends a signal to employers that discriminating against someone because of their deeply held beliefs is unacceptable and unlawful.' Mr Hashman said: 'I am proud to have established in law my philosophical belief in the sanctity of life, including fervent anti-fox hunting and hare coursing beliefs. 'The tribunal found that I was discriminated against because of these beliefs and so I feel vindicated in taking my case to them for judgment. 'I don't think anyone should be discriminated against at work because of their views on issues such as hunting. 'Politics and morality as to how we live our lives should not be brought into the workplace.' The 43-year-old's secret filming helped convict celerity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright of hare coursing . Giving evidence, professional gardener Mr Hashman told the tribunal how he lost his job when his bosses found out he was a leading saboteur and animal welfare activist - and had been since the age of 14. Mr Hashman said he was 'picked on' and suddenly sacked after he appeared on Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, explaining his part in Dickson's Wright's court case. He said: 'I believe now that my involvement in relation to hunting issues and ultimately my philosophical belief was the reason for my dismissal. 'On September 1, 2009 there were two convictions at Scarborough magistrates' court under the Hunting Act, which I was directly responsible for. 'I believe that those connected with Orchard Park knew, or came to know, of some or all of these matters at some point leading up to my dismissal.' Orchard Park Farm had claimed that it only dismissed Mr Hashman because his vegetable patch at the garden centre, designed to encourage customers to grow more produce, was not making enough money. But after losing the case, the directors apologised for a memo that was circulated at Orchard Park in November 2010 criticising Mr Hashman. They said: 'We, the directors of Orchard Park, unreservedly apologise to Mr Hashman for any injury to his feelings arising from the memo. 'In particular, we accept that Mr Hashman did not seek to mislead us or set us up in relation to his animal welfare beliefs and actions. 'Equally, we did not intend to suggest that Mr Hashman engaged in any bullying or mud-slinging. We wish Mr Hashman well for the future.'","Animal rights activist sacked after secret filming helped convict Clarissa Dickson Wright of hare coursing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:12 PM on 28th October 2011 . The son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour will spend Christmas behind bars after his appeal against a 16-month jail term for his drug-fuelled rampage during the student protests was thrown out. Charlie Gilmour, 21, was told those who join mob violence must expect ‘significant’ sentences, even if their actions are completely out of character. Lawyers for the Cambridge University history student argued his sentence was ‘unduly harsh’ and that he should be released early. Paying the price: Charlie Gilmour, pictured with his mother, author Polly Samson, and father Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour during his trial . But three Appeal Court judges ruled that the penalty could not be described as ‘manifestly excessive or wrong in principle’. In what became one of the most infamous images of the London protests, Gilmour was seen hanging from a Union Flag on the Cenotaph. In a clear warning to others, Lord Justice Hughes said those who take part in demonstrations carry ‘clear responsibilities’ to avoid disorder and violence. The earliest Gilmour can now be released from Wayland prison in Norfolk is next March, when he reaches the halfway point of his sentence. He admitted violent disorder after joining thousands protesting in Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square last December. Gilmour, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, was 'out of his mind' on LSD, whisky and valium when he indulged in 'outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour' at last December's student riots. He was jailed for 16 months in July after admitting a charge of violent disorder - but his lawyer had argued that the sentence was 'unduly harsh'. Gilmour was seen swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph just hours before he hurled a bin at a car escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall on December 9 last year. However, the court had previously heard that he did not realise that the monument from which he was swinging was the Cenotaph. The dark side of the son: Charlie Gilmour was seen rampaging through the streets of London and was photographed clambering up the Cenotaph . Gilmour jumped on the bonnet of the car, which was carrying close protection officers, blocking the driver's view of the Prince's Rolls-Royce in front, it had been claimed. Gilmour was also accused of twice kicking a window of Top Shop in Oxford Street as staff and customers cowered inside. His parents did not attend the Court of Appeal for the appeal announcement. Describing the decision to uphold the 16-month sentence, Lord Justice Hughes said Gilmour's offence was committed in the centre of London 'in the course of serious disorder which occurred in the later stages of what had begun as a generally peaceful demonstration against Government proposals relating to the funding of further education'. There was, he said, 'serious mob disorder'. Rampage: Gilmour's lawyer said he had been 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras . He said: 'The defendant admitted violent disorder. He was unmistakably captured on CCTV footage in Oxford Street joining in the attack on the windows of a shop. 'He was part of a violent crowd laying siege to the shop, in which both staff and shoppers were trapped. 'He twice ran up and launched heavy kicks at the window, as did others before him and, no doubt, after him. 'The combined effect of the attack was that the windows were at some stage broken - it may well be by the time the defendant joined in. 'The defendant helped himself to a section of a mannequin and carried it away.' Lord Justice Hughes said the Crown's case was that Gilmour also took violent part in the attack on the royal cars a little earlier. There was evidence that Gilmour was 'quite significantly under the influence of both drink and drugs that day'. At times during the day he was clearly 'in good, if intoxicated, humour', the court was told. In Parliament Square earlier in the day 'he can be seen shouting good-humouredly and at another point declaiming poetry'. The judge said: 'Unfortunately, however, his behaviour was not always in this benevolent category.' At one point 'there is no doubt that he crouched down in the doorway of the nearby Supreme Court and tried to set fire to a bundle of newspapers against the wooden doors', but was 'dissuaded and scampered away'. Lord Justice Hughes added: 'That cannot have been other than potentially very dangerous and, in the context of a volatile crowd, very likely to lead others to behave equally dangerously.' He went on: 'A little later he was to be found swinging in an exhibitionist manner and for quite a prolonged period on one of the flags on the Cenotaph. 'This was an incident which, unsurprisingly, subsequently attracted a good deal of attention. Shock: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in their car when it was attacked by protesters last December. Charlie Gilmour was convicted of hurling a bin at the escort car behind the royals . 'Deeply offensive as it undoubtedly was, it did not amount to violence and thus was not part of the offence of violent disorder with which he was charged. 'Its relevance in law is limited to the fact that, along with the other behaviour, it demonstrates that he was at times over-excited, out of control, and raising the temperature in a manner which could only be dangerous in the context of a large and angry crowd.' At the original sentencing hearing at Kingston Crown Court, the judge concluded that he was sure Gilmour had thrown a bin at a car in the royal convoy - which had been conveying the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and others to an evening public engagement. The appeal judges ruled that he was 'entitled to come to the conclusion which he did'. Lord Justice Hughes said of Gilmour: 'He is plainly a talented man.' References from people who knew him well described him as a person who is 'generally of gentle and peaceable disposition'. He said the judge at Kingston 'rightly treated what the defendant did as entirely out of character'. The appeal judges agreed with Gilmour's barrister that testimonials from a national charity for the homeless painted a 'picture of his capacity to behave very differently' from the way he did on December 9 last year. He had earned 'considerable praise for respect for others, long hours, reliability and enthusiasm'. It was also clear, said Lord Justice Hughes, that 'he has been much chastened by the realisation of what he did'. Disgraceful: The convoy of royal cars transporting Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall can be seen in this image being attacked during the student riots in Regent Street . He added: 'He has made genuine efforts to stop drinking and taking drugs. He made a public apology soon after the event, stimulated no doubt by the heavy publicity which the graphic pictures of the Cenotaph incident had generated.' The law protects the right of people in this country to demonstrate - to 'make known and in public their feelings on matters of public concern' - but to do so in large numbers in public 'carries clear responsibilities, principally amongst them to act without disorder or violence which puts the public at risk'. The attack on the shops in Oxford Street 'was an attack by a mob on hapless shoppers and staff who were terrified as well as trapped inside, whilst the attack on the cars was upon both public figures and those whose job it was to protect them'. Injured: A police officer is hurt during the student riots last December . Lord Justice Hughes said: 'It is an unavoidable feature of mass disorder that each individual act, whatever might be its character taken on its own, inflames and encourages others to behave similarly, and that the harm done to the public stems from the combined effect of what is done en masse. 'We do not believe that violence in this context and of the kind displayed by this defendant can normally be met by other than significant sentences of immediate custody even for those of otherwise good character.' The sentence passed by the judge 'correctly took account both of the defendant's serious and dangerous acts in this inflammatory context and of his normal character'. Lord Justice Hughes said the sentence was a 'penalty which properly met the facts of this case'. At an Appeal Court hearing earlier this month, David Spens, Gilmour's lawyer, told the court that Gilmour did not realise it was the Cenotaph he was swinging on because he had grown up in the countryside without access to television. He made the revelation about his client's upbringing while arguing that the 16-month prison sentence should be reduced so he can finish his degree at Cambridge. Mr Spens said: ''He had no recollection of throwing the bin. He is confident if he threw the bin, he would have remembered'. He also argued his client had simply being 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras during the day. Disputing the length of Gilmour's jail sentence, Mr Spens said: 'A shorter, sharp shock would be perfectly sufficient to punish him, and at the same time to send a message loud and clear to others who might be minded to act as he did. 'This sentence was unduly harsh, unnecessarily so, his potential, like that of other young people in his position is being wasted while he spends too long in prison.' During the sentencing hearing at Kingston Crown Court, it was said that just before his violent outbursts on December 9 last year, Gilmour had 'binged' on whisky and valium. In his mitigation, Mr Spens explained how Gilmour had become increasingly 'dependent' on drink and drugs since he was rejected by his biological father, the poet and playwrite Heathcote Williams four months before the incident. And the night before, the 'gentle' and 'promising' student had binged on LSD and alcohol. Lord Justice Hughes, sitting with Mr Justice Cranston and Mr Justice Hickinbottom, reserved judgement earlier this month because they wanted to wait for the judgement of the Lord Chief Justice in the sentences imposed on the August rioters, in case there were 'implications' for Gilmour's case. Gilmour was adopted by rock star David Gilmour, worth £78million, when he married his mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson .","Cambridge undergraduate reading history claimed he did not know what the Cenotaph was .

Thousands of tourists are today fleeing Mexico's holiday resorts as hundreds of residents follow them away from low-lying areas ahead of Tropical Storm Rina’s approach up the Caribbean coast. Civil protection officials moved some 2,300 people from Holbox, an island where the Caribbean meets the Gulf of Mexico, and the government closed the archaeological sites that dot the coast.

It was about . 115 miles south of the island of Cozumel, moving northwest at 6mph. 'At the hotel, they told us they would make a decision whether to evacuate later today, but we didn't want to wait. We would rather be home when it hits' Janet Gallo, Cancun tourist . But the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Rina's maximum sustained winds were down to 70mph by Thursday lunchtime. About 275 people living in the fishing town of Punta Allen, south of Tulum, were moved to emergency shelters and a smaller group was evacuated from the atoll of Banco Chinchorro. Luh McDevitt, 56, originally of Cincinnati, Ohio - but now a furniture and interior designer in Cozumel - said her family was fitting hurricane shutters to the house and securing furniture. ‘I am not really scared.

Jorge Arturo Cruz, spokesman for Quintana Roo's education department, said schools were ordered to be closed in communities along the coast and on Cozumel in anticipation of the storm. The coastal area around Tulum is dotted with Mayan ruins and farther north is Playa del Carmen, another popular spot for international tourists and the departure point for ferries serving Cozumel. State officials said there had been about 83,000 tourists there, with about 28,000 in Cancun and 45,000 more on the stretch of coast south of Cancun that includes Tulum and Playa de Carmen. State Tourism Director Juan Carlos Gonzalez Hernandez estimated 10,000 tourists had left by Wednesday night. There were only about 1,719 tourists on Cozumel, and many of them had left.

The area was badly damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, when Cancun's white-sand beaches were largely washed away. Insurance officials estimated total damage at $3billion. A hurricane warning was in effect for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from north of Punta Gruesa to Cancun. The projected track showed Rina curving east toward Cuba and the Straits of Florida after crossing the eastern tip of Yucatan. But the U.S. National Hurricane Center cautioned: ‘There is great uncertainty as to where Rina will be located by the weekend.’","Officials move 2,300 people from Holbox and tourists evacuate Cancun .

Two men who helped gun down a man chatting to his estranged wife in a quiet residential street in a case of mistaken identity were each jailed for at least 28 years today. Michael Ofori, 35, fell victim to a 'drive-by' shooting as he sat in his Mercedes. Sahid Sule and Nicholas Allon-McVytie, both 23, are thought to have intended to kill rival gangster Perry Walters, 24, after a spate of tit-for-tat shootings. Sahid Sule, 23, (left), and Nicholas Allon-McVytie, 23, who were jailed for 28 years each for killing an innocent man by mistake . Walters was lured to Oslac Road in Catford, southeast London, on the premise of a drug deal shortly after midnight on June 23 last year. Walters and Mr Ofori turned up in the same road within two minutes of each other, but the killers wrongly picked out Mr Ofori, a cousin of former England rugby international Paul Sackey, as he chatted while sitting in his parked Mercedes. He was shot twice at close range, one of the bullets passing through his brain, and was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital. His wife managed to escape without injury. Allon-McVytie, a former Lewisham College student and father-of-two, drove the gunman to the scene in his white van and slowly passed Mr Ofori's car as they tried to identify their target. Michael Ofori was mistaken for a rival gangster and shot in the street while talking to his wife . He then dropped off the killer and waited nearby, before speeding from the scene once the murder was carried out. Sule co-ordinated the shooting via his mobile, including a key six-minute call to Allon-McVytie, and was linked to the revolver which was found three months later, fully-loaded, in a car he had registered in a false name and address. Sule, who graduated from Roehampton University with a marketing degree, was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two on Wednesday of this week. Both men were jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years. Judge Peter Thornton QC said: 'Your actions have brutally taken the life of a man who was loved by his friends and relatives. 'You have deprived a young daughter of her father. 'This was a co-ordinated, planned execution in which a number of people played a part.' England rugby player Paul Sackey was a cousin of the victim . He said Allon-McVytie as getaway driver 'knew full well the purpose and intention of the gunman'. 'You were a knowing, willing participant in this execution. You were a key link in the chain of communication,' he said. Following his death, Mr Sackey, 31, who has 22 caps for England and played in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, said he was 'really close' to his cousin. 'He used to come to all my matches with Wasps and he had already booked flights to come out here and watch me play my first game for Toulon,' he said. 'He helped me pack before I left and I saw him the night before I moved to France, at my brother's place. The court heard Mr Ofori's daughter was receiving therapy from a counsellor and his elderly and frail mother 'cannot come to terms with the cold-blooded murder of her son'. A third man Kraig Isaacs, 21, was cleared of involvement.Two others Nathaniel Valton, 22, the alleged hitman, and Jules Brown, 25, now face a retrial after the jury failed to reach verdicts.Allon-McVytie, of (28) Deptford, southeast London; and Sule, of no fixed address; were convicted of murder.Valton, from Deptford; and Brown, of Upton Park, east London; are set to return to court next Friday, October 28, when the prosecution will decide whether to proceed with a retrial.

This extremely rare signed group photograph shows UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D.Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 with their military leaders. Historical: A very rare signed group photograph of Winston Churchill, Franklin D.Roosevelt and the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff taken at the January 1943 Casablanca Conference is for sale next month . It was announced today that the . revealing picture will go on sale in London next month with an estimated . price of between £15,000 and £20,000. The Casablanca Conference preceded a trio of wartime conferences attended by the leaders of America, Britain and the Soviet Union. Known as the Big Three, the first of these was the Tehran Conference in November 1943 in which Roosevelt and Churchill travelled to Iran to meet with Joseph Stalin. The central aim of the Tehran Conference was to plan the final strategy for the war against Nazi Germany and its allies, and the chief discussion was centered on the opening of a second front in Western Europe. The Yalta Conference was held in February 1945 at the Livadia Palace in the Crimea. Its main purpose was to discuss Europe's post-war re-organisation. As the meeting finished, a final plan for the occupation of Germany was agreed upon and Roosevelt obtained Stalin's word that the Soviet Union would participate in the new United Nations. The final meeting of the Big Three was the Potsdam Conference in summer of 1945. The meeting was also attended by Clement Attlee as the UK was awaiting the outcome of the general election. Harry Truman attended as the new US President following Roosevelt's death in April. One of the main objectives was to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated Nazi Germany. The other principal goals of the conference were to begin designing the postwar world and negotiating treaties. Only three other photographs jointly signed by the two wartime leaders are known. It was at the Casablanca Conference that . the Allies took the crucial and far reaching decision to demand . unconditional surrender from Germany and the Axis Powers. Militarily, it also resolved the long running and sometimes bitter dispute between the Allied commanders over strategy. While Roosevelt and Churchill enjoyed a good personal relationship there was little love lost between some of the other participants at the conference. The Americans military leaders, in particular, felt that the British had been dragging their heels over the invasion of mainland Europe in favour of an invasion through Sicily and on into Italy. The Casablanca Conference resolved this dispute in Britain’s favour. The successful invasion of Sicily took place in July and August 1943 with the invasion of France following in June 1944. Notably absent from the conference was Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, who stayed . in Russia due to the raging battle of Stalingrad, which by that point . the communists had nearly won. And so, as Red Army soldiers . finally began to roll back the Germans on the Eastern Front, the . conference marked the turning point for the Allies in Western Europe. Roosevelt presented the results of the conference to the American people in a radio address on February 12, 1943. The photograph shows Churchill and Roosevelt seated in the garden of the Anfa Hotel, Casablanca, with, standing behind, Lieutenant-General Brehon B. Somervell (head of US Army Services of Supply), General H.H. Arnold, Admiral Ernest J. King, Lieutenant-General Sir Hastings Ismay (Churchill’s Chief of Staff), General George Marshall (directly behind Roosevelt), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, General Sir Alan Brooke (directly behind Churchill), Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal and Commodore Lord Louis Mountbatten (Head of Combined Operations).

Ian Thomas, 64, was taking his German schnauzer Monty out for an early morning walk when he was struck by a bolt so powerful he would have been killed if he had not been wearing wellington boots. The bolt threw Mr Thomas, who is the Mayor of Redruth in Cornwall, into the air and knocked him out. Saviours: Ian Thomas with Monty at his home in Redruth, Cornwall, and the wellington boots that saved his life . He regained consciousness when five-year-old Monty, who had also been struck, began licking his face. Mr Thomas struggled to stand but only managed to stagger several paces before he collapsed. He managed to wrap his arms around Monty, who responded by dragging him the 100 yards home. Faithful friends: Mr Thomas, knocked out by the lightning strike, only regained consciousness when Monty, a German schnauzer, started licking his face . Mr Thomas' shocked wife Sharen, 42, then took him straight him to hospital. He told the Daily Mirror: 'I heard what seemed like an explosion in my head and the dog scream. 'He makes that noise when he rubs his nose on electrical fences so I think he may have been hit too. 'I saw my legs shoot out in front of me and I was thrown into the air. 'Some time after I came to my senses and found myself curled up in a ball on the ground with my fists clenched.

Mrs Thomas, 42, told the Daily Express: 'He just walked in the front door and collapsed. I just knew we had to get him straight to hospital. 'He was confused and looked in pain. Monty was frightened too and ran into the house and covered his face with his paw'. Doctors said the electrical charge of the bolt that hit Mr Thomas on October 17 was so huge that it would have killed him if it were not for his rubber wellies. Mr Thomas suffered burns to his head and hip and had to spend four days in hospital but has since made a full recovery.",Mayor of Redruth would have died if not for his wellington boots .

Lincolnshire County Council's former chief fire officer Mike Thomas took trips to the USA, Canada, Japan and New Zealand to attend international search and rescue training programmes on business class tickets. He then charged the tickets back to the council at a total cost of £26,768. Trips on the taxpayer: Lincolnshire County Council's former chief fire officer Mike Thomas visited Panama, reportedly travelling business class . The figures, which were obtained by the Taxpayers' Alliance, revealed the council spent more than £42,000 in total on overseas flights for its officers between April 2009 and March this year. Tony McArdle, council chief executive, admitted mistakes had been made and steps had been taken to address them. He said: 'Around 75 per cent of these flights were booked by Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue. 'The majority were for one individual in his work with groups aiming to improve firefighter safety at an international level. Globe-trotting: The fire chief also visited Ottawa, Canada, famous for its red tulips . 'Regrettably, one senior fire and rescue officer often travelled at business class, contrary to the council's rules. 'The individual concerned is no longer employed by the council and we have tightened our procedures to make sure that the rules cannot be disregarded again. 'We will investigate the fire and rescue travelling arrangements and are reminding all of our staff of the need to minimise expenditure as a priority.' On his travels, Mr Thomas flew to Rhode Island, Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte and South Carolina in the USA, Ottawa in Canada, Berlin in Germany, Panama City in Panama, Tokyo in Japan and Wellington in New Zealand on a mixture of business and economy tickets. His biggest bill was the flight to Rhode Island, which cost £4,103 for a Club World ticket flying with British Airways. The biggest bill the council paid however was a £6,004 business class ticket for another employee to fly to the USA. Mr McArdle said the spending was justified as the worker had to go on a series of flights in a short space of time. He said: 'This involved internal flights between each site, as well as the flights between the UK and US. 'As this individual was making five flights within a three-day period, he decided to fly business class on the two between the UK and US. 'So basically it was because he was spending the best part of three days on planes.' Deeping St James Parish Council chairman Phil Dilks said: 'To see this kind of spending on business class tickets at a time when services are being cut is appalling. 'They should hang their heads in shame.'","Trips taken to USA, Canada, Japan and New Zealand .

It is becoming more and more apparent that Lindsay Lohan was destined to be a bad girl if you look at the example that has been set for her. With her father Michael having been arrested twice this week, giving him a grand total of six arrests under his belt, it is easy to see how Lindsay might have a very laissez-faire attitude towards the law. And now the 51-year-old celebrity father has a fairly impressive collection of mug shots just like his 25-year-old daughter. Just like dad: Lindsay Lohan has racked up a collection of five mugshots over the past four years (L-R) October 2011 (probation violation), September 2010 (probation violation), July 2010 (probation violation), July 2007 (DUI and Posession) and May 2006 (DUI) Bad influence: Michael Lohan has a similar collection of booking photos (R-L) October 2011 (Domestic Battery), July 2010 (Domestic Battery), 2004 (Assault and DUI), 1997 (Probation violation) and 1990 (Contempt of court) Michael began his criminal history back in 1990, when Lindsay was just four years old.He was investigated for insider trading and charged with contempt of court. Sentenced to three years in jail, he was released in 1993 on five years probation. In 1997, he violated his probation by travelling to see Lindsay out of state while she was filming in Napa, California and had been hospitalised for an asthma attack.The violation got him a further year in prison. In 2004, he then got into a fist fight outside a party for his son's birthday and was arrested on assault charges. While awaiting sentencing he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle after being involved in an accident. He then spent two and a half years in jail. In July 2010, he was arrested in the Hamptons for domestic abuse after he allegedly pushed his on-off girlfriend Kate Major over a chair and then kicked her in the head. The pair were engaged to be married at the time and Kate later dropped the charges. Serving the community: Lindsay, seen today having a cigarette outside her community service at the LA County Morgue . However earlier this week, he was . arrested again on similar charges after Kate called police in Tampa, . Florida claiming he had become violent towards her when she refused to . perform oral sex on him. Shortly . after being released on bail, he was arrested again for violating the . pre-trial terms set out by the judge stating that he was not to contact . Kate, by repeatedly calling her - even when police were at her house . taking a statement. He then tried to evade police by jumping off a third story balcony, breaking his foot in the process. He is currently in a Tampa area hospital under police supervision, and will be formally arraigned this weekend on charges of violation of a pre-trial condition, two violations of a domestic violence injunction, and obstruction of an officer without violence. Lindsay, meanwhile, is due back in court on November 2 to find out whether she will be sentenced to jail for violating the terms of her own probation. The Mean Girls star was arrested for the first time back in May 2006 for DUI after she ran her car up a curb and was found to be intoxicated. Police also found a small amount of cocaine in her car - she was just 19 years old. Then in July 2007 she was arrested for a second DUI and booked for driving under the influence of alcohol, possession of cocaine and driving with a suspended license. In August she was sentenced to serve one day in jail, 10 days of community service and given three years of probation. Lindsay then failed to appear for a probation progress hearing in May 2010 and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Her lawyers posted bail and she was ordered to wear an ankle monitoring device, undergo random drug tests and attend and alcohol education program. At a July 6 probation hearing the judge found her in violation of her probation after her SCRAM bracelet was triggered. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail but only served 14 days due to jail over crowding. In September of that year, her probation was revoked again after she failed a random drug test, resulting in a day in jail and then a three month stint at the Betty Ford Clinic. In February 2011 Lindsay was arrested and charged with the theft of a necklace stolen from a Venice store in January. It's all going to be all right: When he was released yesterday, Michael pulled a thumbs-up sign and grinned for the cameras. He had been warned by the judge not to contact Kate Major . Trying to escape: Michael is said to have violated the terms of his release by contacting ex Kate Major, but tried to escape and hurt his foot by jumping three storeys out of his hotel . She was sentenced to 120 days in . prison, 360 hours of community service at the Downtown Women's Center, . and 120 hours at the L.A. County morgue for misdemeanor theft and . probation violation, to which she pled no contest. Due . to jail overcrowding, Lohan served the sentence under house arrest, . wearing a tracking ankle monitor, for 35 days between May 26 and June . 29. On October 19,  Judge . Stephanie Sautner revoked Lohan's probation, sent her to jail, and set . bail at $100,000. Sautner told Lohan that if she wanted to avoid any . further punishment, she must complete 16 hours of community service at . the morgue before her next hearing, which is set for November 2, 2011.","Michael will add a sixth mug shot to his collection this weekend when he is formally booked .

All he wanted was for his rubbish to be taken away so when the binmen were four days late John Regan decided to find out why. The retired headteacher picked up the phone and called Winchester City Council helpline hoping for a swift answer to his query. But the taped message the 60-year-old father of two received stunned him. He was 'in a 37-hour queue'. Exasperated and, unsurprisingly, not prepared to wait a day and a half for an answer he then called the council's main number, only to be diverted to Hampshire County Council switchboard. Today his rubbish bins had still not been collected, seven days after they were meant to be emptied. Mr Regan, from Winchester, said: 'I just want my rubbish collected.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 12:40 PM on 28th October 2011 . A surgeon has saved a Gulf War veteran's arm seven hours after it was severed in an industrial accident - using an experimental procedure he'd only heard about on the medical grapevine. Royce Reid nearly bled to death on the way to hospital in Dallas, Texas, after his forearm was all but ripped off by a conveyor belt at work. In shock and terrible pain, the 49-year-old at first told doctors to 'just cut it off' and began discussing options for a prosthetic limb. Lucky to be alive: Royce Reid, who nearly bled to death on his way to hospital in Dallas, shows off the special hand splint supporting his forearm after it was successfully re-attached during experimental surgery . Experimental procedure: Mr Reid's forearm was re-attached in an 18-hour operation which used an external bypass, taking blood from his leg to keep his limb alive . But when he later made a tearful plea for his arm to be saved, specialist hand surgeon Dr Bardia Amirlak decided to try an experimental technique that had never been written about or taught. Nor had he even practised it. By now, it had been nearly seven hours since the accident, far longer than is normally possible for a re-attachment once its blood supply is cut off. Dr Amirlak, who is part of the newly created University of Texas Southwestern hand transplant team, said: 'As I was going to make the decision to amputate, he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said: ""I have grandkids and I want to hold them with my own hands. Do what you can to save my arm"". 'It was worth giving him a shot. He had served our country before — and now we have to help him.' Almost ripped off: This X-ray reveals the extent of Mr Reid's injuries. His forearm was only attached by a flap of skin when he arrived at hospital . Pioneer: Dr Bardia Amirlak decided to try the rarely-used technique after Mr Reid made a last-minute plea, telling the surgeon he wanted to be able to hold his grandchldren . Dr Amirlak quickly improvised by rigging an 'external bypass' to deliver fresh blood from an artery in Dr Reid's leg directly into the remnant part of the forearm to keep it alive while he worked to first reconnect the bones, then the blood vessels, tendons and nerves. Dr Amirlak said: 'I knew if I didn’t do this particular technique, Mr Reid would surely lose the arm.' After 18 hours of surgery, the patient is now using a specialist splint to help with the rehabilitation and has regained some sensation in his arm. Mr Reid, of Gilmer, 120 miles east of Dallas, said: 'We call them the miracle doctors. They did an amazing job. I'm a lucky guy to be alive. 'I thought that when I went into surgery and came out, I didn't think I would have a hand. I was glad to see one when I came out of surgery! 'Once I get this brace off of it and be able to use it, I plan on holding my grandkids again,' he said. Success: Dr Amirlak assesses Mr Reid's special outrigger splint. He still faces several surgeries to repair the skin, but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery . It becomes far more difficult to re-attach an arm once three to four hours have passed since the amputation. A finger can survive up to eight hours. Initially the bone is re-attached, then surgeons generally attempt to reconnect the blood vessels to get blood flowing again. After this, the nerves are reconnected. The whole procedure takes many hours, often lasting an entire day. Generally, patients will regain movement in the re-attached limb. Getting sensation into the nerves proves more problematic as new nerves need to grow from the old end of the cut nerve. This can take many months, particularly for older patients. Mr Reid, a veteran of Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield, caught his left forearm on a pipe in a conveyor which twisted and mangled it, nearly tearing it off, on August 27. With his arm held together only by a flap of skin, Mr Reid’s military survival training kicked in. He managed to free himself and even directed several onlookers on how to apply a tourniquet. He walked to an ambulance that had been called, supporting his own dangling forearm. Physicians at a hospital in nearby Longview determined that Mr Reid required advanced care and expertise, so he was transferred by helicopter to UT Southwestern's Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Dr Sumeet Teotia, assistant professor of plastic surgery who arrived to provide secondary support for the operation, said: 'Dr Amirlak did something that our entire department had not yet heard about. 'All I can say is that I was there when Dr Amirlak was doing this, and it was amazing. The forearm was completely shattered.' Mr Reid was discharged after a 10-day hospital stay that included grafting skin from his thigh to his forearm. Wearing a dynamic outrigger splint that resembles scaffolding to support his healing forearm, Mr Reid now receives occupational therapy and follow-up care at UT Southwestern. He still faces several surgeries to repair the skin, but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery.","Amputated limbs normally can't be saved after three to four hours .

Singing to God and even asking Jesus to torment Reed so 'she, too, finds the Lord,' Garcia was unrepentant. Victims: Garcia's wife Jessica was shot six times and San Antonio police officer Hector Garza, a father-of-five, was gunned down when he called at their home . In his last rambling statement he did not . apologise or even mention the fatal shootings of his wife or father-of-five Garza. 'Thank you, Yahweh, thank you, Jesus Christ, hallelujah, amen, and thank you, warden,' were his final words. After his arrest, Garcia told police he aimed for . Garza's head because he knew officers wear bullet-proof vests. The Garcias' five-year-old daughter witnessed both murders, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He also shot and wounded his wife's uncle during the incident. Several dozen of Garza's San Antonio police colleagues were present outside the prison unit during the execution. Execution chamber: The gurney used to strap down death row inmates at the prison in Huntsville, Texas . The San Antonio Police Department said in a statement: 'Though the execution does not bring complete closure to Hector's family, as we all miss him dearly, it comforts us to know that Frank Garcia will never destroy another family.' Garcia's execution was the 12th this year in Texas, which has executed more than four times as many people as any other state since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. As of Wednesday there had been 38 executions this year in the United States, according to the Center. Texas last month abolished the long-held tradition of allowing condemned inmates to order what they want for their last meal. Instead, they receive what other prisoners are served.","Frank Garcia failed to apologise for either killing ten years ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:37 PM on 27th October 2011 . Desperate: Colonel Gaddafi's son Saif has demanded a plane to fly him from his desert hiding place to the Hague . Colonel Gaddafi's fugitive son Saif wants an aircraft to take him out of Libya's southern desert so he can turn himself in to The Hague war crimes court. According to a source within Libya's National Transitional Council, London-educated Saif, 39, is terrified of receiving the same treatment as his father who met a grisly death last week at the hands of vengeful Libyan fighters. Saif went on the run at the time of his father's capture and has indicated he is ready to surrender to justice like former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi, NTC officials have said. Both men are the subject of arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court, where officials have not been able to confirm any approach. They face charges of crimes against humanity for their response to February's uprising. Conflicting reports of Saif al-Islam's whereabouts have circulated since he vanished from the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid in the north of the country, with some accounts putting him, and Senussi, in Niger. Confirmation from Gaddafi's surviving entourage has not been available. One international lawyer who says he represents a member of the family questioned the reliability of NTC accounts but declined comment on the report of a proposed surrender. The NTC source said Saif al-Islam had not . left Libya and was being sheltered by a prominent figure among the . nomadic Tuareg people of the desert, whom he had supported financially . in the past. Demise: According a source within the NTC ruling council Saif is terrified of meeting the same grisly fate as befell his father . The rugged and empty area close to the borders of Niger and Algeria has offered an escape route to others in his family. However, under ICC indictment, Saif al-Islam would find it harder than his relatives to secure a safe haven abroad. He was reported by an aide to be fearing for his life when he fled Bani Walid, and if he has seen the gruesome video footage of his father's capture, he is likely to be under few illusions about how he might be treated if he remains in Libya. 'Saif is concerned about his safety,' the NTC source said. 'He believes handing himself over is the best option for him.' The source said Saif wanted the involvement of a third country - possibly Algeria or Tunisia - in a deal to get him to The Hague. 'He wants to be sent an aircraft,' the source said by telephone from Libya. 'He wants assurances.' Stockpile: A huge hoard of munition crates were found at an unguarded storage facility in the Libyan desert 62 miles south of Sirte . Armed to the teeth: Some of the heavy weapons discovered at the unguarded desert storage facility . Colonel Gaddafi’s driver has spoken of the dictator’s final moments, claiming his boss showed no sign of fear before he was captured by rebels. 'Everything was exploding,' said Huneish Nasr. 'The revolutionaries were coming for us. He wasn’t scared but he didn’t seem to know what to do. It was the only time I ever saw him like that.' Moments later the revolutionaries overran their position and Nasr was knocked to the ground with a rifle butt. His final glimpse of Gaddafi was of him being dragged from a drainpipe and then surrounded by rebels who started to rain blows down on him. Nasr and Gaddafi’s head of security, Mansour Dhao, are believed to be the only survivors from the guards who accompanied the Libyan leader during his final resistance in Sirte. They spent the five days before Gaddafi’s death moving from house to house. The former Libyan leader, Nasr said, appeared unable to understand how he had been reduced to such a position: 'He was strange. He was always standing still and looking to the west. I didn’t see fear in him.' Following his capture, Nasr was taken to a makeshift prison in Misrata. 'If any of the other close staff are still alive, I don’t know where they are or what happened to them,' he said. 'may be somewhere with the revolutionaries, or they may be dead.' Still dressed in the blood-stained purple shirt he wore on the day Gaddafi was killed, Nasr continued: 'I was with him for 30 years and I swear by God that I never saw any bad behaviour in him. 'He was always just my boss. I believed them when they said we are fighting bad people.' Saif's whereabouts and intentions had been tracked by monitoring satellite phone calls, the source said, together with information contained in intelligence cables. The NTC lacks the logistical capabilities to intercept fugitives deep in the desert. It has asked its Nato allies for further assistance as the Western mission winds up following the death of the ousted leader. Nato officials have made clear, however, that they are keen to cut back their commitment now. Saif had been seen by analysts as his father's heir-apparent and a potential reformer, but his bloodthirsty comments about the rebels this year forced a rethink. Gaddafi loyalist security officials in Bani Walid this week told how the son called his father frequently by satellite phone and became increasingly afraid of being hit by incoming fire. 'He was afraid of mortars,' said al-Senussi Sharif al-Senussi, a lieutenant in Gaddafi's army who was also part of Saif al-Islam's personal security team.              'He seemed confused.' Casualties: A man stands among the graves of unknown victims of the conflict . Mr Senussi, who is not related to Gaddafi's former security chief, said that Saif's convoy was hit by a Nato air strike as he fled Bani Walid but he escaped alive. Saif is the last remaining member of the Gaddafi family currently at a large. It emerged to day that family members currently hiding in Algeria plan to file a war-crimes complaint against Nato for the role they believe the international military alliance played in the former leader’s death, . Marcel Ceccaldi, a French lawyer who previously worked for Gaddafi regime and now represents his family, said the complaint would be filed with the International Criminal Court in the Hague because the family believes a Nato strike on Kadafi’s convoy led to his brutal death. Libyan authorities have said he likely died in crossfire. Others, including the international rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch, believe he was executed. But Gaddafi’s family is convinced that he  died as a result of Nato aircraft firing on his convoy as it fled Sirte. 'The willful killing [of someone protected by the Geneva Convention] is defined as a war crime by Article 8 of the ICC's Rome Statute,' Ceccaldi said. 'Gaddafi's homicide shows that the goal of [Nato] member states was not to protect civilians but to overthrow the regime.' It was unclear when the complaint would be filed, but Ceccaldi said the lawsuit would target Nato executive bodies and leaders of the alliance’s member states.","Family members announce plans to file a war-crimes complaint .

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) plans to shut down six websites based in the UK which have sold kits imported from China without the necessary CE quality mark. The websites also sold non-compliant testing devices for other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis. Wrong results: People who have purchased illegal HIV tests online in the UK have been contacted by the Health Protection Agency to say that they are inaccurate . Almost 500 people have already bought the kits, which allow users to test themselves for infection in their own homes. People have been browsing the internet to buy the products as an anonymous alternative to being tested in a clinic. Some of the kits came with no instructions at all, while others were confusing or insufficient. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has written to people who have purchased the kits, warning them that they do not comply with UK guidelines. The list of people who had bought tests were contained in sales records uncovered during the MHRA investigation. The agency regularly scans the internet to catch websites selling illegal devices. More than 1,100 people would have to be . offered HIV tests in the emergency room to find just one new infection . with the potentially deadly virus, researchers from France said this week. This means that while home tests for the disease are currently illegal, testing in busy hospitals is not the right solution either. Their conclusion - that universal HIV screening in casualty is not a . practical option - contradicts current recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the UK, people are urged to visit their most convenient GUM clinic or go to their local GP. In order to comply with EU rules, kits must carry the CE kite mark and the name and address of the manufacturer or an EU-based representative. It is illegal in the UK to sell any kits to test for HIV, but not for other sexually transmitted infections. The HPA stressed that free and confidential tests are available on the NHS. Susanne Ludgate, the MHRA's clinical director of services, said: 'As far as self-test kits for sexually transmitted infections are concerned, purchasers should check that any kits purchased from internet sites are CE marked, which should denote conformity with the relevant European legislation. 'We're concerned that there may be a number of self-test kits being sold online that may not be compliant with the relevant piece of legislation and we're urging people not to consider the internet as a method of anonymous testing. 'These kits may be unreliable and there is a significant risk they could be providing the user with a false result.' Dr Fortune Ncube, from the HPA's blood-borne viruses department, said: 'If anybody feels they have put . themselves at risk they should contact their local GP or go to their . most convenient GUM clinic, where they can receive a full screen for all . STIs, including HIV. 'Rapid and confidential tests, as well as sexual health advice, are available through the NHS without charge.'",Kits have been imported from China without necessary quality checks .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:22 PM on 27th October 2011 . Inspirational soldier: Mark Stebbing was crushed to death by a horse at a Help For Heroes parade held at Sandown . A soldier who survived having a leg amputated was killed when he was thrown from and then crushed by a horse during a Help for Heroes event, an inquest has heard. Platoon Sergeant Mark Stebbing, 39, had undergone just one hour of riding tuition before mounting a large former racehorse named William at Sandown Park, Surrey. As Sergeant Stebbing was being led back to the stables after the event the thoroughbred horse unexpectedly reared up, sending him tumbling off the back of the 16-hand steed - around six ft tall. The former national hunt racehorse then fell backwards, crushing Sgt. Stebbing beneath him, shattering his pelvis along with his ribs and back vertebrae. Sgt. Stebbing, who served in the Gulf War, was treated in hospital, but later died. As a Platoon Sergeant serving with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) in Aldershot, Hampshire, Sgt. Stebbing was hailed as a role model by many of his colleagues thanks to the way he dealt with his life-changing amputation. The soldier had been selected to take part in . the event because he had given fellow servicemen reassurance on how . to cope with the loss of a limb. He chose to have the dramatic surgery on his right leg in August 2008 after suffering complications when he broke both ankles during an Army drill. His widow, Collette, told the inquest into her husband's death that her husband had been a keen charity fundraiser and had often acted as a mentor to younger soldiers who were living with similar injuries. She said: 'There were two soldiers who had been injured and he had to go and talk to them. 'There was a young man who went through the same operation so Mark went round to speak to him and showed him his own leg.' Mrs Stebbing said that her husband had been looking forward to taking part in the Heroes Parade at Sandown Park, organised by Battle Back, an initiative offering adventure training and sports rehabilitation for soldiers, which was backed by military charity Help for Heroes. Unprepared: Sgt. Mark Stebbing, pictured with with England rugby star Johnny Wilkinson, had just one hour of riding tuition ahead of the event . The Royal Engineer had only taken an hour-long riding lesson at Sandhurst Military Academy a week before the event and was feeling confident about his stint on horseback. 'He had been to Sandhurst for a riding lesson,' said Mrs Stebbing. 'He rode motorbikes and he did well in the lesson so he was allowed to take part. 'He was excited and looking forward to it.' Other riders taking part in the parade on February 18 this year, were riding military horses but Sgt. Stebbing was given ex-racehorse William to ride in front of 5,000 spectators. The original plan had been for seven soldiers to take part in a race but this was downgraded to a parade when there was not enough time to train the riders sufficiently. There was concern when the horse reared slightly during the five-lap ride around the Surrey racecourse's parade ring but the soldier leading Sgt. Stebbing's was able to bring William under control. However, as the horse and rider were being led back to the stable after the parade, William reared up again, only this time he could not be controlled and Sgt. Stebbing was thrown to the ground where the horse fell onto him. Death fall: The accident happened at Sandown Park in Surrey and is best known for its racecourse . The soldier was taken to St. George's Hospital in Tooting, London, where he died on March 16 of bronchial pneumonia caused by the multiple injuries he sustained during the crush. William's owner Carol Nash said that she had never known the horse to rear up before, and that it was used to being handled or ridden by different people. However, she said she had been shocked when she learned Sgt. Stebbing had barely ridden before. Other riders in the event had been given military horses from the King's Troop to ride, which the inquest at Woking Coroner's Court heard tended to be more docile, less easily spooked and more suitable for riders with limited experience. 'He went right over, which caused his injuries,' she said. Charity: The event was organised by Battle Back and supported by the Help For Heroes campaign . 'I'm not blaming anyone but it's very unfortunate. 'Thoroughbred horses are like Formula One cars and you have to treat them in a certain way, with a huge amount of respect.' Mrs Nash said that Sgt. Stebbing had been using a custom-made saddle for William as well as her own stirrups, which she said would have been suitable for use with his prosthetic leg. She said that it was likely that when the horse had reared up, as an inexperienced rider Sgt. Stebbing's reaction would have been to pull on the reins - which only would have made the situation worse. A Health and Safety Executive investigation ruled that the accident could not have been forseen and that all procedures had been followed prior to the parade. However, Lieutenant Colonel Reynold Blue who investigated Sgt. Stebbing's fall on behalf of the Army said that following the death he had recommended that at future events horses and riders should be matched according to capability, with injuries taken into account. He said: 'At any event the competence of the rider should be assessed. 'There needs to be some form of standards assessment.' He also said that horses and riders should train together prior to any event, preferably at the venue itself. Surrey Coroner Michael Burgess recorded a verdict of accidental death. 'Mark Stebbing slipped off the back of the horse and in all probability him holding onto the reigns pulled the horse's head back, which would exacerbate the situation of the horse,' he said.","Sgt.

Hundreds of police union members turned up outside court today  to support 16 New York policemen charged with abusing their authority by helping family and friends avoid paying traffic tickets. The 13 officers, two sergeants, one lieutenant and five others were arraigned in a Bronx court on Friday after handing themselves in last night following a mammoth city investigation. But union members made their voice heard by clogging the street near the courthouse, filling the hallways near the arraignment room and applauding in court after the officers left. Charged: Top row (left to right) Joseph Anthony, Virgilio Bencosme, Jason Cenizal, Jennara Cobb; bottom row (left to right) Eugene P. O'Reilly, Jaime Payan, Ruben Peralta, Jose R. Ramos . Charged: Top row (left to right) Michael Hernandez, Marc Manara, Christopher Manzi, Brian McGuckin; bottom row (left to right) Jeffrey L. Regan, Luis R. Rodriguez, Christopher Scott, Jacob G. Solorzano . Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said ticket fixing was sanctioned at the highest levels of the department, and he vowed that when the dust settled, they would prove it. 'Taking care of your family, taking care of your friends is not a crime,' he said. 'To take a courtesy and turn it into a crime is wrong.' The case began with a 2009 internal . probe into Bronx officer Jose Ramos, who was suspected of associating . with a drug dealer, officials said. While . listening to the NYPD officer's phone, investigators allegedly heard . calls from people seeing if he could fix tickets for them. Ramos has been working for the department for nearly 18 years. He and his wife were arrested at their home on Thursday night. All other 15 policemen turned themselves in, reported the New York Post. Standing together: Police officers and union members demonstrate in support of the police officers indicted . Standing up: The court halls were swarmed with people, and hundreds of officers carrying signs stood outside the courthouse and applauded as the accused officers walked through . The policemen in court on Friday pleaded not guilty to charges including misconduct, grand larceny and obstructing administration. ‘If he had done any of these things that they say, they would've arrested him two months ago,’ his lawyer John Sandleitner said. ‘Or two years ago’ ‘Why did they let him go to work, then? Bring the charges on. None of this slipping it out and releasing to the press.’ The conversation overheard on the Ramos wiretap led to more wiretaps that produced evidence of other officers having similar conversations. Some of those arrested are officials . within the department's largest and most powerful union, the Patrolmen's . Benevolent Association. The union's members were out in force at the court on Friday. Arraigned: Bronx police officer Jose Ramos, left, appears with his attorney John Sandleitner in court on Friday . An unrelated Bronx drink-driving case . forced prosecutors to reveal that the arresting officer was among those . recorded talking about ticket fixing. 'Why did they let him go to work, then? Bring the charges on. None of this slipping it out and releasing to the press . John Sandleitner, lawyer for Bronx officer Jose Ramos . A union delegate allegedly told an officer ‘I'll get this taken care of’ by having a ticket issued to a girlfriend of the officer's cousin pulled the next day, a phone transcript said. The case doesn't appear to rise to the level of the more notorious corruption scandals in the nation's largest police department. But in terms of the number of officers facing charges, it represents the largest crackdown on police accused of misconduct in recent memory. Five current and three former officers were hit with charges including conspiracy  earlier this week for allegedly being part of a gun-running ring. Voices heard: Police officers and union members demonstrate outside Bronx Supreme Court in the Bronx borough of New York in support of the police officers indicted in a ticket-fixing scandal . Arriving: A black NYPD police van delivers some of 17 police officers indicted in a ticket-fixing scandal in New York from Bronx Central Booking to Bronx Supreme Court on Friday . In another recent unrelated case, an officer was charged with arresting a black man without cause and using a racial slur to describe him. One other case involved an officer using a law enforcement database to try to trump up charges against an innocent man. 'This issue could have and should have been addressed differently' Patrick Lynch, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association . As the ticket-fixing investigation unfolded, union officials complained that the probe unfairly singled out officers for an unofficial practice. This is the practice of undoing paperwork on traffic citations before they reach court, which has been tolerated for years. ‘This issue could have and should have been addressed differently,’ Mr Lynch said. Aside from those officers charged criminally, dozens more could face internal charges from the NYPD, which has about 35,000 officers. Backing: Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch speaks at a news conference in support of the police officers indicted in a ticket-fixing scandal at the Bronx Supreme Court on Friday . Problems: Commissioner Raymond Kelly has addressed the issue by installing a new system to track tickets and make it harder to tamper with the paper trail . The last serious NYPD corruption scandal was the ‘Dirty 30’ case involving more than 33 officers from Harlem's 30th Precinct in the early 1990s. Most pleaded guilty to charges including stealing cash from drug dealers, taking bribes, beating suspects and lying under oath to cover their tracks. In one disciplinary case from earlier . this year, a former union financial secretary in the Bronx admitted . administrative misconduct charges. That secretary was docked 40 days of vacation and suspended for five days. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly has addressed the issue. The force installed a new computer system last autumn that tracks tickets and makes it harder to tamper with the paper trail. Commissioner Kelly also recently formed a new unit within internal affairs to look into ticket fixing. Its officers sit in on traffic court testimony and comb through paperwork to ensure none of the methods are being wrongly employed.","Huge investigation started with wiretap of officer with 'links to drug dealer'

Women who carry HPV (pictured) are at greater risk of heart disease a study shows and the HPV vaccine is being cited as a preventative measure . Women who carry the  human papillomavirus (HPV) are more than twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those who test negative, a study shows. Researchers at the University of Texas discovered those who test positive for HPV - one of the most common sexually transmitted infections - are also at greater risk from heart disease. Although long-term studies are needed to confirm the link, scientists are already citing the HPV vaccine as a preventative measure. The HPV vaccine protects against two types of human papilloma virus that are responsible for 70 per cent of cervical cancer. Data from around 2,500 women . between the ages of 20 and 59 was gathered from a . 2003 - 2006 U.S. National Health Survey and Nutrition Examination Survey. In total 44.6 per cent carried some form of HPV while 23.2 per cent had the cancer-causing strains of the virus. After assessing medical history and lifestyle patterns the team discovered the two well known 'cancer-causing' strains of HPV were 'strongly associated' with heart disease. Women who tested positive for any of . the 37 strains of the virus were 2.3 times . more likely to have had either a heart attack or stroke while women who tested positive for . cancer-causing strains had 2.86 times . the risk of heart disease. Lead author Dr Ken Fujise said: 'I thought there would be a weak link . between HPV and cardiovascular disease, but I didn't expect [the risk] . to be 2.3 times as high.' Jab: Girls in the UK are offered a vaccine against two major strains of HPV that are known to cause 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases . The study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was aimed at discovering why almost 20 per cent of those who develop . heart disease do not present traditional risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure. Dr Fujise . said that the new research indicates that HPV could be the nontraditional factor responsible. He added: 'This is very first study to link HPV with [heart disease]. 'However, our data suggests those . patients should be followed more closely by their doctors — if [they] . have chest pain, take it very seriously. 'The HPV vaccine may also help prevent heart disease.' Dr Nieca Goldberg, medical director at New York University told USA Today: 'It is great that researchers are thinking out of the box to assess cardiovascular risk in women. 'If more studies confirm these new research findings linking HPV to cardiovascular disease, this would be an additional tool for doctors to assess a women's cardiovascular risk. 'It would also get younger women to take their hearts seriously.' Currently in the UK the HPV vaccine called Cervarix is offered to children aged 12 to 13 at school.","First study to link HPV with heart disease .

As EU officials flew to Beijing to beg for financial help last night, Brussels was accused of allowing China to ‘buy Europe’s silence’ over its appalling human rights record. Campaigners spoke out after the head of Europe’s bailout fund arrived in the Chinese capital to discuss the terms on which the hardline regime might agree to inject billions into the struggling eurozone countries. Campaigners fear EU negotiators will cave in to Chinese demands to tone down criticism of the regime’s human rights record. 'Buying silence': As EU chief executive of financial stability Klaus Regling (left) flies into China questions are raised about what Hu Jintao will demand in return . Experts believe Beijing will also press for the lifting of a long-standing Western arms embargo and demand preferential trade terms. Tim Hancock, campaigns director at Amnesty International, warned there was a real danger that Beijing would exploit Europe’s weakness for its own ends. He said: ‘Human rights concerns must not be traded away in return for Chinese assistance in the euro crisis. ‘In particular, speculation about a possible lifting of the ban on EU arms sales to China is extremely worrying, especially in the context of an ongoing crackdown on dissent and criticism there. 'Buy Europe's silence': As the head of Europe's bailout fund arrived in Beijing campaigners are questioning the price of any possible bailout . ‘China must not be allowed to buy silence from Europe. If our silence on human rights issues is at stake, then that is too big a price for Europe and for China’s citizens to have to pay.’ The warning came as Klaus Regling, chief executive of the European Financial Stability Facility, began a humiliating mission to China to ask for financial aid. His visit follows a pledge by French President Nicolas Sarkozy to lobby his counterpart Hu Jintao directly over the issue. China, which has a £2.1trillion cash reserve, is seen as one of the few countries capable of shoring up the struggling euro. The visit follows French president Nicolas Sarkozy lobbying Hu Jintao over a possible bail out . Officials believe Beijing might be persuaded to stump up £60billion to bolster the new euro bailout fund designed to support the struggling economies of Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Mr Regling said he was holding consultations to decide the terms for raising the money and was not yet at the point of detailed negotiations on a deal. He said: ‘Don’t expect any precise outcome of our talks. I cannot say today, and it’s certainly far too early to say what kind of amounts might be envisaged.' Joining a bailout could help China establish itself as one of the elite governments that helps manage the world economy. China is said to be keen to see the euro survive as a counterbalance to the dollar. But Beijing was badly burned by losses made on investments in the United States in the 2008 crash, and is expected to demand firm guarantees that it will not suffer a repeat if it agrees to shore up Europe. The Chinese are also pressing for formal recognition by the EU that they now operate a ‘market economy’. This would make it far harder to take retaliatory action against the dumping of cheap Chinese goods in this country. Professor Shaun Breslin, a China expert at Warwick University, said China had a long record of securing demands in return for cash. He said Beijing’s key demands were likely to be economic. But he added: ‘They don’t like being lectured on human rights and although they can get arms from Israel and Russia, they don’t like the arms embargo because they feel it puts them in the same category as regimes like Burma and Zimbabwe.’ However, Professor Breslin warned that any move to bail out Europe would be controversial within China, where poverty is still rife, particularly in rural areas. Lu Daokui, a member of China’s central bank monetary committee, warned on Thursday that China would not throw money into parts of the EU economy deemed a lost cause. He said: ‘The last thing China wants is to throw away the country’s wealth and be seen as just a source of dumb money.’ By KIRSTY WALKER, JASON GROVES and LIZ HULL . David Cameron: There is growing resentment among Tory MPs over his heavy-handed tactics . David Cameron’s support among women is slipping away, with just 43 per cent saying that they approve of the Prime Minister. A Harris Interactive survey for the Daily Mail has revealed a growing divide between the sexes, with 54 per cent of men saying that Mr Cameron is doing a good job. The figures will fuel fears among senior Tories that the Coalition, and Mr Cameron in particular, has a ‘woman problem’. Most worryingly for the Prime Minister is that half of all women between 45 and 54 said they thought the Prime Minister was doing a bad job. The survey follows a poll earlier in the month which found that one in four voters believe Mr Cameron’s attitude to women is ‘sexist’. Tory strategists are concerned that the Coalition’s cuts are seen as particularly harmful to women, with recent figures showing that the number of unemployed women has reached a million. Mr Cameron’s standing with women has not been helped by controversial calls from his policy guru Steve Hilton to scrap maternity pay. A leaked report of the Beecroft report, commissioned by the PM, is said to suggest that Mr Cameron scale back on his pledges to extend flexible working rights. Concerns over Tories’ loss of female support has prompted Mr Cameron to go on a charm offensive in recent weeks. He made a grovelling apology to two female MPs whom he was accused of dismissing with sexist put-downs in the House of Commons, admitting he had ‘screwed up’. The Prime Minister wrote to bosses of some of the UK’s top companies warning them that they must do more to promote women into senior positions.

The first wife of TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson labelled him a 'bully and a hypocrite' as she lifted the lid on their alleged clandestine 10-year affair today. In a revealing interview, Alex Hall claimed she 'still loved' Top Gear presenter Clarkson, but that she'd had enough of being portrayed as a 'blackmailer' for wanting to write a book about their marriage. The mother-of-two said she felt forced to defend herself after revelations about their alleged affair, which purportedly happened while he was married to second wife Francie, were made public this week. Clarkson has denied the affair and, according to her, she has come under heavy criticism from her ex-husband's supporters, it has been reported. She told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I am standing up to rich bullies. Because of his lies and bullying I have to fight back and defend myself and think about my family. 'I have never, ever let him down and have been a discreet, decent, loyal ex-wife who has never said a word to the papers, until now. But now I've had enough.' This week TV presenter . Clarkson lifted a gagging order on Miss Hall which banned her from . revealing intimate details of their relationship, after deciding court . injunctions were ‘pointless.’ The father-of-three won an injunction last year against his first wife, whom he married in 1989. The pair first met through friends when Alex was 17 and Clarkson was 22. They quickly moved in together and lived together for eight years, even sharing an office in Fulham, where he ran Motoring Press Agency and she ran Alltypes, a secretarial services business. The court order prevented her from . publishing ‘information to the effect that AMM (Clarkson) and HXW (Hall) have had a sexual relationship since AMM married his present wife’. The injunction also banned details of . ‘sexual or other intimate acts or dealings’ between the couple, and . confidential information about Clarkson’s ‘sexual life, his relationship . with others, his private thoughts and feelings, his health, or his . financial affairs’. But . Clarkson, 51, said he had regretted it from the day it was granted and . decided to unmask himself and lift the High Court order on Wednesday. He . said injunctions could not prevent comments being published in the . ‘legal free world on Twitter and the internet’. He also said that his . mother had been seriously ill when he went to the High Court last . October. Alex Hall: 'Haunted by Clarkson's fame for 20 years', left, and right, Clarkson with second wife Francie . Miss Hall said she had 'honoured and loved' Clarkson throughout their alleged relationship - before and after they were wed - and even blamed her feelings for him for the break up of her second marriage. She added: 'Even though the injunction terrified me and I have trembled for a month, I have honoured and loved him for 28 years.' The pair married in 1989 at St Andrews Church, South Warnborough, Hampshire, and went on honeymoon to Mauritius. Among their guests were Steve Hall, Alex's second husband, and Clarkson's second wife Frances Cain, 50 who he went on to marry in 1993. Miss Hall said she deeply regrets the break-up but claims she fell for their mutual friend Steve about a year after she married Clarkson. She has denied she left the Top Gear presenter because he was a 'opinionated lazy slob' and said she felt it would be the honourable thing to leave Clarkson after believing she had feelings for Steve. Miss Hall claims she quickly regretted this and asked Clarkson for forgiveness but she said he wanted to punish her and decided that it was best she live on her own for a while. True love: Alex has said she deeply regrets leaving Clarkson, who she refers to as her childhood sweetheart. The Top Gear presenter would visit her at her home in Surrey . Miss Hall then married Steve in 1993 and had two children with him but they divorced in 1996 after he realised she was still in love with her former husband. Miss Hall also claimed that she initially had no intention of revealing anything about her alleged affair in the book and only told Clarkson she was writing memoirs about their marriage out of 'courtesy'. However, he reacted by telling her he would not 'let her write' about their relationship or their marriage - even historically, she has claimed. Despite revealing her anger at the furore surrounding the revelations - and, what she sees as, a subsequent smear campaign against her - the 46-year-old, from Surrey said she would still take Clarkson back. Fight-back: Miss Hall seen in London last week after the revelations about the alleged affair were made public . She told the Sunday Express: Yes, I still love Jeremy and have feelings for him. I want him back. I don't feel we committed adultery during the affair because he was my husband. 'He was like a pair of comfy slippers. I know he'll call again in about six months. I will see him and it will carry on.' They allegedly reunited for an illicit affair in 1999, after the millionaire met her for lunch at the Pharmacy restaurant in Nootting Hill, west London. Miss Hall said she met Clarkson at his Fulham flat later that night and ended up having sex in a blue-striped sofa bed which they had owned when they were married. It was after that night that they continued to see each other and Miss Hall claims Clarkson would come to her home in Surrey after a full day filming Top Gear at the Dunsfold track. She even claims the pair stayed together at Madonna's faviourite hotel, the four-star Parador de Ronda in southern Spain while he was filming in 2007. Miss Hall said the pair rarely went outdoors for fear of being photographed together. In 2009, on September 22 and what would have been their 20th anniversary, Miss Hall said she received a text message from Clarkson which said: 'Do you know what day it is?' She claims he sent this because, like her, he has not been able to move on after the break-up of their marriage. Miss Hall claims Frances 'turned a blind eye' to the alleged affair. She also revealed that leaving Clarkson was one of her biggest mistakes.","Hall claims she was a 'discreet, decent, loyal ex-wife'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:20 AM on 27th October 2011 . A mother is furious after her baby girl sucked a piece of cannabis she picked up in the nappy-changing area of a KFC restaurant. Stacey Rush snatched the drug before Lily, her 17-month-old daughter, could swallow it. She complained, but all the manager did was offer a Fruit Shoot to wash out the infant's mouth. 'He said it happens all the time and there was nothing he could do,' said Miss Rush, a mother of two from Newbury, Berkshire. 'But if you knew someone was taking drugs in your toilet, you'd do something about it.' Shocking discovery: The KFC on Wharf Road, Newbury, Berkshire, where Stacey Rush's baby daughter found the cannabis . Miss Rush, 24, said she was sickened to find that cannabis mixed with tobacco had been left in the baby changing area, and horrified after staff initially refused to say sorry. She said: 'I didn't spot it but then I saw Lily had something in her mouth. When I realised it was cannabis I felt sick. 'It was all over the floor mixed with tobacco. What if she had swallowed it? 'There was no apology. All they did is offer a Fruit Shoot to wash the cannabis out of her mouth. I won't go there again.' Cannabis users often mix the drug with tobacco before rolling it into long cigarettes, or 'spliffs'. Secretive: Cannabis users often seek out private, secluded spots like public toilets and changing rooms to prepare their drug . Public toilets and changing rooms are . frequently used as locations for users to prepare their cannabis . cigarettes away from prying eyes. Miss Rush, who also has a . four-year-old son, had taken Lily into the KFC branch in Wharf Road, . Newbury, just before lunchtime and taken the opportunity to change her . nappy. She said: 'The cannabis was lying about on the baby-changing platform and some had also fallen on to the floor. Research shows smoking marijuana can accelerate the onset of psychotic illness such as schizophrenia by up to three years. Eighty-three studies involving 22,000 people were analysed. It found people vulnerable to mental health problems were likely to suffer symptoms at a much younger age if they used the drug. The findings confirmed that it accelerates the onset of full-blown mental illness, which makes it harder to treat successfully. Dr Matthew Large and colleagues at the Prince of Wales Hospital, New South Wales, claimed 'overwhelming evidence' showed it triggered schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This was perhaps through an interaction between genetic and environmental disorders or by disrupting brain development. 'Goodness knows who left it there - it's . horrifying and sickening to think a mum had been in there rolling a . joint while they changed their baby's nappy. 'I thought these fast-food restaurants sent people in all the time to check on the toilet areas and baby changing facilities to make sure they're kept clean. 'It doesn't say much for their standards if someone can wander into a baby changing area and smoke a joint without any of the staff noticing. 'If my baby had ingested some of this cannabis goodness knows what it would have done to her.' A KFC spokesman said: 'We were shocked to hear of this incident, and have spoken with Miss Rush to apologise for her experience. 'We take hygiene very seriously in all of our stores, and our toilets are cleaned every half an hour. 'We are currently investigating the substance to determine what it was, and have reminded staff at our Newbury restaurant to be extra-vigilant in the future.' The fast food chain, which says it is considering compensating Miss Rush, said it had not yet informed the police but would do so if the substance is confirmed to be illegal.","Manager offers her Fruit Shoot to rinse infant's mouth .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:20 PM on 29th October 2011 . A man accused of tying up a 14-year-old schoolgirl in his Ohio basement in 1967 before killing her and dumping her body was convicted Friday of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Robert Bowman, 75, took the witness stand before his sentencing to deny involvement in the killing after hearing the victim's sister describe how Eileen Adams' death tore her family apart. 'I recognize the pain and suffering I've just heard,' Bowman said, according to the Associated Press, but 'I'm . not responsible for that,' he added. 'I feel no remorse.' Cold-case killer: Robert Bowman is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of 14-year-old Eileen Adams in 1967 . Among new DNA evidence used against him, the trial featured interrogation tapes of Bowman neither denying his involvement in the girl's death or admitting to it. He promises to not make prosecution too easy for them. 'All . this is just a waste of time. What you want me to do is to confess to . something like that which you're not going to get. I'm not going to say . anything . that can be held against me. I'm just not going to make it that easy . for you,' Bowman told prosecutors on the tapes, according to WTOL-TV. Dolls also found in his possession in the 80s featuring nails in the back of their heads, similar to how Eileen's body was found, were also presented. Bowman claimed they were there only to play with prosecutors. When Eileen's body was found it was rapped in a rug and left in a southern Michigan field after being sexually assaulted, tied up and a nail driven through the back of her head. Her sister, Maggie Kirschman, who was eight when her sister disappeared a week before Christmas on her way home from school, said there was 'no forgetting' for her or their six other siblings. Two of them, along with their parents, died in recent years, missing the final sentencing. Closure: Eileen Adam's siblings, from left, Maryann Brimmer, Maggie Kirschman, Ruth Mulford and Al Adams say they're starting a new life after their sister's murder was convicted Friday . After hearing previous testimony by . Bowman's ex-wife against him, describing the girl found tied up 'hanging . like Jesus' in their basement, Ms Kirschman said her family felt . hopeless, with the jury not finding enough evidence for his conviction. 'It was as if there was nothing we could do. It made us all sick,' she said. After stumping prosecutors with a . lack of hard evidence, the case against Bowman was dismissed before a . cold-case squad linked new DNA evidence to Bowman in 2008. He was charged in the killing, however was unable to be located or known if still alive. 'I'm not going to make it that easy for you': New evidence at the murder trial of Robert Bowman included interrogation tapes of Bowman promising investigators not to make it too easy . Victim's clothing: A prosecutor held up an article of clothing the 14-year-old was found wearing when she was found rapped in a rug in a Michigan field . He was profiled on 'America's Most . Wanted' and police in California arrested him after he was spotted riding a bicycle. His attorney said he had been living in the desert under a tarp. During the earlier August trial, . Margaret Bowman, one of the key witnesses against her ex-husband, . offered a chilling account of discovering the girl after hearing what . she thought were rats in the cellar. She told jurors she opened a wooden . door and was stunned to find a naked young girl tied-up and 'hanging . like Jesus'. Her arms were outstretched and she had tape covering her . mouth. Mrs Bowman said she knew the girl was alive because: 'I looked in her eyes.' Schoolgirl: Miss Adams never returned home from Central Catholic High School, Toledo, on that cold December day in 1968 . Headlines: The death of Eileen Adams was widely covered in the media. A clipping here details how body was found in a Michigan field in 1967 . Mugshot: This is a police photo of Bowman from 1962 - five years before the killing . 'I was horrified, I was screaming, I was shaking,' she added. 'I didn't know what to think.' She said she ran upstairs and that her . husband confronted her, saying that she was getting into his business . and that he now had to kill the girl. He also threatened to kill his wife and their newborn daughter if she told anyone, she said. Mrs Bowman said she never went in the basement again. 'That was enough,' she said. That same night, she testified, Bowman . made her go with him as he dumped the body just north of Toledo, across . the state line in Michigan. The defense had previously questioned the credibility of her testimony and why she waited so long to contact authorities. Confrontation: Bowman was questioned by Ed Miller from America's Most Wanted before the trial . Gruesome: Miss Adams was found hogtied with telephone cables and with a nail driven in her head . Mrs Bowman said that at some point she . discovered school books on a table in the kitchen. She opened one of . the books and saw the name Eileen Adams written inside. The couple moved several times, . including to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami. Ms Bowman said she didn't go . to police until 1981, after she had saved enough money to leave her . husband and return to Toledo. That was the first time anyone connected Bowman to the killing. Detectives tracked Bowman down to . Miami, Florida in 1982. Once a successful businessman who sold high-end . handbags in Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue stores, he was living in . an abandoned restaurant near Miami, wearing a tattered shirt, jeans and . a scruffy beard. Bowman's attorney said he had become involved in an offbeat religion and given up all of his material things. Three more decades passed until . cold-case detectives took DNA samples from Bowman's ex-wife and their . daughter and compared them with DNA found on Adams' clothing. Bowman said that he intends to appeal Friday's conviction.","Eileen Adams was hogtied with cords when found dead .

"By . Tim Corkett . Last updated at 3:49 PM on 30th October 2011 . In a chilling photograph unearthed last week, the Hitchin Grammar School hockey team look on nonchalantly as they are confronted with the Nazi salute, and three sharp cries of ‘Heil Hitler’. Now one of the boys in the image has revealed how they got their own back on their German opponents – by taking photographs on the away leg of their sporting clash that would provide vital intelligence to the Dambusters bombers. Graham Sainsbury, who was 15 at the time of the ‘friendly’ game in March 1939, has told how the schoolboys travelled to Essen in the Ruhr valley a few weeks later for a return match. Horrid: The Hitchin Grammar School hockey team playing at home to a German side were stunned when their opponents suddenly clicked to attention and gave the hated Nazi salute . During their trip, they visited the new Baldeneysee dam, taking sightseeing photographs that would provide invaluable information about its design for 617 Squadron’s daring raids on the nearby Mohne and Eder dams four years later. Mr Sainsbury, now 88, said that he submitted his holiday snaps after the government appealed for any pictures of German infrastructure citizens might have. ‘They asked for any photographs of the dams on the Ruhr and the Rhine,’ he recalled from his home in Weston, Hertfordshire. ‘I had taken pictures from the top of the dam. ‘I gave them everything I had. It allowed our people to look at the way the German dams were constructed. It might have helped the Dambusters. Got his own back: Graham Sainsbury, pictured here during his Army days, took pictures on his school hockey team's away leg in Germany which provided vital intelligence to the Dambusters bombers . ‘At the time I had no idea that the photographs would mean anything at all. I can’t really recall what the dam looked like, though I seem to remember some big spherical boulders. It was just part of the sightseeing trip.’ Although Baldeneysee was not targeted by Guy Gibson’s bombers, information about the construction of the dams was vital in ensuring Barnes Wallis’s bouncing bombs would avoid defences and strike vulnerable points. The 1943 raids caused flooding, badly damaging German production, including the Krupp arms factory in Essen. Mr Sainsbury, who thinks he is the third boy along in the photograph, obscured but wearing glasses, said: ‘It was just a routine hockey match. ‘Beforehand, the dear old master Mr Bowker said, “They are going to line up and they will give you their normal salute. You are not to laugh, grimace or make any other gesture. Just be British and when they have done it, get on with the match.” There was no hatred. This is what they did, then they played hockey. We did not know then what it meant. We had no idea of the horrors to come.’ Mr Sainsbury said that during  their visit to Germany, they went to  a Hitler Youth meeting. He said: ‘We were entertained by a Hitler Youth group and, typically of British youngsters, we wanted a souvenir. I got a bayonet with a Hitler Youth badge on the handle.’ The picture of the Nazi salute was discovered by former BBC newsreader Richard Whitmore, 77, and an archivist for the Hitchin Historical Society. Mr Whitmore said: ‘Although I was a pupil at the grammar school from 1943 this was the first time  I had heard of the incident, and I don’t mind admitting that it sent a shiver down my spine.’ Mr Sainsbury later served as an infantryman with the Essex Regiment, seeing action at Arnhem. After demob, he worked for a bank and a chemical firm and ran the village post office in Willian, Hertfordshire, with his wife Olive, 80, for 26 years until they retired in 1990. He added: ‘It is a shame but I think all the others in the hockey team have died. I can remember the names of some of them: Lester, Jackson, Waters, and Grant was the goalkeeper. ‘It was so strange to see that photograph after all these years. I was flabbergasted. They were our guests and at that time I don’t think anyone was serious about the Nazis.’",Teenager took pictures on school hockey team's away leg in Germany and passed them to government .
"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 11:50 AM on 30th October 2011 . Twelve Americans and a Canadian were killed on Saturday when a Taliban suicide bomber struck a coalition vehicle in Afghanistan’s capital. Four U.S. troops and one Canadian solider died in the blast as well as eight American civilian contractors. It is the deadliest attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul since the war began and is a major setback for the alliance as it begins to scale back combat troops. Horror scene: A Nato helicopter flies over the site of a bomb blast in Kabul. 12 Americans and a Canadian lost their lives. Casualties: Four U.S. troops and one Canadian solider died in the attack . It was initially thought that all five soldiers killed were Americans. However,  a Canadian defense spokesperson, told The Associated Press that a Canadian soldier was among the troops killed. The attack is thought to be the worst loss of American life in Afghanistan since 33 soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash on August 6. Emergency: Two Nato helicopters land at the site of the horrific suicide attack near Darul Aman palace in Kabul . Recovery: Nato military helicopters shift bodies and injured from the scene of the attack in Kabul . The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which also killed three Afghan civilians and one policeman. Eight other Afghans, including two children and four other civilians, were wounded, said Kabir Amiri, head of Kabul hospitals. The strike occurred near Darulaman Palace, the bombed-out seat of former Afghan kings on the southwest outskirts of the capital. Wreckage: A tank which was destroyed in the deadly car bombing . Rescue work: US soldiers work to help victims . It was the deadliest of two attacks . in the day that targeted either the U.S-led coalition or Afghan . government offices in the country. 'Initial reports indicate that there . has been a vehicle-borne IED attack today against a coalition vehicle in . Kabul,' Nato said in a statement, using military terminology for a car . bomb. The alliance said 'several' of its service members were among the casualties of the attack, but provided no other details. The Taliban claim came shortly after the attack in a text message to media outlets. Gruesome: A military doctor from the Afghan National Army provides first aid to an injured soldier . Dreadful day: US troops prepare to remove the wreckage of a bus hit by a suicide attack . Amid a new deadly attack that claimed the lives of 13 American in Afghanistan, a new report shows that a strong Taliban still remains. The Pentagon said that militants can still pack a punch when it comes to launching attacks in the Afghan capital of Kabul. The report, released Friday, said the Taliban-led insurgency remains 'adaptive and resilient' and with a 'regenerative capacity.' In addition, the insurgency is enabled by safe havens in Pakistan. The document maintains that the U.S. goal in Afghanistan is to fight off the Taliban and deny its ability to overthrow the Afghan government and to allow Afghanistan’s forces to take over the country’s security by 2014. An Associated Press reporter on the scene said that Nato and Afghan forces had sealed off the area. Two Nato helicopters landed to airlift casualties. The back end of a Nato bus appeared to have been blown apart and was turned into a charred shell. Earlier Saturday, a female suicide bomber blew herself up as she tried to attack a local government office in the capital of Kunar province, a hotbed of militancy in northeast Afghanistan along the Pakistan border. Abdul Sabor Allayar, deputy provincial police chief, said the guards outside the government's intelligence office in Asad Abad became suspicious of the woman and started shooting, at which point she deonated her explosives. Afghan and U.S.-led coalition forces . conducted operations earlier this month, killing more than 100 . insurgents in an effort to curb violence in rugged areas of Kunar where . the coalition and Afghan government have a light footprint. Farther . south along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Afghan and coalition . forces captured two leaders of the Haqqani network and two other . suspected insurgents in Sarobi district of Paktika province, the . coalition said. Haqqani fighters, who are affiliated with the Taliban and Al-Qaida, are heavily rooted in Paktika and neighbouring Paktia and Khost provinces. One of the captured leaders provided insurgent fighters with funding, weapons, supplies and hideouts, and the other coordinated attacks against Afghan forces, the coalition said.","Four U.S. troops and one Canadian soldier killed together with eight American contractors .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:22 AM on 30th October 2011 . New York has today been hit by more than one inch of snowfall before Halloween for the first time ever - with experts predicting much more on the way. A cold weather front is chugging up the East Coast of the U.S at an unusually early period and is expected to dump up to 10inches throughout the region. More than 1.5 million homes have already lost power in the storm. Some places in mid-Atlantic states  saw more than half a foot of snow and approximately 250,000 customers lost power in Pennsylvania and Maryland, requiring utility crews from Ohio and Kentucky to fix it.

More than 1,000 flights into or out of the United States were cancelled, with New York particularly affected. JFK airport had around 230 called off by 5pm local time. Around 60 million people will experience the rare October snowstorm, which should unleash heavy, wet snow and wind, causing fallen tree branches and potential travel chaos. This . weekend looks set to see huge amounts of sleet and snow covering the . North East, invariably causing power outages and travel chaos. Some areas bracing for up to a foot of snow. By 2pm, 1.3 inches of snow had fallen . in Central Park; never before in October has an inch of snow fallen on a . given day in New York City, AccuWeather reported. The website reported that 10 inches in Ogletown, Pennsylvania, 9.5 inches in Frostburg, Maryland, and 8.5 inches in Lost River, West Virginia. New York has received measurable snow . before Halloween only three times since 1869 - and never more than one . inch, as happened today. The heaviest snow, though, is forecast for later in the day on Sunday in the Massachusetts Berkshires, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern Connecticut, southwestern New Hampshire and the southern Green Mountains. Rare snowfall: A man walking through Soho in Manhattan, New York as it snows for only the fourth time in October since the Civil War in the 1860s . Packing a punch: Satellite map shows the massive winter storm making its way up the Northeast coast . 'It's going to be wet, sticky and gloppy,' said NWS spokesman Chris Vaccaro. 'It's not going to be a dry, fluffy snow.' The storm comes on a busy weekend for many along the Eastern Seaboard, with trick-or-treaters going door-to-door in search of Halloween booty, hunting season opening in some states and a full slate of college and pro football scheduled. Fans in State College were making the most of what school officials said was the first measurable snowfall for any October home game since records began being kept in 1896. The crowds were thinner, but 'the die-hards are here,' said T.J. Coursen of Centre Hall, an alumnus. In Connecticut, Governor Dannel P. Malloy warned residents that they could lose power due to the anticipated wet, heavy snow. Tractor to the rescue: Workers try to clear falling snow from the field before an NCAA college football game between West Virginia and Rutgers in Piscataway, New Jersey today .

Standing firm: An Occupy Wall Street supporter braves the elements while maintaining his protest in Zuccotti Park in New York . The . heaviest snows are expected between 5pm and 8pm this evening, . although the temperatures could bring light snow throughout the night. The storm is expected to come hard and fast, with the heaviest snow set for the Virginia and West Virginia border through eastern Pennsylvania and southeastern New York state, northwestern New Jersey, northern Connecticut, Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. Naturally, areas of high altitude will be the most treacherous. Travel chaos is likely, with downed trees a very likely hazard and cars liable to skid on frozen roads. In New England, where six inches of snow has already fallen, there is also expected to be powerful winds which could be very dangerous - bringing down trees and power lines. Six inches already: Vermont has had heavy snowfall already and more is expected to come this weekend . Snowstorm: A workman struggles through huge amounts of snowfall in Vermont, where another storm is expected on Saturday night . Winter's here! Residents in Vermont woke up to six inches of snowfall on Friday morning . Temperatures in the 30s and 40s and wind chills in the 20s will make it feel like winter has truly arrived. Forecasters . at weather.com say the heaviest amounts of snow will fall in parts of . Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, upstate New York, Connecticut and . Massachusetts. These areas could see between two to four inches late on Saturday. Weather.com . said: 'Precipitation will start as rain in these locations, but may . change over to snow. How quickly this occurs and how much snow falls is . dependent on the availability of enough cold air, which is difficult to . forecast early in the season.' The Northeast can expect what Denver already got. Colorado was hit with an unseasonably early snowstorm this week, sending some Occupy protesters to the hospital . Early season snows, when the leaves . are still on the trees, are notorious for causing tree damage and power . outages and this storm will be no exception. The . biggest impact from the weekend’s storm will not come from snow . accumulation, but from the rain and melted snow freezing on bridges and . overpasses. Sunday morning could be particularly treacherous on the roads. Overnight freeze warnings are in effect across the north east region. Lows in the 20s will effectively bring the agricultural growing season to an end, the Wall Street Journal reports. Surface temperature is a factor in accumulations. It's . been a warm October so far in much of the north east, so any falling . wet snow that hits the pavement could melt soon after contact. If snow . rates are heavy enough, then the warm ground obstacle to accumulations . would be overcome. Trick or treaters most likely will not be treading the white stuff on Monday. The forecast for the country is . mostly dry, though a few disturbances could bring some showers to parts . of Pennsylvania and upstate New York. Residents in the path of the unseasonable snow should watch out for power outages and falling tree limbs, still green from the late summer . The frozen north: Map showing the expected accumulation on grassy surfaces, indicating that east-central Pennsylvania to south-central New England will be hardest hit late on Saturday . National . Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson said you would won't need to . go out and buy roof rakes, but October snowfall records could be broken . in parts of southern New England, especially at higher elevations. The October record for southern New England is 7.5 inches in Worcester in 1979, the Associated Press reports. The most snow will likely hit the . Massachusetts Berkshires, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern . Connecticut, and south western New Hampshire, he said. Connecticut Gov Dannel P. Malloy warned residents that they could lose power. The storm could bring more than six inches of snow to parts of Maine beginning Saturday night.In . Pennsylvania, six to 10 inches could fall at higher elevations, . including the Laurel Highlands in the south western part of the state . and the Pocono Mountains in the north eastern part. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh could see a coating. Not meant to be: Halloween decorations stand covered in snow in a front lawn in Denver, Colorado. A foot of snow fell this week, just two days after the city was 80 degrees . Initial blast: First snowfall in the tri-state area was in Vernon, Connecticut, on Thursday night . John LaCorte, a National Weather Service meteorologist in State College, Pennsylvania, said: 'This is very, very unusual. It has all the look and feel of a classic midwinter nor'easter. It's going to be very dangerous.' The last major widespread snowstorm in Pennsylvania this early was in 1972, Mr LaCorte said.In New England, the first measurable snow usually falls in early December, and normal highs for late October are in the mid-50s. 'This is just wrong,' said Dee Lund . of East Hampton, who was at a Glastonbury garage getting four new tires . put on her car before a weekend road trip to New Hampshire. Temperature plunge: The Saturday daytime figures show a biting 42-47 degrees as the storm clouds gather. Forecasters are predicting a 5pm start for the snow in much of the north east . Heading north: The temperatures ease up slightly Sunday daytime as the snow makes its way to northern New England . Drying out: Trick or treaters can look forward to a dry day for most of the country, with some showers in the north . Miss . Lund said that after last winter's record snowfall, which left a . 12-foot snow bank outside her house, she'd been hoping for a reprieve. The good news, Mr Simpson said, is that relatively warm water temperatures along the Atlantic seaboard would keep the snowfall totals much lower along the coast and in cities such as Boston. Temperatures should return to the mid-50s by midweek. 'This doesn't mean our winter is going to be terrible,' he said. 'We're Not Leaving': A snow-dusted protest sign sits under a tree at the Occupy Denver camp on Wednesday. Several protesters were taken to the hospital for hypothermia . 'You can't get any correlation from a two-day event.' Not everyone is lamenting the arrival of winter. Dan Patrylak, 79, of Glastonbury, had just moved back to New England from Arizona and was picking up two new ice scrapers for his car. He said he was looking forward to seeing snow on the ground again. 'In Phoenix, it's 113 all summer long,' he said. 'So, it just depends on where you are and what the weather is and you learn to accept that.  Whatever it is, I'm going to be ready for it.'","Earliest New York City one-inch snowfall since records began .

The plane, operated by British Columbia-based Northern Thunderbird Air, was bound for Kelowna. Bill Yearwood, from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said the flight took off at 3.40pm but turned around when the crew got the 'indication of a problem' about 15 minutes after take-off. The aircraft did not make it back to the airport, crashing on Russ Baker Way in Richmond, about 900 metres short of the runway. In an audio recording, obtained by CBC News, the pilot can be heard telling air traffic control that he is declaring an emergency and turning back to Vancouver, but is confident he can reach the airfield. The air traffic controller asks the pilot to confirm whether he 'doesn't need equipment or help' on the runway. The pilot calmly responds: 'Negative, everything's good here at the moment'. Visibility was good with clear skies at the time of the crash, CBC meteorologist Claire Martin said. An airport statement said the Vancouver Airport Authority went into emergency mode at 4.12pm local time.

It will also be two-and-half times larger than the biggest casino in the U.S. - the Foxwoods Resort in Ledyard, Connecticut. Getting, which has already spent $500 million buying the land around Biscayne Bay, says the project will  create around 100,000 jobs - for an area where unemployment currently stands at 10.6 per cent. It will also give a 5.4 million tourist visitor boost to the city and generate $600 million in much-needed tax revenue for the cash-strapped state. Florida currently has a $1.5 billion budget deficit.

A convention centre, shopping mall and two casinos will also be built. However, before construction on the ambitious development begins, a Bill to open up gambling laws in Miami has to be approved. This is because in gambling in Florida is banned, apart from in Native American tribal lands. It means the Seminole Indian tribe, which owns seven casinos in the state, has a monopoly - and are rumoured to have already spent $140,000 on keeping the company out.

Leaders pored over the proposed bill on Wednesday, which if given the go-ahead would bring three large casino resorts to the Sunshine State. Phil Goldfarb, president of Fontainebleau Miami Beach, told Miami-Dade commissioners at a hearing that: 'We’re most concerned about existing businesses. 'When you look at the enormous size and scope of some of these projects, it just doesn’t make sense.' Other critics see the urban resort scrambling downtown Miami’s ongoing revival and stealing customers from hotels and restaurants from nearby neighborhoods and Miami Beach. But supporters say it will create jobs and see tens of millions in tourist dollars pour in once it was open. Esteban Garcia, owner of Garcia’s Seafood Grille and Fish Market on the Miami River, which Genting says may open a second location at the planned resort, told the Miami Herald: 'The Genting resort will be a magnet for the city. 'This kind of resort would bring a lot of new jobs to our community.'

Dramatic pictures show the heavily bearded gunman calmly walking the streets clutching his semi automatic weapon before indiscriminately shooting at civilians and police officers. And the Bosnian president has told reporters he believes the shooting spree in front of the embassy was terrorist attack. Terror: The gunman walked the streets clutching his semi automatic weapon before indiscriminately open firing at police . Pictures taken at the scene show the gunman chillingly approach the embassy carrying his weapon before callously open firing at officers and passers-by. Earlier media reports said the man, identified as a member of the Wahhabi branch of Islam, was killed by a sniper after firing a Kalashnikov rifle at the US mission. But later it was confirmed the gunman, identified by Bosnian television as 23-year-old Serbian Mevlid Jasarevic, was still alive after being shot down in a police operation at the embassy. 'The doctors are conducting a medical intervention and the man is expected to be escorted from hospital by the police in next two to three hours,' said hospital spokeswoman Biljana Jandric. Shoot to kill: The gunman was calmly seen approaching the U.S. Embassy in a long coat which seem to cover traditional dress . Run for your life: As the gunman opens fire police rushed to seal the area off as drivers careered away from the embassy . A police spokesman told Bosnian television at least one officer was injured before the gunman was taken down. He added: 'The person who fired an automatic weapon was wounded and arrested during the police operation. 'After receiving medical treatment on . the scene the person was hospitalised.' police spokesman Irfan Nefic . told national BHT television. Spree: The unidentified gunman was on the streets armed and shooting for at least 30 minutes before police shot him down . Embassy spokeswoman Sanja Pejcinovic would not go into details of the apparent attack. 'We can confirm there has been an incident in front of the embassy. The building is closed and we are waiting for the police to seal off the area', she told AFP. Bosnian national radio said police were searching the vicinity of the embassy for possible accomplices. 'Several police patrols were sent to the scene. Two police men were wounded, one in the leg and one in the head,"" the radio reported.'

Many of these Muslim fighters stayed on after the conflict and obtained Bosnian citizenship. Some in the mostly moderate Bosnian Muslim community have converted to the more radical Islam preached by several ex-mujahedeen. The U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, a mainly .

He may be 90 years old, but Prince Philip was ready for any challenge the Aussies could throw at him on the final day of the royal tour Down Under. The Duke of Edinburgh gamely flipped a steak as he joined in a record-breaking barbie in Perth before he and the Queen bade goodbye to Australia. But Philip could not be persuaded into sampling the chef's barbecued shellfish at the end of the 16-day state visit, telling him, 'I'm not in the mood'. Bonzer barbie mate: A cheerful Prince Philip gamely joins in a record-breaking Aussie cook-off wearing a suit and Panama-style hat . Poised in pink: The Queen looks stern-faced as she stands in the glaring sunlight beside her husband and Perth Mayor Lisa Scaffidi for the national anthem . Satisfied chef Vincent Garreffa said: 'We had a ribeye steak and a pork cutlet which were waiting to be turned, and he did us proud.' The prawns, crayfish and scallops the chef offered up were a step too far for the intrepid prince, however, who kept out of the glaring sun under a Panama-style hat. Nearly 100,000 people joined in the barbecue on the banks of Swan River, where the hungry hordes devoured 130,000 sausages, 8,000 loaves of bread, 60,000 litres of sauce and 150,000 drinks. G'bye: The Queen holds on to her hat in the blustery wind as she and the Duke of Edinburgh get a rapturous send-off from Australia . The prince was presented with a book of barbecue recipes for his troubles, which may come in useful for stately entertaining after the Prime Minister's summer's picnic for the Obamas proved something of a damb squib. The Queen, who was tempted this week by kangaroo stew, was again feeling peckish after TV chef Anna Gare showed her some Turkish lamb sausages with onion marmalade and tomato and pear chutney. Ms Gare, Ben Elton's sister-in-law, said afterwards: 'The Queen was gorgeous, she totally sparkled. She was very interested in the type of sausages we had. She said she had such a lovely time in Perth.' The Queen has received a rapturous welcome during her 11-day tour and tens of thousands of people gathered in Perth for a final glimpse of the royal couple. Her Majesty told the crowd: 'We have been overwhelmed by your kindness and support. 'Once again we will return to the United Kingdom with fond memories of our time here and the warm Australian welcome we have received on our 16th visit to this beautiful country.' The Queen also chatted to five schoolgirls who helped at the barbecue. Chloe Dann, 11, said the Queen asked what they were cooking. 'I told her we cooked some sausages with some spices and stuff on them.' See ya later: The adoring crowd wave goodbye to their Queen as she boards a flight home from Perth . Thanks Bruce: The monarch offers a gloved hand to the governor of Western Australia, Malcolm McCusker, as her 11-day tour comes to an end . Myra Agnew was hoping to see the Queen for a second time. 'Twenty-three years ago my daughter Catherine gave her flowers and we came with flowers today and tried to give them again but we were one barricade behind and couldn’t get forward,' she said. But Mrs Agnew was still pleased to have gone to the event. 'The Queen is part of our history, no matter what people want to say,' she added. 'She’s a magnificent person and a lot of people admire her for what she does and I do think we all need to belong somewhere. 'We are part of the Commonwealth and I think it’s a good thing.' British pride: The Queen receives David Cameron at the banquet she hosted to mark the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting . Radiant ruler: Her Majesty glittered in white and silver as she and Prince Philip presided over an opulent evening . The trip had political significance as the Commonwealth leaders' summit agreed yesterday to put royal daughters on the same footing as sons. Those in line for the throne will also be allowed to marry Roman Catholics for the first time in 300 years without giving up their claim. Some predict the 85-year-old Queen's visit will be her last, but Buckingham Palace dismissed rumours it was a farewell tour. A royal source said: 'The Queen and Duke have really enjoyed themselves. The Queen has been bowled over by the reaction.' The main purpose of the tour was to allow the Queen to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and she presided over the launch ceremony before hosting a lavish banquet in honour of the world leaders. Her visit ended with a low-key farewell on the tarmac at Perth International Airport. The couple's chartered British Airways jet was flying the sovereign's Australian standard from the pilot's cockpit window, as several hundred well-wishers gathered behind a wire mesh fence to see them off. As the monarch's motorcade arrived, Governor General Quentin Bryce and her husband Michael greeted the royal couple as they emerged from their Range Rover. The two women chatted for a few minutes before the head of state was introduced to federal and state representatives. The royal couple climbed the plane's steps and the Queen clung on to the brim of her hat in the blustery weather while the pair waved goodbye. A cheer went up from the spectators watching from 100 metres away and senior members of the royal household followed the Queen on to the plane. They are due to arrive back in the UK in the early hours of tomorrow morning.",The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh joined in giant BBQ at the end of 11-day royal visit before boarding a plane home .
"By . James White . Last updated at 10:38 AM on 31st October 2011 . As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind . down, the number of people indicted and convicted by the U.S. for . bribery, theft and looting in both countries . is rapidly rising, new reports have revealed. Examples of crimes committed by U.S.personnel include a Marine in Iraq who sent home $43,000 in stolen cash by hiding it in a footlocker among American flags. Another soldier shipped thousands more concealed in a toy stuffed animal and an embassy employee tricked the State Department into wiring $240,000 into his foreign bank account. Impact: Some U.S. troops in Iraq have been involved in huge levels of fraud and looting sparking wide-scale investigations (file picture) Prosecutors have retrieved some of . the money. More than $83 million will be returned to the U.S. from Iraq . cases completed in the budget year that ended Sept. 30, bringing the . total recovered over the last seven years to nearly $155 million, . Bowen's office said. As well as stolen cash, the total . includes court-ordered restitution, fines and proceeds from the sale of . merchandise seized from those convicted, including Rolex watches, luxury . cars, plasma TVs and houses. 'This is a boom industry for us,' Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, said as two government reports into the growing problem were released. 'Investigators and auditors had a productive quarter,' said a report on the theft of Afghanistan aid by Steven Trent, who holds the same job for Afghanistan. His report covered August through October. In the past 13 months U.S. investigators in Iraq secured the indictments of 22 people for alleged aid-related offences, bringing to 69 the total since the SIGIR office was created in 2004. Convictions stand at 57. Cruel: Money earmarked for the reconstruction of Afghanistan villages such as this one has apparently been diverted into the hands of contractors and military personnel . Several hundred more suspects are under scrutiny in 102 open investigations and those numbers are expected to climb. The rise in caseloads derives partly from spin-off investigations, where suspects facing prosecution lead investigators to other suspects, said Jon Novak, SIGIR's assistant inspector general for investigations. 'More and more people are ratting out their associates,' he said, turning in conspirators who helped launder money after it was stolen, others who were aware of it and others implicated in the crimes. As investigators gain experience, they're received better information from a growing network of sources in Iraq, said Dan Willkens, Novak's deputy. Development of an automated data-mining system for investigations has helped, he said, as did a decision two years ago to speed prosecutions by hiring three former assistant U.S. attorneys and detailing them to the Department of Justice. At the inspector general's office for Afghan reconstruction, created in 2008, officials report only nine indictments and seven convictions so far. Re-establishing their country: Iraq has become increasingly independent of the U.S. and other countries but still relies on the aid that has been the subject of fraud . They say they're trying to ramp up after years of upheaval and charges the office was mismanaged. Trent was named acting inspector general after his predecessor left in August and is the third person to hold the job. Still, Trent reported that during the last quarter, an investigation initiated by his office netted the largest bribery case in Afghanistan's 10-year war. A former Army Reserve captain, Sidharth 'Tony' Handa of Charlotte, N.C., was convicted, sentenced to prison and fined for soliciting $1.3 million in bribes from contractors working on reconstruction projects. Most crimes uncovered by U.S. investigators in the two war zones include bribery, kickbacks and theft, inspired in part by the deep and pervasive cultures of corruption indigenous to the countries themselves. Among some of the cases listed in the reports were those of:Gunnery Sgt. Eric Hamilton, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in what prosecutors say was a scheme to help Iraqi contractors steal 70 generators that were meant to supply electricity for fellow Marines. He sent some of their payments home in a footlocker and had other money wired, the report said. Several U.S. government employees, who received kickbacks for steering contracts to local conspirators and providing inside information to people competing for contracts. Project: Regeneration projects such as the Mosul Dam on the Tigris River in Mosul, Iraq, is an example of the type of scheme that is susceptible to exploitation . A former army sergeant, who was not identified, is charged with pocketing more than $12,000 in cash that a contractor never picked up after the money was allegedly stolen by another army sergeant and mailed to California inside a stuffed animal. Jordanian national and U.S. Embassy employee Osama Esam Saleem Ayesh, who was convicted in April for stealing nearly $240,000 intended to cover shipping and customs charges the State Department incurs when it moves household goods of its employees. The money wound up in Ayesh's bank in Jordan. Money stolen from reconstruction projects also has been shipped off of U.S. battlefields tucked into letters home and stuffed in a military vest. Tens of thousands of dollars were once sewn into a Santa Claus suit. Prosecutions by Trent's office recovered $51 million over the past year, his report said. The amount recovered is believed to be a tiny fraction of what's been stolen in the two war zones, a figure that will probably never be known for certain. Far more money is believed to have been lost through waste and abuse that resulted from poor management and the often-questioned U.S. strategy of trying to rebuild nations that are still at war. The U.S. has committed $62 billion to rebuilding Iraq and $72 billion for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The independent Commission on Wartime Contracting estimated in August that at least $31 billion has been lost to waste and fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan, adding that the total could be as high as $60 billion. It studied not just reconstruction spending, but $206 billion for the logistical support of coalition forces and the performance of security functions. The commission found that from 10 to 20 percent of the $206 billion in spending was wasted, while fraud accounted for the loss of another 5 to 9 percent. Bowen called the cost of fraud 'egregious'. 'This is open crime occurring in a war zone,' he said. 'And the purpose of a lot of these expenditures is to win hearts and minds. Obviously we lose hearts and minds"" when local populations see foreigners steal money meant to help rebuild their country. The inspectors general are only two of the U.S. government offices looking into fraud, waste and abuse. Others include State Department inspectors and Army criminal investigators.",$83m recovered from Iraq probes in a single year .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Last updated at 9:45 AM on 31st October 2011 . Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Mark's suicide. Mark Madoff hanged himself with a dog leash on the second anniversary of his father Bernie Madoff's arrest for running the biggest financial fraud in history. He had wanted his mother to cut off all contact with his father. Speaking for the first time since her disgraced financier husband's sensational arrest three years ago, Ruth Madoff now says she wishes she had severed ties with her husband as Mark wanted. Guilt: Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Marks' suicide. Previously she was reported to have held Bernie, now serving a 150-year prison . sentence for his record-breaking scam, responsible for her son's death. In an interview with CBS broadcast tonight, Ruth said: 'I just wish, until my dying day, that I had done what he wanted. 'I don't know if it would have made a difference or not, but if I could change things, at least if I had tried, I would have felt a little better. I don't know if it would have mattered. She added: 'It's the most awful thing that can happen to anybody- the suicide of a child.' The Madoffs' other son, Andrew, also appears in the interview with '60 Minutes' Disgraced: Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence . Ruth and her sons barely spoke in the two years after his father's arrest because, Andrew Madoff said, he and his brother could not understand her decision to stay by their father's side. 'I never thought of leaving,' Ruth Madoff said. 'I didn't know what else to do but stay there.' 'I think he got stuck, that's what he said. And he didn't have the courage to face things when they might have been able to be faced on a much smaller scale,' she said. After Mark killed himself in his Soho loft, aged 46, Ruth Madoff cut off contact with her husband and now lives in a three-room apartment in South Florida. That decision led to a reconciliation with her other son Andrew. When the interviewer asked why she hadn't filed for divorce, she said: 'It doesn't matter to me -- he's going to die in prison.' The devastated mother claims she . understood Mark's decision, as the family fell spectacularly from grace, . 'going through those agonies of shame.' In . a segment of the interview revealed earlier this week Ruth claimed that . she and Bernie themselves attempted suicide on Christmas Eve. Despite taking all the sleeping pills they had in the house (Bernie took more she said) the couple simply woke up the next day.

After being call all kinds of names and had their industry demonized, it doesn't come as an exact shock to hear that the country's wealthy are donating the least to the Occupy Wall Street protests. Online fundraising site WePay said that people earning over $250,000 have only donated 1.39 per cent of the cause's cash, falling very closely in line with their representation as the country's wealthiest one per cent. This news comes as protesters face increased police opposition across the country. Getting handouts: Donations of cash and various food have helped sustain protesters who are staying in New York's Zuccotti Park . The site has accumulated a total of $325,000 to the protesters, with the majority coming from the self-proclaimed middle class. People that decided to make donations online were asked by the site to give their annual income to allow for demographic analysis. Of those donations, 60 per cent were given by people who claim that they make between $35,000 and $100,000. 'The middle class is really giving the bulk of the money,' said Bill Clerico, the CEO of WePay. 'In the last 30 days, donations have really snowballed as more movements have joined Occupy Wall Street,' he continued. Manhandled: A protester is grabbed by police officers during the unrest in Denver on Saturday . The donations are spread across the . country and the world, as sympathizers in 36 different countries, . including Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates. All 50 states are financially . represented, and the geographic break down helps to paint a clearer . picture of where the country stands on the movement. Connecticut residents have given the . most, with the average donation coming in at $65.15, with Hawaii and New . Jersey following suit staying within a dollar above and below the $60 . mark respectively. North Dakota had the lowest average donation with only $16.25, and Arkansas came in second to last with $20.50. Interestingly, those figures fall . along party lines: the three highest paying states voted for the . Democratic Barack Obama in the 2008 while Nebraska and Arkansas voted . for John McCain, the Republican nominee. Staying power: Though many protests have come since the original, New York seems to have the most momentum as they hit the one month mark on October 17 . Anniversary dates- like New York's one . month mark on October 17- and big media spectacles- often caused by . police violence- prompt more people to open the purse strings, serving . as big money days for the site. Given the weekend's incidents at some protests, it seems like there will be many more of those days to come. A tense standoff between Occupy Denver . protesters and authorities near the Colorado Capitol erupted Saturday . with a surge of demonstrators being met with police force that included . pepper spray and rubber bullets. Grounded: A man is arrested after clashing with police during the Occupy Denver protest after a march through the downtown district . The clash came as Occupy Wall Street . protesters and state officials in Tennessee squared off for a third . consecutive night Saturday, even though a local judge has refused to . jail demonstrators who have been arrested and said the state lacks the . authority to set a curfew on the property. These violent blow ups come at the . same time as groups of over 30 people were arrested in both Portland, . Oregon and Austin, Texas in the late hours of Saturday night and early . morning of Sunday. Arrested: Denver police handcuff a man after a tense standoff on the steps of the state Capitol and Civic Center . In New York City, where the Occupy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:49 AM on 31st October 2011 . An American official says Iran has formally complained to the U.S. over claims the Iranian government was involved in an alleged plot to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. The official said that the U.S. received a diplomatic note on Friday expressing displeasure with the charges that were levelled earlier this month.  Iran has already denied the allegations. The complaint calls on the U.S. to apologise publicly to Iran for the 'material and moral damages' caused by 'this baseless accusation', an Iranian source told NBC News. Scroll down for video . Plot: Manssor Arbabsiar (left) is accused of a terror plot to murder Saudi ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir (right) It adds that the accusations violated . 'international rules and regulations' but that deception has become 'a . permanent part of statecraft in the U.S.' The note was delivered through the . Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents U.S. interests in Iran since . the two countries don't have diplomatic relations. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private diplomatic exchange. Iran has angrily denied charges . brought by U.S. federal prosecutors that an Iranian government agent was . involved in plotting the assassination of the Saudi ambassador. Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old U.S. citizen who also holds an Iranian passport, is due to appear in court . on December 21 accused of trying to hire a Mexican drugs cartel to carry . out the killing. Detained: Arbabsiar appearing before Judge Michael Dolinger and United States Assistant US Attorney Glen Kopp during his arraignment in New York . Appearance: These court sketches show Magistrate . Judge Michael Dolinger (left) presiding over the arraignment of Manssor . Arbabsiar (right) at Manhattan federal court . He is accused of plotting to kill Adel Al-Jubeir by bombing a restaurant, before setting off . blasts at the Saudi and Israeli embassies. The devastating plan was foiled after Arbabsiar offered a government informant posing as a Mexican drug cartel associate a $1.5 million bounty  to help carry out the attack. The . informant who helped uncover the plan, which could have cause . catastrophic damage if it had been successful, was posing as a member of . the feared Zetas drug cartel. The . Zetas have have been behind some of the worst violence in Mexico's drug . war, including mass beheadings, the murder of a U.S. immigration . official, and the arson of a Monterrey casino that trapped and killed . 52. The informant had been busted by the . Drug Enforcement Agency for drug trafficking and had become a source . that had helped make arrests in drugs cases. Arbabsiar and another man, Gholam Shakuri, have been charged with the $1.5 million terror plot. Suspect: Alleged terror plotter Manssor Arbabsiar's home in Round Rock, Texas . Accused: The home of terror plot suspect Manssor Arbabsiar in Round Rock, Texas . Shakuri, whom authorities said was a member of the Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is still at large. A third man named Abdul-Reza Shahlai is accused of coordinating the alleged plot. Shahlai, an Iranian official who is Arbabsiar's cousin, has previously been accused of plotting an attack in Iraq which killed five U.S. soldiers. Shocking details of the plot emerged as authorities revealed the scale of the operation to foil the attack. According to prosecutors, when asked by undercover agents about the potential loss of innocent life in the bombings, Arbabsiar replied, 'They want that guy [al-Jubeir] done. 'If the hundred go with him, f**k 'em.' Arbabsiar was arrested on September 29 in New York at JFK airport. Warning: Hillary Clinton (left) said the plot . 'crosses a line' in Iran's state sponsorship of terrorism and will . further isolate the Islamic republic, whose president is Mahmoud . Ahmadinejad (right) Attorney General Eric Holder, right, and FBI Director Robert Mueller announce that two individuals have been charged for their alleged participation in a plot to murder the Saudi Ambassador . May 24: Arbabsiar first meets someone posing as an associate of a drug trafficking cartel in Mexico, who was actually a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration informant codenamed CS-1. Arbabsiar asked about the informant's knowledge of explosives and explained he was interested in attacking a Saudi embassy. June 2: Arbabsiar returned to Mexico . and held more meetings with the informant in late June and early July. He allegedly said his associates in Iran had discussed a number of 'violent missions' including the murder of the Saudi ambassador to . Washington, Adel Al-Jubeir. July 14: Arbabsiar meets CS-1 again, they discuss plot details - how four men and a payment of $1.5 million are needed. July 17: The pair meet again in Mexico. CS-1 says one member of his gang has already carried out surveillance on the ambassador and they allegedly discussed bombing a restaurant in the United States where the ambassador frequently dined. August 1 and 9: Arbabsiar makes two overseas wire transfers 'totalling approximately $100,000' September 28: Arbabsiar flies to Mexico, is refused entry and is sent back to JFK . September 29: Arrested at JFK by federal agents . October 4-5: Arbabsiar, who has been in . U.S. custody since his arrest, made phone calls which were monitored by . U.S. law enforcement agents to Shakuri, described as a member of the . Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He is believed to be based in Iran. Shakuri allegedly confirmed to Arbabsiar . the plot should move forward as quickly as possible, stating: 'Just do . it quickly, it's late' He was working for the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard and had confessed to a plot. Officials said he had flown from . Iran to Mexico City, via Frankfurt, but had been refused entry to . Mexico and had been put on a plane to New York. Mexico . worked closely with U.S. authorities to help foil the alleged plot - . issuing an immigration alert on Arbabsiar after U.S. authorities told . Mexican counterparts that he was the subject of an arrest warrant. Julian . Ventura, undersecretary for North America, said the alert prompted . Mexican immigration officials to turn Arbabsiar away when he tried to . enter Mexico on September 28. Arbabsiar was arrested the next day when he arrived at New York's Kennedy International Airport. After his arrest, Arbabsiar made phone . calls to Shakuri in Iran which were monitored.  During the calls, . Shakuri allegedly confirmed that Arbabsiar should move forward with the . plot to murder the Ambassador and that he should accomplish the task as . quickly as possible, stating on October 5, 2011, 'Just do it quickly, . it’s late.' Bombings of the Saudi and Israeli . embassies in Buenos Aires and Argentina were also discussed as part of . the plan, according to officials. Shakuri, who is based in Iran, remains at large. He is a member of Iran’s Quds Force, a special operations unit . of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which sponsors . and promotes terrorist activities abroad. The Treasury, meanwhile, identified the Iranian official coordinating the plot as, Abdul-Reza Shahlai, a cousin of Arbabsiar. Shahlai was three years ago identified as a terrorist by the U.S. Government for organising violence in Iraq. He is said to have worked with the anti-U.S. Mahdi Army to attack soldiers. In . one of the attacks he is alleged to have planned in January 2007, up to . a dozen fighters infiltrated a government building in Karbala, dressed . as American security officers. They opened fire, killing one U.S. soldier. Four others were abducted and found shot dead soon after. Target: The plot would have also attacked the Israel embassy, pictured here, in Washington DC . High alert: The Saudi Arabian ambassador, who works out of this Washington DC embassy, was the target of a terror plot . Iran’s secretive Quds Force is an elite brigade within Iran's revolutionary Guard. The Guards, with their own navy, air force and command structure separate from the regular armed forces, are seen as fiercely loyal to the supreme leader. Within the Guards, Quds are tasked with 'exporting' the Iranian revolution abroad. Said to contain 15,000 troops, the force has been linked to operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, North Africa and now North America. In the past, the U.S. has accused Quds of arming Iraqi militants with deadly bomb-making material, building up an extensive network in the war-torn country, recruiting Iraqis and supporting not only Shiite militias but also Shiites allied with Washington. The case looking into the Mexican cartel plot, called Operation Red Coalition, started in May when . Iranian-American Arbabsiar from Corpus Christi, Texas, sought help for . the assassination from a Mexican drug cartel and inadvertently . approached a US informant. Arbabsiar allegedly wired $100,000 to the informant as a down payment for the $1.5million assassination fee. He told the informant that his contacts in the Iranian government could provide 'tons of opium' to the drugs cartel. According . to the complaint, Arbabsiar claimed he was being 'directed by . high-ranking members of the Iranian government' including a cousin who . was 'a member of the Iranian army but did not wear a uniform'. He told agents he was recruited and funded by men he understood to be senior officials in Iran’s Quds Force. He allegedly said these Iranian officials were aware of and approved of the plot. Saudi-Iranian . tensions have increased since March, when Saudi Arabia sent troops to . help Bahrain's Sunni rulers quell pro-democracy protesters led by the . island's Shi'ite majority, which has long complained of sectarian . discrimination. Bahrain accused Iran of being behind the unrest, a charge denied by Tehran and by Bahraini Shi'ite political parties.

It is a bike whose inventor was once arrested for riding it but later released when police couldn't work out what crime he had committed. And with a record like that it's not hard to see why it didn't catch on. Now though this steam powered motorcycle is set to enter the record books, as the most expensive bike ever to be sold at auction. The 117-year-old 'Roper Steam Powered Motorcycle' was designed by Sylvester Roper and is now expected to reach £325,000 when it is sold in Las Vegas in January. Under the hammer: This steam powered motorcycle designed by Sylvester Roper is to be auctioned in the New Year and is expected to fetch £325,000 . Enthusiasts from across the globe are expected to bid for the machine which had a top speed of 40mph and consisted of a boiler, steam engine stuck onto a hickory velocipede bicycle frame. Roper connected the piston rods to cranks on the rear wheel axle and the solid wheels made for a very uncomfortable ride. It also appeared that the machine was dangerous - as Roper actually died while riding it during 1896. The bike worked by using a firebox and boiler suspended on springs from the frame between the wheels. A charcoal fire heated the water to generate steam to power the engine. The exhaust steam was carried by . tubing into a chimney behind the saddle. Water was supplied from a reservoir that was part of the seat using a feed-water pump operated by the left-cylinder crank. The rider could accelerate by turning the grip on the handles that acted as the throttle - in the same way as modern motorbikes. Rudimentary: The piston rods connected to a crank on the rear wheel axle and the solid wheels made for a very uncomfortable ride . Following Roper's death the bike went through a number of owners who displayed it to the public until it was bought by its current owner in 1996. Glenn Bator, head of Auctions America by RM's Vintage Motorcycle Division, said: 'Roper built two steam motorcycles and this one dates from 1894. 'Both of them exist and the other, earlier one that was based on a boneshaker cycle, is in the Smithsonian museum. 'At the time the internal combustion engine was in its infancy so no one knew that steam wasn't the way forward. 'When Roper invented his machine the word motorcycle hadn't even been conceived. It is amazing the machine has survived for this long. Modern way: The rider of the 'Roper Steam Powered Motorcycle' could accelerate by turning the grip on the handles that acted as the throttle - in the same way as today . 'Not only was it one of the very first motorcycles, but it was involved in the first ever motorcycle accident. 'Roper came off the bike and died and although it was shown he died from a heart attack it is not known whether he had it before or after he came off. 'The bike is still in working order and although the present owner hasn't sued steam, he has put pressure in it and the piston still works. 'It really was like riding with a locomotive between the legs just hoping it doesn't blow up. 'It is a significant piece of Americana and arguably one of the world's most important motorcycles.' The current world record for a motorbike sold at auction is held by a 1915 Cyclone Board Track Racer.

The day long event featured heavyweight speakers discussing the gender politics of Snooki and the morality and ethics of The Situation and Jwoww. Jersey Shore: The event featured heavyweight speakers discussing the gender politics of Snooki and the morality and ethics of The Situation and Jwoww . Attendees also debated the ‘sociolinguistic’ significance of the series and whether or not it pandered to stereotypes of ‘Guidos’, or Italian-Americans. Among the lectures was one called: ‘The Jersey Saga: Honour Culture in Medieval Iceland and Modern Seaside’. Another debate was given the title: ‘""Pickles Is My Thing"": Snooki and the Ascendancy of Ordinary Celebrity’. 'Pickles Is My Thing' is Snooki's catchphrase in the hit reality series. Chicago University: There were around 50 submissions from top academics of which half were chosen to go before the audience at Friday's event .

According to the New York Times there were around 50 submissions from top academics of which half were chosen to go before the audience of professors and graduate and undergraduate students. The first keynote address was from Alison Hearn, an associate professor at the University of Western Ontario, who talked about ‘the branded hybrid person-character’ and entrepreneurship in Jersey Shore. Her speech was titled: ‘The Monetization of Being: Reputational Labour, Brand Culture, and Why ""Jersey Shore"" Does, and Does Not, Matter.’ Meanwhile: A day after academics debated her gender politics, Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi was at Pure nightclub inside the Caesars Hotel in Las Vegas on Saturday . Other talks on the day included ‘Platonic Justice and ""Jersey Shore"" '""You're Not Even Italian"": Stereotype, Authenticity, and the Warped Reality of ""Jersey Shore""' and ‘Foucault's Going To The Jersey Shore, Bitch!’ The conference, which took place on Friday and lasted from 9am to 8pm, was put together by David Showalter, a senior at the University of Chicago. During his opening speech he admitted Jersey Shore was an obsession of his own and claimed that it was ‘exceptionally good to think with’. He has previously said he is wary of academics ‘restricting heir work to so-called ""high culture"", but to seriously engage with popular culture as well’. All the lectures were free and open to the public. It was paid for by funding from the university which had been secured by Mr Showalter.

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 2:10 PM on 31st October 2011 . Hand-in-hand and smiling as they leave church, this is Jeremy Clarkson marrying the woman who claims she was ‘airbrushed’ from his life. The marriage – Clarkson’s first – would end in divorce within a year, but yesterday ex-wife Alex Hall told how they went on to enjoy a ten-year affair after the motoring journalist married second wife Francie. At one point the Top Gear philanderer even told her he had cheated on both of them with a BBC colleague. Big day: Clarkson with his first wife Alex wed in 1989. Their marriage lasted less than a year, but they embarked on a ten-year affair in 1999 . Mrs Hall revealed how she and Clarkson would enjoy take-away curries followed by sex sessions at his London bolthole. Details of the alleged affair emerged after Clarkson, 51, lifted a gagging order which prevented Mrs Hall from disclosing intimate details of their relationship. Despite branding him a ‘bully and a hypocrite’ over the decision to take out the injunction, businesswoman Mrs Hall likened Clarkson to a pair of ‘comfy slippers’ whom she never got over after their split in 1990 – two years after he joined BBC’s Top Gear. She claimed the pair rekindled their relationship in 1999 after she sent him a note saying ‘Call me’ with her phone number. After a lunch in a Notting Hill restaurant, they spent that evening at Clarkson’s Fulham flat – where he kept a sofa bed they had bought together years before. The presenter often stays in the capital for work purposes during the week, travelling home to his wife in Oxfordshire at weekends. Second wife: The presenter with Francie on the red carpet last month . Mrs Hall said: ‘We watched TV and had an Indian take-away. We started on the sofa then ended up in bed together. It was so natural and normal. He initiated it. It was just like the old times, like we’d never been apart.’ She said the decade of deceit began a few months later when Clarkson once more got in touch. Again they would enjoy a take-away – Clarkson’s favourite was chicken madras, she said – before spending the night together at either’s flat. Many of the liaisons took place after Clarkson had been filming at the Top Gear track at Dunsfold aerodrome in Surrey. Clarkson even admitted to her that he was 'frolicking with a colleague', the the Daily Star reported yesterday. He had to explain himself to his first and second wife after he was pictured embracing BBC presenter Elaine Bedell at the height of his affair in 2003. Mrs Hall told the Star: 'I said to him in a text or phone call: ""Oh dear, you're gonna get into trouble, I told you I was the only person you could sleep with who wasn't your wife"".' Although the star rarely took her out during the alleged secret romance, Mrs Hall, 46, said they once stayed at the four-star Parador de Ronda hotel while Clarkson was filming Top Gear in southern Spain in 2007. I want you back: Alex says she expects Clarkson to be in touch and that the pair will 'carry on' She said she still loved Clarkson and wanted him back. ‘I don’t feel we committed adultery during the affair because he was my husband,’ she said. ‘He was like a pair of comfy slippers. ‘I know he’ll call again in about six months, I will see him and it will carry on.’ The mother-of-two, from Surrey, claimed she had ‘honoured and loved’ Clarkson for 28 years since they got together when she was just 17 and he was 22. The pair married in 1989 at St Andrew’s Church in South Warnborough, Hampshire, and honeymooned in Mauritius. But within six months, Clarkson wrote in his newspaper column on Saturday, she ‘admitted to a number of flings’ and left him for another man – friend Stephen Hall, now a 54-year-old property developer. They went on to marry in February 1993 – two months before Clarkson wed Francie, 50 – but divorced in 1996 after having two children. Mrs Hall said she couldn’t hide her feelings for Clarkson from her second husband and described leaving the heavy smoking presenter a ‘huge mistake’. She said that on September 22, 2009, which would have been their 20th wedding anniversary, Clarkson sent a text to Alex which simply read: ‘Do you know what day it is?’ ‘That is not somebody who has forgotten and moved on,’ said Mrs Hall, who by then had met somebody else and said she had stopped returning Clarkson’s calls and texts. Clarkson told last week how he lifted the injunction, imposed last year, because it was ‘pointless’ to continue when speculation over his identity was rife in the ‘legal-free world’ of the internet. Mrs Hall’s allegations come five months after it was claimed Clarkson cheated on his wife with Top Gear Live tour colleague Phillipa Sage, 42. Clarkson claimed in his newspaper column Mrs Hall had contacted him 15 years ago, after his TV career had started to take off, demanding ‘money for her silence’. He added: ‘Eventually, these demands became so hysterical and so huge, my wife and I were forced to take out an injunction. But thanks to Twitter and the internet, it didn’t work.’ Mrs Hall denies attempting to blackmail the star. Francie yesterday denied claims she had kicked the presenter out of their country home near Chipping Norton after allegations of the affair left her ‘at the end of her tether’.",And Top Gear presenter cheated on both with BBC colleague .
"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 4:26 PM on 31st October 2011 . Checking out: Joy Bricker spent over 10 years at the TownePlace Suites Marriott in Falls Church . A 79-year-old woman has finally checked out of her hotel suite, after staying in the same room for over a decade. Joy Bricker first stayed in Room 202 at Towne Place Suites by Marriott, in Falls Church, Virginia, on August 4, 2001 and only moved out last week. The former pilot from Pennsylvania lost her husband, Glenn, to cancer 10 years ago and soon afterwards was offered a job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and jumped at the opportunity. Mrs Bricker, who spent most of her married life in Ashland, New Hampshire, negotiated a deal which meant that she was paying $139 (£87) a night for the 500 sq ft, two-bedroom suite. Her . reasoning was simple: that figure was not too much more than most of the flats . available for rent in the Washington metro area $1,700 (roughly £1,060 a . month). The extra cost was justified because in addition to . freshly washed sheets, a daily cleaned room and continental breakfast, . she was also provided with around-the-clock security and free WiFi and . cable television access. And, after checking out last Wednesday, she succeeded in becoming the longest extended-stay guest in the hotel chain's history. The 79-year-old has outstayed six managers at the hotel . SEPTEMBER 2001: The World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, are attacked, killing almost 3,000 people (including 19 hijackers) OCTOBER 2001: America declares war on Al Qaeda and sends troops to Afghanistan .

OCTOBER 2011: Colonel Gaddafi is killed in Sitre, LibyaIt's little surprise that she has become a Platinum Premier member of the Marriott Rewards frequent guest loyalty program. Mrs Bricker began her professional career late in life - when she was 50. Years of political organising helped her strike up a friendship with Elizabeth and Bob Dole which led to her first job during Ronald Regan's administration at the Department of Transportation in 1981. An appointment at the White House followed, where she began work for the campaign 'A Drug Free America' in 1986. After moving in to Room 202 Mrs Bricker quickly became a part of the hotel community, and has outstayed six managers, and has developed firm opinions about how the hotel should be run. But the only piece of furniture she introduced to the room was an old armchair. In addition, there were only some plants, computer equipment, books and photo albums to move out of the room. She made friends with staff and neighbours, and recently her Kuwaiti friend who lived next door to Room 202 brought round traditional meals of spiced stew for them to share. 'It's helped my appetite,' she told CNN. 'I call it community planning. I turned it into a community. 'I would give a million dollars to manage a property like this for one year. 'No matter where we look, there’s always ways to save a few more pennies.' Her daughter, Christy Winton, added of her mother: 'She turned them into family, and they accepted.' Now suffering from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, Mrs Bricker will move in with her daughter in New York and she intends to use her energies in the church. She said: 'If I've set a goal, I'm going to reach it.' And she said that her goal now is to 'continue offering whatever I am able to give' and added: 'I have to help. I'm not a sitter.' But Mrs Winton warned her mother with a smile: 'There’s no continental breakfast at the Winton Inn.'","American is longest guest Marriott have ever had .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 9:00 AM on 31st October 2011 . New attack: Home Secretary Theresa May has accused British judges of being overzealous in their use of the Human Rights Act . Theresa May has launched a fresh attack on British judges accusing them of being overzealous in their use of the Human Rights Act. The Home Secretary has claimed that the courts in this country go further than the European Court of Human Rights itself when considering immigration appeals. Mrs May says judges are allowing too many immigrants to stay in the country on the grounds that their relatives might suffer if they were forced to leave. Thousands of illegal immigrants cite Article 8 of the Human Rights Act – the right to respect for private and family life – to fight deportation. The Home Secretary’s comments are set to reignite her bitter feud with Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, who has dismissed her suggestion that the British courts are too lenient. Mr Clarke publicly ridiculed Mrs May after she highlighted a case in which an illegal immigrant’s pet cat was taken into account at the Conservative Party conference earlier this month. However, defiant Mrs May has continued her onslaught against the Human Rights Act in a letter to Westminster’s joint committee on human rights which is examining judgements. Mrs May said there was a major divergence in the approach of British judges with the stance of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Mrs May said that deportation appeals made under article 8 were only upheld by Strasbourg in the ‘most exceptional circumstances’. In contrast, she went on to cite the case of a woman who was allowed to remain in Britain because she would be forced to live with her mother who ‘she did not feel a close bond’ in Kenya. One of the judges in the case said that forcing her to return to Kenya was ‘unreasonable’. Feud: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has previously dismissed Theresa May's claims that the British courts are too lenient when using the Human Rights Act . The judge also considered whether the woman, who had been in Britain since 2002, would struggle to adjust to Kenyan society and would be able to continue her hobby of singing in a church choir. She said judges are supposed to consider whether there are ‘insurmountable’ obstacles to families being sent home, the test applied in Strasbourg. But they are increasingly setting weaker tests of their own. Mrs May wrote: ‘There is now a divergence in approach between the UK courts and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg over whether the family of a person facing removal from the UK can live elsewhere, and the weight given to family relationships formed whilst migrants are knowingly breaking immigration laws. ‘We have wide-ranging concerns with the operation of article 8 in an immigration context’. Handle: David Cameron and Theresa May say they are trying to get to grips with the immigration system . The Home Secretary cited another case of a judge found there was no ‘compelling public interest’ in deporting a woman to Jamaica although she had made a mockery of the immigration system. ‘This was his conclusion,  despite the fact (she) originally entered the UK as a visitor, switched into a student category and then married as an overstayer’, Mrs May wrote. Mrs May’s letter was sent to the committee after it asked for some examples of ‘inappropriate application’ of article 8 in immigration cases. She added: ‘In a number of more recent cases, the UK courts have substituted for whether there are ‘insurmountable obstacles’ the alternative question of whether it is ‘reasonable to expect’ the family of an applicant facing removal to join him or her in his or her country of origin’. A spokeswoman for Mrs May said: ‘We don’t comment on leaked documents.’ Meanwhile, it has also emerged that Mrs May will speed up the process of removing foreigners involved in British gang crime. The Home Secretary will this week announce to fast track the deportation of the most dangerous individuals who are involved in crimes such as murder, kidnap, shootings, stabbings and drugs supply. She will say that a pioneering scheme, which involves police working directly with UK Border Agency Staff and boasts a 100 per cent success rate, will be rolled out across England and Wales. The news comes after it was disclosed more than 150 people arrested for their role in the summer’s riots were foreigners, and that 13 per cent of all those detained were gang members.","Claims that judges allow too many immigrants to stay on the grounds that their relatives might suffer .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 1:37 PM on 31st October 2011 . At least five people have died and 52 have been injured - many believed to be civilians - following an air strike by the Kenyan air force on a displaced persons camp in Somalia. The Kenyan military today confirmed that they had conducted the attack over Jilib, between Mogadishu south to Kismayo , yesterday, and said that 10 al Shabaab insurgents - the intended targets - had been killed. Spokesman Emmanuel Chirchir denied that civilian blood had been spilled, and claimed contrary reports were propaganda from the Islamist insurgent group. A number of Somalian civilians at an internally displaced persons camp in Jilib, Somalia, are believed to have been killed by a Kenyan air strike . He said: 'We . bombed an Al-Shebab camp, killed 10 and wounded 47. 'We are sure about this assessment, no . collateral damage, no women, no children.' However aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) indicated that most of those injured were women and children. 'Our staff said that around 52 people, all civilians, mostly women and children, had been wounded and that three were dead,' Gautam Chatterjee, Head of Mission for MSF Holland in Somalia, said. 'In our hospital in Marare, we received 31 children, nine women and five men. All of them of with shrapnel injuries.' He said MSF staff in the region were 'treating dozens of injured following an aerial bombardment on the town of Jilib that hit a camp for internally-displaced people at around 1.30pm (11.30am GMT) on Sunday'. Three children, one man and one . woman had been killed in the aerial bombardment, witnessed by MSF . employees in a camp that is home to 1,500 households, added Mr Chatterjee. He declined to comment on . Kenyan military denials of any civilian casualties in Jibil, saying he . could only give details of the patients MSF had received for treatment. On October 17 Kenya's foreign minister, Moses Masika Wetangula, revealed that he had sent troops into neighbouring Somalia in order to target al Shabaab. Mr Wetangula said Kenya was defending itself following a spate of kisnappings believed to have been masterminded by the Islamist militant group. Eye-witnesses described seeing dozens of military vehicles trundling over the border, along with planes and helicopters. Al Shabaab leaders, who deny carrying out the kidnapping, have fortified their ranks in preparation for the attacks. And al Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage told the BBC Somali service: 'We will defend ourselves. 'Kenya doesn't know war. We know war. The tall buildings in Nairobi will be destroyed. 'We have fought against governments older and stronger than Kenya and we have defeated them.' He said MSF had now evacuated its team from Jilib so a distribution of rations planned for today had been postponed. In addition, Doctors Without Borders said at least three were killed in the air raid on the camp, which houses some 9,000 internally displaced people. Further, witnesses at the camp in Jilib, the most populous town in the Middle Juba Region, spoke of up to five victims dying following the strike. 'One of the bombs exploded near a camp where suspected members of the al Shabaab were distributing food to displaced families,' local resident Abdikadim said. 'Several people died on the spot, I saw three of them.' Moalim Isak, another witness, said: 'At least four powerful blasts were heard inside and outside Jilib this afternoon and at least five civilians were killed when one of the bombs smashed into an aid distribution centre.' Kenya moved its troops into neighbouring Somalia a fortnight in pursuit of the Somali insurgents it blames for a series of kidnappings on Kenyan soil and frequent assaults on its security forces in the border province of North Eastern. The first serious clash between Kenyan troops and al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgents was last Thursday. Kenya said it killed nine rebels and one Kenyan soldier who had been wounded in the insurgent ambush subsequently died. Abdiwelli Mohammed Ali, the Somali prime minister, earlier said: 'I doubt the Kenyans did this. Even if that's the case, I doubt that they have done this on purpose. 'The Kenyans wouldn't target Internally displaced persons (IDPs). But if that happened, then it's an unfortunate incident. But the fight is not towards this IDPs, the fight was towards the al-Shabab who are a common enemy for both of us. 'They are an enemy for the Somalis and Kenyans. So that's where our focus is and that's where our target is.'","Kenya dismisses civilian causalities as propaganda .

And new creatures too, like Baily, a kindly donkey who loves to sing, and Haseen O Jameel, a vain crocodile who lives at the bottom of a well. Sesame Street is coming to Pakistan but not as generations of Americans know it. The TV show has a new cast of local characters led by a vivacious six-year-old girl named Rani who loves cricket and traditional Pakistani music. Come and play! New characters in Pakistan's version of Sesame Street are prepared for filming in Lahore. The programme is hoped to fight the radicalisation of children . Final touch: Taking Sesame Street to Pakistan comes at a critical time when the U.S. is trying to counter the tide of Islamic fundamentalism in the country . Her sidekick, Munna, is a five-year-old boy obsessed with numbers and banging away on Pakistani bongo drums, or tabla. The U.S. is bankrolling the initiative with $20 million, hoping it will improve education in a country where one-third of primary school-age children are not in class. Washington also hopes the program will increase tolerance at a time when the influence of radical views is growing. 'One of the key goals of the show in Pakistan is to increase tolerance toward groups like women and ethnic minorities,' said Larry Dolan, who was the head education officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Pakistan until very recently. The show, which started filming last week and will air at the end of November, was jointly developed by Sesame Workshop, the creator of the American series, and Rafi Peer Theater Workshop, a group in the Pakistani city of Lahore that has been staging puppet shows for more than three decades. Old favourite: Elmo, left, will also star in the new version of the show but Bert and Ernie, right, have not made the cut . The American version of Sesame Street first aired in 1969, and the U.S. government has worked with the company since then to produce shows in about 20 foreign countries, including Muslim nations like Bangladesh and Indonesia. Perhaps nowhere else are the stakes as high as in Pakistan. The U.S. is worried that growing radicalisation could one day destabilise the nuclear-armed country. Washington has committed to spend $7.5 billion in civilian aid in Pakistan over five years, despite accusations that the country is aiding insurgents in neighbouring Afghanistan. Rani, the new program's star, sports . pigtails and a blue and white school uniform. Her innate curiosity is . exemplified by the magnifying glass she often carries and her endless . stream of questions. She is captain of the school cricket team and plays the harmonium, an instrument used to perform Qawwali music. The . creators chose Rani as the lead character to emphasise the importance . of sending girls to school, something that doesn't often happen in . Pakistan's conservative, male-dominated society, said Faizaan Peerzada, . the chief operating officer of Rafi Peer and one of several family . members who run the organisation. 'It makes the girl stand equally with the boy, which is very clear,' said Peerzada. Rani . and Munna are joined by Baily the donkey, Haseen O Jameel the . crocodile, and Baaji, a spirited woman who serves as a mother figure for . the others. Elmo, the . lovable, red, child monster, is the only traditional Sesame Street . character on the show, which is called Sim Sim Hamara, or Our Sim Sim. The . action centres around a mock-up of a Pakistani town, complete with . houses, a school and Baaji's dhaba, a small shop and restaurant found in . many places in the country. The town also includes a large Banyan tree, . known as the wisdom tree in South Asia, in the shade of which the . children often play. Given . the intense ethnic and regional divisions within Pakistan, the creators . tried to build a set that was recognizable to Pakistani children but . did not stand out as being from one part of the country. For similar reasons, the skin colors of the puppets range from very light brown to orange. A . total of 78 episodes will be aired in Pakistan's national language, . Urdu, over the next three years, as well as 13 in each of the four main . regional languages, Baluchi, Pashtu, Punjabi and Sindhi. The shows will appear on Pakistan . state television, and the producers hope they will reach 3 million . children, one million of whom are out of school. They also plan radio programs and 600 live puppet performances they hope will reach millions more kids and parents. Each episode will be based around a . word and a number, like the U.S. version, and will tackle general themes . like friendship, respect and valuing diversity. This . last theme is particularly important in Pakistan, where Islamist . extremists often target minority religious sects and others who disagree . with their views. 'There . are many situations where we coexist peacefully, and that's what we . want to focus on,' said Imraan Peerzada, the show's head writer. The . program will feature holidays celebrated by Muslims, Christians and . Hindus in an attempt to get children to respect the traditions of . different religious groups in Pakistan, said Peerzada. American . officials stressed they were not involved in creating content for the . show. The U.S. is extremely unpopular in Pakistan, and suspicions run . high about American manipulation in the country. The . creators realize that there is some risk of militant backlash. Events . held by Rafi Peer have been attacked several times in the past, . including a world arts festival in 2008 that was hit by three small bomb . blasts that wounded at least half a dozen people. 'We can't just stop because of this fear,' said Faizaan Peerzada.

The Taliban suicide bomber hit an armoured Nato vehicle as the convoy was passing the American University in the city. Wreckage: A tank which was destroyed in the deadly car bombing . A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Two British nationals were among those killed in yesterday's attack in Kabul. 'Next of kin have been informed. Consular staff in Kabul are in close contact with the employer of the deceased. 'Our thoughts are with the families of those who died, ISAF personnel, contractors, Afghan forces and civilians. We stand ready to provide the consular assistance needed to their families.' The armoured personnel carrier, known as a Rhino, was travelling on a four-lane road frequently used by Nato forces in a south-western section of the city. In addition to those killed in the convoy, three Afghan civilians and one policeman died as a result of the attack with eight other Afghans, including two children, wounded, officials said. Horror scene: A Nato helicopter flies over the site of a bomb blast in Kabul. 12 Americans and a Canadian lost their lives. Many of the attacks in Kabul have been . blamed on the Haqqani network, an al Qaida and Taliban-linked movement . that operates out of Pakistan.

Americans and a Canadian were killed on Saturday when a Taliban suicide . bomber struck a coalition vehicle in Afghanistan’s capital. Four U.S. troops and one Canadian solider died in the blast as well as eight American civilian contractors. It . is the deadliest attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul since the . war began and is a major setback for the alliance as it begins to scale . back combat troops. Casualties: Four U.S. troops and one Canadian solider died in the attack . It was initially thought that all five soldiers killed were Americans. However,  a Canadian defense spokesperson, told The Associated Press that a Canadian soldier was among the troops killed.

Dreadful day: US troops prepare to remove the wreckage of a bus hit by a suicide attack . Amid a new deadly attack that claimed the lives of 13 American in Afghanistan, a new report shows that a strong Taliban still remains. The Pentagon said that militants can still pack a punch when it comes to launching attacks in the Afghan capital of Kabul. The report, released Friday, said the Taliban-led insurgency remains 'adaptive and resilient' and with a 'regenerative capacity.' In addition, the insurgency is enabled by safe havens in Pakistan. The document maintains that the U.S. goal in Afghanistan is to fight off the Taliban and deny its ability to overthrow the Afghan government and to allow Afghanistan’s forces to take over the country’s security by 2014. An Associated Press reporter on the scene said that Nato and Afghan forces had sealed off the area. Two Nato helicopters landed to airlift casualties. The back end of a Nato bus appeared to have been blown apart and was turned into a charred shell. Earlier Saturday, a female suicide bomber blew herself up as she tried to attack a local government office in the capital of Kunar province, a hotbed of militancy in northeast Afghanistan along the Pakistan border. Abdul Sabor Allayar, deputy provincial police chief, said the guards outside the government's intelligence office in Asad Abad became suspicious of the woman and started shooting, at which point she deonated her explosives.

A couple who prayed and rubbed olive oil on their dying son rather than calling 911 have been sentenced to more than six years behind bars. Dale and Shannon Hickman, both 26, were convicted of manslaughter in September for the death of their son, David. The baby boy was born two months . early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had . trouble breathing and turned blue. On Monday, a judge told the couple, who are members of a controversial Oregon faith-healing church, that they could have done more to save their baby. Guilty: Dale and Shannon Hickman wait to be taken into custody at Clackamas County Court, Oregon after being jailed for six years for the death of their son . They cried and hugged after being sentenced to 75 months in prison and three years of . probation. Sentencing the couple at Clackamas County Court, Oregon, Judge Robert Herndon said: 'As the evidence unfolded and the witnesses testified, it became evident to me and certainly to the jury … that this death just simply did not need to occur.' He added that in the trial in September, the jury had come back with a verdict in a 'stunningly' short time. During the trial, prosecutors explained David was born with a bacterial infection and underdeveloped lungs and had a 99 per cent chance of survival with medical care. Mr Hickman said he didn't call 911 because he was praying. The couple never considered taking the baby to the hospital, prosecutors said. Shannon Hickman said that she must defer to her husband because of church rules. ‘I think it's God's will whatever happens,’ she testified. Dead: Their baby David was born two months early at his grandmother's home and died nine hours later when he had trouble breathing and turned blue . The Followers of Christ church was founded in the 1890s in Kansas but moved to Oregon City in the 1940s. The . devout followers firmly believe that the power of prayer and the laying . of hands - where ministers lay their hands on believers while . praying - can cure illnesses. It’s . thought that some followers secretly visit traditional doctors - but if . found out, they are likely to find themselves ostracised. The . baby boy died quickly and there was no evidence that medical care would . have saved him, Mark Cogan, defending, told the court. The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils. Five other church members have been . convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of . medical care for their children. The Hickmans' conviction on . second-degree manslaughter charges typically requires a mandatory . minimum sentence of six years in prison. But many feared that, because of a religious exemption in . state law at time of the crime, they might have received just 18 months . in prison and a $250,000 fine. Hickmans: Five other church members have been convicted in Clackamas County for crimes related to the rejection of medical care for their children . In response to deaths among Followers of Christ members, state lawmakers removed the religious defences from criminal laws this year. Those exemptions had made it tougher to . convict parents shunning a child's medical care for religious reasons . instead of neglect. Mugshots: Shannon and Dale Hickman . were sentenced to 75 months in prison and three years probation for the death of their son David . The change will allow prosecutors to seek stiffer manslaughter or murder charges in faith-healing cases. On Monday, Prosecutor Mike Regan said a message needed to be sent to the church that child abuse for any motive is still child abuse. He said: 'These generally are good, decent, law-abiding folks, except in this one narrow area of their lives. One (area) where they have told us stubbornly – and arrogantly, if I may – that ""We are not going to change."" Under-fire: The Followers of Christ Church has a history of rejecting medical care for children and relying on as prayer and anointing the sick with oils . 'The law of civil society demands that they change. It demands that we sent a message to all of them that whether you believe this or not in Oregon, you cannot act upon that belief.' Two other parents from the church were convicted earlier this year for failing to seek medical care for their infant daughter. She had a growth that could have left her blind in one eye - and they were sentenced to three months in jail.","Dale and Shannon Hickman found guilty of manslaughter in September .

"Eugene M Isenberg will stay on as chairman . Deal reduced from $264m after shareholders complained . Worth $750m and has homes in Palm Beach, New York and Martha's Vineyard . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:59 PM on 31st October 2011 . The elderly CEO of an oil company has been given a $100 million pay out - even though he isn't leaving the company. Eugene M Isenberg, 81, has been chairman and  chief executive of . the oil-drilling company Nabors Industries . Ltd since 1987. It was announced last week that Mr Isenberg would be promoting his second in command, 57-year-old Anthony G. Petrello, to CEO of the Bermuda-based company, but . that he would also remain in his job as chairman. Scroll down for video . Sweet deal: Eugene M Isenberg, 81, who lives in Palm Beach, walks away with $100 million in severance pay from oil company Nabors but will stay on as chairman . The power shift means that a clause in Mr Isenberg's employment contract will give him $100 million. The amount is less than he was originally entitled to, $264 million, after shareholders complained several years ago about the exorbitant sum. Mr Isenberg, who is already worth $750 million, would not have been entitled to the payout had he retired or resigned. The 81-year-old lives in Palm Beach, Florida and has commuted to the company's operational headquarters in Austin, Texas. He also has homes in New York and Martha's Vineyard. The company has yet to comment on when Mr Isenberg will receive his payout. According to the Wall Street Journal, the payment is more than the company made in the third quarter which was $74.3 million on revenue of $1.66 billion. In 2009, the Corporate Library listed Mr Isenberg as one of the highest paid, worst performing U.S. executives. In 2011, Nabors stock fell 19 per cent. In a statement on his company's website, Mr Isenberg said: 'I have complete . confidence that Tony is the right person to take over as CEO. 'We have . worked closely together for 20 years, and he has a deep knowledge of the . Company's operations and strategy. 'He is well positioned to lead the . Company as CEO moving forward. I believe the Company's brightest and . most successful days are ahead of it.' Slick: The headquarters of Nabors Industries Ltd in Austin, Texas . Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, told the Wall Street Journal: 'I think shareholders will have some issues. 'From an outside standpoint this doesn't seem to be a severance event.' Eugene Isenberg has been in charge of Nabors since 1987 when the company, which was started in Alaska, was coming back from bankruptcy. He began his career at another oil and gas company Exxon and was formerly head of a steel trading company Genimar Inc. He has served as Governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers from 1998 to 2006 and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) until 2005. He is also the President of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Foundation and a major donor to the college where he was once a student. Booming business: Mr Isenberg has made a fortune from a long career in the oil industry and is said to be worth $750 million . His successor Anthony Petrello, who attended Harvard law school, has been on the board of directors at Nabors since 1991. Last year, the company had a net income of $300 million. The Nabors companies own 491 land drilling rigs . and 749 well-servicing rigs in the U.S and participate in most of the significant oil and gas markets in the world. Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules concerning shareholder approval of compensation for company executives and so-called 'golden parachute' arrangements. From January 2011, the new rules say that 'say-on-pay' votes for shareholders must take place every three years. However the SEC also adopted a temporary exemption for smaller companies which will not be required to abide by the voting rules until 2013.","Eugene M Isenberg will stay on as chairman .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 2:13 PM on 1st November 2011 . A British couple worth more than £45 million have been arrested after allegedly being caught up in in a lewd incident in a U.S. nightclub toilet. Police say tycoons Chris and Mary Gorman were found in the Roxy Club in Orlando, Florida, with her performing a sex act on another man as her husband watched. Mrs Gorman has also been charged with possessing cocaine and battery after allegedly lashing out at a police officer. Mugshots: Chris and Mary Gorman pictured after their arrest in August at a Florida nightclub . He has been charged with interfering with a police officer who was trying to arrest his wife. They were, however not charged with indecency, and the man in with them was released without charge. Mr Gorman, 44, has made a fortune from his digital companies The Reality Group and The Gadget Shop, while Mary is also an entrepreneur, and they live in a £2 million mansion in Renfrewshire, Scotland. The pair now face court after the incident in August, with Mary due before a judge on November 23. The arrest affidavit for Mary, filed by the City of Orlando police officer Noah Pruitt, says: 'One of the club employees informed me that a white male, black male and a white female, later identified as defendant Mary Lang Gorman, were possibly having sex in the men's restroom. Incident: The couple were arrested at the Roxy Club in Orlando, pictured, but the other man at the scene was released without charge . 'As we entered the men's restroom, I noticed the stall was locked. 'Once the stall door opened, the white male was watching defendant Gorman performing a sex act on the black male. 'The . white male and black male exited the stall, exiting the bathroom. Defendant Gorman was still inside the bathroom and was asked to leave . several times. 'Defendant Gorman turned around and pushed me in the chest with an open hand. 'The . white male was later identified as Christopher Gorman. Search incident . to arrest: defendant Mary Gorman black purse contained a black wallet. Inside the wallet were two pieces of white paper containing a white . powdery substance. Scandal: The couple, who have both made millions from nothing, deny all the charges brought against them in Florida . Honoured: Chris and his wife Mary pictured when he received his OBE for services to business in 2005 . 'Based upon my training and experience in street level narcotics, the substance appeared to be ""powder cocaine"".' In a statement the couple told . MailOnline: 'We are obviously horrified by this as, although the arrest . did happen, we firmly do not believe that we have done anything to merit . the charges or treatment we received. Self-made man Chris Gorman accumulated his huge fortune in just 15 years despite coming from an impoverished background. Living in a council house he went on to help organise Live 8 in Scotland and enjoy a millionaire’s lifestyle. With homes in Scotland and Spain, it is believed he is worth at least £35 million on his own. Handed an OBE six years ago for services to business, he has also spent large periods encouraging and investing in young entrepreneurs. The former mobile phone salesman's wealth came after he set up DX Communications with a friend, and from a humble investment of £25,000 it grew to 170 shops, which was sold for £4.2million, which he took a quarter of. After investing this money in internet services, he sold his next business for £35 million, and has continued to make more money from other ventures. He is still involved in the mobile and internet sectors with Truphone and Media Corporation as well as music and lifestyle companies like Lucid Group, ChartsNow! and Quintessentially Group. His wife was also from a modest background but is also now a multi-millionaire from her own businesses, working in technology, music, and beauty sectors. She is also an ambassador for Action for Children Scotland and a supporter of the Prince’s Scottish Youth Business Trust. 'We . totally refute all the charges and have appointed an attorney in . Orlando who fully expects a successful resolution in due course. This is . an already horrendous situation for us and our children so anything . that can be done to limit this would be very much appreciated. 'We are horrified by this.. we do not believe we have done anything to merit the charges.' On August 13 Richard Roman was working alongside Pruitt, and it was he who arrested Chris Gorman . 'I knocked on the door and it was opened by a white male later identified as Christopher S Gorman,' His affidavit says. 'With the door opened, both Pruitt and I observed the white male, a black male and a white female inside the stall. 'We ordered all of them out of the stall. The female became very loud and argumentative with us. 'We managed to escort the female outside the club after Pruitt had arrested her for battery on a law enforcement officer. 'I was standing with Pruitt outside the club when the white male came out the side door and came right at us. 'I ordered the male to stand back, that we were in the middle of writing a police report. The male stated, ""I don't care, that's my wife"". 'I explained to the white male that if he continued with his conduct that he would be arrested for interfering. 'The male again stated, ""I don't care"" and came at both Pruitt and myself. These actions caused Pruitt to stop what he was doing and assist me in detaining the male suspect. 'I placed the white male under arrest at this time for interfering.' The couple were taken to police premises to be booked and photographed, before being freed. Couple: Chris and Mary Gorman, pictured in April 2005, have been married since 1992 . Humble: The pair both came from relatively humble backgrounds and are multi-millionaires in their own right .

"Calvin Gibbs, 26, pleaded not guilty at court martial . Defence lawyer admitted taking the body parts was 'inappropriate' By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:16 PM on 31st October 2011 . An Army staff sergeant, described by a comrade as 'evil incarnate', severed the fingers from the bodies of three Afghan civilians but had nothing to . do with any plot to slaughter the unarmed men for sport, his lawyer said today. A court martial opened for Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, 26, who . has pleaded not guilty to 16 criminal charges ranging from murder to taking the . fingers as bloody mementos. The sergeant, from Billings, Montana,  has maintained that the three . killings early last year were legitimate engagements – and that his . co-defendants conspired to blame him when they got caught. Scroll down for video . Shamed: Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs, pictured on patrol in Afghanistan, is accused of killing three civilians in Kandahar province . Gibbs' attorney, Phil Stackhouse, told jurors in his opening . statement: 'What you are seeing in this case is the ultimate betrayal of an . infantryman.' However the lawyer admitted that Gibbs took fingers from . the victims. He noted that while it's inappropriate to take such trophies, . soldiers are taught to 'disassociate war casualties from the human being they . once were'. In some of the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the Afghan war, . prosecutors say Gibbs and his co-defendants slaughtered the victims with . grenades and powerful machine guns during patrols in Kandahar province, then . dropped weapons near their bodies to make them appear to have been combatants. Of the five soldiers charged as part of the so-called 'kill team' within the platoon, three have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against . Gibbs, who faces up to life in prison without parole if convicted. Gruesome: A courtroom sketch of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs and his lawyer Phil Stackhouse . Brutal slayings: Dead Afghans are tied to a post in one of the many images published from the 'Kill Team' Gibbs, 26, is the highest-ranking of those charged. Others in the unit, . including some of his co-defendants, portrayed him as an imposing sociopath . with little respect for life – a man who gunned down dogs without provocation, . threatened fellow soldiers and who tallied his kills with skull tattoos on his . calves. A prosecutor, Captain Dan Mazzone, told the jurors at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, . south of Seattle that Gibbs took advantage of weak leadership in the platoon to . lead his juniors into the diabolical plot. This wouldn't be a case where they . have to second-guess difficult combat decisions, Captain Mazzone told them. Turning on each other: U.S. Army Special Michael Wagnon at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state where he is a potential witness in Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs' murder trial . Justice: The military courtroom where the court-martial of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs is being held 2011 at Joint Base Lewis-McChord . He said: 'This case is the exact opposite: It is about premeditated . murder.' The crimes are among the most gruesome allegations to emerge from the Afghan . war. Gibbs joined the unit in what was then known as the 5th Stryker Brigade in . Kandahar province in late 2009. He soon began telling others how easy it would . be to kill civilians, Mazzone said. When the platoon later came across a body that had been mangled by a . helicopter gun, the prosecution said, Gibbs had reason to believe he'd really be able . to get away with murder. As the platoon's leadership watched, one soldier . stabbed the corpse with a knife and posed for a photo. Deal: Corporal Jeremy Morlock has pleaded guilty and was given a 24-year sentence . Captain Mazzone added: 'This platoon is out of control. He sees weak . leaders, he sees an opportunity, he sees soldiers who are willing to cross the . line.' Gibbs' lawyer sought to lay the blame for any unjustified killings with . Gibbs' comrades. When Gibbs came to the unit, hash smoking was already rampant, . Stackhouse said. Gibbs, who had more combat experience than most of the others, did talk . frequently of previous shootings he'd been involved in – including one in Iraq, . when Gibbs fired on a car that refused to stop at a checkpoint, only to later . learn that the vehicle was carrying an innocent Iraqi family. The others may have misinterpreted Gibbs' stories, according to Mr Stackhouse. He said: 'On hash-filled nights, under a cloud of intoxication ... they'd talk . about these things.' Gibbs is accused of a wide range of misconduct, from providing a grenade . used in January 2010 to kill the first victim, an unarmed farmer in a field in . Kandahar province, to directly shooting or tossing grenades at the next two in . February and May of that year. One co-defendant, then-Cpl. Jeremy Morlock of . Wasilla, Alaska, said that he or Gibbs enlisted one other soldier to . participate in each of the three killings. Asked why he took part in the killings Morlock, the first witness, . testified Monday that the unit had trained to be deployed to Iraq, and were . frustrated that at the last minute their orders were changed to Afghanistan. Morlock said they wanted action and firefights but instead got meetings. He added: 'It was a lot of meet-and-greets, shaking hands.' Prosecutors said Gibbs also led a group of others in assaulting a soldier who . reported drug use in the unit, and that he threatened that same soldier with . fingers severed from the bodies of dead Afghans. That soldier, Pfc. Justin . Stoner, ultimately prompted the war crimes investigation by telling . investigators who were looking into his beating that members of his platoon had . engaged in unjustified kills. Stackhouse admitted that Gibbs took part in the beating to punish Private Stoner for . going outside the chain of command to report the drug use. He said: 'Did he get roughed up? Yeah. Was he . brutalized? No.' Gibbs and Morlock also paid Stoner a visit later to make sure he didn't . report the beating, Stackhouse said. Gibbs rolled out the severed fingers on a . cloth, and Morlock told Stoner not to wind up like those guys. Stackhouse added: 'Is this shocking to Stoner? Stoner had seen the fingers before.' Morlock has pleaded guilty in a deal for a 24-year sentence. Pfc. Andrew . Holmes of Boise, Idaho, admitted involvement in the first killing and was . sentenced to seven years. Spc. Adam Winfield of Cape Coral, Florida, admitted . involvement in the third killing and was sentenced to three years. Winfield had previously tried to blow the whistle on the plot by reporting . it to his family, who reported the allegations to Lewis-McChord after the first . killing. The report went unheeded, and two more civilians were killed before the . defendants were arrested in May last year. Winfield said he participated in the last . killing because he believed Gibbs might kill him if he didn't. 'He likes to kill things,' Winfield told investigators. 'He . is pretty much evil incarnate. I mean, I have never met a man who can go from . one minute joking around, then mindless killings.' Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, who is charged with direct involvement in . the second killing, has a court martial scheduled for January. Gibbs' trial is expected to last until Friday. The verdicts need not . be unanimous but four out of five jurors must agree to convict him.","Calvin Gibbs, 26, pleaded not guilty at court martial .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 12:41 PM on 1st November 2011 . Courts should have the power to quiz all defendants - and witnesses - on their use of internet porn, a top lawyer said today. Nick Freeman - the solicitor dubbed Mr Loophole - said it was outrageous that the jury in the Jo Yeates murder trial couldn't hear about Vincent Tabak's interest in images of women being throttled - yet Milly Dowler's father was hounded over his interest in bondage when his daughter's killer was in court. He says judges should not be allowed to decide whether evidence relating to pornography is admissible and believes a blanket ruling should allow lawyers to quiz any defendant or witness on pornography, providing it is relevant to the case. Not happy: Lawyer Nick Freeman, left, says it's outrageous that the jury in the Jo Yeates murder trial couldn't hear about Vincent Tabak's interest in hardcore porn . He believes it is the only way to 'smash this disgraceful contradiction', especially in view of the fact that more than a third of UK internet users view porn online. Writing in his Manchester Evening News column today Mr Freeman  said: 'In my view, anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings, their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court, if relevant to the charge.' In the Jo Yeates murder case, the judge at Bristol Crown Court refused to let prosecutors reveal Tabak's interest in hardcore porn. In the weeks after the killing he visited sites which showed men choking women during sex, images of other women tied up in car boots and others being bound and gagged. Changes needed?: Although he was only a prosecution witness, Bob Dowler, pictured here with his wife Sally, was forced to admit at his daughter's murder trial that police had found pornographic material in his possession . In the trial of Levi Bellfield in June, the father of his victim Milly Dowler broke down in tears as he endured hours of questioning about pornography and bondage equipment found at his home. Mr Freeman says: 'Though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial, Bob Dowler was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession. 'Many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief-stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing.' By contrast, he says the withholding of evidence relating to Tabak's porn interest was an 'outrage'. He says: 'His predilection for hard-core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying ""choke me"" - was kept from the jury in the Jo Yeates murder case. 'An outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused. 'Without it, the Crown just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority.' Ever been tempted to look at porn on the internet? After all, pornography is viewed by 35.9 per cent of UK internet users. It's unlikely many of these are more than casual sauce-surfers, idling away a few moments of spare time over their lunchtime pot noodle. Certainly - or rather, hopefully - very few, fuelled by a cyber-fix, would develop a thirst for violence or even murder. Unfortunately, it did in the case of Vincent Tabak. And yet his predilection for hard-core and violent pornography - including images of women being held by the neck saying 'choke me` - was kept from the jury in the Jo Yeates murder case. An outrage since in my mind this was a scorching piece of evidence which directly played to the mindset of the accused. Without it, the Crown just about limped home with a conviction after the jury deliberated for two days before returning a 10 - 2 majority. A very close call for the Crown. Square that with the experience of Milly Dowler`s father. Though only a prosecution witness at his daughter`s murder trial, Bob Dowler was forced to admit in open court that police had found pornographic material in his possession. Many leading commentators stormed that this was an intrusion too far for a grief-stricken parent traumatised by his daughter`s killing. It`s time to smash this disgraceful contradiction by carving the legal position in statute. In my view, anyone watching internet porn should know that if they subsequently become a defendant or witness in criminal proceedings, their cyber spectating could be open to questioning in court, if relevant to the charge. Every day minds are polluted by the toxic trash being pedalled on the web. Yet the law seems to protect a violent killer tanked up on gruesome internet footage whilst exposing an innocent witness for his lamentable sexual interest. At the moment a judge has a discretion to make this call. It`s not enough. If he errs on the side of caution, suppresses evidence arbitrarily and gets it wrong, a vicious murderer could walk free. The scales of justice between the probative and the prejudicial need to be rebalanced. The law needs to stand as a serious deterrent. There are 755 million porn-heavy pages on the web, generating £60billion a year in filth-soaked revenue. And nearly 36 per cent of the population are looking at it. One of them could be you. Would you take a peek if you knew your secret wasn`t safe?","Mr Loophole blasts decision to withhold Vincent Tabak's interest in violent porn from jury .

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 4:17 AM on 1st November 2011 . A £1.4billion fund to boost economic growth has given grants to just seven firms so far, it emerged  last night. The news came as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the second round of the Government’s Regional Growth Fund which, it is promised, will pay out £950million to 119 firms nationwide. He said the investment would ‘jump-start growth’ and create or safeguard up to 200,000 ‘jobs that last in the places that really need it’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (right) talks to Graham Honeyman, chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters during a tour of the firm's steel plant today. He announced that the government will invest £950million to support growth . David Cameron, pictured with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard (left) and Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani (right) at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth at the weekend, has promised to kick-start major infrastructure projects and get the economy moving . But last night officials at the . Department for Business, Innovation and Skills admitted that, six months . on from the first round of the growth fund, just seven of the 50 . companies offered a share of the original £450million pot have received . their cash. A steel firm in Nick Clegg’s home city was yesterday offered £36million of taxpayers’ money to expand – following a backlash against the Deputy Prime Minister over the cancellation of a previous loan. Sheffield Forgemasters will be one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the second round of the Government’s Regional Growth Fund, which is run by the Lib Dem leader. The award follows a bitter row last year over the Coalition’s decision to cancel an £80million loan agreed by Labour in the run-up to the general election. Mr Clegg, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, denied that the U-turn was an attempt to repair the political damage he has sustained in the city. While touring the firm, he was repeatedly asked whether the money was a  payment to shore up his own position. ‘This is not about any politician,’ he said. ‘It’s genuinely about what we can do together – the Government and companies like Forgemasters – to restore a sense of hope and confidence and growth to the economy.’ He insisted that the loan promised by Labour was judged to be ‘unaffordable’. Aides to Mr Clegg said he had not taken part in the decision to hand the new money to Forgemasters due to his local connections. The firm, best known for unwittingly making parts for Saddam Hussein’s ‘supergun’ project in 1990, is a highly respected manufacturer specialising in steel forgings and castings. The figures represent an embarrassment . for David Cameron, who yesterday said officials had been ordered to . ‘strain every sinew’ to get money for investment and infrastructure . projects out the door. Ministers were also facing questions . over the allocation of the grant money, much of which has gone to . multinationals including the U.S. car-maker General Motors, the Spanish . bank Santander and German engineering firm Siemens. Other businesses benefiting from state support include Bentley and Lotus. James Ramsbotham, chief executive of . the North East Chamber of Commerce, said the money was coming through . too slowly – and not necessarily going to the firms that needed it most. ‘When you look at the first tranche, . which was announced much earlier this year, until the beginning of last . month not a penny had been paid,’ he said. ‘It is only just beginning to  filter through. ‘Very few projects are benefiting, and . we are seeing that a lot of the businesses it is going to are . businesses that are already doing incredibly well. ‘The delays are hugely important. With . the length of time it is taking for decisions to be made and for money . to come through it is going to be a long time yet before we see any . benefits.’ The Prime Minister was challenged in . the Commons over the fund last month – when the Labour leader Ed . Miliband revealed that just two firms had received their grants. Downing Street piled pressure on . officials to accelerate the process, and Mr Cameron claimed last week . that the initiative was ‘on schedule’, with ‘about 40 projects’ helped. But the Government last night said that only seven firms’ grants had been processed. The rest will not be handed out until the completion of ‘due diligence’. Demonstrators dressed as vampires wear David Cameron and Nick Clegg masks as they protest the government's proposed public sector pension reform today. The real-life dastardly duo expect 'many more' infrastructure project announcements over the autumn . Luxury car companies were among the businesses to benefit from the nearly £1billion of grants announced by the government today. Bentley, based at Crewe in Cheshire, said its £3million grant would safeguard more than 200 jobs. And another luxury car company, Lotus, based at Hethel in Norfolk, was also on the list of firms that had been successful in getting a Regional Growth Fund (RGF) grant. Bentley said its grant would help support the development of a new engine and would also create a small number of extra jobs within the company's 900-strong engineering department. Bentley chairman and chief executive Wolfgang Durheimer said: 'This is a real boost for Bentley. This grant will help safeguard our engineering operations as we look to develop new power trains which appeal to new markets and new customers.' The latest grant, which follows an earlier £1.68million RGF payment, will mean Bentley is making plans to increase its graduate and apprentice intake next year. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This is a very significant boost to local communities, and the RGF will help businesses like Bentley drive local growth.' Mr Miliband yesterday described the . funding as ‘too little, too late’ and pointed out that the £1.4billion . allocated over three years was a third of the money made available . through Labour’s Regional Development Agencies, which are being scrapped . by the Coalition. He also accused the Government of . undermining manufacturing by slashing capital allowances – a move which . could see 200,000 firms lose tax breaks worth up to £30,000. Ministers insist that the Regional . Growth Fund has the potential to make a major impact, particularly in . parts of the country that have struggled to attract private investment. In addition, Mr Clegg said yesterday that every pound of the fund would be matched by at least £5 of private sector investment. The funding announcement came as the . Prime Minister gave the green light to two power plants – at . Ferrybridge, in West Yorkshire, and Thorpe Marsh, in South Yorkshire – . which will create 1,000 construction jobs. Whitehall sources suggested that both . announcements had been rushed forward in anticipation of today’s . official growth statistics, which are expected to show the recovery is . still sluggish. Ahead of the figures’ release, Mr Cameron said that ‘strong growth alone is not the goal’. He continued: ‘Our ambition is to . build a new and better economy. This coalition has the determination to . do the right thing for our country.’ Here is how today's £950million government funding breaks down between England's regions, according to figures from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills: .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 1:52 AM on 1st November 2011 . It was supposed to be a symbolic gesture to mark a global milestone. But when the UN declared a baby from the Philippines the world’s seven billionth human, it sparked worldwide howls of ‘oh no she isn’t’. Parents from Britain to India scrambled to claim that their child was in fact the landmark baby. What's all the fuss about? Danica is oblivious to the significance of her arrival . Proud: Yasmin Karim and son Peter Bashir in London and Marina Nikolaeva and son Pyotr in Russia . Of course, with hundreds of thousands of births each day, it is impossible to pinpoint the true holder of the title. But the UN chose to mark the event by welcoming Danica May Camacho, who was born two minutes before midnight on Sunday to a struggling family in Manila, with a chocolate cake marked ‘7B Philippines’ and a gift certificate for free shoes. Her mother Camille said: ‘She looks so lovely. I can’t believe she is the world’s seven billionth.’ Not to be outdone, officials in Uttar Pradesh – the most populous state in India – appointed seven girls born yesterday to share the honour. They included Nargis Yadav, daughter of Ajay and Vinita. Delight: George Doikas and his mother, left, and Ajay and Vinita Yadav with Nargis, right . Britain has a candidate, too. Soon after his birth at St Thomas’s Hospital, London, at 6.58am yesterday, Peter Bashir was presented with a House of Commons teddy bear by Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Tonge, Tory MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and hospital staff. Mother Yasmin Karim, from Rotherhithe, south London, said: ‘We will be able to tell him he was the seven billionth baby when he gets older. It felt like he was fighting to get out. Maybe he wanted to be famous.’ There were also celebrations following declarations by officials in Vietnam, Zambia, Russia – Marina Nikolaeva’s son Peter – and Greece – George Doikas. Sadly, it’s unlikely to be a title that will carry much weight. The families of Adnan Nevic from Bosnia Herzegovina, named as the sixth billionth baby, and Matej Gaspar, from Coatia, who was number five billion, have complained the UN has ignored them ever since. Something to celebrate: Proud father Florante Galura holds a cake marking the significance of his daughter's birth . The Philippines' Health Secretary Enrique Ona said the . arrival of the world's seven billionth baby presented his country with an opportunity to assess population related issues. According to the UN Population Fund . (UNFPA) State of the World Population Report, the Philippines is the . 12th most populous country in the world with 94.9 million people.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:38 PM on 31st October 2011 . Freed: Lola Olayemi admitted causing death by careless driving . A woman driver who killed a mother and left her son fighting for his life after slamming into a bus shelter walked free from court today. Lola Olayemi, 35, had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving after the smash in Caversham, Berkshire, which killed Catriona Scott, a single mother. The court heard how Olayemi, from nearby Reading, had gone on a shoplifting spree the day she had been charged over the crash, which also left Miss Scott's son in a critical condition. Miss Scott was crushed to death when the bus shelter where she had been waiting with her then nine-year-old son, Miles collapsed on top of them both. Both mother and son were rushed to hospital, but she died just two days after the crash, which was caused when Olayemi smashed her 4x4 into one of the shelter's supporting pillars. Miles suffered a fractured skull in the incident and was left deeply traumatised by the tragedy. A judge sitting at Reading Crown Court heard how Olayemi made no attempt to prevent the tragic collision, despite her own baby daughter, then aged 21 months, travelling in the car with her. Jane Davies, prosecuting, told the court that witnesses standing at the bus stop saw Olayemi's Toyota Rav 4 turn a corner but fail to straighten out. Her car hit a bollard as it mounted the pavement before crashing into the shelter, demolishing it. Fellow passengers waiting for their buses were left covered in glass as the shelter collapsed on top of Miss Scott. 'Catriona Scott was lying on her front. She was being helped by another passenger and her son Miles was also injured and was crouching close by,' said Ms Davies. 'The defendant got out of her car and was shouting ""what shall I do?""' Olayemi had tried to help stricken Miss Scott before paramedics arrived at the scene of the crash in Briants Avenue, Caversham, at around 1.30pm on February 28. Both Miss Scott and Miles were treated at as specialist head injuries unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where Miss Scott later died. Tragic: The scene of the crash on Briants Avenue, Caversham, on February 28 . In a witness impact statement read to the court, Miss Scott's 71-year-old father, George, said that her loss had left a 'black hole' in his life. He had become the full-time carer for the boy and had moved into his daughter's home to ensure that the youngster's life remained as unchanged as possible. Despite the schoolboy making a full physical recovery the court was told that he required counselling sessions to help him come to terms with his mother's death. Crushed to death: Catriona Scott, a single mother, died in hospital two days after the accident in February . 'I have no life now, my life centres around my grandson and trying to ensure that he can get over his problems as soon as possible,' said Mr Scott, a widower. The court was told how Olayemi had not been speeding at the time of the crash, nor was she under the influence of drink and drugs while both of her mobile phones were inside a bag in the back of the car. Olayemi, who had only held a UK driving licence for a year despite driving for 10 years in her native Nigeria, told police that she had been trying to avoid another car - although witnesses said they had not seen it. She admitted causing death by careless driving at an earlier appearance in Reading Magistrates' Court. She also admitted to stealing £300 pounds worth of clothes from Debenhams just one hour after being charged with causing Miss Scott's death on July 28. Judge John told Olayemi, who had previous convictions for theft but not for driving offences, that were he to give her a prison sentence she would only have ended up serving around six weeks. 'In my judgement that would serve no justice whatsoever and would lead Miss Scott's family to wrongly believe that six weeks inside was the price I was putting on her life,' he said. The judge instead sentenced Olayemi to a 12-month community order and told her she would have to undertake 240 hours of unpaid work - with a further 60 hours for the shoplifting offence.",Lola Olayemi went on a shoplifting spree the day she was charged with causing death by careless driving .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:40 AM on 31st October 2011 . These shocking images of a little boy shot in the head have emerged hours after Syrian president Bashar Assad claimed his army was only targeting terrorists. The boy is from the Bayada neighbourhood of Homs, northeast of the capital, Damascus. He was wounded in the head after he was allegedly hit by the Syrian army during the recent uprisings in his hometown. The projectile entered the back of his head and can be seen lodged above his left eye. Shocking: A large bulge can be seen above Mohammed's left eye. He was allegedly hit by the Syrian army . Blood can be seen coming from the wound in the back of the youngster's head . Warning: Syrian president Bashar Assad has said his country is different to others where similar uprisings have occurred . In his first interview with a Western . paper, published in the Sunday Telegraph, Assad claimed that he was a . popular president and added that his army was only now targeting . terrorists. During the . interview Assad also warned Western intervention against his regime . would cause an 'earthquake' that would 'burn the whole region'. President Assad said the action could lead to 'another Afghanistan'. Defying worldwide condemnation of his actions, he said any outside aggression would ‘burn the whole region’. Assad's ultimatum came as hundreds of demonstrators marched to the Syrian embassy in London to show solidarity with victims of the seven-month uprising. In a two-hour rally outside the building in Belgrave Square, protesters chanted ‘get out Assad’ and ‘free Syria’. Activists claim Syrian forces killed more than 50 civilians in violent clashes over the weekend. At least 3,000 people – including 200 children – have died during the unrest. Thirty soldiers also died in fierce fighting in the city of Homs and in an ambush in the northern province of Idlib on Saturday. Assad conceded that the West would ‘ratchet up the pressure’ but said his country was different ‘in every respect’ from Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen, where other rebellions had taken place. Home: The Syrian president lives in Damascus and claims he is popular with his people because he lives an ordinary life . Assad lives a relatively modest life-style and claims this has made him popular with his people. He lives in Damascus with his wife Asma and their three children in a small, but guarded house in an ordinary street. The president, who can regularly be seen on the school run, said he lives a normal life and even drives his own car. ‘Syria is the hub now in this region. It is the fault line and if you play with the ground you will cause an . earthquake,’ he said. ‘Do you want to see another Afghanistan, or tens of Afghanistans? Any problem in Syria will burn the whole region. If the plan is to divide Syria, that . is to divide the whole region.’ He admitted his forces made ‘many . mistakes’ at the start of the uprising, but claimed only ‘terrorists’ were being targeted now. Assad also claimed his modest . lifestyle made him a popular leader. ‘The first component of popular . legitimacy is your personal life. It is very important how you live,’ he . said. ‘I drive my own car, we have neighbours, I take my kids to school. That’s why I’m popular.’ Unrest: Protesters burn images of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a protest earlier this month . Unpopular: Britain, France, the U.S, the United Nations and the Arab League have spoken out against the Syrian president . The president made his remarks as demands grew for a Libya-style no-fly zone over Syria. The resilience of the protesters, the . determination of the authorities to crush dissent and the growing armed . insurgency have combined to make Syria’s  turmoil one of the most . intractable confrontations of this year’s Arab uprisings. Western governments have called on . the country’s embattled leader to step down, and have already imposed . sanctions on Syrian oil exports and state businesses . President Assad insisted his response . to the Arab Spring was not one of ‘stubborn government’, adding: ‘Six . days after (the protests began) I commenced reform.’ He also insisted . the pace of reform was ‘not too slow’. The latest wave of violence was met . with strong criticism from the Arab League, which issued a statement . expressing ‘disgust’ at the killing of civilians. An Arab League committee was due to meet a Syrian delegation in Qatar yesterday to discuss ways to solve the crisis. Britain, France, the U.S and the United Nations have all openly criticised the Syrian president over the past few months. The Arab League also sent a message to Assad and said they hoped the government would try to protect its citizens. One . of the protest leaders told the Sunday Telegraph said that protesters . were not calling for economic reform but wanted Assad out, followed by . free elections.

Tourists may be ""banned"" from parts of Cambridge City centre and ordered to pay a ""tax"" in a bid to protect the historic city centre from over-crowding and deterioration. Cambridge City Council is considering a series of ""draconian"" measures after parts of the city have become no-go areas for normal residents. Cllr John Hipkin, former Mayor of Cambridge, yesterday called for the city to be turned into a high-calibre heritage and culture destination. Attractions: Almost four million tourists visit Cambridge each year to see its attractions such as the university (pictured) He argued for restricting the number of budget hotels to ""discourage"" short-stay visitors and imposing a ""tourist tax"" on hotel bills to subsidise public services. He believes the tourist tax on hotel bills should be handed over to Cambridge City Council to improve the city for its residents. He said: “The levy, if it were possible and lawful, should be considered for Cambridge because of the impact of tourism on the city. “The money should be used by the local authority to improve public services such as public toilets and keeping the streets clean. “Tourists should be required to make a contribution.” Under his vision long-term all visitors would need to buy a Cambridge Pass to gain exclusive entry to historic and cultural sites, such as colleges and museums. He said: ""Some will consider these suggested measures to control tourism draconian and so they may be but, without strong policies to stabilise or reduce tourist numbers, the character of the city and its amenities, especially in the peak season, will continue to deteriorate. Restrictions: The Cambridge councillor would also like to see punting and punt touts 'rigorously restricted' ""We need a new vision of Cambridge as . a tourist destination and all those who care for the city must unite to . ensure that it is realised. ""The . vision is of a high calibre, long-stay heritage and culture city at the . hub of connections to nearby sites of historic and natural interest. Cllr John Hipkin warned that the city is becoming overcrowded . ""Casual short-stay tourism should be discouraged."" Cllr John Hipkin warned that the city is becoming overcrowded as the number of tourists visiting Cambridge each year reaches four million. He said some part of the city centre, such as King's Parade and Quayside, are ""off-limits"" to residents and that market square is going the same way. The Cambridge councillor would also like to see punting and punt touts ""rigorously restricted"". Diane Thompson, general manager of the Royal Cambridge Hotel, said attracting a mix of tourists was what kept the city's economy afloat. She said: ""I don't think we can turn on one tap and switch off another because it doesn't work like that."" Cllr Neil McGovern, the city council's tourism chief, said Visit Cambridge's focus was already on ""value, not volume"" tourism. He said: ""Visit Cambridge works hard to maximise the economic impact of our four million visitors each year while also working to reduce any detrimental impact on the city as a result of these high visitor numbers."" Cllr McGovern said Cllr Hipkin's ideas were ""interesting"" but warned they could damage businesses in the city.","Cllr John Hipkin wants to discourage 'casual, short-stay tourism'

"By . Press Association Reporter . Last updated at 3:49 PM on 28th October 2011 . A former nurse told her daughter her life had become a 'nightmare' after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, an inquest heard today. Virginia Humphrey, 67, died at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) in Brighton, East Sussex, on May 9 after losing 10 stone in six months, the inquest at Brighton County Court was told. An email sent by divorcee Mrs Humphrey to her daughter, Deborah Mitchell, who lived in the U.S., was read out to the inquest. Tragic: Virginia Humphrey, pictured with her grandchild before the operation, was worried about having the gastric bypass . In the email, sent on January 18, she described how she was unable to keep any food down and had chronic indigestion, leaving her feeling like a 'prune'. She wrote: 'Life since coming out of hospital has been a nightmare. 'Friday was an awful day ending with me being so sick I thought I turned my body inside out.' Her son, Kevin Humphrey, said that in her last few months she became wheelchair-bound as she did not enough energy to walk, and he would have to carry her up the stairs to the house they shared in the city. He told the inquest: 'I had rails fitted but she wasn’t strong enough to use the rails. 'She could walk no further than 10 steps, then she’d feel faint.' The inquest heard yesterday how Mrs Humphrey, who also had another son, suffered from malnutrition as she was unable to absorb nutrients. It was also heard that the surgeons who carried out the operation at University College London Hospital (UCLH) may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure as it was possible a channel leading to the colon was cut too short. Fatal . operation: Virginia Humphrey died in hospital in Brighton after she . lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation . Mrs Humphrey, who suffered from type two diabetes, asthma and high blood pressure, had undergone the procedure to help her lose weight on August 31 last year and seemed to be doing well and making the progress expected in the following months. However by December she was beginning to have problems keeping food down and was admitted to the A&E department at the RSCH twice that month. The inquest heard that although she went to the hospital because of her constant vomiting, medics also found she had chest problems and so did not inform staff at UCLH of her bariatric trouble. Mrs Humphrey, who worked as an Army nurse before becoming an auxiliary nurse, went to A&E again on February 9 suffering from severe vomiting, diarrhoea, lower abdomen pain and indigestion. Medics found she was dehydrated and also had difficulty swallowing. The inquest heard staff at the RSCH decided Mrs Humphrey should be transferred to UCLH so she could have specialist bariatric care. They did not have space for her immediately but she was admitted on February 22 with symptoms of vomiting and difficulty swallowing. University College Hospital London: The hospital where Mrs Humphrey underwent her gastric bypass surgery in August last year . James Hewes, a trainee surgeon who had carried out the gastric bypass alongside consultant bariatric surgeon Marco Adamo, told the inquest these were relatively common complaints from patients following gastric surgery, and would normally last for around a year afterwards. He said on seeing her again at the hospital, her kidney function appeared to be completely normal and she appeared dehydrated, but not severely. Her albumin levels, which indicate the amount of protein in the blood and could have pointed to malnutrition at the time, fluctuated but were also said to be normal. The inquest heard that 'morbidly obese' Mrs Humphrey, who had weighed 18st 10lb (119kg) ahead of her operation on July 23, weighed 75.4kg on February 22, which was described as more than would have been expected, but not of great concern. It was heard that Mrs Humphrey, who was previously described as a 'very cheerful' person by her GP, Dr Caroline Roberts, was also a 'stoic' character who may not have let on to hospital staff just how ill she felt before she was discharged on February 28. Mr Adamo said: 'Patients are very happy because of the weight loss so sometimes they tend to minimise their symptoms. 'Patients are more inclined to say 'it's fine'.' The inquest heard Mrs Humphrey, known as Ginny, later contracted a blood stream infection, which may have contributed to her death of multiple organ failure.","Son reveals mother could not walk more than 10 steps in her last few months .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 10:09 PM on 1st November 2011 . Bernie Madoff's daughter-in-law has hit back at claims made by Ruth and Andrew Madoff in their recent '60 Minutes' interview and describes the dramatic change her life has taken since the Ponzi scheme was discovered. Stephanie Madoff-Mack sits down with Anderson Cooper to 'put right' some of the revelations made by the pair in the revealing interview aired on Sunday. Stephanie was married to Madoff's son Mark, who was 46 when he committed suicide on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Scroll down for video . Stunned: Stephanie said she was shocked by some of the things they said, particularly that Andrew said he wasn't surprised by his brother's suicide . Reaction: Stephanie sat down with Anderson Cooper to discuss her feelings over some of the revelations made in the '60 Minutes' interview . In love: Stephanie told Anderson that she and her husband were talking about having more children and were absolutely not splitting up . Madoff's wife Ruth revealed in the interview that she and her husband tried to commit suicide together on Christmas Eve by taking all the sleeping tablets they had in the house. But they simply woke up the next day. Anderson Cooper asks Stephanie what she thought when she learned that. She said: 'I have no idea what went on in that penthouse that night but for Ruth to talk about trying to kill herself so flippantly like that is so offensive to me because that's how my husband died. 'Ruth says she was happy that she woke up. I'm happy for Ruth that she woke up but I just wish that my husband had and he didn't. 'Its not a laughing matter. It's not funny. It's what killed my husband.' Tell-all: Ruth Madoff gave the first interview since her husband's arrest and revealed they had tried to commit suicide . Son: Andrew Madoff said he never suspected his financier father of running a Ponzi scheme because he grew up hearing what a legend he was . Happy times: Stephanie denies Andrew's claims that she was seeking a divorce, saying they were in a 'good spot' Madoff earlier denied ever having attempted suicide in an interview from prison, where he is serving a 150-year sentence for his record-breaking scam. But he called the Today Show's Matt Lauer on Sunday night to corroborate Ruth’s account of the pact before he interviewed her on Monday. Pact: Madoff finally admitted to Matt Lauer that he and his wife did try to commit suicide . Lauer told Ruth: '(Bernie) agrees completely with the way you tell this story. He said he took Ambien, aspirin and some blood-pressure medication. The two of you got into bed that night fully dressed because you suspected your bodies would be found. 'He said he woke up the next day to the sounds of you saying, ""I’m alive, I’m alive"".' In the interview, Ruth described finding out about her husband's affair as the 'worst thing that ever happened to her'. Cooper tells Stephanie that he found this 'stunning', in that her son's suicide wasn't the worst thing. Looking noticeably annoyed, Stephanie told him: 'I do too. I mean I'm a mother I can't even imagine the pain Ruth must feel about losing a son but to say that the affair was worse. It doesn't make sense to me. She doesn't make sense to me.' Andrew Madoff, along with his fiancee, has released a book about their experience throughout the trauma saying they wanted to tell their side of the story. In it, he makes a number of allegations against his late brother Mark, pokes fun at him - calling him a mama's boy - and even alleges that Stephanie was seeing a divorce lawyer days before he hanged himself with a dog leash. Speaking about the claims made in the book, Stephanie said: 'It is hurtful. I have not read his book . but I have heard that he does poke fun at Mark and I don't understand . why. Close-knit: Bernie Madoff with his wife and two sons on a skiing holiday before the confession that was to blow their family apart . On the Today Show: Catherine Hooper, left, fiance to Andrew, centre, and Ruth Madoff who went on the show to talk about the book and their life since Madoff confessed . 'I also understand he claims that I was planning on leaving Mark, a . few days before Mark killed himself. That's absolutely not true. Mark . and I were in a great place that day I went to Disney World and we had . been a great place through out the fall and winter time. I was getting . my husband back. 'The anniversary of Bernie's confession was coming up . and it wasn't even on our radar.  Mark was laughing again, working . again, we were talking about having more children and to hear that is . very hurtful and Mark died, I would think he would want to honor him.' Book: Andrew and his fiancee released the book so that people would 'know the truth' about the scandal . She also revealed to the CNN anchor she believes Ruth's claims that she knew nothing about the Ponzi scheme, saying: 'She's not a monster, she's not a bad person. She just makes foolish choices.' Despite that, she banned her mother-in-law from coming to Mark's funeral saying she did it for both her husband and children's sake. 'I didn't think Mark would want her at . the funeral and furthermore I thought the presence of Ruth Madoff would . cause such a media circus…I really wanted to protect all four of Mark's . children. I wanted it to be as calm and private as possible,' she said. Ruth . Madoff cut off all ties with her husband after her son's funeral and . she revealed in '60 Minutes' that she wish she had done it sooner as . Mark had wanted, blaming herself for his suicide. Stephanie reveals that after Madoff's . confession, her family became Mark's family. He sent emails to his wife, . her mother, brother and stepfather before his death. He didn't send any . goodbye emails to anyone in his family. She said: 'My family had become his. He felt very abandoned obviously by Ruth. He felt abandoned by his brother.' Andrew Madoff, who said he was very close to his brother before he died, said he was 'not surprised' that Mark committed suicide, something Stephanie says she 'doesn't understand'. 'Look I was Mark's wife. I lived with him everyday. My husband was in a good spot. He was moving on. I have nothing more to say to that. I just don't agree with Andrew's statement at all.'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 5:14 AM on 2nd November 2011 . A Florida man pleaded not guilty today to hacking into the emails of stars such as Christina Aguilera, Mila Kunis and Scarlett Johansson, whose nude photos were eventually splashed on the Internet. Christopher Chaney, 35, of Jacksonville, Fla., made his first court appearance in California, where he's been indicted on 26 counts, including unauthorized access to a computer and wiretapping. Invaded: Naked pictures of Scarlett Johansson circulated the internet after they were stolen from her phone . If convicted, he faces up to 121 years in prison. U.S. Magistrate Judge Patrick Walsh denied federal prosecutors' request to remand Chaney to custody but modified his bond to $110,000, and he will wear an electronic monitoring device upon his return to Florida. A trial has been scheduled for Dec. 27. Chaney was arrested as part of a yearlong investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi.' There were more than 50 victims in the case. Some nude photos taken by Johansson herself were posted on the Internet. Chaney offered some material to celebrity blog sites but there wasn't any evidence that he profited from his scheme, authorities said. Chaney is accused of mining through publicly available data to figure out password and security questions for celebrity accounts. Chaney hacked Google, Apple and Yahoo . email accounts beginning last November through February, then hijacked a forwarding feature so that a copy of every email a celebrity received was sent to an account he controlled, according to court documents. He allegedly used the hacker names . 'trainreqsuckswhat,' ''anonygrrl' and 'jaxjaguars911,' and also used the . victims' identities to illegally access and control computers. A search warrant unsealed and obtained by The Associated Press said Chaney's computer hard drive contained numerous private celebrity photos as well as a document that compiled their extensive personal data. Suspect: Christopher Chaney, centre, is accused of mining through publicly available data to hack into the email accounts of more than 50 celebrities like Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera and Mila Kunis . In arguing for a higher bond and time . behind bars, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Feldman said that even after . FBI agents seized the defendant's computer in February, he continued his . hacking scheme against another actress for six months. She declined to reveal the celebrity's name. 'We have great concern that he can't stop himself,' Feldman said. 'We think detention would.' Chaney said he managed to hack into Johansson's email account to send one of her acquaintances an email containing a nude photo of her in exchange for a photo, authorities said. Collection: A search warrant said Christopher Chaney, who appeared in court today, had numerous private celebrity photos as well as a document that compiled their extensive personal data stored on his hard drive . Johansson told Vanity Fair for its December issue that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, who is now her ex-husband. 'There's nothing wrong with that. It's not like I was shooting a porno,' the actress told the magazine. The pair had their divorce finalized by a judge in July. Chaney has apologized for his actions. His attorney, Christopher Chestnut, told AP that his client doesn't want the case to drag on, but the resolution has to be within reason. 'I think he has a crystal clear view of what is at stake,' Chestnut said during Tuesday's hearing. Celebrities who agreed to be named in the . indictment included Mila Kunis, Christina Aguilera and lesser known . actress Renee Olstead, who has a role on TV show The Secret Life of the . American Teenager . The warrant also said Chaney may have stalked a Connecticut woman online for the past 12 years. The document contends there is probable cause that Chaney violated federal charges of stalking and unauthorized access to a computer. Federal prosecutors also said a second woman has stepped forward and made similar accusations that Chaney stalked her online. They declined to comment further. Chaney told the AP the new allegations are completely false. 'I can't accept responsibility for things I didn't do,' Chaney said. Chestnut said the new allegations amount to nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to damage his client's reputation. Mr  Chestnut said: 'The amount of time, money and energy the authorities have spent pursuing a man who didn't sell anything or profit in any way from this alleged activity is truly remarkable, given everything we are going through in this country.' No other charges have been filed against Chaney, who has a 1998 mail fraud conviction in Florida. He was sentenced to four years' probation.

Her courage melted the heart of Princess Diana and helped inspire fellow paraplegic Superman actor Christopher Reeve to fight back from the depths of despair. Now Gemma Quinn, who was paralysed from the neck down at the age of seven in a horrific car crash, again faces one of the biggest fights of her life after revealing she is virtually penniless. She won a £3.9million compensation settlement in 2000, eight years after the family car, driven by her father, was hit by a lorry in North Wales, severing her spinal cord. Survivor: Gemma Quinn is now facing financial strife after costly care that could have been free from the NHS . But the cost of round-the-clock medical care, mobility equipment and pioneering treatments has eaten into the payout. Now Miss Quinn, 27, is preparing to . seek legal advice after learning her local primary care trust should . have been paying for her medical care for the past nine years. She is relying on a ruling in 2002 . which said the NHS had to pay for the continuing long-term care of . patients despite multi-million pound awards or settlements. Miss Quinn . says she was not told of this change and continued to pay her . £100,000-a-year care bill herself. Although Liverpool NHS PCT is now . paying for her 24-hour care she says she hopes to get back some of the . money she paid since 2002. Miss Quinn, who lives in Woolton, . Liverpool, said: ‘It has been an utter nightmare because I have been . funding my own care since 2000. Touching hearts: Gemma, pictured in 1995, won praise from both Princess Diana and Superman actor Christopher Reeve . ‘We have been in a really bad . financial predicament, so much so that for the two years until March . this year, I had virtually no care.’ At the time of her accident in . 1992, doctors said Gemma would never live an independent life but she . was determined to prove them wrong. She learned to operate a word . processor with her mouth and gained good GCSE and A-level results. Not long after her accident Gemma . wrote to late actor Reeve after learning he had broken his spine in the . same place as her in a horseriding accident, urging him not to give up . hope. Reeve said at the time: ‘This amazing young lady showed me an . example of how to cope.’ She met the Princess of Wales, who had . heard about the letter, on an official visit to Liverpool in 1995. Later, at the age of 12, she took part in Princess Diana’s funeral . procession. Miss Quinn campaigned for spinal research charities, raising . more than £100,000, and in 1996 won a Child of Courage award. Expensive care: Gemma, aged 19, at the Mind Instructor Centre in London having a form of body and mind therapy with instructor Hratch Qgali . As well the cost of care, Miss Quinn . says a failed business venture, ill-timed share investments and a home . education means she is facing a mountain of debt. She said: ‘People ask where all  the . money has gone. But more than £1million went on care, more on . specialist treatments and day-to-day living. I’ve got some property but . that is mortgaged and could be repossessed. ‘I didn’t know I could get help with . the care costs and, despite being fully aware of my circumstances and . previously providing care for me, the PCT never came forward to offer me . help.’ Miss Quinn said her financial situation had forced her to move . back with her parents, Michael and Jacqueline, who have since split. With her family: Gemma posing with her father Michael in 2001 . She is facing further medical problems . after developing a bladder stone requiring surgery which is complicated . by her paralysis. The stone triggers a blood pressure . condition called autonomic dysreflexia, which causes excruciating . headaches and can prove fatal if left untreated. She is hoping to . undergo surgery later this month after the operation was postponed. A Liverpool NHS PCT spokesman last night said they needed to speak to Miss Quinn to assess her case regarding her care. Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS . Trust, where Miss Quinn is due to have her operation, said the surgery . had been rescheduled to the next available date.","Gemma, now 27, was unaware she was entitled to free care since 2002 .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 2:15 PM on 1st November 2011 . Two Russian families who were awarded $100,000 after their daughters were accidentally switched at birth have pledged to spend the payouts on new homes so the girls can grow up next door to each other. The 12-year-olds from Chelyabinsk, Russia, have become friends since their mix-up was discovered but will not switch to their biological families. Judges ordered the maternity home where the error took place a dozen years ago should pay out the money to the shattered families. Special bond: 12-year-olds Anya Belyayeva, left, and Irina Iskanderova have become friends after it was revealed they were mixed up at birth . The two girls were born 15 minutes apart . on the same day and the medical centre, located in the Ural Mountains, . admitted that they had mixed up the identity labels of the pair of . babies. The mistake was only discovered earlier this year when one couple, the Belyayevs, were going through divorce proceedings. Yuliya Belyaeva's former husband, had refused to support their daughter, Irina, because . she didn't look like him. The subsequent DNA test revealed that neither parent could have been the biological parents of the girl. 'The results were a total surprise,' Mrs Belyaeva told the BBC. 'Not only does my ex-husband have no biological link to Irina, neither do I.' After contacting the police, the Belyayevs were able to track the Iskanderovs and their daughter, Anya. There was a reconciliation with both families, in the city of Kopeisk in the Ural Mountains and heir situation has caused a media storm in Russia. The two girls have become close after meeting and Irina said: 'We were a bit shy at first but we're now the best of friends.' From right: Iskanderova, her father, Nimatullo, Irina and her mother Yulia Belyayeva. Chelyabinsk's Kopeisky city court ordered a maternity hospital to pay 3 million rubles after the girls were mixed up mixed up 12 years ago . Now that the maternal home has agreed to pay out both families have said that the girls will not return to their original families. However the families are thinking about spending the compensation to get houses close to each other. 'I would like us to share a house so . that we don't worry about her daughter coming to me and the other way . round,' Irina's biological father, Naimat Iskanderov said. However, there are complications, as he explains: 'One family is Christian, the other is Muslim. 'What I fear most is that the daughter I've raised will start going drinking in bars, that she will stop praying and working.' Lawyer Natalia Shtreker - representing both families - said: 'We are satisfied with the result and with the amount of compensation. We believe that it is fair.' The parents laughed in joy and embraced each other in the footage from the courtroom after the judge delivered the verdict. The compensation is huge by Russian standards, where an average monthly wage currently stands at the equivalent of some £300. However, despite winning the court battle, Mrs Belyayeva continues to feel bitter. 'All the money in the world isn't worth a child's look at mother,' she said. 'I wish they could put our lives in place. 'I tried to show Anya motherly love, but she doesn't accept it. 'When your own daughter looks at you like a stranger, that's so painful.'","The mix-up only came to light when one couple took a DNA test while going through a divorce .

"By . James Slack . Last updated at 2:54 PM on 2nd November 2011 . More than 11,000 foreign students have been barred from entering Britain after their college courses were exposed as ‘bogus’, it emerged last night. The Home Office said one in every five colleges - more than 450 in total - offering places to overseas students has lost its licence after a crackdown on the rampant abuse of the visa system. The colleges have been banned from bringing any non-EU students into the UK. The Home Office has revoked the licenses of 450 colleges as they were found to be offering bogus courses to foreign students . The colleges, which either failed to sign-up to a new Home Office inspection system or had their licences revoked, could have brought more than 11,000 international students into the UK each year. Some could not produce any records of student attendance, others failed to show they checked student qualifications and another could not even produce a list of students enrolled or a timetable of classes. Immigration minister Damian Green said widespread abuse of the student visa system - the most common way for migrants from outside the EU to get into the UK - had gone on for too long. Immigration minister Damian Green said widespread abuse of the student visa system had gone on for too long . Under Labour, ministers admitted it was the ‘Achilles’ heel’ of the immigration system, but critics say they did little to tighten the rules. It was blamed for allowing terror suspects a backdoor into the UK. Some colleges were nothing more than rooms above fast-food shops or other commercial premises. Earlier this year, the government introduced new rules making it far harder for colleges which do not offer degrees to be allowed to sponsor visas. Students are now also required to speak a reasonable level of English. Mr Green said: ‘Too many institutions were offering international students an immigration service rather than an education and too many students have come to the UK with the aim of getting work and bringing over family members. ‘Only first-class education providers should be given licences to sponsor international students. We have curbed the opportunities to work during study and bring in family members. ‘We have also introduced new language requirements to ensure we only attract genuine students whose primary motivation is to study.’ More than 400 colleges lost their right to recruit international students after they failed to sign up for the new inspection system, the Home Office said. In addition, a sharp spike in student visa applications from south Asia just before the English language requirement rules were tightened prompted an investigation into 119 colleges. Of these, a further 51 had their licences revoked, three had licences suspended and nine were re-rated. A total of 11 are subject to further considerations and 45 were found to be compliant. The move comes after the Government announced a blacklist of more than 2,500 banks which cannot be trusted to verify documents supporting student visa applications. Foreign students applying to study in the UK who claim they have funds to support themselves and pay for their course held in any of the banks on the list will receive no points for maintenance. The list includes 1,977 banks in India, three in Pakistan and 762 in the Philippines. Ministers consider it vital to get a grip on student visas if they are to have any chance of reducing net migration – the difference between the number of people entering the country, and those leaving – to the ‘tens of thousands’. Students represent almost two-thirds of the migrants coming to the UK from outside the EU each year. In the 12 months to the end of June, a total of 304,548 student visas were issued, including 33,342 dependants, along with 36,018 student visa extensions, which included 19,416 dependants, Home Office figures showed.","Some colleges were rooms above fast-food shops .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:35 PM on 1st November 2011 . A woman accused of killing her husband in a road crash after grabbing the handbrake during a row only did it so she could get out of the car, a court heard today. Caroline Meeking said she didn't intend to kill partner Alan and just wanted to get away from him in order to let him calm down when the crash occurred near Yeovil. The pair were on their way home to Somerset from a day's drinking in Bridport, Dorset, when the road accident happened on the unlit A3088 at Montacute, on the evening of August 30 last year. Trial: Caroline Meeking, right, leaves Bristol Crown court this afternoon . Accused: Caroline Meeking is on trial for manslaughter . Between them, the couple, who had been together for nine years and married for 12 months, had drunk two bottles of Rose wine and four or five pints of lager. Giving evidence at Bristol Crown Court, 45-year-old Meeking told jurors that the argument began as they took a wrong turning on a roundabout. 'He started shouting at me, calling me ""[a] Satnav with no batteries"" and a ""total waste of space"",' Meeking told the jury. 'We were arguing and it just escalated from there.' Tragic: Alan Meeking, 49, died at the scene of the crash . Meeking claimed she said nothing, hoping her 49-year-old husband - who was more than twice the drink drive limit - would calm down but he carried on. She said: 'He started talking about my family and my dad. He started abusing me and saying that they are scum. 'I kept saying ""Just stop it, just stop it. Just stop the car, I want to get out. I don't want to listen to you any more"". 'I was pretty nervous. I just wanted to get out. I just thought if he drove off I could walk home from there or he could turn around and get me once he had calmed down.' Fighting back tears, she said: 'It seemed like he was going more faster. He had never shouted at me in the car like that before. 'I had never seen him that way before or in that manner in such a confined space for that length of time. 'I thought to myself if I opened the door and jumped out but I thought he was going faster and I couldn't jump out. 'And I thought if I put the handbrake on it would slow the car down and I could get out. He could then go off and do whatever he wanted to do.' Showing the jury how she pulled on the handbrake, she said: 'I just pulled it up like when you park a car.' Meeking said that when she grabbed the handbrake she had no wish to either hurt herself or her husband, and had no idea the car would spin out of control. She added: 'I just wanted to defuse the situation.' Meeking, who lives in Ilminster, Somerset, denies a single charge of manslaughter. Bristol Crown Court: The trial is ongoing, with Mrs Meeking denying manslaughter . Meeking denied an accusation from prosecutor Ian Dixie that she had 'jammed' the handbrake on. He asked her: 'I suggest to you that the truth of the matter is that you didn't stop and think what you were going to do, and you pulled it on without thinking?' She replied: 'No.' After pulling on the handbrake, the silver Ford Escort went into a spin and headed side-on at speed into the path of a car coming in the opposite direction. The driver of the other car had no time to react and the two cars collided shortly before 10.30pm. Mr Meeking suffered catastrophic injuries and was declared dead at the scene by medics. Motorists who came to the couple's aid described her shouting repeatedly: 'I am sorry, it's all my fault. That's my husband, it's all my fault. 'He didn't want me no more and I just grabbed the handbrake. 'We were having an argument and he called me a dirty slut and I pulled up the handbrake.' The witnesses also told police they did not believe Mr Meeking was driving with his headlights on. The defendant said she had no memory of what happened after the crash but described how she felt later as a 'nightmare'. She told jurors: 'I was just numb and felt like a zombie. I just wanted to curl up and pretend it was a dream.' Blood tests carried out afterwards found that Mr Meeking, who was 5ft 9ins and weighed more than 17 stone, had a blood alcohol level of 168mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood - meaning he was more than twice the legal drink-drive limit. The court heard that the speed limit on the road was 60mph and police investigators believe Mr Meeking was travelling 'very close' to that speed when the crash happened. Meeking said she and her husband, who worked as a vehicle panel beater, had a good marriage and shortly before his death had been to the doctor to discuss IVF treatment after deciding to start a family. Breaking down in tears, Meeking told the jury: '(Our marriage was) the best thing that ever happened to me. It was all my dreams come true.' She told the court that they had met in West Drayton in West London but decided to move to Somerset for a 'change of lifestyle'. Together they ran a cattery. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow when Judge Neil Ford QC, The Recorder of Bristol, will begin summing up.","'I thought if I put the handbrake on it would slow the car down and I could get out...

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 2:04 PM on 1st November 2011 . The Scottish Government has reintroduced its plan for minimum alcohol pricing. The SNP administration had been blocked by opposition parties when it tried to set a floor price per unit last year but now has a majority in the Scottish Parliament. Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said it was time Scotland's 'unhealthy relationship with alcohol' was tackled. Booze Britain: The chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland said it is wrong that alcohol is sold at prices cheaper than fizzy drinks . However critics, including some drinks industry bodies, say the move will penalise responsible drinkers and will encourage people to go on cheap 'booze-runs' across the border to towns like Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle. Last year the price was expected to be set at 45p per unit but no official limit has yet been set. An own-brand bottle of vodka increasing in price from from £8.35 to £11.85 . A two-litre bottle of cider going up from £1.20 to £3.75 . And the cost of a bottle of wine moving from £3.75 to £4.20 . The policy has been widely supported by . police and health professionals. The Liberal Democrat group has changed its position . and is likely to support the Government too. Ms Sturgeon said: 'We should not . lose sight of what has been achieved during the last four years. We . have had a wide-ranging debate on alcohol pricing and there is now . widespread recognition across the country of the need to tackle pricing. 'We have introduced a ban on quantity discounts and promotions in off-sales have been restricted, but already we have seen that without minimum pricing these attempts to take action on Scotland's alcohol problem are being undermined. 'By setting a minimum price for a unit of alcohol, we can raise the price of the cheap supermarket white ciders, lager and value spirits sought out by problem drinkers. Booze cruise: Drinkers could hop over the border to towns like Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland, pictured, to buy cheaper alcohol . 'I hope that this time around MSPs will do the right thing and back this policy that has the support of doctors, nurses, the police and growing numbers of the general population.' Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland, said it was wrong that alcohol is sold at prices cheaper than fizzy drinks. Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's unhealthy relationship with alcohol must be tackled . He said: 'Without addressing price, many of the policies we've introduced already will be rendered less effective. 'There is an urgent need to legislate. For too long supermarkets have been piling it high, selling it cheap when it comes to alcohol. 'These retailers are already working . on how to navigate the loopholes of the new laws on drinks promotions . and it is clear that, by encouraging bulk-buying at low prices, these . retailers are placing profit before public health.' But . Jeremy Beadles, chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Trade . Association, said the move means the majority of responsible drinkers . will be punished by higher prices. He said there was no evidence minimum pricing will address the problem and the most recent Government figures show alcohol consumption per capita fell in Scotland last year. Mr Beadles added: 'The Scottish . Parliament should insist on its right to review the policy and its . impact on cross-border shopping, internet sales of alcohol and any . evidence of illegal trade of alcohol in Scotland.' The Government argues that alcohol-related problems cost Scotland £3.56 billion each year, equal to £900 for every adult. Last year, MSPs did approve a ban on . discount deals, such as two-for-one bottles of wine, and restricted . 'irresponsible' drinks promotions and advertising around premises. Price rise: The changes could mean an own-brand bottle of vodka increasing from £8.35 to £11.85 and a two-litre bottle of cider going up from £1.20 to £3.75 . The Bill established a requirement for age verification and paved the way for a new tax on licence holders, called a social responsibility levy. The tax aims to ensure retailers and licensed premises, such as nightclubs, contribute to the wider cost of their activities to the community. The SNP pledged to push ahead with the alcohol price plan in its election manifesto. The party was elected with an unprecedented majority in May this year. Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said minimum pricing was the wrong option. He highlighted comments made last week by Westminster's Public Health Minister, Anne Milton, who said the plan is 'probably illegal' under European free trade rules. Scottish Labour public health spokesman Dr Richard Simpson MSP said his party is still opposed to the policy and questioned whether the plan is legal. Meanwhile, a leading academic on the alcohol industry and the chief executive of a brewery have backed the Scottish Government's plans to introduce minimum pricing. Professor Tim Stockwell, director of the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia, said there is clear evidence that minimum pricing in Canada has significantly reduced alcohol consumption. However, Rooney Anand, chief executive of brewer Greene King, which runs more than 2,000 pubs, restaurants and hotels in the UK, believes minimum pricing would 'go to the very heart' of the problems associated with excessive drinking. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'Cutting alcohol abuse is essential if we are to help people get on in the world. Too many Scots don't achieve all they can because they drink too much. Minimum pricing will help with this effort.'",Alcohol problems cost Scotland £3.56bn per year .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:43 PM on 2nd November 2011 . A four-month-old baby who had rickets suffered fatal brain damage after being shaken, a court heard today. Rohan Wray, 22, and Chana Al-Alas, 19, of Islington, north London, appeared at the Old Bailey accused of murdering their son and causing or allowing his death. Jayden Wray was taken off life support on July 24, 2009 and died the following day. Jayden Wray, who died in 2009, was found to have 'moderately severe rickets' though a doctor believes that some of the injures to the four-month-old were non-accidental . Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'It is the Crown's case that those responsible for his death are his parents. 'Clinical investigation into the cause of his collapse revealed a number of injuries - some recent and others pre-dating his admission to hospital by quite some time. 'These injuries suggested to doctors treating him that Jayden had sustained them as a result of either a shaking or shaking/impact assault.' Jayden had been born a normal baby when his mother was 16 and his father 19. On July 22, 2009, he was admitted as an emergency to University College Hospital and placed on life support. Within hours, Jayden's condition deteriorated and he was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. Rohan Wray and Chana Al-Alas, accused of murdering their son and causing or allowing his death, are pictured arriving at the Old Bailey . Despite efforts to save his life, he was considered so severely brain damaged that his condition was 'incompatible with life', said Miss Howes. The couple denied that Jayden had been injured in any way to their knowledge, but staff at Great Ormond Street Hospital found multiple fractures including to his arms, leg and skull. He was severely brain-damaged and had haemorrhaging in his retinas. On July 24, 2009, doctors decided to take the baby off life support. Miss Howes told the court: 'It was explained that life support would be withdrawn but if Jayden stopped breathing, he would not be resuscitated. Al-Alas gave birth to Jayden when she was 16 . 'Rohan Wray asked the consultant paediatric intensivist Dr Shruti Agrawal how big the skull fracture was and if fractures could be dated.' Jayden died the following day. As part of tests carried out after Jayden's death, Professor Archibald Malcolm found that he had been suffering from rickets, a disease which causes bones to be weaker. Miss Howes said: 'It was quite clear that Jayden, despite his healthy appearance to most of the health professionals who he saw, had moderately severe rickets.' She added: 'It has to be borne in mind that Jayden had a greater risk of bone fracturing than any normal, well-nourished child.' Prof Malcolm believed that, while many of the baby's fractures could be linked to rickets, some injuries were not. He argued that fractures to the top of both of Jayden's humerus bones and his femur were more likely to have been caused by non-accidental injury, as was the skull fracture. In his opinion the injuries were around seven to 14 days old. He also noted haemorrhaging in the skull fracture, which he said could suggest a repeat injury before death, Miss Howes told the jury. Wray and Al-Alas deny having caused any injury to their baby and the defence maintains that the seizures and fractures were linked to rickets. Meningitis and encephalitis could also not be ruled out as possible causes of death. The case continues.","Brain damage so severe he was 'incompatible with life'

The former U.S. Secretary of State has revealed more details about their strange relationship and a music video he made for a sing called ‘Black Flower in the White House’ and presented as a gift. She said her colleagues had already warned her about the late Libyan leader’s fascination with her before she went to visit him in 2008. Scroll down for video . Strange relationship: Former U.S. secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, left, said her colleagues warned her about Muammar Gaddafi's fascination with her . Pictures: He compiled a photo montage of Ms Rice, Chinese president Hu Jintao (right in left photo) and ex-Russian president Vladimir Putin (right in right photo) ‘When I got there I thought ""just get through your business, just do diplomacy, just get out of here"",’ she told the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. 'Everything was going fine and then all of sudden he said: “I have this video for you”. And I thought: “Uh oh, what is this?”.’ It turned out that he had compiled a photo montage of her, including images of her with other world leaders like Chinese president Hu Jintao and former Russian president Vladimir Putin. This was set to a song Colonel Gaddafi had written for her called ‘Black Flower in the White House.’ Asked to sing a few lines, Rice politely declined, describing the ballad as ‘kind of hard to sing’.

Fascination: There were many albums of the former secretary of state found in 'Bab Al Aziziya' in Tripoli, Libya . A bizarre photograph album filled page to page with pictures of Condoleezza Rice was found at Gaddafi's compound in August. Colonel Gaddafi had previously hinted at a serious admiration for her in an interview with Al-Jazeera television in 2007, where he hinted that then-President George W. Bush's top diplomat wielded considerable influence in the Arab world. 'I support my darling black African woman,' he said at the time.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:30 AM on 2nd November 2011 . Songs from Amy Winehouse's posthumous album have been revealed - but reviews say she may not have liked how it turned out. Amy Winehouse Lioness: Hidden Treasures, which contains original tracks as well as covers, is to be released on December 5. One song, Between the Cheats, reportedly tells of cheating . ex-husband Blake Fielder Civil. Hidden Treasures: The 12-track posthumous album by Amy Winehouse will be out in December . Another was apparently recorded while the . singer was high on drugs. Most of the recordings are just the first takes of songs which have been reworked by producer Salaam Remi who added backing tracks and vocals. He had worked with the singer on her two . albums Frank and Back to Black and was slated to produce her third. He says he only spent two weeks polishing the material after the singer died on July 23. Seven of the 12 tracks were revealed . to journalists in a Soho recording studio yesterday. In one of the recordings, Song For You, Amy bursts into tears, Salaam recalled. The album is said to feature original tracks and covers, one of which is a recording of jazz standard Body and Soul with Tony Bennett, left . One journalist wrote: 'It is hard to believe that . Winehouse herself – who oversaw every aspect of the two albums she . released – wouldn't have reworked much of the material that is to be put . out. 'There are certainly times when her vocal on a song sounds more . like a sketch, even if she was an instinctive artist who appreciated the . magic of capturing a first take.' Musical legacy: The star was found dead in bed in her Camden flat in north London in July . She added: 'At best, the seven tracks sounded like . the basis for another hit album, although it's hard to make any kind of . judgment on the basis of one listen.' Saleem declined to reveal a . Frank-era live set opener called Best Friends, an early version of the hit . Valerie, a demo of the song Wake Up Alone, a version of the Shirelles' Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow and the Tony Bennett duet Body and . Soul. He explained of the album: 'Lots of people are going to want to remember . other aspects of her life, but what we have here highlights that . musically and creatively, she was the tops. She was a great musician and . a great songwriter as well. She wasn't a musical fluke.' After playing the seven tracks, Saleem explained that he was in London the weekend Amy died. They had . planned to attend a friend's wedding with her on the Sunday morning, but . 'before I could make it from Shepherd's Bush to Notting Hill, she had . gone'. 'For me, working on a record was a healing process. He . said he had only needed to spend two weeks of further production on the . tracks since his friend's death. 'I had a big brother relationship with . her – with me, there was a musical space where she could be herself and . not worry about anything else. And with this record: I wanted to get it . off my chest. I knew what material was there, and I didn't want to . rehash the pain that I feel now, in 12 months time ... These songs, I'd . like people to know them. I didn't want them sitting on a hard drive, . wilting away.' Mitch and his partner Jane, leave a London Coroner's Court after hearing the singer was more than five times the drink-drive limit when she died . He added: 'I know there were times when she wasn't in great shape – . although personally, I didn't really see that side of her; it didn't go . on in my presence – but music for her was her escape.' A label executive said there was a trove of live material which could be released in the future. 'We're . not looking to paper over any cracks with this record. 'We want this album to be good enough to exist on its own . merits, and we think it's faithful to her legacy. Whether you can hear . every lyric on every song or not, you can always hear the emotion . there.' Between the Cheats . The song was recorded in May 2008, . for possible inclusion on Amy's planned third album. The song is . another with a heavy doo wop influence, and 'shows one of the main . directions in which she was heading', says Salaam. It has led to speculation that it references Amy's . tempestuous relationship with her ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil, whom . she divorced in July 2009. But the big and brassy song starts with a spot of whistling and is not a maudlin ballad. The lyrics can not be clearly heard – at least, not on . a first listen – although there is a reference to 'my husband'. 'Amy was mostly a one-take person,' said Salaam. 'Going through all the . [computer] files of her music: it's mostly all one or two takes.' A Song For You . Love hurts: The album is said to include a song about her ex Blake Fielder-Civil . This . version of the Leon Russell classic made famous by Donny Hathaway was . recorded in one take at Amy's home studio in Camden in . early 2009. 'She said to me, . we can make the new album here,' Salaam recalled. 'We don't have to worry . about the paparazzi. 'She was just lying down on a couch, with the mic in her hand and by . about halfway through the song she was crying, really weeping, with . makeup running down her face.' The song concludes with the lines: 'And when my life is over/ Remember . when we were together. We were alone and I was singing this song for . you.' After the song . finishes playing, Amy is heard talking to Salaam, . discussing the relative merits of Marvin Gaye and the singer who first . made the song famous. 'Donny Hathaway,' she says. 'It was like he . couldn't contain himself … he had something in him, you know.' Our Day Will Come . Salaam explained that during the . recording of Amy's debut album, Frank, the pair would play around with . different versions of songs that they liked, once a vocal take was in . place. This song is a reggae version from those sessions in 2002 of this 1963 hit by doo wop outfit Ruby & the Romantics. 'It also points the way forward to the doo wop sound of Back to Black,' the producer said. Tears Dry . The first take from November 2005 in Miami of the song which appears on . Back to Black. 'It brings another light to the song,' said Salaam. 'It's not so much about the production: it's her … making a . direct connection with the listener.' So, a ballad to which strings have . subsequently been added. But not – for this listener at least – a real . tearjerker. Like Smoke . Back then: Amy in 2004 when she wrote some of the songs . This song was recorded two weeks after Between the Cheats and features a guest . appearance from the New York rapper Nas, whose verses were added . subsequently to the recording. 'He was one of Amy's favourite artists,' Salaam said, adding that the song In My Bed from Frank, effectively . sampled one of his tracks, while Me & Mr Jones told the story of . missing one of his gigs. 'They had an affinity. Besides . which, they were both born on 14 September.' Nas references Amy's death, when . he raps about a visit to Camden, and his belief in heaven. Halftime . The . song was recorded three or four times in 2002 but missed the cut for the record . that became Frank. It did, however, give that album its title, as . Winehouse mentions Ol' Blue Eyes himself in the lyrics: 'And when . Frank Sinatra sings, it's too much to take … he pacifies my ache'. It is Winehouse's vocal and guitar playing that form the basis of the . track, but Salaam later invited Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson of the Roots to . add a drum part. The song starts in acoustic fashion, but when . Winehouse sings ""when the beat kicks in, everything falls into place"", . on cue, Questlove does his thing. Again, as with so many Winehouse songs, it's a tale of heartache and . fierce pride. 'You can try and stop me, Amy sings' 'but you won't . get the chance'. The Girl from Ipanema . In May 2002, Winehouse met Remi in Miami for the first time. 'I didn't . even know what she looked like at the time, but she came in with an . acoustic guitar and sang this. Her voice just filled and lit up the . room. She really put something into the song that I'd just not heard . before.' This 1960s hit takes that recording as its basis, and it's daft and fun, so . never mind that it's clearly a half-finished take, with Winehouse . resorting to scat singing.","Review says she probably would have reworked album if she had the chance .

Newly-released maths scores have revealed that U.S. fourth and eighth grade children are doing better than ever in the subject - but are still behind national targets. The U.S. government's 'No Child Left Behind' law aims to make every child in America proficient in maths and reading by 2014. Results issued today show that in maths, 40 per cent of fourth-grade students and 35 per cent in the eighth grade have currently reached that level. Scroll down for video: . Goal: The U.S. hope to make every child in America proficient in maths and reading by 2014 . Just over a third of students in the U.S. are proficient or higher in reading.In 2011, fourth and eighth-graders posted the highest maths scores ever on the national assessment test, with the grade four students gaining a single point over 2009 scores and 28 points over 1990, when testing began. Among eighth-graders, average math scores climbed by a single point over 2009 and by 21 points over 1990. In reaction to the scores issued by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said they were 'reason for concern as much as optimism'. He said in a statement: 'While student achievement is up since 2009 in both grades in mathematics and in 8th grade reading, it’s clear that achievement is not accelerating fast enough for our nation’s children to compete in the knowledge economy of the 21st Century. 'After significant NAEP gains in the 1990s, particularly in mathematics, the 2011 results continue a pattern of modest progress.' A graph shows the gradual improvement on U.S. school pupils in maths since 1990 . On the up: Eighth grade U.S. children are also showing a marked improvement in maths in the past 20 years . Statistics show the percentage of U.S. fourth grade children who are above the basic level in maths (dark green), above proficient (pale green) and at advanced levels (mid green) While more eighth graders are also achieving good maths scores, their proficiency is still behind national targets . The Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics administers the test every two years. The only U.S. state where student scores in maths and reading increased at both fourth and eighth grade level in the past two years was Hawaii. New York was the only state to score lower in math among fourth-graders in 2011, compared to 2009. David Driscoll, chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board, said: 'Over the past two decades major gains have occurred in mathematics achievement, but only modest improvements in reading.' Despite better math scores, progress has slowed and achievement gaps between races remain 'unacceptably wide,' he said. There were few noticeable changes in the achievement gap between white and black students from 2009. The data for maths results in the U.S. is collected every two years from the National Assessment of Educational Progress . While the gap is smaller than in the early 1990s, the new test results reflect a 25-point difference between white and black fourth- and eighth-graders in reading and fourth-graders in math. However, Hispanic students in eighth grade made some small strides to narrow the gap with white students in both math and reading. The results, known as The Nation's Report Card, also revealed that Asian students, this year for the first time in their own category, had the highest scores of any single group.","Government hope to make every American child proficient in maths and reading by 2014 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:02 PM on 1st November 2011 . In one man's world, your house can be destroyed, you can continue to make its mortgage payments, yet it can still be foreclosed. That's the situation for Brad Gana, a Texas man whose home was washed away in 2008 by Hurricane Ike who continued to make its mortgage payments, before the bank arrived, confiscating whatever items they could get. 'I was shocked when they said they were foreclosing on it,' Brad Gana told investigator Amy Davis, according to KPRC-TV. 'Shocked': Brad Gana says he paid all of his mortgage payments on time, despite no longer having a house to live in after a natural disaster, but his bank still foreclosed on him . Mr Gana was working overseas when the hurricane hit his neighborhood of Sea Brook, completely destroying his home. But even then he says he never missed a single mortgage payment for his home, which no longer existed. It was in fact left as a rumbled slab of concrete. So when his bank contacted him, telling him they were foreclosing on him, despite payment he said he was making, he was stunned. Vanished: The suspected former-house of Brad Gana, shown by Google Images before it was destroyed by Hurricane Ike . 'It wasn't until about 20 calls that someone said, 'We had a homeowner's policy on your home that you reside in, and your monthly payments have gone up,'' Mr Gana told KPRC. Mr Gana says he first learned of the foreclosure just two days before he planned to sell his property. Hiring an attorney to stop the . procedure, which was successful, Bank of America still arrived at his . property, removing any personal items that were available like his tools . and collectibles, all of which are now gone. Reached for comment, a representative with Bank of America sent an email to the investigator, Ms Davis, admitting that the bank had 'incorrectly placed insurance' on a home that no longer existed. The representative said they will have to audit his account to correct any discrepancies. 'Ruthless ... incompetency': The Texas homeowner returned to find his lot picked clean by his bank who accused him of inadequately paying them what he owed . Unoccupied insurance: The bank admitted to 'incorrectly placed insurance' on the vacant lot despite which they say they will audit to correct any discrepancies . 'Bank of America is ruthless in their incompetency,' Mr Gana responded. The representative with the bank said that they had tried to reach Mr Gana earlier on his homeowner's policy and changed mortgage amount, but all of their efforts mailed were returned. Mr Gana offers one argument to that: his mailbox was destroyed. But either way, he says had provided the bank with an email address he could be reached at, as well as two phone numbers to where he was residing overseas and could be contacted. Promising to work together with the unfortunate home owner, in an email to KPRC, a representative wrote: . 'There were a number of factors that contributed to the issues that resulted in the actions that we took on Mr. Gana’s mortgage and property. 'We continue to research the incidents. 'We have contacted Mr. Gana and we will work with him directly to address his concerns.' But this isn't the first case of misdiagnosed mortgages by the banking giant. National attention: Marine One carrying then-President Bush surveyed the damage delivered by Hurricane Ike in 2008 that swept 110 MPH winds across the shore . Astronomical damage: Ike's 110 mph winds caused more than $29 billion in damage and took the lives of at least 72 in the United States . A senior couple in Florida faced foreclosure earlier this summer after paying their mortgage one month too early and then using the wrong routing number in their following payment. Sharon Bullington, 70, said the bank contacted her to say her and her husband had been cut out of their trial mortgage plan because of improper payments. Instead of filing it the 'month in which it [was] due' in January, Mrs Bullington filed it in January, the bank penalized. A second couple in Houston, Texas, was also under fear of foreclosure by the bank. Brian and Khanklink Pyron were warned of their home's imminent loss, despite saying they had been current on their mortgage payments because of a technicality on the transfer of their home's title. The cause was a bankrupt company involved in their home's purchase, that never notified the family, despite their continuing payments to Bank of America which never reached their mortgage-holder. 'We did everything we were supposed to do,' Mr Pyron told MyFoxHouston. 'Nobody has communicated with us, notified us. 'We had been paying our mortgage . and everything,' he asserted.",Brad Gana latest victim of bizarre Bank of America foreclosure .

Two-year-old twin girls who were joined at the chest and abdomen have been separated after nine hours of surgery at a California hospital. Doctors at Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital said Angelica and Angelina Sabuco should now make full recoveries. Paediatric surgeon Dr Gary Hartman, along with a team of more than 20 physicians and nurses from various specialties, said the surgery went smoothly and he expected both girls to do well. Scroll down for video . Brave: Conjoined twins Angelica and Angelina Sabuco will undergo a nine-hour procedure tomorrow with hopes they will grow up to lead normal lives . Operation: Dr Gary Hartman operates on Angelica and Angelina during the nine-hour surgery on the conjoined twins . Scale: More than 20 surgeons and nurses were involved in the operation at the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California . He said: 'The long-term prognosis is that we should have a happy, healthy set of girls. We don't see any barrier to a full recovery. The twins' mother, Ginady Sabuco, called the operation 'a dream come true'. She added: 'Words cannot express how the family feels.' The operation took months of planning and required the separation of livers, diaphragms, breastbones and chest and abdominal wall muscles. It began at around 6.30am yesterday morning and by mid-afternoon the girls had their own operating rooms for the second phase of surgery - reconstructing the area where they had been connected. They were then moved to an intensive care unit, each with a scar stretching from her chest to her belly. Both girls are being kept sedated and doctors said they could be awakened earlier today, CBS reported. They are likely to remain in hospital for at least two weeks. 'Dream': The girls' mother, Ginady Sabuco, stands with Dr Hartman, right, and plastic surgeon Peter Lorenz after the successful operation . Family: The girls, who were born in the Philippines, live in San Jose with their parents Ginady and Fidel Sabuco, and their ten-year-old brother . The reconstruction included covering . what plastic surgeon Dr. Peter Lorenz described as a 'window' left in . their chests after separation. Since July, the girls had received . weekly injections of sterile saltwater into balloons placed under their . skin. The procedure stretched their skin and grew new skin to patch the . area. Angelina and Angelica, who were born . in the Philippines and live in San Jose with their parents and . ten-year-old brother, have done well so far. They love listening to stories and music, and they know their colours and can count to ten. And like many children their age, they love Dora the Explorer and Elmo, and celebrated their second birthdays with cakes adorned with Disney princesses and Tinker Bell. But remaining conjoined carries risks for the girls' physical health, especially if they share organs unequally. If one conjoined twin dies, the other will die within hours. Conjoined: Angelica and Angelina are classified as thoraco-omphalopagus - their livers, diaphragms, breast bones, chest and abdominal wall muscles are fused . Risky: The nine-hour operation will involve cutting along the girls' skin and muscle and separating their diaphragms and livers . Angelica and Angelina were classified . as thoraco-omphalopagus - joined at the chest and abdomen. Their livers, . diaphragms, breast bones, chest and abdominal wall muscles are fused. They have separate hearts, brains, kidneys, stomachs and intestines. The occurrence of conjoined twins is estimated to range from one in 50,000 births to one in 100,000 births worldwide. According . to the hospital, only about six separation surgeries are done annually . in the U.S. Most conjoined twins never survive pregnancy and the overall . survival rate is approximately 25 per cent. According . to ABC News, there have been approximately two dozen sets of conjoined . twins in the world who have been successfully separated. The operation involved cutting along the girls' skin and muscle and separating their diaphragms and livers. Doctors snipped any adhesions between the girls' bowels. Separate reconstruction operations will follow. While the hospital would not discuss the cost of the surgery, officials told the network part of the expenses will be paid for by the family's medical insurance.

"In one case officers allegedly bought teenager alcohol to encourage him to own up to burglaries . By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 6:23 PM on 1st November 2011 . Police are boosting their detection rates by getting offenders to confess to other crimes, figures suggest. Convicted criminals asked for a total of almost 69,000 crimes to be 'taken into consideration' in England, Wales and Northern Ireland last year, statistics disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act showed. The offences can then be wiped off the slate, and they cannot be prosecuted for them at a later date. But the practice also allows police to . record the crimes as solved, improving the clear-up rates on which their . performance is measured. TIC: Defendants gain credit in court for putting their hands up to other crimes and offences can be wiped off the slate so they cannot be prosecuted for them . The figures obtained by BBC Radio 4's Law in Action exclude Greater Manchester Police and British Transport Police, as no details were provided. The TIC system does not operate in Scotland. A total of 68,976 crimes were recorded as 'taken into consideration' last year - almost 6 per cent of all crimes cleared up by police. TICs accounted for 35 per cent of all detected burglaries and 25 per cent of detected car crimes. One suspect arrested in London by the Metropolitan Police asked for 404 crimes - mostly burglaries - to be taken into consideration. Highest TIC rate was in South Yorkshire, where 19 per cent of detected crimes were solved this way, while the lowest levels were in Gwent and the Police Service of Northern Ireland where the rate was 0.5 per cent. Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has carried out various inquiries in the past six years into . allegations police encouraged suspects to admit crimes by offering them . inducements. It said the . abuses found tended to be characterised by officers offering 'low-level' inducements, such as the use of a phone call to family and partners, . 'bumping' into family and friends while being driven around, home visits . and inducements in the form of meals or drinks. A total of 68,976 crimes were recorded as 'taken into consideration' last year - almost six per cent of all crimes cleared up by police . In one case currently ongoing, two South Wales Police officers are alleged to have bought a Cardiff teenager alcohol to encourage him to own up to burglaries. Sean Wall's lawyer claimed . detectives gave his 'vulnerable' client two litres of cider and took . him on a 'drive around' questioning him about burglaries at different . houses. Nadeem Majid told the BBC last year: 'This was a . vulnerable young man who was taken from what one would say is safe . hands in custody and made to admit offences that he could have . never had committed.' Mr Majid claims his client could not have committed some of the crimes he admitted to as he was in custody at the time. The IPCC told MailOnline it was investigating the allegations and a gross misconduct hearing will be held early next year. It said the IPCC also looked at whether what happened to Mr Wall . was indicative of a wider systemic abuse by South Wales Police officers . and found no evidence of this. The IPCC said a separate investigation into the Metropolitan Police's use of TIC's resulted in the dismissal of one detective constable and a police constable receiving a final written warning. The officers had taken a prisoner from HMP Wormwood Scrubs for interview in 2009 about a large number of thefts from cars in the Hounslow area between 2004 and 2005. The officers had been informed by the prison liason officer that she had information suggesting the prisoner was planning to obtain drugs and mobile phones while out of prison. On his return, prison staff searched him and found two mobile phones, three SIM cards and an adapted USB cable on his body. The three officers admitted that they allowed the prisoner an unauthorised escorted visit to his family before being returned to jail.","Almost 6% of crimes were 'taken into consideration' last year .

A gypsy family squatting in a Premier League football team's car park has cost taxpayers £120,000 after the local council agreed to build them a toilet block and hire a liaison officer. The family-of-five moved their two caravans into the car park used by Swansea City for big matches seven years ago and have refused to budge. They have set up picket fences and even scrawled a Keep Out warning on a large boulder placed outside the site. Expensive: Taxpayers have been forced to spend £120,000 on . services for a single gypsy family who set up an illegal site in Premier . League side Swansea City's car park . Now the cash-strapped local council . is being forced to pay £90,000 for a toilet block next to their caravans, plus an additional £30,000-a-year for a traveller liaison officer. Since March more than £3,000 of taxpayers’ cash has also been spent cleaning human excrement off the land. Neighbours living near the car park next to the club's Liberty Stadium are furious at the 'waste of money' just for one family. Father-of-three Peter Jones, 42, said: 'This is the Liberty Stadium - but it is the gypsies who are taking a liberty with our money. Warning: The traveller family has scrawled 'Keep Out' on a boulder placed outside the site . 'It is just ridiculous that the . council is being forced to fork out all this money just because these . people won’t get their caravans out of the car park.' Traveller Kieran Joyce and his family moved into the car park seven years ago. In 2009, the Joyce family won a court battle for the right to stay on the land while the council found a permanent site. Swansea Council was contacted by Children’s Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler after receiving a letter from one of the traveller children - about the lack of toilets. He instructed the authority to build toilets on the site at a cost of £90,000.But local people say the car park in now a 'filthy no-go zone'. Councillor Dennis James said: 'A lot of people are afraid of what happened in Essex at Dale Farm. People are saying if they see this site, the Essex travellers could come here. 'There is excrement everywhere. This was a lovely area for walking but people won’t walk there now.' Ground: The illegal traveller site is next to Swansea's Liberty Stadium used by Swansea City FC and the Ospreys rugby team . The blitz unearthed 54 tonnes of waste - more than four tonnes of recycled material and 106 tyres. The clean-up cost a further £6,100. A council spokesman confirmed it was installing the toilet block and appointed the traveller liaison officer to help tackle the problems. He said: 'We are in the process of arranging the installation of amenities such as toilets and running water for one family. 'We hope to complete this work by the end of 2011. 'The site has been subject to continued fly-tipping which is blighting the area and requires clearance at a cost to the council. 'Our aim is to clear the site, make it secure and enable the park and ride site to be reopened.'

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 12:22 PM on 2nd November 2011 . Billions of pounds of investment in Britain's mobile phone network seems to have been wasted as one in four people still have very poor or no access to 3G services. Half of the population now owns a smartphone, which rely on faster services for internet and e-mail, but a study by communications watchdog Ofcom has found that vast swathes of the UK lack adequate coverage to make them work properly. A new study also reveals only 13 per cent of Britain is covered by all the major networks, which means 7.7million UK homes or businesses do not have a choice of all five 3G mobile companies. In a matching map, areas with best coverage are shaded green, while those with the worst are red, and the fact that large parts of the UK are scarlet shows the poor services many receive. 3G coverage by premises: Ofcom has revealed the level of poor service British mobile users are receiving despite billions in investment. Green denotes the best coverage while red shows the worst . Mobile phone companies like Vodafone, T-Mobile, Orange, O2 and 3 have to provide coverage in 80 per cent of the UK, but it seems that they are concentrating on profitable urban areas and pushing aside rural Britain. 'Mobile providers tend to prioritise investment in network infrastructure where the maximum number of consumers and businesses can be served,' an Ofcom spokesman said. Last year, T-Mobile and 3 together invested £400million in upgrading their 3G capability, and both spent millions more this year. Figures show that by 2009, O2 had already spent more than £500million on network upgrades - and then announced it would invest 'hundreds of millions of pounds' more in the coming years increasing speeds and coverage. Meanwhile, Orange has claimed it spends £1.5million a day on upgrading its network, which is around £500million per year since at least 2008. They have also reportedly invested huge sums in developing smartphone technology themselves. Using data supplied by communications companies, the regulator split the UK into 200 areas and ranked them according to how well they were served. Struggle: Around half of Britons now have a smartphone like the iPhone, pictured, but millions do not have the coverage needed to use it properly . The worst-hit areas are mid-Wales and the Highlands of Scotland while London comes out best. The measurements were taken outside and critics think that the situation indoors could be even worse. Bob Warner, chairman of the Communications Consumer Panel, said 'Ofcom quotes figures for outdoor mobile coverage of buildings and UK geography, but what also matters to most mobile users is the coverage that they get when they're at home or at work.

Householders in Benfleet, Essex, received the news that they would no longer be receiving mail on Saturday - in the post. The notification letters said the uneven road surfaces presented an 'unacceptable risk' and this was their last delivery. Royal Mail bosses are worried that postmen could fall off their bikes. Non-delivery: Postmen in Essex have been ordered to boycott homes on 'unmade roads', such as Catherine Road (pictured) because of health and safety fears . The move means some residents must make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office. Doreen and Meredith Chatterton, aged 88 and 89, of Catherine Road in Benfleet are among those who have been told that the post they received on Saturday was their last. Mrs Chatterton said: 'Royal Mail has said it's not delivering any mail at all to the unmade roads, and there's quite a lot in this area. 'We all had the letter from Royal Mail on Saturday and it starts now so we didn't even get any warning.' The letter stated there had been 'on several occasions a number of near miss accidents' which prompted a health and safety review that found an 'unacceptable risk' for delivery to homes on unmade roads. But the couple have lived on the road since 1969 and said it had never been a problem before. Mrs Chatterton said: 'What they could do is park in Clarence Road and walk a couple of minutes down the footpath. That's how they used to deliver the mail in the old days.' Mrs Chatterton said they would now be forced to travel 25 minutes each way to the sorting office to collect their post. She said: 'We don't want to be doing that every day, especially with winter coming.' Lack of vans? The move means some residents must now make a return journey of almost an hour to collect their post from the sorting office . John Baxter, 66, who also lives on Catherine Road, said: 'The letter arrived on Saturday and said this is your last post. All of a sudden they've brought in these changes overnight. 'It's got to be a cost-cutting measure and taking vans off the route and someone's going to lose their job.' Sheila Stainer has lived in Thundersley Park Road for 30 years and said she will struggle to get to the sorting office because of a spinal disability. She said: 'The roads are not made up because we're on greenbelt, but I've never known one person to fall off their bike or slip on the road. 'They've done it without consultation from everyone or anyone.' Mel South, 60, of Wensley Road has already submitted an initial stage one appeal against the ban. In his appeal letter, he wrote: 'I am a trained manager in both health and safety and the preparation of risk assessments so I am aware that you must have an accident record log which I request site of. 'Should you not be able to re-instate deliveries this will be essential at future stages, especially if the residents enlist professional help.' Royal Mail has three months to respond to the initial appeal, before it can move to stage two and three appeals. Residents in Bower Road and Rhoda Road have also been affected. Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said the decision to suspend deliveries is a temporary measure. She said: 'We have reluctantly decided to temporarily suspend deliveries to a number of addresses in a particular part of Benfleet. 'This is because the private, unpaved roads in the area are in a poor state of repair. 'That poor state of repair has meant some of our vehicles have been damaged and there have been some near accidents for our postmen and women. 'It is the responsibility of the residents to ensure that private roads are fit for purpose and do not constitute a safety risk. This is far from being a trivial matter and we will not compromise on the safety of our colleagues or the roadworthiness of our vehicles.'","Uneven road surfaces present an 'unacceptable risk'

"Pay out for chief executive Sanjay Jha, 48, who has held the role since January . Motorola to cut 800 jobs by the end of the year . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:57 AM on 2nd November 2011 . The CEO of Motorola is in line for a $65 million bonus following the company's merger with Google. Sanjay Jha, 48, was named chief executive of the cell phone company in January after being brought in to salvage a business that lost $4.3 billion between 2007 and 2009. Mr Jha's huge windfall comes a day after it was revealed that Eugene M Isenberg, 81, chairman and  chief executive of . oil-drilling company Nabors Industries . Ltd, will receive a $100 million pay out - even though he isn't leaving the company. Bonus time: CEO Sanjay Jha is in line for a $65 million windfall despite his company Motorola Mobility recently announcing the loss of 800 jobs worldwide . Shareholders have been left furious as Mr Isenberg's gilded exit is worth more than the entire company made in his last quarter as CEO. Brandon Rees, deputy director for the AFL-CIO’s office of investment, which owns Nabors shares told Fuelfix.com: 'It defies logic. We’re baffled by what the board of directors was thinking in negotiating such an agreement for a CEO who is of retirement age. 'Nabors will continue to be a focus of shareholder discontent.' In the case of Mr Jha, the deal is likely to be less controversial with investors because mergers often increase share prices. In the Motorola deal, stock and stock options account for more than $52 million of Mr Jha's potential payout, according to the Wall Street Journal. The chief executive's pay packet topped $13 million last year. The firm also recently announced the loss of 800 jobs worldwide before the end of the year. Motorola did not comment to MailOnline. Sanjay Jha was born in the city of . Sultanganj, India and studied engineering at the University of . Strathclyde in Scotland followed by the University of Liverpool. He worked at San Diego-based Qualcomm . for 14 years. When he left, he was president of the wireless giant’s . chip set division and chief operating officer. The . multi-millionaire married in 1991 and lives in San Diego with his wife . and three sons but commutes to Motorola’s Chicago headquarters during . the week. Sweet deal: Eugene M Isenberg, 81, who lives in Palm Beach, walks away with $100 million in severance pay from oil company Nabors but will stay on as chairman . It was announced last week that oil company boss Mr Isenberg would be promoting his second in command, 57-year-old Anthony G. Petrello, to CEO of the Bermuda-based company, but . that he would also remain in his job as chairman. The power shift means that a clause in Mr Isenberg's employment contract will give him $100 million. The amount is less than he was originally entitled to, $264 million, after shareholders complained several years ago about the exorbitant sum. Mr Isenberg, who is already worth $750 million, would not have been entitled to the payout had he retired or resigned. The 81-year-old lives in Palm Beach, . Florida and has commuted to the company's operational headquarters in . Austin, Texas. He also has homes in New York and Martha's Vineyard. The company has refused to comment to MailOnline on when Mr Isenberg will receive his payout. Slick: The headquarters of Nabors Industries Ltd in Austin, Texas . In 2009, the Corporate Library listed Mr Isenberg as one of the highest paid, worst performing U.S. executives. In 2011, Nabors stock fell 19 per cent. In a statement on his company's website, Mr Isenberg said: 'I have complete . confidence that Tony is the right person to take over as CEO. 'We have . worked closely together for 20 years, and he has a deep knowledge of the . Company's operations and strategy. 'He is well positioned to lead the . Company as CEO moving forward. I believe the Company's brightest and . most successful days are ahead of it.' Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, told the Wall Street Journal: 'I think shareholders will have some issues. 'From an outside standpoint this doesn't seem to be a severance event.' Eugene Isenberg has been in charge of Nabors since 1987 when the company, which was started in Alaska, was coming back from bankruptcy. He began his career at another oil and gas company Exxon and was formerly head of a steel trading company Genimar Inc. He has served as Governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers from 1998 to 2006 and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) until 2005. He is also the President of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Foundation and a major donor to the college where he was once a student. His successor Anthony Petrello, who attended Harvard law school, has been on the board of directors at Nabors since 1991. Last year, the company had a net income of $300 million. The Nabors companies own 491 land drilling rigs . and 749 well-servicing rigs in the U.S and participate in most of the significant oil and gas markets in the world. Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules concerning shareholder approval of compensation for company executives and so-called 'golden parachute' arrangements. From January 2011, the new rules say that 'say-on-pay' votes for shareholders must take place every three years. However the SEC also adopted a temporary exemption for smaller companies which will not be required to abide by the voting rules until 2013.","Pay out for chief executive Sanjay Jha, 48, who has held the role since January .

Michael Jackson's doctor was on the phone to his mistress at around the time the King of Pop stopped breathing, jurors in the Conrad Murray trial heard today. Cocktail waitress Sade Anding revealed that Murray suddenly broke off from their call and she couldn't get back in touch with him. Prosecutors claim the 11.51am call on June 25, 2009 was interrupted because the doctor had discovered Jackson's heart had stopped - but nobody called for an ambulance until 12.21pm. Scroll down for video . Call interrupted: Prosecution witness Sade Anding said Dr Conrad Murray was on the phone to her just before 12pm on the day Michael Jackson died . Forlorn: Murray looked despondent as girlfriend after girlfriend was put before the jury .

Live-in partner: Miss Alvarez, 29, said she has been living with 58-year-old Murray for the last three to four years and had a son with him in March, 2009 . Met Jacko: The actress said Murray took her along to meet Jackson at his Los Angeles mansion and the star took a special interest in her baby son . Miss Anding was one of a procession of Murray's girlfriends - including a stripper and his current live-in partner and mother of his two-year-old son - who testified at Los Angeles Superior Court. She said she first met Murray at a Houston, Texas, restaurant and was chatting about her day to the doctor when she realised he was no longer listening. 'I heard mumbling sounds and coughing and voice. I kept saying, hello, hello, are you there? But I didn't get any reply,' she added. Earlier that morning, Murray also left a message on the phone of Michelle Bella, an exotic dancer he met in Las Vegas the previous year, the court heard. And jurors heard from another ex-girlfriend, Bridget Morgan, who testified that she called Murray earlier on the morning of the day Jackson died, but she said that he didn't pick up. The court was told that Murray, 58, was on the phone for 46 minutes of the hour before Jackson died while prosecutors claim he should have been caring for Jackson. Murray has pleaded no guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering Jackson, then 50, with a fatal dose of the hospital anaesthetic Propofol. The prosecution claims the stream of . phone calls to his girlfriends diverted the doctor at a crucial time . when he should have been at the singer's side. Murray . was also on the phone to his current girlfriend, Nicole Alvarez, at . 1.08pm when he was travelling in the ambulance with Jackson to the . hospital, still pushing paramedics to try and revive the lifeless . entertainer. 'I . remember him telling me that he was on the way to the hospital with Mr . Jackson and for me not to be alarmed. He didn't want me to be worried . because he knew I would hear through the news and I would be upset,' she . said. Murray went on to call Miss Alvarez four more times through the afternoon. Miss Alvarez, 29, said she has been living with Murray for the last three to four years and had a son with him in March, 2009. Prosecutors today put four of Dr Conrad Murray's girlfriends in front of the jury in an effort to establish the exact timeline of the 58-year-old's actions the day Jackon died. Nicole Alvarez - the actress and mother to Murray's two-year-old son said he called her while in the ambulance on route to hospital . Sade Anding - cocktail waitress who met Murray in Houston was on the phone to him when Michael Jackson's heart stopped . Michelle Bella - exotic dancer Murray met in Las Vegas last year said he called her earlier in the morning and left a message . Bridget Morgan - a former girlfriend who rang Murray on the morning of Jackson's death but he did not pick up . The . actress said Murray took her along to meet Jackson at his Los Angeles . mansion and the star took a special interest in her baby son. 'I first met him in 2008. It was a . surprise and I was speechless. Michael was very excited about the . pregnancy. He wanted to schedule visits so he could see my son and I . went to see him one of two times during the day and once in the . evening,' she added. Miss . Alvarez said Murray paid the $2,300 rent on her Santa Monica, . California, apartment. While he was working at nights caring for . Jackson, his girlfriend said she was 'maintaining my instrument' to look . for acting jobs in Hollywood. She confirmed receiving a series of . packages at her apartment in the months before the star's death. Prosecutors have told the court they were shipments of Propofol, but . Miss Alvarez denied any knowledge of what was in the packages. Miss Alvarez said after April 2009, Murray would frequently leave her . apartment at night and return early the next day.

Morale among engineers at Twitter has become low as the micro blogging site is struggling to define itself and justify its huge valuation, an insider has claimed. The mood among employees at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco is said to have dropped as pressure intensifies on the company to become more profitable before the technology bubble bursts. Twitter now boasts a valuation of $8 billion, but industry experts have noted that the social network 'is still trying to figure out what it is', with disillusionment said to have crept in among staff. Mood change: Morale is said to have dropped at Twitter's San Francisco office as the site struggles to define itself . The micro blogging site is 'still trying to sort out its product problems', according to one expert. Morale is said to have become low among engineers who are disappointed the company has not innovated enough or introduced more new features. Recent figures suggest that Twitter now has up to 100 million users worldwide, sending 230 million 'tweets' a day.

While Twitter can boast a huge fanbase, it still lags behind the 750 million users of Facebook worldwide, and is now facing competition from Google+, which has an estimated user base of 30 million. According to Joe Hagan, of New York magazine, an analysis of the company showed that there is mounting pressure to make Twitter more profitable. Bosses are also keen to address the gap in people who sign up to the site but do not actively tweet themselves. As a medium so popular with hundreds of celebrities round the world, many people sign up to Twitter just so they can keep tabs on their favourite stars, rather than actually tweet themselves. Recent analysis suggests as many as 40 per cent of Twitter users don't actively tweet. Hagan's article states: 'The intense . pressure to convert Twitter into a profitable business, and before a . tech bubble pops, is palpable here. 'And it’s happening as the company . struggles with an interlocked set of existential questions, starting . with the most basic one possible: What is Twitter?'

Mr Hagan's article goes on to state . that in terms of audience, talent and advertisers, Twitter is not . 'anywhere near' where it should be.

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 6:25 PM on 1st November 2011 . Doctors are having to be ordered to ensure the elderly do not go hungry or thirsty on NHS wards. The General Medical Council has drawn up new guidelines reminding them that their care does not begin and end with providing clinical treatment. They are urged to be ‘guardians of patient safety’ and take the lead whenever there is a risk that dignity or comfort are being compromised. Responsibilities: The General Medical Council has drawn up new guidelines to urge doctors to be 'guardians of patient safety'. (Picture posed by models) But campaigners say it is ‘very worrying’ that doctors need to be instructed about their basic duties such as ensuring patients are helped to eat, drink or go to the lavatory. There is growing concern that the elderly are routinely neglected in hospitals. Earlier this month a highly critical report by the Care Quality Commission watchdog found that half of hospitals were failing to ensure patients did not become malnourished or dehydrated. Some patients were not given anything to drink for more than ten hours. On some wards inspectors saw patients banging their bed rails to try to attract attention of medical staff, and in many hospitals the elderly were routinely forced to undergo the indignity of using commodes next to their beds because staff were too busy to take them to the lavatory. The guidelines tell doctors they have a duty to take ‘prompt action’ whenever there are ‘problems with basic care for patients who are unable to drink, feed or clean themselves’. A doctor found to be in breach of them could be hauled in front of a GMC panel and in extreme cases struck off. Niall . Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: ‘The shocking neglect of . vulnerable and elderly patients revealed by recent reports shows that . health professionals have to do more to ensure that every patient gets . the quality of care he or she should receive, and is treated with . respect. ‘Our current . guidance already sets out a doctor’s duty to raise concerns where they . feel that patient safety is at risk. We wanted to make it even clearer . that doctors have a leading role to take prompt action if they identify . problems. ‘This applies not . just to clinical care, but in making sure their patients are getting all . the help they need to eat, drink and wash. Doctors have to be the . guardians of patient safety.’ The . rules are to be added to the GMC’s Good Medical Practice, a handbook . for doctors. They are included in a draft version published yesterday . which will be reviewed by senior doctors, healthcare workers and patient . groups before the final version is published next year. Prompt action: A recent report found half of hospitals were failing to ensure patients were not becoming malnourished and dehydrated. (Posed by models) But Joyce Robbins of Patient Concern said: ‘It’s terrifying that such guidance should be needed. What we would like to see is the GMC taking strict action against those doctors in charge of patients who are being neglected.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said such guidelines ‘should be part of the norm’. ‘Doctors should see a patient as a human and whatever their need they should be able to provide it,’ she said. ‘It should be as much a doctor’s responsibility as any other member of staff. ‘Their duties go beyond clinical care and include dignity and respect. It’s surprising and worrying that doctors need to be reminded.’ The guidelines also urge GPs to encourage patients to go back to work if they have been off sick for long periods. They state that they may have to ‘encourage patients to stay in or return to employment or other purposeful activity’. The Daily Mail has long called for an end to the neglect of patients in old age as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last year we launched a separate campaign with the Patients Association to highlight poor care on NHS wards. Our coverage helped prompt the Government to order the Care Quality Commission to carry out spot-checks of hospitals to see if elderly were properly fed and treated with dignity.","Half of hospitals failing to ensure patients were not becoming dehydrated or malnourished, report warns .

Campaigners are trying to cut the annual toll of deaths and injuries caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, which saw 4,000 Britons treated in hospital last year alone. Experts warned that carbon monoxide poisoning, which killed at least 50 in the UK last year, is often unrecognised because its early symptoms can be easily mistaken for tiredness, flu or food poisoning. Faulty boilers are one of the most common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning . Christine McGourty of Carbon Monoxide - Be Alarmed! said: 'We are urging people to go out and buy an alarm now - but there are also two simple steps we'd like the Government to take. 'Firstly, building regulations should be amended so that new homes come with alarms already installed. Secondly, providing an alarm should be part of a landlord's annual gas safety inspection.' Inhaling carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leaving the body's organs and cells starved of oxygen.  It can lead to severe confusion, coma and death. Early symptoms such as nausea, stomach cramps and dizziness are often mistaken for flu or food poisoning. However, carbon monoxide does not cause a high temperature. The gas has no colour, taste or smell the only effective way to detect it is with an audible alarm. Carbon monoxide is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, charcoal, coal and wood do not burn fully. The most common cause of this is when appliances such as a boiler or cooker is installed incorrectly or is poorly maintained. Carbon monoxide can also build up when flues, chimneys or vents are blocked. Alarms are available from many DIY . stores, supermarkets, high street shops or directly from energy . suppliers. They can cost as little as £15 and many retailers will be . offering special discounts in support of the campaign. Research . carried out last month found that 63% of UK homes do not have a carbon . monoxide alarm and 78% of people do not know that the gas can kill. The poll of 2,001 adults was conducted by ICM, on September 26 and 27. Zonera Rehman, an HR advisor from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, said a carbon monoxide leak in her home put her whole family in grave danger, earlier this year... We could have died: Zonera with her husband and two sons. They already had their boiler checked each year but didn't have a carbon monoxide alarm . Mrs Rehman, 30, said: 'It was the school Easter holidays and we had just returned from a week away in Stoke on Trent when my husband and our two boys - Zachariah (4) and Zain (2) first started to feel unwell. 'It had been a really hectic week and we had done a lot of travelling so when we all started to feel  tired, at first we simply put it down to normal fatigue.  But then the tiredness became much more severe - at one stage I could hardly keep my head up I was so drowsy, and my four year old son who is usually full of beans was sleeping all the time. 'My husband, who is really fit and active, was napping in the day, something I had never known him to do. I would never describe us as a ‘couch potato family’, so when things hadn’t changed after four days, we realised that something was up. 'It was my husband who first thought about the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning, and on a hunch he bought an alarm. When we turned it on, the alarm went off immediately and kept going off. 'Despite this, we still didn’t quite believe it as we had no problems with our heating or water. My husband decided to buy another  alarm – one that showed carbon monoxide levels so we could be absolutely sure. 'When this showed really high levels, we immediately called the gas board and a plumber.  The gas man turned off the gas and when the plumber arrived he tested the levels of carbon monoxide in our home. Normal levels are around 10 - our levels were above 200. Life savers: Campaigners have urged more homeowners to install carbon monoxide alarms after it was revealed one in five don't realise it can kill . 'It was a fault with our boiler than had caused the carbon monoxide leak. We did all the right things and got our boiler checked every year, so it just goes to show you can never be sure you are safe unless you have an alarm. 'After we realised what the problem was we evacuated our home and stayed at my mother in laws. After a week, we returned home.  We now have two carbon monoxide alarms, which we test almost every day. 'I feel so lucky that we are all alive. It was unusual for all four of us  to be home together for that amount of time – if it wasn’t the school holidays it is likely we wouldn’t have realised what the problem was in time. 'The doctor told us there was high change we could have all died in our sleep. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t think about what could have happened. 'The fact that  the highest levels of carbon monoxide were found in my oldest son’s bedroom still sends shivers down my spine. The thought that I was so close to losing a child will haunt me forever.'

The war between Apple and Samsung shows no sign of abating, as the release date of iPhone 5 rumbles ever closer (albeit without confirmation from Apple itself) - and many of Samsung's products remain paralysed in legal limbo by Apple lawsuits. Now it seems Samsung is going to strike back. 'We'll be pursuing our rights for this in a more aggressive way from now on,' Lee Younghee, head of global marketing for the company's mobile division said this week. Younghee also said that Apple was 'free riding' on Samsung wireless technologies - lending credibility to rumours that Samsung would attempt to torpedo iPhone 5 before its European launch. Too similar? Samsung's Galaxy touchscreens and iPhone are currently the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries . Ever since Apple launched its iPhone, . it's been an open secret that Samsung makes many of the components . inside it - in fact Samsung's CEO has admitted, 'Apple is our biggest . customer.' But ever since Samsung launched its . own Galaxy series of phones and tablets - high-powered touchscreens . whose flagship, the Galaxy S II, currently outpaces iPhone on the . processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine . countries. A Samsung executive told the Korea . Times this week, 'When the iPhone 5 arrives here, Samsung plans to take Apple to . court here for its violation of Samsung's wireless technology related . patents.' This is in . response to Apple's continued legal action against Samsung's Galaxy . family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are . currently illegal in Europe, thanks to Apple lawsuits claiming they are 'slavish' copies of iPhone and iPad. Samsung recently overtook Nokia in . the smartphone market, and its Galaxy S II offers a larger screen and . faster processor than iPhone 4 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs. This month, Apple even forced Samsung to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a Berlin electronics show. Samsung's larger Galaxy 10.1 tablet remains illegal in Europe thanks to Apple's legal action. The Maeil Business Newspaper reported that the South Korean firm may seek an injunction against Apple's new iPhone in Europe. Samsung said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues. Legal battle rages between Apple and Samsung over alleged 'similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets . The two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as Google and Microsoft. The latest attacks come after Apple successfully blocked Samsung from selling its latest tablets in Germany and some smartphone models in the Netherlands and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in Australia. After Apple's latest legal victory in Germany earlier this month, Samsung said it would take all available legal options. Apple first sued Samsung in April, claiming its strongest competitor had 'slavishly' copied its product designs, and Samsung had since counter-sued, arguing Apple infringed on its mobile technologies.","Samsung 'will be more aggressive' from now on .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 7:09 PM on 4th October 2011 . A Nigerian man accused of trying to . bring down an international jetliner with a bomb in his underwear . walked into the start of his federal trial today and declared that a . radical Islamic cleric killed by the U.S. military is alive. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's outburst came as jury selection got under way for his federal terror trial in Detroit, where the 24-year-old is acting as his own attorney and has previously told reporters they should stop reporting that Osama bin Laden was dead. 'Anwar is alive,' Abdulmutallab . said today, referring to American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who . was killed last week by a joint CIA-U.S. military air strike in Yemen. Outburst: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab claimed his 'mentor' American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed last week in Yemen, is not dead . 'The mujahadeen will wipe out the U.S. — the cancer U.S.,' he added. Abdulmutallab, . a well-educated Nigerian from an upper-class family, was directed in . the attack by al-Awlaki and wanted to become a martyr when he boarded . Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam a Christmas 2009, according . to the government. Abdulmutallab, . who complained loudly at a previous hearing about having to wear prison . clothes, came into the courtroom today wearing an oversized prison . T-shirt. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds called a brief recess to . allow him to change into clothes more appropriate for court, after . acknowledging and denying his apparent request to wear a 'Yemeni belt . with a dagger.' The judge has denied several of Adulmutallab's requests for the trial, including that the case be judged under Islamic law. Abdulmutallab . has pleaded not guilty to eight charges, including conspiracy to commit . terrorism and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Bomb in his underpants: The slightly charred and singed underpants, allegedly worn by Abdulmutallab, with a packet of explosive powder sewn into the crotch is seen in government photos . Moment of arrest: Alleged plane bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab being taken into custody on board Delta/Northwest Airlines Flight 253 . The . government says he wanted to blow up the plane by detonating chemicals . in his underwear, just seven minutes before the jet carrying 279 . passengers and a crew of 11 was to land at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. But the bomb didn't work, and passengers assisted by crew members saw flames and pounced on Abdulmutallab. The . failed suicide attack, the first act of terrorism in the U.S. during . the Obama administration, revealed the rise of a dangerous al-Qaida . affiliate and al-Awlaki's growing influence. The . government says Abdulmutallab willingly explained the plot twice, first . to U.S. border officers who took him off the plane and then in more . detail to FBI agents who interviewed him at a hospital for 50 minutes, . following treatment for serious burns to his groin. Abdulmutallab . told authorities he trained in Yemen, home base for Al-Qaida in the . Arabian Peninsula. He said he was influenced by al-Awlaki, who was . killed Friday by an air strike that President Barack Obama called a 'major blow' to al-Qaida's most dangerous franchise. Good upbringing: Abdulmutallab, a well-educated Nigerian from an upper-class family, was directed in the attack by al-Awlaki . Following . the strike, a U.S. official outlined new details of al-Awlaki's . involvement against the U.S., including Abdulmutallab's alleged mission. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss . intelligence matters, said al-Awlaki specifically directed Abdulmutallab . to detonate an explosive device over U.S. airspace to maximise . casualties. Osama bin Laden . appeared in a video declaring Abdulmutallab a 'hero.' Abdulmutallab . also has been lauded by al-Qaida's English-language Web magazine . Inspire, whose editor was killed along with al-Awlaki. After . the outburst about al-Awlaki and flap over Abdulmutallab's clothes, . jury selection got under way in earnest, with most questioning done by . the judge and attorney Anthony Chambers, who has been appointed to . assist Abdulmutallab. Abdulmutallab, . who had suggested he would interview some prospective jurors and could . give his own opening statement, calmly questioned one woman who . indicated she had concerns about retaliation for serving on the jury. The woman remained in the jury pool, but several others were immediately dismissed after saying they could not be impartial.","Nigerian 24-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab also called America a 'cancer'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 8:23 PM on 1st November 2011 . A Republican group has been forced to apologise after being accused of going too far with a Halloween email which featured a zombie President Obama with a bullet hole in his head. The email got the attention of the Secret Service after a Virginia GOP committee used it to scare up interest in Halloween political activities. The montage, a banner on a mass email to Loudoun Republicans, mingles seasonal images including a jack-o-lantern, a disfigured U.S. Rep Nancy Pelosi and a throng of flesh-hungry zombie Obama supporters. Undead: This email, featuring an image of a zombie President Obama with a bullet in his head got the attention of the Secret Service after a Virginia GOP committee used it to scare up interest in Halloween political activities . The image of a rotting, undead Obama with a bleeding, large-caliber hole an inch above his right eye prompted Democrats to cry foul and Virginia's Republican governor to denounce it as 'shameful and offensive.' 'This is a disgusting and violent portrayal of the president of the United States,' said Democratic Party of Virginia spokesman Brian Coy. After Virginia officials from both parties condemned the email, Loudoun County GOP Chairman Mark Sell was forced to apologise. 'The Loudoun County Republican . Committee yesterday sent an email to its members that represented a . light-hearted attempt to inject satire humor into the Halloween . holiday,' he said in a statement. Apology: Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell called on the Loudoun GOP to 'apologize for their actions, and to immediately ensure that such imagery is never used again' 'Apparently, some individuals have . interpreted an image of Barack Obama that appeared within the email as . intending to portray the president as a victim of a violent crime. 'Nothing could be further from the . truth, and we deeply and sincerely apologise to the president and anyone . who viewed the image if that was the impression that was left.' He said his group 'deplores any . effort to display, suggest or promote violence against the president or . any other political figure.' The statement came after Gov Bob . McDonnell, through spokesman J. Tucker Martin, called on the Loudoun GOP . to 'apologise for their actions, and to immediately ensure that such . imagery is never used again.' Virginia GOP Chairman Pat Mullins said such an image 'has no place in our politics. Ever.' The image was first reported in a post on Monday on the conservative northern Virginia blog, Too Conservative. The . post's author, identified as a 'Loudoun Insider,' said he's no Obama . fan, 'but putting up a photo of him as a zombie with a bullet hole in . his head?' 'Someone should . send this to the US Secret Service,' the blog post concluded. The Secret . Service is in charge of the president's security. 'We are aware of the situation,' said George Ogilvie, a Secret Service spokesman in Washington. No laughing matter: The Loudon GOP offered an apology to President Obama for the image . The . picture by the Loudoun GOP is the red, white and blue image of Obama . gazing upward that, emblazoned with the caption 'HOPE,' became a . ubiquitous Obama poster during his 2008 campaign. It . was created from a copyrighted AP photo taken in 2006 when Obama was a . U.S. senator appearing at the National Press Club in Washington. The AP sued over the unlicensed, uncredited and uncompensated use of its photo. The litigation was settled earlier this year.","Political campaign described as 'shameful and offensive'

"By . Sara Nathan . Last updated at 12:11 PM on 2nd November 2011 . Nancy Dell-Olio is seeking the advice of lawyers as she is looking for an apology for comments made about her on the BBC show . You might have thought you’d heard the last of Nancy Dell’Olio for a while after she was voted off Strictly Come Dancing. But given her feisty reputation, she was never likely to go quietly. She has launched a war of words with Alesha Dixon after the judge described her final performance as ‘unfeminine’. Yesterday Miss Dell’Olio hit back by calling her ‘vulgar’. And she has told friends she is prepared to contact lawyers in an effort to get an official apology from Miss Dixon and the BBC. It . comes after this year’s series was blighted by accusations of producers . introducing ever more revealing costumes and vulgar routines in an . attempt to chase ratings. The . BBC has received more than 300 complaints about ex-footballer Robbie . Savage’s ‘Michael Jackson-style’ hip thrusts on Saturday’s show, which . he directed at judge Craig Revel Horwood. Many . viewers have also complained about the plunging necklines and exposed . flesh shown by contestants including One Show presenter Alex Jones, 34, . and Waterloo Road actress Chelsee Healey, 23. Miss Healey broke down in tears after . her low-cut gown slipped when she lost her footing while dancing the . tango with partner Pasha Kovalev. And . producers have been criticised for introducing a new camera which . focuses on the contestants’ cleavages as they descend or mount the set’s . stairs. Miss Dell’Olio, 50, . was widely mocked by the judges for her rumba with Anton Du Beke on . this weekend’s Halloween special, in which she wore a revealing white . and silver dress and flashed her underwear as she clambered out of a . sequined coffin. Nancy Dell'Olio  and Anton Du Beke (left) toppled out of Strictly Come Dancing - and judge Alesha Dixon ripped their performance to shreds . Miss Dixon, 33, a former winner of the show, said of the performance: ‘Nancy, I think you are a sexy woman and you know how to work it but I have to be honest – you are a walking disaster. ‘Your legs are so far apart and that’s not very feminine. You both should have stayed in the coffin!’ On BBC Breakfast yesterday, Miss Dell’Olio said the show had been left bare without her, adding: ‘It’s like a Christmas tree without the lights.’ And referring to Miss Dixon, the only female judge on the Strictly panel, she said: ‘Some of the comments, especially when something comes from a woman to another woman, she has to think about it. ‘She was not elegant, she was a little bit vulgar. There is a fine line between entertainment and then unnecessary comments.’ Host Bruce Forsyth consoles Chelsee Healey left in tears after her dress breaks during her routine . Presenter Sian Williams then interjected: ‘Alesha did say you are very  sexy…’ to which Miss Dell’Olio retorted: ‘Well everyone knows that, it’s  quite evident.’ But she admitted: ‘If you do a show like this you can’t take anything personally, you have to take a risk for entertainment.’ Seemingly joking, she added: ‘I don’t think it was personal otherwise they would be having legal action immediately from my lawyers.’ Robbie Savage performed odd pelvic-thrusting on the show, much like Michael Jackson use to do . However last night a close friend told the Daily Mail: ‘Nancy was really hurt by Alesha’s comments. ‘The way she looks is, of course, a massive part of her personality. ‘She doesn’t mind her dancing being criticised, but she took Alesha’s remarks about her legs as a massive slap in the face. 'She felt it was really nasty to be trashed in front of millions of viewers and she wants  an apology – and she’s talking to lawyers to find out the best way to get one.’ The friend added: ‘Anton is also appalled.’ Miss Dell’Olio had already been ogled by head judge Len Goodman when she danced the salsa in an earlier show, when he told her: ‘The most exciting part was when I took a crafty look up your skirt.’ Miss Dell’Olio’s spokesman said last night: ‘Nancy is now looking at her options as to how to get an apology from Alesha and the BBC.’ Yesterday Savage also hit back at criticism of his routine, writing on Twitter: ‘So some people thought it was inappropriate to do a Michael Jackson move at 7pm on a Saturday night to one of his songs! Why?’ Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The judges always look to give constructive criticism and this is often delivered with humour given that Strictly is an entertainment show. Alesha’s comments were not meant to cause any offence.’","Nancy Dell'Olio prepared to contact lawyers over Alesha Dixon's comments .

Tarnished image: Rupert Murdoch apparently told his son to step down as chairman of News International, but then changed his mind . Rupert Murdoch told his son James that he should step down as chairman of News International at the height of the phone-hacking scandal in the summer, it has been alleged. The 80-year-old media mogul apparently made the move at the instigation of his daughter, Elisabeth - but changed his mind after a sleepless night. The revelation appears in Vanity Fair's December issue, due out today. Writer Sarah Ellison - a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp - said Elisabeth initially persuaded her father to remove her brother from his top job because she thought he allowed the crisis to 'spin out of control.' Ellison also writes that Murdoch's eldest four children - James, Elisabeth, Lachlan and Prudence - have been undergoing psychological counseling over who will succeed the aging tycoon to run the media conglomerate. The article on the family's internal power struggle comes as James Murdoch, News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer and the son once tipped to inherit his father's powerful mantle, faces increasing pressure over his handling of the affair. Elisabeth Murdoch is said to have urged . her father to force her younger brother James to 'step aside' in July, . just days after the closure of the News of the World. Family feuds: James, Lachlan, Rupert and Elisabeth Murdoch - who persuaded her father to remove her brother from the top job . According to Vanity Fair, Murdoch was 'open to the idea' at first because he had been at loggerheads with his son and told him, ""Maybe you should go"".' Elisabeth also reportedly told her father that News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of The Sun and The News of the World, should resign along with the company's former chairman Les Hinton. Both stepped down a few days later. The Vanity Fair article says: 'Elisabeth blamed her brother for allowing the phone-hacking crisis to spiral out of control. After the meeting, Elisabeth approached her father and urged him to take control of the situation. 'She said Brooks and Hinton needed to resign (they eventually did) and that James needed to take a leave. Brutal honesty: Rebekah Brooks was also allegedly a target for Miss Murdoch, who apparently told her father the News Int CEO should step down . 'Rupert was open to the idea - he and James had been at odds for months. Elisabeth had been urging her father to step in. 'The next morning, Elisabeth, at her father’s suggestion, confronted James and said he should step aside and let Rupert handle the crisis moving forward. The suggestion infuriated James. 'Rupert summoned Brooks and told her she should take a leave. He called Hinton and asked him to come to London. Rupert then spoke to James and suggested that he take a leave. ‘Maybe you should go too,’ he said. But after a sleepless night he changed his mind,' added the Vanity Fair report. The article claims that in February Murdoch considered stepping down himself and grooming James to take over. 'Lachlan, Prudence and Elisabeth had discussed the move extensively with James. The siblings had been in family counselling with a psychologist over the issue of succession,' says Vanity Fair. 'They told James that if they worked together as siblings they could help him and their father have a better relationship. 'Together the siblings agreed that James was the best-suited to be the heir apparent but they also agreed he had to stop being so aggressive and alienating in his public postures.' The article also claims that Murdoch 'hated' his daughter's husband, public relations guru Matthew Freud.","Decision was encouraged by his daughter .

Wall Street markets suffered huge falls today as fears grow that Europe's plan to save the euro will unravel before it can even kick in. Greek Premier George Papandreou said he will put Greece's bailout through a referendum, throwing the long-awaited deal into disarray. Financial markets around the world tumbled in reaction to the shock announcement today and U.S. stocks fell by up to three per cent. Worrying times: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange before the closing bell on Tuesday . Down: James Maguire, left, and Christopher Culhane, right, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . The Dow Jones closed down 295 points, or 2.5 per cent, at 11,660; the S&P 500 was down 35 points, or 2.8 per cent, at 1,218; and the Nasdaq was down 77 points, or 2.9 per cent, at 2,607. Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy called a crisis meeting and agreed the Greek decision has made it more necessary than ever to push forward with plans thrashed out during last week's EU summit. The German and French leaders will meet with the Greek government, the IMF and their European partners tomorrow in Cannes, ahead of a G20 summit, to push forward support for their view. Meanwhile following a surprise meeting of the cabinet, the beleaguered Greek government shocked its nation again by sacking all of its defence chiefs for no clear reason. ‘The market did not see this Greek referendum coming, which is potentially a killer,’ said investment strategist Paul Mendelsohn. ‘It could knock the wheels off the bus of the whole (Europe rescue) plan.’ The FTSE in Britain fell two per cent, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC-40 both plunged by a worrying five per cent in trading on Tuesday. Hard at work: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as the Dow Jones opened 250 points down .

'The market did not see this Greek referendum coming, which is potentially a killer. It could knock the wheels off the bus of the whole (Europe rescue) plan' Paul MendelsohnVermont investment strategist . The falls were due to lower European demand, reinforcing fears the euro zone's debt troubles were sapping global growth. China's factory activity last month was . its slowest since February 2009 - an unexpected decline that reflected a . drop in new export orders. The U.S. dollar index rose 1.5 per cent. U.S. oil futures dropped 2.7 per cent and copper prices fell 3.8 per cent. Markets in Asia have also fallen with Japan's Nikkei closing with a 1.7 per cent drop and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing 2.5 per cent. Plunge: The Dow Jones closed down 295 points, or 2.5 per cent, at 11,660 . Shock: Greek Premier George Papandreou, pictured (centre) on Tuesday arriving for a cabinet meeting, said he will put Greece's bailout through a referendum, throwing the long-awaited deal into disarray . Mr Papandreou took many of his own . parliament by surprise by declaring that the hard-bargained agreement . will be put to a public ballot. It will be Greece's first referendum since 1974, when the monarchy was abolished by a landslide vote after the collapse of a military dictatorship. Mr Papandreou's decision means voters will be asked to approve a €100bn deal that would see 50 per cent of the country’s debts written off. But it would also see harsh austerity measures imposed for years to come. Demonstrators: Anti-austerity protesters shout slogans before a scheduled military parade in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki last Friday . Flow map: This graphic on the European debt crisis shows the extent of the problems for major economies . A ‘no’ vote would prove catastrophic for the EU and could prompt a disorderly default on the country’s debts and an exit from the euro. One recent poll showed that 59 per cent of Greeks think the new package is ‘negative’ or ‘probably negative’ for their country. The turmoil in Europe has also seen U.S. brokerage firm MF Global file for bankruptcy after suffering massive losses gambling on eurozone bonds. The firm was founded by sugar broker James Man in 1783 and is now led by former New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs chief Jon Corzine. George Papandreou said a referendum will be held in a ‘supreme act of democracy and of patriotism for the people to make their own decision’. His announcement that the public will be . able to vote on whether to accept the latest package is being . considered as a way to regain more popularity. A recent opinion poll suggested that 60 per cent of Greeks were against the austerity measures that have been put forward. But other surveys show broad support for remaining in the eurozone and investors are not hopeful that Mr Papandreou will be able to pull off a victory. Greece's main opposition conservatives called for Mr Papandreou's resignation, accusing him of incompetence and blackmail. The referendum is expected to be held early next year. A confidence vote in the Socialist government will also take place at the end of this week. American-born Georgios Papandreou (left) helped cement the top political post in Greece into a dynasty as he is the third member of his family to lead the country in the last 65 years, after his father and grandfather. Mr Papandreou has been leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party since February 2004 and became the 182nd prime minister of Greece in October 2009. His grandfather George Papandreou Sr had three terms, between 1944 and 1945, in 1963, and then from 1964 to 1965. While the current PM's father Andreas Papandreou (right) served two terms, from 1981 to 1989, and then from 1993 to 1996. In two separate polls, conducted in 2007 and 2010, Mr Papandreou, who was known to the public simply as 'Andreas', was voted as the best prime minister of Greece since democracy re-emerged in 1974. It is unlikely in light of recent events that his son will challenge him for this crown. Mr Papandreou was elected in a landslide victory where the country's conservatives suffered one of their worst ever general election results. On the back of a huge swell of public support and an emphatic majority he promised to reinvigorate Greece's stuttering economy by pumping in three billion euros. However it then came out that the country was in much more debt than first thought so he began to cut spending, bump-up taxes and slash public sector jobs, leading to national strikes. Fellow eurozone members also hit out at Mr Papandreou, saying he failed to manage his economy properly. This has led to poor opinion polls and a lack of parliamentary backing. In May, 77 per cent of the people asked said they had no faith in his handling of the Greek economic crisis and a month later he narrowly survived a vote of no confidence in parliament with a majority of two. His announcement that the public will be able to vote on whether to accept the latest austerity package is being considered as a way to regain more popularity. But it seems that his period in charge of the country will always be tainted by Greece's financial collapse.","Greece's George Papandreou in shock referendum call over bailout plan .

They used a video clip he shot of himself delivering a profanity-laced, racist diatribe against a group of Afghan men detained by U.S. troops. Morlock's ranting, craven appearance in the video contrasted sharply with his calm and focused demeanour in court earlier this week. He had taken the stand to paint Gibbs as the instigator behind murders of innocent villagers staged to look like legitimate combat engagements. In court: Gibbs, seated lower left, is shown as his lawyer Phil Stackhouse stands at centre, and military Judge Lieutenant Colonel Kwasi Hawks listens, at top left . Morlock was previously sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the same three killings with which Gibbs is charged. He quoted Gibbs on Monday as telling him: ‘We can get away with it. It's that easy.’ 'We can get away with it. It's that easy' Calvin Gibbs, as recounted by Jeremy Morlock in court . The court-martial caps an 18-month investigation of the most egregious case of U.S. military atrocities during 10 years of war in Afghanistan. The killings were initially exposed through a probe of rampant drug abuse among soldiers. Photos seized as evidence in the case showed Morlock, Gibbs and other soldiers posing grinning with the bodies of Afghan casualties. They have drawn comparisons to the inflammatory Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq in 2004. Sketch: Gibbs is shown in this courtroom drawing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, during his court-martial for charges of killing three Afghan civilians . Gibbs, 26, of Billings, Montana, is the highest-ranking of five men from an infantry unit charged with murdering villagers in Kandahar province. He was also charged with cutting fingers off bodies as war trophies and beating a fellow soldier who alerted superiors to hashish use in their unit. 'I think the Army needs more people who can kill people' Calvin Gibbs, as recounted by Ashton Moore in court . Seven other Stryker soldiers were charged with lesser offenses. Most already have reached plea deals and have been sentenced. One of them, Ashton Moore, convicted on drug charges, testified about a conversation between him and Gibbs . He was allegedly asked by Gibbs if he would be willing to shoot an Afghan without knowing whether he was an enemy combatant. ‘I said, “no” (and) he said, “I think the Army needs more people who can kill people”,’ Moore recalled. Testifying: Lawyers for Gibbs have been trying to discredit the prosecution's star witness, former Army Specialist Jeremy Morlock, pictured both left and right . The climax of proceedings came in testimony from former Army Specialist Adam Winfield, 23. It was about how he, Gibbs and other . troops searched a village for Taliban activity in a routine patrol last . year and found a family inside a home. 'Is this the guy?' Calvin Gibbs, as recounted by Adam Winfield in court . ‘Just an old man, his family and a bunch of kids, just a normal house, nothing going on,’ Winfield said. He recounted Gibbs gestured at the man and asked, ‘Is this the guy?’, then discussed how the man might have attacked them with a grenade. Having heard Gibbs and Morlock boast about two previous slayings, Winfield testified, he realised this was the next ‘guy to be killed.’ Gibbs then led the individual outside and around a corner. Inside: A military courtroom at Joint Base Lewis-McChord sits empty during a recess in the court-martial of Gibbs, accused of killing three Afghan civilians . ‘It was just a matter of seconds - boom, boom, boom,’ Winfield testified, adding that Gibbs ordered the others to yell, ‘Grenade, grenade!’ 'It was just a matter of seconds - boom, boom, boom' Adam Winfield . This was as he set off an actual grenade that mangled the victim's legs, then yelled at his men, ‘You guys were supposed to shoot.’ Gibbs allegedly then moved close enough to see the victim lying on the ground and ‘shot him two more times with a smile on his face.’ He then allegedly bent down and ‘pulled a tooth from the guy’ and offered it to Winfield, who said he replied, astonished, ‘I'll just get it later.’ Winfield himself pleaded guilty in August to a reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to three years in prison. Others: Adam Winfield, left,  has already been jailed for three years for involuntary manslaughter and Andrew Holmes, right, pleaded guilty to a single murder count . Picturd: A fifth soldier charged with murder in the investigation - Michael Wagnon - still faces a court-martial. He has been accused of shooting at an Afghan civilian . A fourth co-defendant charged as a member of the 5th Stryker Brigade ‘kill team,’ Andrew Holmes, pleaded guilty two months ago to one murder. ‘(He) shot him two more times with a smile on his face'Adam Winfield on Calvin Gibbs . He was sentenced to seven years in prison. The fifth soldier charged with murder, Michael Wagnon, still faces a court-martial. If convicted on all charges, Gibbs faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He pleaded not guilty on the first day of his court-martial last Friday. The trial is expected to run through at least the end of next week.","Staff Sergeant Calvin Gibbs on trial in Washington state .

The 47-year-old, who works as a real estate agent, had been walking with her 13-year-old son on the ground floor of the shopping centre as the cart plummeted from a fourth floor walkway. Scroll down for video . Critical: Marion Hedges, 47, remains in critical condition today after being hit by a shopping cart thrown from a fourth floor walkway . Her son was not injured. Last night, her husband Michael Hedges had a grim update on her condition. He told CBS 2: 'What I can tell you is she’s not well. Her prognosis at a minimum involves many months of painful rehabilitation.' Marion Hedges was devoted to helping under-privileged children like the two who dropped a shopping trolley on her. She helps out at Manhattan's Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center and was out on Sunday buying sweets for trick-or-treaters. ‘She’s . a terrific member,’ the centre’s executive director Wanda Wooten told . the New York Daily News. ‘You can't believe this happened.’ Mrs . Hedges attended the $37,500-a-year private Spence school and then the . $40,400-a-year Barnard College in Manhattan. She has a 13-year-old son . and 14-year-old daughter. The . real estate worker was the daughter of a businessman and a doctor and . her husband is currently working in Spain for Merrill Lynch. ‘She’s a super, super nice person,’ a family friend told the New York Daily News. ’She's been involved in not for profits and charities for more than 25 years.’ Mr Hedges added: 'There’s not a lot we can do right now. It’s with the doctor and with fate’s hands.' Meanwhile, the grandmother of one of the 12-year-old suspects said her family is wracked with sadness over the incident. Ana Cespedes told the New York Daily News: 'I don't even know how to approach the family to wish them well. I want God to help this woman get better.' While the 89-year-old grandmother claimed the boy was 'raised well' by his mother, neighbours told the paper that he was 'the baddest boy in the building.' Police said the cart was thrown from a . walkway that connects a parking garage to a Target store where Mrs . Hedges had just finished shopping. Mrs Hedges, who also has a daughter, was rushed to Harlem Hospital where she is in critical but stable condition. The . two boys have been charged as juveniles with felony assault and . criminal possession of a weapon. They were arrested after one of their . friends reported the prank to the police. 'They deliberately pushed it over the . edge,' a law-enforcement source told the New York Post. 'They're a bunch of . stupid kids, they made a bad decision. She was in the wrong place at the . wrong time.' Tragic: Mrs Hedges, right, was rushed to Harlem Hospital where she is critical condition. Her husband Michael Hedges, left, said her recovery is 'with fate's hands' Investigation: Police seal off the crime scene and Target shopping cart which struck Mrs Hedges . According . to a family friend, Mrs Hedges was shopping for candy at Costco for the . Stanley M Isaacs Neighborhood Center, a community centre for the . elderly. Mrs Hedges has worked with charities for over 25 years and is currently involved in at least six different projects. 'She is such a super, super nice person,' the friend said. Yesterday, her father-in-law, who is also named Michael, told the Post: 'They have her sedated right now, . she's unconscious. It's not quite clear what happened but I hear she has . some broken bones and some cranial injuries - there's some blood up . there,' he added gesturing to his head. 'They're letting us up two at a time and . we can only stay for five minutes. 'You can't really see anything up . there - it's just her lying in a bed unconscious with 50 thousand tubes . in her. She's stable, they're keeping her stable and her respiratory . system is functioning.' Dangerous prank: The two 12-year-old boys are accused of hurling the shopping cart of the fourth-floor walkway . When asked about what should happen to . those responsible for throwing the shopping cart, Mr Hedges said, 'They . should have the book thrown at them.' He also said that his grandson was 'holding up well - he's a brave young man.' A 47-year-old friend of the family . added: 'That is one tough kid. That little kid marched down to the . police department this morning to give a statement. He's such a tough . little kid. They're the nicest, kindest family.' At a hearing on Monday, the boys were remanded in the custody of New York's Administration for Children's Services, the city's child welfare agency.

But Graham Axford managed the feat in his private yacht – despite claiming he was unfit to work because of a bad back. The 57-year-old tackled some of the world’s most dangerous waters while claiming thousands of pounds in incapacity benefit over a 15-year period. Picture of health: Keen sailor Graham Axford sailing near the Azores... despite claiming benefits for a bad back . He was caught out when it emerged he had made a month-long voyage from America to the Azores. The benefits claimant also lived in a council house in Croydon, South London, despite part-owning a farmhouse in Normandy. Mr Axford was apparently exposed living a double-life by a BBC Panorama investigation, which airs tonight. The keen sailor started receiving incapacity benefit in 1996, after injuring his back in a motorcycle accident. But Mr Axford continued to sail extensively and, in 2003, he set off from South Carolina in his yacht on a four-week Atlantic crossing. Accompanied by one crew member, he . sailed via the West Indies, before tackling the huge swells of the . Atlantic. It is then thought that he sailed from the Azores to France. According . to the programme, Mr Axford was given a council flat in 1997 after . failing to tell the local authority that he half-owned a house in . Normandy. Intrepid: Mr Axford was apparently exposed living a double-life by a BBC Panorama investigation . He then held on to the council property while also living in the U.S. and France. In the programme, Mr Axford admits to a Panorama investigator that he has been mostly based in the U.S. for the past seven years. During this time, he continued to receive incapacity benefit, housing benefit, and council tax benefit. Croydon Council is now investigating his benefits claims. Fraud investigator Andrea Corderey said: ‘He’s got a property in France and also we discovered that he owns a yacht. ‘He’s in receipt of incapacity benefit based on a bad back. We are not quite convinced that what he’s told us about his disability is true.’ It comes as figures estimate that fraudulent benefit, housing and tax credit claims cost taxpayers £4billion a year – far more than previously thought. The latest research by The Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University suggests that fraud has increased by a third since the economic downturn began three years ago. Mr Axford’s solicitor said he had never fraudulently misrepresented the nature or extent of his back injury. He added that his eligibility for incapacity benefit had been assessed by medical professionals and that having an ongoing back condition was not incompatible with travelling in a boat with assistance.","Caught out after a month-long voyage from America to the Azores .

After her version of Up The Mountain was heaped with praise by Paula Abdul and LA Reid, Simon was not slow at coming forward. The grinning judge said: 'I don't want to take any credit for this but I'm going to. 'I think you want to give me a kiss don't you.' After hugging the 42-year-old single mother and kissing her, he sat back in his chair and started gloating even more. He said: 'That is why I love judging on this show. I can help the mentors and I can help the contestants. 'This is what you should have been doing right from the start. It was real.' Simon says: The superstar judge was delighted to highlight the fact people should follow his words of wisdom . Drama: The judging panel, from left, LA Reid, Nicole, Paula Abdul and Simon . Crestfallen Nicole tried to deflect the attention away from her failure, but she did admit she had been wrong. The red-faced star conceded: 'I took your advice Simon. I'm not going to make it about you, I'm going to make it about Stacy. 'I think you were being honest with your performance tonight. 'This was the perfect song for you and you fulfilled your purpose.' And to top it all off Paula told Stacy: 'You were the shining moment of tonight.' Colourful: Lakoda Rayne stood out in an array of shades - but Cowell criticised their mentor Paula over their 'prom dress' outfits . Hogz in the limelight: The RnB group were lavished with praise and seem set to go further in the competition . It was a moment of triumph for Simon, . who explained: 'Some of the best singers in the world are what I call . church singers, like Aretha Franklin, that's what I mean, what's wrong . with that? 'But Stacy got it so wrong last week. So I'm going to take responsibility for what she's singing tonight. 'If she gets it wrong tonight I'll . take full responsibility - but this is more me than Nicole with Stacy . this week, it's been me guiding her.' The . Stacy spat was the highlight of a night of verbal grenades from the . show's star act, who gleefully announced on air his show had been . renewed for another season despite getting nowhere near the 20 million . viewers he had hoped for. There are just twelve acts left, with this week being the first subject to the public vote. Jealous: Simon stroked Paula's ego by saying he was envious of her group Stereo Hogz . Hellish: Simon was not a fan of the flames during Chris Rene's performance . First up was the Stereo Hogz, with the RnB group giving a rendition of Janet Jackson song Rhythm Nation. Simon said: 'I was in such a good mood until this because Miss Smug on my right is so happy. 'You know I've got to say something guys, not only do I think you are the best group I've seen on one of these competitions. 'I work for a record label and I don't think there is a band in the world as good as you. 'I wish I was mentoring you. This is so annoying.' LA Reid agreed, saying: 'The . whole idea here is do you have what it takes to be a star, and you know . what, you just showed you absolutely have what it takes to be a star.' Dated: Simon gave Nicole another verbal spanking after labelling her song and presentation choice for LeRoy Bell 'dated' Crow road: 13-year-old Rachel will be hoping the cuteness card will allow her to go deeper into the contest . Chris Rene sang Carpenters hit Superstar, and was praised for picking the right song for him. Nicole said: 'You sound absolutely amazing. You've grown so much already in this competition. Vocally you sounded beautiful.' Simon said: 'Last week you knew . you weren't on your game. When the song started for 10 seconds I thought . this was going to be a disaster. 'I thought it was a big improvement on what you did last week and I love your honesty.' But he had a pop at the flames that covered the stage at the end of the song. His mentor LA Reid defended the styling choice, saying: 'You know that fire was because he is hot.' Singing his heart out: Josh Krajcik in the Overs category took the stage for another rousing performance, clad in a full black ensemble . Michael . Bolton clone LeRoy Bell, who does not look anywhere near his 60 years . of age,was criticsed for his song choice by LA Reid and Simon Cowell . after sing country ballad. Simon accusing Nicole . Scherzinger of picking the wrong song for her pupil, saying: 'I don't . think Nicole quite understood to give you the right kind of song. 'I thought it looked very dated having a piano player up there with you.' But she shot back: 'You know what, Simon? Sometimes, less is more. The ding-dong continued when Simon Cowell's contestant 13-year-old Rachel Crow sang Walking On Sunshine, but with new lyrics. Nicole questioned why they had been changed, and claimed it had wasted the song. But acid-tongued Simon said: 'Referring to the lyric change, Nicole, it's called being inventive darling.' One to beat? Simon is sure he has a winner on his hands after bring back leather-lunged Melanie Amaro . And when she tried to challenged him again he spoke over her, saying: 'Nicole, grown-ups are talking. 'This girl is going to be around for a long time.' LA . Reid seemed to agree, as he added: 'You must be one of the most . charasmatic people I have ever met. It is tough to cricise your . performance because you are so loveable. 'You have really got something special, whatever you want to do, you can do it.' Melanie Amaro, sang the Eagles' classic hit Desperado, and despite only being in the show after Simon . changed his mind on axing her, she is suddenly the favourite. LA Reid said: 'The only thing Simon ever did right was bringing you back. 'Great song choice, but for me Simon bringing you back was more powerful for me.' Paula added: 'You look beautiful and I have to say your voice is like fine china.' Its a rap: Pint-sized hip hop wannabe Astro was popular with the crowd and the judges . Fair's fair: LA Reid admitted he had been wrong about his own act after being jabbed by Simon . Smug Simon said: 'I didn't realise how good you are, you are seriously, seriously good. 'Right now, you are the one to beat, trust me.' Pint-sized rapper Astro, who . looks less than his 15-years, took on Naughty by Nature's Hip-Hop . Hooray, and added some of his own lyrics thrown in for effect. Simon took LA to task, as he was now singing his act's praises while before had said noone would buy his records. Simon said: 'I remember a few weeks ago LA Reid saying people your age can't rap and sell records. Gleeful: Intensity won the approval of Simon with their Glee-esque act . 'I think LA it is time to take that back. I think you are a real little star. 'Your ego is getting bigger, I know LA is channelling is ego through you, but that is what it needs.' And the hip-hop mogol agreed, saying, 'that's fair.' Once . again, if you like to download Glee's versions of your favourite songs, . there's nothing not to like about the hodgepodge of 12- to 17-year-olds . who make up Intensity. Simon . admitted he had been wrong to doubt them and Paula, saying: 'I'm going . to say S O R R Y to Paula because that was terrific. Are Drew kidding? Simon claimed he was learning from his 14-year-old act and that she should be his mentor . 'I like the fact there is a bit of a rebellion going on here and you insisted on changing your music to suit all of you.' Paula reposted: 'You put him in his place, thank you so much for working so hard.' Another contestant who fared well was 14-year-old Drew, who LA lavished with praise before adding, 'You're unlucky, you have the wrong mentor, otherwise, you're amazing. However old campaigner Simon knew the best move was to use his reputation to shine even more light on his act, replying: 'LA, I'm not her mentor, she is my mentor. 'I'm learning from you and you are doing an incredible job.

Rescuers . released the three trapped men after a trench collapsed at the . Aberpergwm drift mine, in Glynneath, South Wales, just after 3am. Two of them were taken to hospital, but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. The cave-in comes seven weeks to the day after the deaths of four miners . at the Gleision Colliery, 15 miles away. Rescued: The three trapped men were released after a trench collapsed at the Aberpergwm drift mine, in Glynneath, South Wales, just after 3am . A Mid and West Wales Fire Brigade official said: 'Three . people were released, there were two casualties who were taken to . hospital. The third person was released after receiving treatment at the scene.' She added that the miners were released by a colliery rescue crew after being trapped for approximately one hour. Firefighters stood by with lighting equipment and gave assistance until receiving the order to stand down at 5.58am. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed that two men were taken to Morriston Hospital, Swansea. The extent of their injuries is not known, but they are not believed to be life-threatening. The cave-in at the Neath Valley drift mine comes seven weeks after flooding at the Gleision Colliery in the neighbouring Swansea . Valley killed four miners. Phillip .

He said: 'Any injury to any miner is a cause for concern. 'This latest incident is endemic in mining, which is a risky activity. 'However, it cannot be compared to the tragic disaster which occurred in Gleision. 'Against the backdrop of Gleision people may be understandably more concerned. 'But . Aberpergwm is a modern and efficient mine. Its safety record is . admirable and the mine is employing and recruiting more and more people . every year.' Mr Hain . said he would be 'very concerned' if the Gleision tragedy cast a dark . shadow over mining in his constituency, where '400 people are employed . in highly skilled jobs'. Aberpergwm first opened in the late 19th century, and during the 1930s more than 1,500 men were employed there. It closed in 1985, but reopened 12 months later under private ownership.

"By . Steve Doughty and Emily Andrews . Last updated at 7:14 PM on 3rd November 2011 . St Paul's protesters were handed a two-month reprieve yesterday after the authorities offered to allow them to stay until the New Year. In a humiliating climbdown, the City of London Corporation said it would abandon legal action against the campers if they leave peacefully in early 2012. But protesters are already aiming to stay through the Olympic Games next summer – which would guarantee international attention for their cause and embarrassment for the Government. Hard at work: A protester with a mask of David Cameron on his head cleans the Occupy London camp area outside St Paul's Cathedral. And a clash between campsite and . authorities is likely before next weekend, when Saturday’s Lord Mayor’s . Show will bring tens of thousands of spectators to the City, and . Remembrance Sunday, as both feature services at St Paul’s. As late as Tuesday morning the . Corporation was preparing to hand the camp a 48-hour eviction notice, . but was forced to change its policy after the Cathedral publicly backed . the protesters. Four of the protesters then met . representatives from the local authority in an attempt to resolve issues . in a non-violent and non-confrontational manner. Reprieve: Protesters were due to be served with legal notices, but that action has been called off . Archbishop: Dr Rowan Williams (left) has kept his counsel since the protest began but, after the resignation of Dean of St Paul's Cathedral Graeme Knowles (right), he has spoken and backed the demonstrators . Chancellor George Osborne was last night on collision course with Church leaders after it emerged he has serious doubts about moves to bring in a ‘Robin Hood’ tax on bankers. The European Union tax will hit shares, bonds and currency deals – but bankers fears it will harm London’s position as a financial centre. As one of the central planks of the protests at St Paul’s Cathedral, the tax is also backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams. He said: ‘There’s an impatience with a return to “business as usual” – represented by still soaring bonuses and little visible change in banking practices.’ But a private letter by Mr Osborne to bank chiefs claims the ‘necessary international consensus does not exist’ to impose the tax. As part of last night’s deal, the . City of London Corporation asked protesters to reduce the number of . tents to enable access to St Paul’s churchyard and abide by health and . safety legislation. Tina Rothery, 49, who attended the . meeting, said: ‘They want a slight but visible reduction of tents, but . otherwise we can stay until the New Year. ‘I think this is a huge climbdown for . the City of London. At the start of this week it was taking legal . action to evict us and about to hand us our notice. Now it is allowing . us to stay until the New Year.’ The offer will now be discussed at . the camp’s general assembly, which is held twice a day, and with a vote . on the proposal expected today. But many protesters have already . expressed a desire to stay long-term under the cathedral. Camp spokesman . Ronan McNern said: ‘Some of our camp say it should be a permanent . back-drop and we should be here for the Olympics and beyond. ‘But things are changing so fast that . we can’t really say anything for certain. Guessing at any sort of . timeframe is something we can’t really do. We’ve had offers of  better . tents so we can upgrade the camp which would enable us to stay for . longer.’ The looming difficulty for City . authorities now is the annual Lord Mayor’s Show next Saturday, when a . parade of 6,000 people, including a large military presence, attracts . thousands of spectators. Mr McNern said: ‘We won’t take the . tents down for either Remembrance Sunday or the Lord Mayor’s Show but we . will work with St Paul’s. ‘We’ll be provocative but peaceful. We want to get people involved but not anything disruptive. We want this . to be a safe space for campers and visitors, and it’s not about . interrupting the cathedral’s work.’ Protest leaders have met with St Paul's officials to discuss were health and safety and to ensure that upcoming events at the cathedral run smoothly . 'Untenable': Rt Rev Knowles became the second of the cathedral's senior clergy to resign in less than a week . An unlikely crowd: A demonstrator directs questions to Rt Rev Knowles (second from right), and the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres (right) at the weekend . There are now around 24 Occupy tent protests around Britain. One such rally is taking place in Bristol, where tents have been pitched on the cathedral-owned College Green for the past three weeks.

"By . Daniel Miller . Last updated at 3:54 PM on 3rd November 2011 . Police have smashed a human trafficking ring which moved more than 230 people into the UK to claim more than £2million in illegal benefits. Officers arrested 29 suspects as they gathered for a wedding in Poland while a team from Scotland Yard detained a further two people in London and carried out searches in Birmingham. The arrests came at the end of a two-year joint investigation involving Scotland Yard, HM Customs and Polish police. Operation: A team from Scotland Yard worked in conjunction with HM Customs and Polish police to smash a criminal ring which trafficked people into Britain to falsely claim benefits . The gang had promised jobs in Britain to at least 230 people, many with alcohol or mental health problems. However, once they were brought to the UK they were tricked into signing papers to open bank accounts. The fraudsters falsely applied for tax credit and other benefits using their victims' details. They then sent the money back to ringleaders in Poland, leaving the people they had trafficked destitute on the streets of Britain. Most of the victims have since returned to Poland where they have been supported by local authorities. Officers from Scotland Yard and police forces in Poland searched five addresses in south and east London today for evidence, while colleagues swooped on other gang members in Poland as they gathered for a wedding. Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland, of the Met's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command, said: 'These vulnerable victims were trafficked here to be exploited and satisfy the greed of these criminals. 'They were brought here under the impression they were getting a job but were left with nothing, with many ending up on the street. 'The complex international dimension to this inquiry meant that it was vital to have a close relationship with the Polish authorities, which is why they joined us on this operation today. 'These arrests are the first step in these victims getting justice in their home country and have prevented more money being stolen from the public purse.' Destination UK: The gang promised jobs to at least 230 people who they then tricked into signing papers to open false bank accounts once they arrived in Britain . Assistant . Director John Pointing, from HMRC Criminal Investigation London, said: . 'During this operation, HMRC investigated over 230 tax credit awards . with a value in excess of £2,000,000. 'We . suspect the claims have been submitted by a criminal gang trafficking . people who have then acquired their victims' identities to commit fraud . in the UK. 'The evidence HMRC gathered has played a vital role in the strategic planning of this international investigation and has directly supported the arrest of suspects in Poland and the UK.' Police Major Monika Sokolowska, of Poland's Central Unit for Trafficking in Human Beings, said: 'This form of trafficking is a new phenomenon in Poland. 'In the past we were used to dealing with cases where people were trafficked for prostitution or for slavery but this new form of trafficking is becoming ever more prevalent. 'This is a big case for us with over 200 statements taken from vulnerable witness who were exploited. 'These people were trafficked to the UK by criminals and did not receive any of the social benefits that were fraudulently claimed in their name.'","Fraudsters stole benefits and left vulnerable victims destitute on the street .

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 5:05 PM on 19th October 2011 . Legal 'victory': French writer Tristane Banon today dropped all legal action against 'sex attacker' Dominique Strauss-Kahn . French writer Tristane Banon today dropped all legal action against ‘sex attacker’ Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but warned him to ‘keep a low profile’. The development came as increasingly sleazy allegations about the 62-year-old’s involvement in an international vice ring came to light. Ms Banon, now 33, maintains that the former International Monetary Fund chief tried to rape her in a Paris flat in 2003. Judges agreed that she had been . sexually assaulted but - because the statute of limitations for such a . crime in France is three years - police stopped investigating last week. Ms . Banon said she was satisfied that Mr Strauss-Kahn’s status as a ‘sex . attacker’ had been proved, and that she had achieved a legal ‘victory’. ‘Police recognised that he assaulted me but cannot charge him,’ Ms Banon told the Canal Plus TV station in Paris. ‘This . means he is officially a sex attacker, and officially I am not a liar. My status as a victim has been established and I am dropping my action.’ Mr . Banon added: ‘I expected him to apologise, but I think it’s too much to . ask that gentleman. I advise him above all to keep a low profile.' Under fire: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pictured leaving a polling station in Paris on Sunday, was accused of trying to rape Ms Banon in 2003 . This is the second time in three months the former IMF chief has been cleared of sex charges. In August, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges that he had raped a maid in a New York hotel room in May.Ms Banon first spoke out after Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of attempting to rape a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in New York.U.S. prosecutors eventually dropped the charges after finding the cleaner, 32-year-old Nafissatou Diallo, had told a number of lies.However just 24 hours later, Mr Strauss-Kahn was implicated in an investigation into underage prostitution. He is among politicians and business leaders allegedly named in a ‘black book’ of clients at a luxury hotel which was said to double as a brothel.A judicial Inquiry into prostitution at Carlton Hotel, in Lille, was opened in March amid claims underage girls were involved.Prostitution is legal in France, but those offering sex must be over 18. French Closer magazine, which published the claims, said it has seen prosecution documents which say Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, used prostitutes at the hotel. A source close to Mr Strauss-Kahn said he had 'no comment' to make on the allegations. She said she would now campaign for the statute of limitations for sex assault to be increased to ten years. She has published a book giving her side of the incident where she describes Mr Strauss-Kahn as ‘le couchon’ (the pig). Mr Strauss-Kahn strenuously denied Miss Banon’s claims. 'Eight years ago, the pig stole my life,' writes Ms Banon at the beginning of 'The Hypocrites' Ball' ('Le Bal des Hypocrites'). Ms Banon refers continually to the alleged crime in her 126-page book, but leaves out the name of Mr Strauss-Kahn. This is a common tactic adopted by French authors as they try to avoid libel charges relating to what they have written. Despite this, publicity for the book makes it perfectly clear that the book is auto-biographical. Mr . Strauss-Kahn also faced trial for allegedly trying to rape Nafissatou . Diallo, a 32-year-old chamber maid, in a New York hotel earlier this . year, but also escaped prosecution in that case. Now he is preparing to speak to judges about allegedly taking part in an orgy in the U.S. city just days before his arrest. Judges . sitting in Lille have so far arrested five men linked with a vice ring, . and some of them are said to have travelled to New York with . prostitutes to meet Mr Strauss-Kahn. He is also said to have taken part in orgies from girls from the same ring in luxury hotels in central Paris. At . the start of this year, Mr Strauss-Kahn was the most powerful banker in . the world, and the hot favourite to replace Nicolas Sarkozy as . president of France next spring. Now . he is unemployed and living in Paris with his long-suffering third . wife, Anne Sinclair, a former TV journalist who has stuck with him . throughout his legal problems.

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 7:55 PM on 14th October 2011 . Another scandal: Dominique Strauss-Kahn has found himself caught up in an investigation into an alleged underage prostitution racket . Only 24 hours after escaping  sexual assault charges in France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been implicated in an investigation into underage prostitution. The former head of the International Monetary Fund is among politicians and business leaders allegedly named in a ‘black book’ of clients at a luxury hotel which was said to double as a brothel. A judicial Inquiry into prostitution at Carlton Hotel, in Lille, was opened in March amid claims underage girls were involved. Prostitution is legal in France, but those offering sex must be over 18. Senior staff from the Carlton Hotel, including the manager and a public relations executive, were arrested earlier this month as part of the inquiry. They are said to have acted as ‘pimps’ to their guests, and face charges of procuring prostitutes, organised conspiracy in criminal acts and money laundering. French Closer magazine, which published the claims yesterday, said it has seen prosecution documents which say Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, used prostitutes at the hotel. Power couple: Mr Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair, who has stood by him throughout his recent court ordeals . French Closer claims: 'The prostitutes . and the go-betweens charging for sex indeed put forward the name of the . husband of Anne Sinclair. 'According to one of the girls in the ring, Dominique Strauss-Kahn would have benefitted from her services.' Investigation: The Carlton Hotel in Lille, where staff members have been arrested over an investigation into an alleged prostitution ring . French Closer magazine, which has a good record for investigative journalism, claimed it has 100 per cent confirmation from Lille examining judges Ausbart and Vignau that Strauss-Kahn was a client of those accused. He would, naturally, face criminal proceedings if he was found to have paid or slept with an underage girl. Sexual assault: French journalist and writer Tristane Banon attends a rally in solidarity with rape victims in Paris . Lille is just an hour from Paris by high-speed train, and an obvious place for high-profile men to travel to meet prostitutes. Despite conceding that he had attacked author Tristane Banon, judges cleared Mr Strauss-Kahn on Thursday because of the statute of limitations in France, which is three years for sexual assault. It is the second time in three months the former IMF chief has been cleared of sex charges. In August, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges that he had raped a maid in a New York hotel room in May. Ms Banon first spoke out after Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of attempting to rape a maid at at the Sofitel Hotel in New York. U.S. prosecutors eventually dropped the charges after finding the cleaner, 32-year-old Nafissatou Diallo, had told a number of lies. Mr Strauss-Kahn could have received a prison sentence of up to 15 years if found guilty of attempted rape in France. He still faces civil cases in both Paris and New York over the alleged rape incidents.",He was only yesterday cleared of the attempted rape of young French journalist Tristane Banon .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:58 PM on 2nd November 2011 . Crippling defence cuts have left the UK without a single warship dedicated to protecting the waters around the British Isles. For the last month the stretched Royal Navy has been unable to deploy a frigate or destroyer whose sole task is to patrol the country’s coastline. Typically, the Navy would place a vessel - known as the Fleet Ready Escort (FRE) - on standby to respond swiftly to a potential threat such as a terrorist attack in UK waters or abroad. But controversial cuts to the beleaguered fleet and the Libyan conflict meant naval chiefs were forced to axe the emergency capability at the start of October. Worrying: Cutbacks have left the UK without a single warship tasked with protecting the coastline - the last ship to undertake this role was the Type 23 frigate HMS Portland . It has raised serious concerns that Britain’s defences are at risk because of the gap in firepower. Admiral Lord Alan West, the former . First Sea Lord, said: ‘If there was a terrorism incident in UK waters, . this would historically be the ship sent in to deal with it. ‘It’s a big problem. If we haven’t . got a ship ready to do this role then it’s worrying. It’s a very . unsatisfactory position to be in. ‘What it shows is that the number of . frigates and destroyers we’ve got now is insufficient. We need more . ships as a matter of urgency.’ In last year’s Strategic Defence and . Security Review (SDSR) the Government cut the number of frigates or . destroyers in the Navy’s surface fleet from 24 to 19. Critics warned the cuts would leave . the navy overstretched. Since March nine warships have been deployed to . Libya to join operations to topple Colonel Gaddafi. But the war dragging on has left none left to be on hand in the UK. Concerned: Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord Alan West, says it is worrying if a ship is not available to protect the country's shores . It is understood the last time the . Navy did not protect ‘home waters’ was in 1982 after every available . ship left for the Falklands War. The last ship to undertake the high readiness role was the Type 23 frigate HMS Portland. However, it left the position on . October 3 to take part in the Joint Warrior Nato exercise off Scotland . which provides vital training for ships’ crews. Major General Julian Thompson, former . commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and a Falklands . veteran, said: ‘This demonstrates how sea-blind the government has . become - they don’t seem to realise we live on an island. ‘The first duty of the Royal Navy is . to defend the British Isles and yet it hasn’t got enough ships to do so. It is absolutely appalling. ‘Some people might say, ""Well, we’re . not under attack."" Well, okay. But if we stay unprotected too often for . too long someone might decide to run some guns, or smuggle drugs or ship . over a few terrorists. It really makes your jaw drop.’ The Ministry of Defence said the next FRE vessel would be formally notified by the end of the week. But with the MoD being forced to make . cuts of £4.7billion by 2015, as well as eliminate an equipment . overspend of £38billion, there are fears that the high-alert ship will . be ditched more frequently in future. Earlier this year the head of the . Navy was hauled over the coals by Prime Minister David Cameron for . warning that the UK’s defences would be at risk if the war in Libya . dragged on beyond September - a stance that has proved correct. Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First . Sea Lord, said warships patrolling ‘home waters’ around the British . Isles may have to be diverted to the Mediterranean to shore up Britain’s . war effort. At the peak of the conflict, Britain . had five warships - destroyer HMS Liverpool, mine clearance vessel HMS . Bangor, a Trafalgar-class submarine, helicopter carrier HMS Ocean and . supply vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Rosalie - off the Libyan coast. Sir Mark said that beyond September . ‘we might have to request the Government to make some challenging . decisions about what priorities they want. The Government will have a . choice as to where they chose to take the platform from - it could be . from around home waters.’ The MoD said that as well as the high . readiness ship, the Navy normally has a frigate escorting the Trident . nuclear deterrent and others protecting fishing vessels. A spokesman said: ‘Due to the . successful deployment of Royal Naval units to the Libya campaign it has . been necessary to re-profile the tasks of some ships. ‘UK waters remain well protected as . at any one time there are always a number of Royal Navy ships conducting . security operations. Should a ship be required for a counter-terrorist . operation, for example, a Royal Navy ship would be allocated . immediately.’ Asked why there has not been a FRE . since HMS Portland, an MoD spokesman said: ‘We do not need one . currently. We’ve got ships off Libya and they are returning now. That’s . the situation. We’ve had to look after our priorities and be flexible. We are doing the best with what we have got.’ The Government has been warned that service personnel are 'hurting' because of redundancies and cuts as further details of a scheme to boost support for the armed forces were revealed. Defence Minister Andrew Robathan announced that more than £423,000 had been allocated to 13 bids in England for local projects funded through the community covenant scheme. The projects range from money for a play area to a grant for English lessons for Gurkhas and funding for Royal Wootton Bassett to help commemorate the town's new Royal status. The £30 million grant scheme was launched earlier this year and aims to reinforce the military covenant spelling out the bond between the nation and the armed forces. But Dawn McCafferty, chairman of the RAF Families Federation, warned of the impact of redundancies and cuts to allowances on service personnel. She told a Local Government Association (LGA) conference in London discussing the covenant that many were 'keeping their heads down' in an attempt to avoid the next rounds of job cuts. 'Families are hurting and actually the covenant doesn't mean a great deal to those who have just received a redundancy notice,' she said. Roger Harrison, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire, criticised the Government over cuts to allowances. The former warrant officer in the Adjutant General's Corps, who is a Huntingdonshire councillor, accused the Government of paying for a doubling of the operational allowance in Afghanistan through cuts to education and disruption allowances. 'I find it very disappointing that the minister wants to take all the credit for the doubling of the operational allowance when they have cut other allowances to pay for it,' he said. He told Mr Robathan: 'If you want local councils to sign up for this scheme, central Government should put its money where its mouth is.' Mr Robathan said the armed forces deserved to be properly remunerated. 'We have to balance the absolutely correct payment of continuity of education allowance to people who need it with the needs of the public purse,' he said. 'That is also true of other allowances, that we have to ensure that we are not overly-generous at a time when actually outside the armed forces people are in a pretty difficult situation.'","At least one ship is normally at readiness for an emergency in UK waters or abroad .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:34 PM on 2nd November 2011 . 'Like a sprung coil': Mr Allen, shown leaving court in June, was said to have snapped after his wife Melanie deprived him of his dinner . A deputy high court judge who hit his wife during an argument has been sacked for bringing the judiciary into disrepute, officials said today. James Allen QC was removed from his judicial positions after being given a 12-month supervision order by District Judge Daphne Wickham at Bradford Magistrates’ Court in June. A spokeswoman for the Office for Judicial Complaints said: 'The Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice are of the view that his actions had brought the judiciary into disrepute and have removed Judge Allen from his judicial positions.' During a trial which ended earlier in . June, Allen, 61, claimed that his wife, Melanie, inflicted injuries on . her own face during the incident at their house in Woolley, Wakefield, . West Yorkshire, on February 20 last year. Mrs Allen, 44, backed up her husband’s story when she gave evidence in court. She also said she had self-harmed in the past. But Mrs Wickham said she did not believe the couple’s account and found Allen guilty of common assault. His wife was not in court, although the district judge was told they are still together. Mrs Wickham also ordered Allen to pay £5,000 towards the £5,421 cost of the prosecution. The court heard that most of this was spent on expert medical opinion. The trial, which was spread over a . number of days starting last year, heard that the argument between the . Allens started after the husband had been away for a week and then spent the . Saturday running his family around. Lavish: The home of the Allens in West Yorkshire is where the attack took place . He returned to the family home having . not eaten, to find his wife was preoccupied by the couple’s cleaner, . who had come round to talk to Mrs Allen about various problems she was . having. They both told the court the argument . was more heated than usual and Mrs Allen described her increasing . exasperation at her husband’s insistence he was leaving. She said she punched herself on the sides of her head out of sheer frustration and despair. Mrs Allen also gave evidence saying she had done something similar on Boxing Day 2009, following another argument. And, she said, she cut her wrist 18 years ago, resulting in a minor injury which was treated in hospital. But one doctor told the hearing that . Mrs Allen’s injuries on February 20 - which included bruises and . swelling - were not consistent with self-punching. Police officers told the trial Mrs . Allen made no mention of harming herself when they called at the house . within 15 minutes of receiving a 999 call. In that emergency call, the caller was recorded saying Allen was 'trying to kill' Mrs Allen. Sentencing Allen, Mrs Wickham said he . had reacted to his irritation at his wife having a 'female chat' with . the cleaner 'rather like a sprung coil'. The district judge added: 'I found that you snapped when you felt you were being stopped from leaving.' She reminded the court that Allen hit . his wife at least three times and, although the bruises and swelling . were not 'long- lasting', she said the attack was 'dangerous and . unpleasant'. She told Allen: 'The effect of the conviction on you personally and professionally is profound. 'That is punishment, I’m sure you will think, in itself.' Allen made no comment as he left the court. He was called to the bar in 1973 and was made a QC in 1995. He was made a deputy high court judge in 2000. One high-profile case he presided . over was Christine Gill v RSPCA, in which he ruled against the animal . charity in a dispute over a large will bequest. Mrs Allen is also a trained . barrister. She sits using her professional name, Melanie Williamson, as a . deputy coroner in the eastern district of West Yorkshire, covering the . Leeds area.","Allen also had to pay £5,000 towards prosecution costs .

Brave face: The Baby star took to the stage to perform on Dancing With The Stars, just hours after the story broke . Hugs all around: Bieber received encouragement from the fellow singers . The singer and actress looked stunning in an asymmetrical silver dress with cut out detail, showing off her enviable figure. She teamed her revealing dress with a pair of T-bar heels for the occasion. Selena wore her glossy hair, which had been preened at a hairdressers shortly before the event, around her shoulders and donned a pair of silver hoop earrings. Smiles: Across town, the show also went on for Bieber's girlfriend Selena Gomez, who is surely also rocked by the claims . Ahead of the event the actress was seen leaving a salon wearing a cropped black leather jacket and clutching her phone. In news which has stunned the world, Bieber is now at the centre of a paternity lawsuit which 20-year-old Yeater filed on October 31. Yeater has asked the star to submit to a paternity test, and a claim ‘to provide adequate support for my baby', for the tryst which she allegedly lasted no longer than 30 seconds. In . a legal statement, sworn under penalty of perjury, Yeater . told a California court that Bieber propositioned her on October 25 of . last year, when she was 19 after his concert and at L.A.'s Staples Center. Getting ready: Ahead of the event the actress was seen leaving a salon wearing a cropped black leather jacket and clutching her phone . Serious: Selena found it hard to raise a smile . According to U.S. website Radar Online, Yeater told a judge: . 'When I later realized I was pregnant with Justin Bieber's baby, I tried . to contact him through his representatives but no one ever called me . back.' She added: 'On July 6, 2011, I gave birth to a baby boy. That was . exactly 36 weeks and two days after the sexual encounter with Justin . Bieber. 'Based upon the timing as well as the fact there were no other . possible men that I had sex with that could be the father of this baby, I . believe that Justin Bieber is in fact the father of my baby.' Bieber's spokesperson has vehemently denied the allegations, and told website Radar: 'While we haven't yet seen the lawsuit, it's sad that someone would . fabricate malicious, defamatory, and demonstrably false claims. Place of birth: Mariah Yeater gave birth to her baby at the futuristic looking Grossmont Hospital in San Diego, California . Birth certificate: The birth certificate of Tristyn Yeater, who a lawsuit alleges is Bieber's baby is seen without the father's details on it . 'We will . vigorously pursue all available legal remedies to defend and protect . Justin against these allegations.' Yeater wrote a detailed statement about . meeting her idol in papers submitted to a Los Angeles court. She claims she was approached by a security guard while seated in the front row of the star's concert and asked if she wanted to meet the singer backstage. She said: 'Immediately, it was obvious that we were . mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. 'Shortly thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private place where we could be alone. 'I agreed to go with him and on the . walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this . was going to be his first time. 'We went inside and immediately his . personality changed drastically. He began touching me and repeatedly . said he wanted to f*** the s*** out of me. Getting prepared: Justin is seen ahead of his Dancing With The Star performance . 'At the time I asked him to . put a condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to.' 'In his own words, he said that because it was his first time he wanted to feel everything.' She is said to have described the intercourse as 'brief', lasting 'approximately 30 seconds'. However, Yeater's claim that she had sex with the star when she was 19 and he was aged . 16 would mean under California law that he . was underage. And if the claims turn out to be true . Yeater could lay herself open to a charge of statutory rape of a minor . and would at least be guilty of a misdemeanour. But she would not have . to register as sex offender if a conviction was upheld. Post show: The woman claims she had sex with the underage star after one of his concerts in Los Angeles . Yeater . claims that after the encounter he refused to give her his phone . number, and was 'not interested' in writing down her contact details. She . says that after learning she was pregnant she tried to get in touch . with him via his representatives, but there was no response to her . calls. A court hearing is said to have been set for December 15. Justin . has been dating girlfriend Selena Gomez since the end of last year but . the couple waited until the Oscars in March to make their first public . debut together. Last month when the couple were both . in Winnipeg and they spent an amorous evening watching the basketball . together and were seen smooching from a private box. They also adopted a dog together, whom they have named Baylor, from an . animal rescue centre in Winnipeg on October 14. What will Selena say? Justin has been dating his girlfriend for the past ten months . Bieber continued his professional duties last night in the wake of the claims with a performance on Dancing With The Stars. Gomez also stepped out with a red carpet appearance at a charity event in Los Angeles. In .

"By . Emily Andrews . Created 8:45 PM on 26th June 2011 . Escape: Rachel Cowles was nearly abducted in the same week Milly Dowler was snatched by Levi Bellfield . Rachel Cowles was stopped by a chubby man in a red car as she walked home from school aged 11. She refused a lift. She repeatedly tried to report the incident to police, but they didn't take a statement for three years. Last Friday the jury deliberating a charge of attempted abduction by Milly's killer Levi Bellfield was discharged without reaching a verdict. Yesterday Miss Cowles, now a 21-year-old student nurse, told the Daily Mail: 'I am very angry and hurt. '[When the jury was discharged] I burst into tears. 'This whole thing has been very difficult and frightening, both recognising Bellfield in court and giving evidence. 'I just want to be able to draw a line in the sand and move on.' Seconds after Miss Cowles refused a lift from the man in 2002, a police car passed and he sped off. Miss Cowles and her parents John and Diana were convinced that her would-be attacker was Milly's killer. For three years, every time there was an appeal about the unsolved murder or a new press report appeared, Miss Cowles's mother would ring Surrey Police and offer to make a statement about the stranger. Each time, she was told the force had no record of previous calls, that this  one would definitely be logged and someone would call back – but they never did. Miss Cowles, pictured right in 2002, was just 11 when she was approached by a man she says fits Levi Bellfield's description while on her way home from school . The barrister who defended Levi Bellfield has come in for increasing criticism in the wake of the trial. Milly’s sister Gemma branded Jeffrey Samuels’s cross-examination of her parents the worst day of her life. Mr Samuel's, pictured, has a bulldog reputation for fighting the corner of defendants accused of terrible violence, including Barry George in his successful appeal against his conviction for murdering TV presenter Jill Dando. Last night Shane McDonnell, the uncle of Marsha McDonnell, who was murdered by Bellfield in 2003, said: ‘He needs to explain whether his motive was genuine belief that his line of defence was correct, or was it just the lure of notoriety and state money?’ Miss Cowles added: 'I feel very lucky . that I got away. When it came out about Milly it really hit me that it . could have been me. 'I genuinely felt that I could put [the experience] to good use to help find Milly's killer.' Her mother, 50, a secondary school science technician, said: 'It had to be more than a coincidence that Rachel was approached on the road where Milly went missing. 'Two girls, in two days – surely there had to be a connection? 'The police weren't taking us seriously. 'In the end we had to write to the chief constable, and it was only then, three years later, that they came to take Rachel's statement.' Miss Cowles, in smart navy uniform and striped tie, with a dusting of freckles on her cheeks and brown eyes, bore an uncanny resemblance to Milly as she walked to her home in Shepperton, Surrey, in March 2002. She said the driver beckoned her over, but soon after 'a police car drove towards us on the opposite side of the road and I think it spooked him and he sped off'.","Jury unable to decide whether Levi Bellfield tried to snatch Rachel Cowles the day before Milly Dowler .
A previous version of this article reported that Rachel Cowles accused police of robbing her of justice. In fact Miss Cowles has publicly thanked Surrey Police for their hard work on the case. Neither she nor her family  hold police responsible for the outcome.We are happy to clarify Miss Cowles’ position."
"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 8:04 AM on 5th October 2011 . There were tears today as villagers finally lost their battle to save a century-old tree at the heart of their community. Despite a two-week occupation by five protesters, coming at the end of a £300,000 five-year legal case, the Irton beech is no more. Contractors with chainsaws began felling the magnificent 55ft tree in the centre of the North Yorkshire village. Behind barriers: Felling work started after protests from the villagers failed to save the tree.. the five year legal battle cost North Yorkshire County Council almost £300,000 . Protected by metal barricades and five police officers, workmen lopped off its branches as the fifth and final eco-warrior climbed down in tears. After four nights in the tree Vikki Welsh, 17, stood sobbing behind the barriers as the chainsaws and clunking machinery drowned out the residents’ last protests. The teenager, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, said: ‘I feel very emotional. The worst moment was coming down. I am absolutely distraught that more than a quarter of a million pounds has been spent and the tree has still not been saved.’ She and local residents wept, hugged each other and jeered as workmen moved in to take down the tree. Ann Wootton, 62, who has lived in the village 22 years, said: ‘It is the last thing I wanted to see. It’s horrendous. I can’t watch this. It is so very, very wrong. Tears for the tree: The last protestor in the tree, Vicky, is consoled as the tree is felled in Irton village, North Yorkshire . ‘The tree represented England at its best and they are just desecrating and destroying it. ‘This is a symbol of a rotting Britain and a desecration of everything we used to hold dear in this country –  village life and the environment.’ Mark Snow, 39, who was the first to climb the tree a fortnight ago to  prevent its felling, said he was ‘absolutely appalled’. ‘It is terrible news,’ the carpenter said today. ‘A friend and I were offered the job of turning the stump into a bench but we wouldn’t touch it.’ Mr Snow – dubbed the Scarborough Swampy – climbed the tree an hour before workmen were due to begin cutting it down a fortnight ago. When he left he was replaced by another protester, and so on, until this morning when Miss Welsh descended the tree. Getting the axe: Contractors with chainsaws began felling the magnificent 55ft tree . It brought to a close a dispute that began in 2006 when Gerald and Norah Hazelwood moved into their £345,000 home on Irton’s Main Street. They said the tree, which stands by the gates to their detached home, was damaging their drive and limestone front wall and causing the drains to block. But their opponents called the felling ‘wanton destruction’ for the  convenience of only two people, and asked why they had bought the house when they knew a huge tree was right outside the front gates. A total of 200 locals in Irton, which has just 150 houses, signed a petition calling for the beech tree not to be cut down and were backed by the parish council and officials at Scarborough Borough Council. Before the chop: A general view of the beech tree last month, where local resident Mark Snow was staging a protest in the village of Irton, Scarborough . They issued a Tree Preservation . Order, saying the loss of the beech would result in ‘serious harm to the . character of the village’. Because the tree is on a public grass verge it falls under the ownership of North Yorkshire County Council. Despite . spending £300,000 in legal fees to save the tree, the council was . eventually forced to comply with a judge’s order to remove it. Taxpayers will have to pay at least £100,000 of the fees. Scarborough’s . Tory MP, Robert Goodwill, said: ‘The only people to come out of this . smiling will be the lawyers who have pocketed some very fat cheques.’ He said the trunk would be retained as a bench and turned into ‘the world’s most expensive village seat’. Parish . council vice chairman David Parker said: ‘We did not want to give up, . but had to because of the financial cost. We are just a group of . elderly villagers with very little clout other than what we believe in.’ Passionate about the cause: Mark Swan in late September on the third day of his vigil tyring to save a historic Beech tree in the village .","The trunk of the tree is to be retained and turned into a bench .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:05 PM on 8th August 2011 . A British soldier fighting in Afghanistan has been accused of cutting off the fingers of dead Taliban fighters - which he then kept as 'macabre' souvenirs. The squaddie, from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, is said to have carried out the horrific ritual during the battalion's last tour which ended in April. It will provoke anger amongst Muslims who are traditionally buried with all their body parts. Allegation: A soldier from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, pictured here meeting the Queen in 2007, is said to have sliced the fingers off a dead Taliban fighter (file picture) The Ministry of Defence has launched a probe into the 'very serious allegation' - and has tasked the army's elite Special Investigation Branch to look into the shocking accusation. A source told the Sun: 'These allegations have rocked the battalion. That said, they are being kept very hush hush for obvious reasons. Only one soldier is said to have been involved. 'The Afghanistan tour was his first one and it's possible that the stresses of that made him do these horrific things.' The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, is known as 5 Scots and is based in Canterbury, Kent. It became Britain's lead presence in Helmand, where it traveled with The Royal Highland Fusiliers as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, last September. As part of its second tour to the country it took control of the Helmand Police Training Centre. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie has now called for urgent action over the allegations and said the Army must act quickly, if the 'sickening acts' were the result of severe military trauma, to make sure others were not suffering in the same way. Claims: A British soldier is alleged to have cut the fingers off dead Taliban fighters . Honorary colonel of the Argyll's Cadet Force Clive Fairweather added that he was 'baffled' by the allegation. He said that during training soldiers were told they must treat the enemy dead with respect. And he also revealed that taking trophies from the dead was a 'sure fire way' to provoke anger from locals. The MoD would not reveal the total number of allegations, regarding soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, currently being investigated. Violation: This photo shows the injuries suffered by Baha Mousa, who died while being detained by British soldiers in Basra . But a spokesman did tell MailOnline that the overall figure was very low. He said: 'This is not endemic.' He also confirmed the Special Investigation Branch, which specialises in cases considered too serious to be dealt with by the standard Royal Military Police, was involved in the case. And he added: 'This is a very serious allegation and it would be wrong for us to comment. An investigation is ongoing.' Douglas Young, executive chairman of . the British Armed Forces Federation, said: 'We don't know if there is . anything in these unproven claims, but the MoD is right to investigate . rigorously. 'British soldiers don't want anyone . serving alongside them who has been involved in such irrational, . unprofessional behaviour as is alleged.' The allegation comes a month after relatives of Iraqi civilians who were ill-treated and unlawfully killed by British troops during the Second Gulf War were told they would receive thousands of pounds compensation from the UK Government. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that the accused soldiers were, while at war in Iraq, governed by Europe's human rights convention. Judges overturned a 2007 House of Lords ruling that there was no UK responsibility regarding the deaths. In doing so they backed victims' relatives who insisted they should be treated in line with the safeguards of the human rights code. The cases before the human rights judges involved incidents between May 2003 and late June 2004, during the UK's time as an occupying power in Iraq. Three victims were shot dead or shot and fatally wounded by British soldiers, either on patrol or carrying out raids. Another died in an exchange of fire between a British patrol and some unidentified gunmen. Beaten up: Baha Mousa with his wife and children. The hotel receptionist died after being taken into custody by British soldiers in Basra in 2003 . A fifth victim was allegedly beaten and forced into a river where, as a non-swimmer, he drowned. The sixth death was Baha Mousa, seized by British troops from the hotel along with nine other Iraqis by members of the 1st Battalion The Queen's Lancashire Regiment (QLR). He was taken to a British military base where he was beaten and died of asphyxiation two days later with 93 injuries identified on his body. A seventh victim, Hilal Abdul-Razzaq Ali Al-Jedda, 54, is a British and Iraqi national now living in Istanbul. He was arrested in Iraq in October 2004 by American soldiers accompanied by Iraqi national guards and British soldiers, on suspicion of terrorist involvement in Iraq. He was taken to a detention centre in Basra run by British forces. Periodic reviews concluded he was a threat, but he was released - more than three years later - without charge. Relatives of all victims insisted they were within UK jurisdiction when they were killed or detained, and therefore could expect treatment in line with the safeguards of the human rights code. The human rights judges ordered the Ministry of Defence to pay Mr Al-Jedda damages of 25,000 euro (£22,400) and 40,000 euro (£35,700) in costs and expenses. The relatives of those who died - apart from Baha Mousa for whom the UK authorities accepted human rights responsibility - were awarded 17,000 euro each (£15,200)in damages, and a total of 50,000 euro (£44,700) in costs and expenses. A public inquiry into the case of Baha Mousa will conclude later this year.",MoD launches probe into 'very serious allegation'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:10 PM on 4th November 2011 . A new poll has found anti-Semitic views are rising in America. A nationwide survey released today by the Anti-Defamation League found that 15 per cent of adults – nearly 35million adults – hold deeply anti-Semitic views, an increase of three per cent from a similar poll conducted in 2009. Experts say old stereotypes about Jews and money appear to be more widely accepted among Americans as the downturn in the economy persists. Prejudice: A nationwide survey found that 15 per cent of adults - nearly 35million - hold deeply anti-Semitic views . The 2011 Survey of American Attitudes . Toward Jews in America, a national telephone survey of 1,754 adults, was . conducted October 13-23 by Marttila Strategies of Washington, DC and . Boston. The survey shows that at a time of high unemployment and economic . uncertainty, age-old myths about Jews and money and Jewish power in . business endure, with a surprising number . of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews. Over the last decade, the highest . level of anti-Semitic attitudes was reported in 2002, when an ADL poll . found 17 per cent of Americans harboured anti-Jewish attitudes. Nineteen percent of Americans answered . 'probably true' to the statement: 'Jews have too much control/influence . on Wall Street' - an increase from 14 per cent in 2009. The survey found 14 per cent agreed with the . statement 'Jews have too much power in the U.S. today' - an increase . from 13 percent in 2009. Research: In the 11-question survey a surprising number of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews . And 15 per cent agreed that Jews are 'more willing to use shady practices' - up slightly from 2009. Sixteen per cent agreed that Jewish 'business people are so shrewd, others don't have a chance' - up from 13 per cent in 2009. Thirty per cent believe that Jews are . 'more loyal to Israel than to America,' 'a percentage that has remained . virtually unchanged since ADL's benchmark survey in 1964, despite the . changing make-up of the U.S population', according to the organisation. Anti-Semitic propensities are measured by an 11-question index developed by the Anti-Defamation League more than 40 years ago.  The index includes 11 statements used to gauge the anti-Semitic attitudes of the respondents. In the new survey a surprising number of Americans agreed with sharply worded criticisms of Jews: . 'Nearly half' of all respondents . agreed with the statement that Jews 'stick together more than other . Americans', and 33 per cent said they believe Jews 'always like to be at . the head of things'. Thirty-one per cent of Americans . agreed with the statement 'Jews were responsible for the death of . Christ; and one-quarter of Americans believe that Jews 'still talk too . much about what happened to them in the Holocaust'. ADL National Director Abraham H . Foxman said: 'It is disturbing that with all . of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, . anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not . insubstantial segment of the American public.' 'The stereotypes about Jews and money . endure, and the fact that more Americans are now accepting these . statements about Jews as true suggests that the downturn in the economy, . along with the changing demographics of our society, may have . contributed to the rise in anti-Semitic sentiments,' said Mr Foxman. 'Once again the old anti-Semitic standbys about Jewish loyalty, the . death of Jesus and Jewish power remain strong.' According to the ADL poll, the most . educated Americans are largely free of prejudicial views.  Less educated . Americans are more likely to hold anti-Semitic views. The poll found that 22 per cent of who . graduated high school or completed some high school harbour strongly . anti-Semitic views, as compared to 13 per cent among those who completed . some college, and nine per cent among those who graduated from college. The poll also looked at anti-Semitic . views among significantly large minority groups. It found that Hispanic . Americans born outside of the U.S. are more likely than Hispanics born . in the U.S. to hold anti-Semitic views.  According to the survey, 42 per . cent of foreign-born Hispanics hold anti-Semitic views, as opposed to . 20 per cent of U.S. born Hispanics. In 2011, 29 per cent of . African-Americans expressed strongly anti-Semitic views. That . percentage is consistent with the findings of past surveys. Jews were found to be held in high . regard on many key measurements, however.  Even Americans who hold the . most anti-Semitic views agreed with many positive statements about Jews. Seventy-nine per cent said they . believe Jews have a strong faith in God; sixty-four per cent said they . believe Jews have contributed much to cultural life of America; and 83 . per cent say they emphasise the importance of family life. The survey was conducted with a base . sample of 1,200 plus an oversample of 243 African-Americans and 227 . Hispanics, bringing the oversample for both communities to 400 each.

But now the man behind the Vans phenomenon has died. James Van Doren passed away on October 12 at his home in Fullerton southern California, his wife, Char, has revealed. Co-founder: James Van Doren and his brother were behind the Vans brand of shoes that became part of skateboarding culture . Popular: Vans canvas shoes were embraced by the skateboard culture and became a nationwide sensation when Sean Penn wore a checkerboard pair in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' He was 72 and was suffering from cancer. Mr Van Doren and his older brother Paul cooked up their iconic brand of shoes in their family rubber factory  in the 1960s. Almost immediately, they turned out to be the perfect fit for the skateboarding culture that swept southern California. But most importantly, once you slipped on a pair of Vans, you never fell off your skateboard. At least not until you crashed it. Mr Van Doren, whose background in chemistry and mechanics contributed to that unique, slip-resistant design. The brothers were working for a sports shoe company in the 1960s when Paul suggested they and two friends form their own business. Skater culture: A skateboarder wearing vans performs a big ollie over a ramp . They would name it Vans and create an instantly recognisable logo with a capital V whose elongated tail covered the rest of the word. They decided to keep their prices low by cutting out the middle man, choosing to manufacture the shoes themselves and sell them at their own retail store in Anaheim. Initially, the company was so small that its first store carried only display samples. A customer would order a pair of shoes and the brothers would go next door to the family rubber factory to make them. Often they would use patterns and designs the customers had brought in themselves. Professional skater Rob Lorifice (right) watches Shaun White practice before a Vans sponsored event . But most importantly, they would make the shoes' soles with a unique, waffle-like design perfect for gripping a wood surface like the top of a skateboard. 'They got it right the first time. The sole they use, it's called the waffle sole. Nothing else seems to work nearly as good for skateboarding,' said Herb Hogen, a former competitive skater who has been wearing Vans for 30 years. Then, . in 1982, the shoes got a gigantic promotional boost. Sean Penn, in a . breakthrough role that would make him a star, played quintessential . stoned surfer-dude Jeff Spicoli in the film 'Fast Times at Ridgemont . High.' And he wore a pair of Vans with a distinctive checkerboard . design. Vans trainers are celebrity favourites. Selena Gomez, Jessica Biel, Taylor Swift, Zac Efron and Justin Bieber are all fans, and Kristen Stewart (pictured) is so fond of her checkered pair she wore them to leave her footprints in cement at a Graumans Theatre ceremony yesterday. The trainers have been paired with everything from little black dresses to a head-to-toe emo look – and everything in between – bringing a grungy look to any outfit. But they were originally intended for a pretty niche market when the first store opened in 1965. Soon the shoes seemed to be ubiquitous with skateboarding across the country. 'If . you saw another guy wearing Vans, you immediately knew they were a . skateboarder and you immediately had a connection,' said Hogen, 42, a . bicycle mechanic from Missoula, Montana, who still skates for fun. 'The checkerboard pattern skyrocketed after that,' recalled Char Van Doren. Teens continue to wear it to this day, and Vans continues to market to alternative youth culture, announcing a collaboration with the rock group Pearl Jam earlier this year. Over the years, however, the company did run into some bumps. As the sports shoe business exploded in the 1980s, competitors who produced shoes with cheap foreign labor nearly ran Vans out of business. The company had to seek protection in bankruptcy court. 'We had kind of gotten away from our sweet spot and off track into athletic shoes that were expensive to make in America,' Mr Van Doren's nephew Steve Van Doren told the Los Angeles Times. A court-ordered management shake-up in 1984 led to the departure of James Van Doren. Control of the company was returned to his brother Paul, who came out of semi-retirement. Four years later, an investment banking company bought Vans, which has been sold several times since. In 2004, Vans Inc, then headquartered in Santa Fe Springs, was bought by Greensboro, North Carolina-based VF Corp, a clothing company with brands such as Wrangler jeans, Vanity Fair lingerie and The North Face outdoor line. The Vans office is now in Cypress, where several Van Doren family members still work. As for James Van Doren, his loyalty to the American-made shoe never wavered. His wife says he wore Vans deck shoes 'every day of his life'. Mr Van Doren's body was cremated and his ashes may be scattered in Hawaii. A memorial Mass is planned for Friday at Fullerton's St Juliana Falconieri Catholic Church. Along with his wife and brother, Mr Van Doren leaves his sons James Jr, Mark and Eric; another brother, Robert; and a sister, Bernice Chute.","Contributed to the unique slip-resistant design of the trainers .

Mariah Yeater has claimed Justin Bieber had told her it was his first time when they had a seedy liaison backstage at one of his concerts. Yeater, 20, who alleges that Bieber is the father of her baby, said the 17-year-old singer had told her he was a virgin before hastily removing her clothes in a bathroom. Californian Yeater also claims that her sexual encounter with Bieber was 'brief, lasting . only approximately 30 seconds'. Here is the first photo of the Californian woman who has alleged was secretly fathered by the pop world's biggest teen idol, Justin Bieber . Yeater reportedly . claimed in court papers that she had sex after the singer’s October 25, . 2010, concert at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles. In an affidavit, she allegedly said a . security guard working for Bieber approached her and ‘asked if I wanted . to meet Justin Bieber’ before shepherding her backstage. ‘After waiting for a short period of . time with several young women, Justin Bieber appeared and engaged me in . conversation,’ Miss Yeater reportedly says. The first picture: Justin Bieber fan Mariah Yeater is seen for the first time with the child she claims was fathered by the teenage idol . ‘Immediately, it was obvious that we . were mutually attracted to one another, and we began to kiss. Shortly . thereafter, Justin Bieber suggested that I go with him to a private . place where we could  be alone. ‘I agreed…and on the walk to a private area, he told me he wanted to make love to me and this was going to be his first time.’ She said he led her to a bathroom . where ‘immediately his personality changed drastically’. Baby daddy? The singer performed on Dancing With The Stars last night . She allegedly . claimed: ‘He began touching me ... at the time I asked him to put a . condom on for protection, but he insisted that he did not want to.’ Yeater now wants the 17-year-old to . take a paternity test to ‘scientifically confirm’ he is the father of . her three-month-old son, according to Star magazine in the U.S. In court papers filed on Monday, she is also demanding Bieber 'provide adequate support for  my baby'. Bizarre: Yeater poses with cling film wrapped around her face in a picture on her Facebook page . Saucy: In another shot, Yeater shows off her figure and her tattoos by lifting up her top and displaying her stomach . A spokesman for Bieber denied the 'malicious' allegations while the star himself dismissed them as 'gossip'. 'I’m gonna focus on the positives...the music,' he tweeted yesterday. Yeater claims she was 19 when she was . seduced by the Canadian, who is currently dating Selena Gomez, 19, best . known for her role on the Disney show Wizards of Waverly Place. Bieber has publicly blasted casual sex . in the past, saying: ‘I don’t think you should have sex with anyone . unless you love them.’ In a bizarre twist, however, Miss . Yeater may be the one who is in trouble because Bieber was 16 at the . time of the alleged incident. Birth certificate: The birth certificate of Tristyn Yeater, who a lawsuit alleges is Bieber's baby is seen without the father's details on it . Focusing on music: The 17-year-old teen idol took to his Twitter page today telling fans that he was choosing to ignore the rumours and rather concentrate on his music . Under California law, the legal age of . consent is 18 and police are required to launch a rape inquiry into any . claims of illicit sex. The baby – Tristyn Anthony Markhouse Yeater – was born on July 6. Meanwhile, Yeater's grandfather Eddie Markhouse has come forward to insist his granddaughter is telling the truth. He . told Radaronline.com: 'I don't know the whole story. But, from what I . understood, she met him at a concert and he sent two security guards . down off of the stage to bring her backstage to meet him. Getting prepared: Justin is seen ahead of his Dancing With The Star performance . Post show: It has been reported the woman claims she had sex with the underage star when she was aged 19-years-old, backstage after one of his concerts in Los Angeles . 'She's basically an honest good person. She's got a big heart. She's a good kid and she loves this baby.' Bieber has sold millions of records . around the world after first being discovered in 2008 when a talent . manager spotted his videos on YouTube. His debut album My World went platinum. What will Selena say? Justin has been dating his girlfriend for the past ten months . Out and about: Selena Gomez also stepped out tonight despite the rumours and attended a charity event in L.A. Bieber was raised by his mother, . Pattie as a devout Christian and says he talks to Jesus and 'he’s the . reason I’m here'. He is said to pray before concerts. Bieber has been dating girlfriend Selena Gomez since the end of last year but . the couple waited until the Oscars in March to make their first public . debut together.

Michel and Lynda Thibodeau sued Air Canada for not respecting their right to be served in their mother tongue during a flight from the country's capital Ottawa. Despite speaking fluent English, Mr Thibodeau complained that he was not greeted in French when the pair checked in for their flight or at the airport's boarding gate. Language campaigner: Michel Thibodeau sued Air Canada when airline staff failed to greet him in French . He also branded the airline's employees 'malicious, oppressive and reprehensible' for not answering his questions in French. The pair also complained that when they ordered a 7Up drink on the plane, the English-speaking air hostess brought them a Sprite instead. Mr Thibodeau had sued Air Canada for £350,000 for breach of the Official Languages Act, under which Air Canada must communicate and provide services in English and French. But a Canadian federal court ordered the airline to pay the couple £7,850 in damages and apologise. The ruling has reignited debate over Canada's linguistic divide. The country is officially bilingual but arguments are often stirred by nationalists in French-speaking Quebec. Payout: Mr Thibodeau also complained when an air hostess brought him a Sprite instead of a 7Up . Mr Thibodeau said after the ruling last week: 'This was a violation of my linguistic rights, and at some point you have to stand up for your rights or lose them.' He also filed a similar language complaint against Ottawa's bus company in 2002 after a driver greeted him with 'hello' instead of 'bonjour'. Canadian constitional expert Michael Behiels said: 'Canada is an officially bilingual country and Air Canada is bound by the Official Languages Act. 'If it doesn't respect the Act, then that will aggravate the separatists in Quebec and we don't want that to happen.' An Air Canada spokesman said the firm is studying the ruling.","Couple claim airline 'didn't respect their right to be served in their mother tongue'

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 8:54 AM on 4th November 2011 . Back in work: Controversial doctor Gideon Lauffer, who is alleged to have carried out botched operations which killed or seriously injured more than 20 patients, is working again at a London hospital . A  controversial doctor alleged to have carried out botched operations which killed or seriously injured more than 20 patients is working again at a London hospital, it emerged today. Gideon Lauffer was suspended from the medical register for six months in 2010 following the deaths of two people. It was found that he had acted inappropriately and not in the best interests of some of his patients. However, now that the suspension period is over he is able to resume practicing and is now working at St Thomas' Hospital. Previously-fit pensioner Terry Harris, 68, died after Mr Lauffer perforated his bowel during a routine gall bladder operation in 2007. Allan Scamell, 63, died in September 2007 following surgery for a hernia in which Mr Lauffer allegedly sewed his bowel to the wall of his abdomen. In another case, Mr Lauffer performed surgery which led to damage to a patient's testicle. A General Medical Council (GMC) panel determined that some of his actions were inappropriate, not in the interests of the patient and not of a standard to be expected of a registered medical practitioner. However, the six-month suspension was a far more lenient sentence than the GMC itself wished to impose. It had recommended to its independent panel that Mr Lauffer be struck off. But it was overruled by the panel which makes the final decision on disciplinary hearings. Earlier this year, a review hearing placed conditions on Mr Lauffer's registration, including that he needed supervision. Controversial: Doctor Gideon Lauffer is now working again at St Thomas' Hospital in London . Mr Lauffer is now working for Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. The case has led for calls for the system to be overhauled to protect other patients. The GMC, which is answerable to Parliament, is powerless to challenge the panel. Mr Harris' widow, Ann, 60, today told the Evening Standard: 'This isn’t just about Terry. This man seems to have done a lot of damage and we don’t feel we have a voice.' The GMC is now seeking a right of appeal in cases where it thinks panelists have been too lenient. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said today: 'Our role is to protect patients. This is undermined when panels do not take the action we believe is needed to do this. 'We are pressing for the right of appeal of these decisions as part of our ongoing reforms to ensure that patients are fully protected.' A statement from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The Trust can confirm that Gideon Lauffer is currently employed as a clinical fellow in the emergency medicine department. 'He has returned to work to retrain in a non-surgical specialty and works as a junior doctor under the close supervision of consultant staff. 'He was employed by the trust with full knowledge of the conditions placed on his practice by the GMC and remains in close contact with the GMC, as do the staff supervising his retraining. 'This is in line with national arrangements whereby NHS organisations assist in supporting medical staff who are returning to work.' Mr Lauffer, who lives in Hendon, told the Evening Standard: 'I want to apologise to my former patients and their families for any  mistakes that I have made.'","Controversial doctor now working at top London hospital .

Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp has told how he knew he was in trouble when he felt chest pains while running on a treadmill. Speaking at his Dorset home where he is recovering, Mr Redknapp revealed how he felt his chest tighten and 'struggled to breathe'. The 64-year-old, who lives in Sandbanks, . Bournemouth, was in 'excellent spirits' this week after undergoing . heart surgery to widen his narrowed arteries. Yesterday, he told The Sun how the . scare - which he described as a 'warning sign from within' - would not . stop him running and vowed to one day complete the marathon. He even pledged to be back at work 'within a couple of weeks' and reassured supporters that the heart trouble would not stop him doing the job he loves. Mr Redknapp, who has been taking pills for his narrow arteries, told the newspaper he jogs for about half an hour several times a week to stay in shape. But on the day of the scare he'd only been running for a couple of minutes when he felt his chest constrict and stopped immediately. London-born Mr Redknapp, who has been in charge of the White Hart Lane club for three years, said he went to see the Spurs doctor and then a specialist on Saturday before going into hospital on Monday. The grandfather, who does not smoke and rarely drinks, said he was 'sort of half conscious' while surgeons inserted two metal 'stents' to widen his arteries and improve blood flow. The father to football pundit Jamie and model Mark insisted he had not had a heart attack and said the surgery was 'no big deal'. He said: 'I love my football and wont be walking away any time soon. I can assure everyone I'm doing OK.' On the mend: Mr Redknapp pictured with his much loved pet bulldogs has been recovering at home in Sandbanks, Bournemouth . However, now out of hospital, he joked his wife Sandra is 'already fed up with me being back at home' and said his many get well messages had really cheered him up. Mr Redknapp, who also had stints at West Ham United, Portsmouth and Southampton, added: 'I have only been in hospital - and there are people in there dying and suffering far worse than me.' He recalled the danger to his life in 1990 when he was pulled from the wreckage of a car crash during the World Cup in Italy. Five people, including AFC Bournemouth's managing director Brain Tiler were killed. Animated: Redknapp on the touchline during Tottenham's clash with QPR on Sunday .

Mr Redknapp was resigned to watching Group A leaders Spurs lose 1-0 to Russian side Rubin Kazan on the television last night. Assistant manager Kevin Bond and . first-team coach Joe Jordan took charge of the team for the match. Mr Redknapp, who insists he looks after himself despite his stressful job, makes the 250-mile round trip to the club's Essex training ground most days. He admitted in March 2010 that he had started talking heart pills . upon the advice of his doctors, but stressed it was not a major problem. Writing . in his Sun column at the time, Mr Redknapp said: 'About a year ago I needed to . take heart pills and I am still taking them regularly.

On the stresses of management he . added: 'After a game I cannot sleep, there is too much going on in my . head as I go over moves, think about game plans, think about which . player has had a good or bad game - and it's worse if you lose.'

'Knowing Harry he will want to rush back, but it's important that he only does so when he has recovered properly.' Mr Redknapp is not the first football manager in recent times to have undergone heart surgery. Gerard Houllier had to have an . 11-hour emergency aortic dissection after experiencing heart problems at . half-time during Liverpool's game against Leeds in 2001, and the . Frenchman required a similar operation last season when in charge of . Aston Villa.

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 9:55 AM on 4th November 2011 . Britain's beleaguered Post Offices came under attack yesterday in a move which will leave millions of savers stranded. In a shock announcement, National Savings & Investments revealed plans to end its 150-year relationship with the network. It marks a watershed moment for the two organisations, which used to be one company called the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. They were separated in 1969. Goodbye letter: National Savings & Investments are to end their 150-year relationship with the Post Office . The country’s 11,800 Post Offices . are a vital lifeline for savers, particularly the elderly, who go into . their local branch to withdraw money from their NS&I savings. NS&I . products, such as its Investment Account which has 2.4million users, . are hugely popular because it is the only savings giant which offers a . 100 per cent guarantee on all money. But . yesterday NS&I said it has decided to gradually cut its ties with . the Post Office, in a move described by postal experts as ‘bitterly . disappointing’. They fear it is another nail in the coffin for the Post Offices which, in many villages, represent the only remaining shop. Over . the next two years, NS&I will force all its customers to start . using the internet, the telephone or the post to contact them. They will . not be able to use the Post Office for common transactions such as . depositing or withdrawing money. There . is only one exception. Premium Bonds will still be bought and sold at . Post Office counters for at least the next four years. The . contract will be reviewed in 2015, although an NS&I spokesman said . yesterday that a review is ‘perfectly normal’ and should not raise . alarm. She added: ‘We intend for Premium Bonds to remain on sale over the Post Office counter.’ The Post Office has been . haemorrhaging lucrative Government contracts, such as renewing the BBC . TV licence. Most recently, it emerged it will lose the £20million a year . so-called ‘Green Giros’ contract – the payment of benefit cheques to . vulnerable people with no bank account. George Thomson, general secretary of the . National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, said: ‘We are surprised and . bitterly disappointed by NS&I’s decision. This news reinforces the . urgent need for ministers to deliver on their pledge to make the Post . Office the “front office” for government.’ Ministers have repeatedly pledged that . there will be ‘no programme of closures’ like under the previous . Government. When Labour came to power in 1997, there were just over . 19,000 outlets in the UK. As a result of Labour’s closure programme, . there are now 11,800. The first two NS&I accounts to be . hit – the Investment Account and the Easy Access Savings Account – have . a total of more than 2.5million customers who have a total of . £6.2billion with NS&I. But . last night it said the Children’s Bonus Bonds, which has 1.2million . customers, will also disappear from Post Offices at some point. An . NS&I spokesman said: ‘We have not finalised our plans but we expect . them to be only available from NS&I.’ The . decision was fuelled by the Post Office’s decision to set up its own . savings arm, in a joint venture with the Bank of Ireland in 2004. It has . around £13billion of savers’ money. A . Department for Business spokesman said: ‘This Government is committed . to the Post Office network, which is why we have set aside £1.34billion . of funding over the next four years to help secure its future.’ Ian Tonks, national officer at Unite, . said: ‘This will only serve to increase financial exclusion, preventing . citizens without access to the internet from accessing NS&I . products.’","Federation of Sub-Postmasters: 'We are surprised and .

A railway crossing keeper in charge of a level crossing was so drunk on duty he could not be woken up, a court heard. Peter Singleton, 29, of Sandal, Wakefield, was warned he could face jail after being found slumped in his cabin as a passenger train waited on the track. An ambulance was called after a colleague failed to rouse Singleton, who was supposed to be manning the control barrier at Doncaster Road, Wakefield, in West Yorkshire. When he was eventually woken, he admitted he had drunk three pints of cider before he came on duty. An . empty two-litre bottle of cider was found in his locker at work and . Singleton admitted working on a railway while unfit through drink. A . breath test showed he was nearly three times the drink-drive limit and . just under eight times the strict Network Rail limit for employees. The control barrier at Doncaster Road is used by 65 passenger, freight and express trains every day. A colleague arrived to take over from him at 8.15am on October 18 and noticed a passenger train waiting 250 yards up the line. He expected the keeper to come out of his cabin to close the gate so the train could pass. Diane Gomersall, prosecuting, told . Wakefield magistrates: ‘He could see this defendant in his chair with . his head back and his eyes rolled back. ‘The crossing is known to be the second busiest in Europe due to a nearby depot.’ Drunk worker: Peter Singleton was supposed to be manning this control . barrier at Doncaster Road, Wakefield, in West Yorkshire . The railworker pinched Singleton's ears and called his name to try and wake him but failed. He then called an ambulance and Singleton was finally woken up. He later told police he was a crossing keeper in a ‘safety critical’ role. The court heard he was a recovering alcoholic and was also bulimic. He had worked for Network Rail for six years and had up until that point had an exemplary record with the company. Defending Mike Devlin, for Singleton, told the court; ‘He had no intention to drink at work that day. At some stage later on in the shift he did drink that cider.’ The crossing keeper has been suspended on full pay but accepts he will lose his job. Bench chairman Barbara Phipps said the offence was made worse because he was virtually unconscious while doing a job which affected people's lives. Singelton was warned he could face jail when he is sentenced later this month.","The railway crossing keeper was three times the drink-drive limit .

And it is among young people that the carrying  and use of knives . appears to be most prevalent. ‘The message has to be reinforced . every time that a death occurs from the use of a knife that punishment . and deterrents to protect the  public are the prime purposes of . sentencing, whatever the age of  the accused.’ Shaw’s victim had a young daughter . and his girlfriend was pregnant with their second child at the time of . his death. The court heard that Shaw had two run-ins with Mr Smith on . the fateful day and initially packed a knife in his lunchbox on the way . to classes before ditching it. He later armed himself with a second knife, which he took from the kitchen at home, in order to  stab Mr Smith. Prosecutor Michelle Colborne QC said Shaw talked about his intention to launch a knife attack. She said: ‘He was going to give him a . couple of stabs in the leg.  He wanted to show him who was who.’ Mr . Smith, who was unemployed, died in the village of Moorends, near . Doncaster, on March 23 this year. The pair both lived in the village. Shaw accepted he stabbed Mr Smith during an altercation in the street after school, but claimed it was an accident. The prosecution said Mr Smith had told friends he was going to attack – or ‘bang’ – the 15-year-old. ‘He said he had some trouble with a . lad who wanted to fight with  him, but he didn’t appear to be fazed by . this,’ said Miss Colborne. When the pair encountered each other, . they began arguing and Mr Smith ran at Shaw and swung  a punch. Shaw, . who had the knife up his sleeve, retaliated and began  shouting at his . rival before stabbing him twice. Shaw then threw his arms up in triumph and ran away, leaving his rival to die ‘a very speedy death’. The weapon was later recovered from a . drain with the victim’s blood on it. When arrested, Shaw, who is now . 16, told police Mr Smith had pushed him and he just reacted with a knife . he had found earlier that day, which he later admitted was a lie. Shaw had been permanently excluded . from school for fighting and had a conviction at 13 for assault when he . kicked a boy on the ground. He has also had a reprimand  for threatening behaviour and a warning for anti-social behaviour. After the trial, Detective Chief . Inspector Matt Fenwick of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This case has . greatly affected the community of Moorends, where both Joseph Smith and . Jordan Shaw are from. ‘The two young men were out in Moorends with their friends on  the evening when Joseph was attacked.’ The victim’s parents, Betsy and . Charles Smith, said: ‘The day we lost Joey was the saddest day of our . lives. Six months later, you  can almost touch the grief in the family . home. ‘He had the rest of his life ahead of him and two beautiful children to watch grow up. ‘No one will ever know what went . through one boy’s mind as he  took the life of another, and whatever . happens it will never bring Joey back.’","Shaw was permanently excluded from .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 5:47 PM on 4th November 2011 . A little boy suffered horrific injuries after he was crushed by a stone wall while out playing with friends. Harley Chivers, six, was left with a huge gash to his head, a broken arm and needed emergency facial surgery after the wall, near his home in Cwmtillery, South Wales, collapsed. His mother, Claire Hockey, was horrified as the youngster turned up at home, covered in blood and nursing his arm on October 26 and immediately called an ambulance. Recovering: Harvey next to the wall that collapsed on top of him, pictured with his mother Claire . He was taken to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, where the true extent of his injuries were revealed. His arm had to be put in a cast, his two front teeth had been pushed back chipping his jaw bone, his lip and knee had to be stitched and the back of his head was glued and needed 15 stitches. Doctors said it will take nine months for the Blaentillery Primary School pupil to make a full recovery and that he will be scarred for life. Ms Hockey said her son and his friend told her that one of the children had pulled at a stone in the wall while they were playing that lead to its collapse. She said Harley told her stones had hit him but had then rolled off meaning he could get back up and make it home. He . had used his arm to protect his face when the wall fell saving himself . from injuries that could have been even more devastating. Wounded: Harvey covered in bandages, cuts and bruises while in hospital after the incident . She said: 'He was crying and he kept saying, 'I'm dying'. I just screamed. There must have been a weakness in the wall for it to happen. 'I know these walls are all around the area but they shouldn't be by a children's play area. 'Harley is getting better now but he has been in so much pain and been so scared. A Blaenau Gwent council spokeswoman said it was clear that the wall had been vandalised due to gaps in the standing wall where stones had been removed. This had caused a layer of stones to collapse. She said: 'We are now working with Gwent Police in order to make further investigations. Several follow-up visits to the site have also been made'.","Blaenau .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Created 10:17 PM on 13th July 2011 . Official figures yesterday showed that the number of foreign born men and women in work soared by 334,000 to more than 4million over the last year. However, the number of British-born workers finding employment in the same period - up to the end of March this year - rose by only 77,000. Workers wait outside Wickes in Tottenham, north London. Official figures show the number of foreign born men and women in work soared by 334,000 to more than 4m . The revelation, by the independent Office for National Statistics, will fuel the explosive debate over 'British jobs for British workers'. Earlier this month, Iain Duncan Smith broke Cabinet ranks by warning that a new generation of young men and women will be condemned to a life on benefits without tougher measures to stem the flow of migrant workers. The Work and Pensions Secretary said that his expensive back-to-work schemes will fail without stricter controls. And he urged British businesses to give young people coming off welfare and back into employment a fair chance, and 'not just fall back on labour from abroad'. Mr Duncan Smith's comments provoked a furious backlash from British business leaders who said that British youngsters were too lazy, ill-educated and lacking the work ethic to compete for jobs. Outspoken: How the Mail reported Iain Duncan Smith breaking Cabinet ranks over the migrant jobs situation on July 1 . They also blamed the welfare system for not encouraging more unemployed British people to find work. Recent figures show that Britain's population increased by nearly half a million last year, driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates. Between 1997 and 2010, more than half of the rise in employment in the UK was accounted for by foreign nationals. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: 'It is impossible to look at these figures which show a substantially greater increase in the foreign-born workforce than in the British-born workforce without deducing that there has been a  significant impact on the prospects for British workers. 'There no point in being in denial about this. 'British employers surely have a responsibility to consider the wider implications of who they employ.' The ONS figures showed that UK unemployment as a whole has fallen by 26,000 in the three months to May to 2.45million. The unemployment rate was 7.7 per cent - down from 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter. But the numbers claiming the Jobseeker's Allowance jumped by 24,500 to 1.52million - the biggest such increase for two years. Of those, nearly half a million are women - an increase of 9,500 and the highest rise in women claiming unemployment benefits for 15 years. Recent figures show that Britain's population increased by nearly half a million last year, driven by high levels of immigration and rising birth rates . Mr Duncan Smith's outspoken comments were highly unusual and were seen as a warning to Prime Minister David Cameron not to give in to Liberal Democrat demands for a softer stance on immigration - an issue that remains close to the top of voters' concerns. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said last night: 'These figures are exactly why Iain felt the need to speak out about this. 'We are doing everything we can do to get people into jobs in the short term, but if businesses keep falling back on foreign labour, we are going to face this problem again and again. 'He is very concerned about the impact of this on the economy.' The ONS yesterday stressed that the figures for the number of non-UK-born people includes individuals who were born outside the country, but also have British nationality. However, the number of non-UK nationals finding jobs also rose 239,000 from a year earlier to 2.5million. The employment rate for UK-born people aged from 16 to 64 was 71 per cent, compared with just 67.3 per cent for non-UK-born people. The ONS statistics are also set to raise questions about the Government's decision to set a cap on the numbers of foreign migrants. Some Treasury officials are worried about the effect of the cap on tax receipts as the numbers of migrants contributing to the economy and paying taxes continues to increase. Meanwhile, the ONS figures indicated that the number of new jobs created in the private sector was still outstripping Government job losses with an extra half a million jobs created in the last year. There was also a drop in youth unemployment among 16 to 24 year-olds by 42,000 to just over 4million. Chancellor George Osborne had been hoping for a strong boost to employment. But ministers yesterday admitted the figures showed that the Government still faces a 'big economic challenge'. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, warned: 'With the economy going through a very soft patch, the growth outlook muted and increasing job cuts on the way in the public sector, we strongly suspect that unemployment is headed up over the coming months.'","Number of foreign born men and women in work soars by 334,000 to over 4million .

"By . Katherine Faulkner . Last updated at 9:51 AM on 4th November 2011 . Living in fear: Genet Kidane had begged police to protect her . An illegal immigrant who murdered his ex-lover by pushing her 30ft from a bridge had already been deported from Britain three times. Younas Beraki shoved mother-of-one Genet Kidane on to a busy dual carriageway because he could not accept that she had ended their relationship. Only weeks earlier, the failed asylum seeker from Eritrea in North-East Africa had been deported from the UK for a third time – but he smuggled himself straight back into the country in a lorry. Beraki, 33, has been given a life . sentence after admitting murder and has been told he will serve at least . 12 years in prison before facing deportation for a fourth time. Last night Miss Kidane’s daughter, . Senait Gebremichael, demanded to know how Beraki, an alcoholic, was able . to evade border police four times in six years. She asked: ‘How could he possibly slip through immigration four times? ‘It is unbelievable. We have been let . down. If they had dealt with him properly then maybe my mother would . still be alive today.’ Miss Gebremichael, 22, also accused . the police of being ‘careless’ with her mother’s welfare after she . repeatedly told them Beraki planned to kill her. ‘My mother and I warned . them so many times that he was a madman, but they did nothing,’ she . said. ‘They ignored her pleas. She was helpless.’ Miss Kidane, 41, came to the UK with . her daughter in 2005 after being persecuted for her Christian beliefs in . her native Eritrea and had her asylum application granted. As well as working long hours as a . cleaner at a Primark store in Coventry, she spent her spare time . volunteering with a charity.

Kidane begged police to protect her from Beraki, who refused to accept . that she had ended their relationship. She told police that Beraki had . described in detail how and where he would eventually kill her. Prosecutor Emma Cutts told Coventry Crown Court: ‘He had said he would come behind her, push her and kill her. ‘She even told the police about the . very bridge that she subsequently fell to her death from, as this was . the route for her to go to work, and was frightened he might push her . off it.’ Last night the Independent Police . Complaints Commission said it had launched an investigation into the . police handling of the case. Beraki first came to the UK six years ago after deserting from the Eritrean army. He was refused asylum but remained in the country living ‘a feral existence’, the court heard. Miss Kidane ended their year-long . relationship in July 2010 because of his drinking problem and his . ‘obsessive’ and ‘controlling’ behaviour – but he continued to harass . her. In the months before her murder Miss Kidane repeatedly told police that he was threatening her. Beraki was also arrested in August . 2010 for hitting a female stranger at a Birmingham New Street railway . station. He was given a conditional discharge. In December 2010, Beraki was deported . for a third time to Italy – but a month later Miss Kidane frantically . called 999 to say that he had returned and was trying to break into her . house. In a desperate attempt to escape him, Miss Kidane decided to move . to London but she was killed the day before she left. She was walking to Primark at 6.50am . on January 12 when Beraki, who was living in a nearby hostel, attacked . her on a footbridge over the Coventry ring road. Miss Gebremichael, who also worked as a . cleaner at the shop, was a short distance behind her mother. She heard . her mother screaming ‘Why?’ as she was pushed off the bridge and fell . 30ft onto the busy road below. Moments later, she saw her mother lying dead in the road. Beraki jumped off the bridge, but survived. Judge Richard Griffiths-Jones told . him: ‘You were deported from this country but you came back, in my . judgment, to pursue your obsession of not accepting the end of the . relationship. ‘When you came back you quickly came . back to Coventry and to where you knew she [Miss Kidane] was living. Your obsessive knowledge about her routine meant that you knew where and . when she would be going to work. ‘And you foreshadowed by what you had . said to her that you would kill her in the way you eventually did. You . had decided she would die because if you couldn’t have her, she wouldn’t . have a life of her own.’ The UK Border Agency said it would seek to deport Beraki for a fourth time after he had served his sentence.",Younas Beraki shoved Genet Kidane on to a busy dual carriageway after she ended their relationship .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:00 PM on 4th November 2011 . Claims: Out of work equity research analyst Todd J. Remis says photographers missed 15 crucial minutes of his wedding . Disgruntled groom Todd J. Remis is suing photographers who took his wedding photos and is demanding his $48,000 nuptials be re-staged - even though he is divorced and his ex-wife may have moved to Latvia. The out of work equity research analyst from Manhattan, New York, wants the entire wedding replayed to capture the final 15 minutes of his wedding to Milena Grzibovska, which took place in 2003. Mr Remis alleges that established firm H & H Photographers of Irvington, Westchester County, missed the last dance of the day and the moment his new bride tossed her bouquet. And he has demanded in court papers . that the firm repay him the $4,100 cost of the wedding photos and that . he is awarded $48,000 to allow him to re-enact the day and fly in guests . to New York. The . photographic studio have pointed out however that the bride is believed . to have moved back to her native Latvia and has proved uncontactable. Do-over needed: Photographers snapped this photo of Remis with new bride Milena Grzibovska, but missed the moment she tossed her bouquet . Stunning: The Castle on the Hudson where Remis married. He wants his 2003 wedding re-staged at the upmarket venue and that the photographers from the day to foot the bill. The couple married in front of 40 guests at Castle on the Hudson in Tarrytown, Westchester, but separated in 2008. Their divorce was finalised in 2010. Photos of the day show a happy bride and groom surrounded by family, including the bride's mother, Irina, and her sister Alina, who travelled from Latvia for the occasion. But a few months after the contract to photograph and video the event had been signed, Mr Remis complained to the firm that the three man crew had missed the last 15 minutes of his wedding day. Photo company founder Curt Fried, who sold his half of the business to his son Dan, right, says Mr Remis doesn't even know where his wife lives now . In his lawsuit Mr Remis argues that the . images he saw were 'unacceptable to colour, lighting, poses, . positioning' and that a video of the event, which he expected to be six . hours long was only two. He testified: 'I need to have the wedding recreated exactly as it was so that the remaining 15 percent of the wedding that was not shot can be shot. 'We would like to have it documented for eternity, for us and our families.' But photographic boss Curt Fried, 87, who handed over his half of the firm to his son in 2004, said: 'He wants to fly his ex-wife back and he doesn't even know where she lives.' Mr Fried maintains that Mr Remis was given 400 proofs to allow him to choose final images for the wedding album. Mr Remis claims 'the office kept everything'. Anger: Mr Remis claims that the photographers for his wedding day missed the moment his bride threw her bouquet to waiting guests . A 2004 magazine article, however, published a photo of the bride and groom, which Mr Fried says his firm took. H & H Photographers are a 65-year-old studio known among Bronx residents for chronicling weddings, bar mitzvahs and communions. Mr Fried's son, Dan, added that he . and his father were paying their legal bills and that he considered the . case to be 'an abuse of the legal system.' They say their bill has already topped the sum that Mr Remis is seeking from them. The . lawyer acting for Mr Remis works for the same legal firm, Goodwin . Proctor, where his father, Samuel M., is a litigation partner. He states he is paying his own legal fees. Justice . Doris Ling-Cohan of the State Supreme Court in Manhatten has dismissed . most of the grounds for the lawsuit, which was filed in 2009 just before . the statute of limitation was about to expire. But she has allowed it to proceed to determine whether there had been a breach of contract. She . ruled against claims of 'infliction of emotional distress' and said in . her opinion earlier this year, quoting Barbra Streisand's classic song . 'The Way We Were': 'This is a case which it appears that the ""misty . watercolour memories"" and the ""scattered pictures of the smiles .. left . behind' at the wedding were more important than the real thing.' The next court hearing into the case is scheduled for next Thursday. Mr. Remis, who said at his deposition that he has not been employed since . 2008, his lawyer, Frederick R. McGowen, and Ms. Grzibovska have not been . contactable.","Groom says he wants to have his wedding day 'documented for eternity'

A woman who killed her co-worker in . a Lululemon yoga clothing shop has been convicted of . first-degree murder and now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life behind bars. Brittany Norwood, 29, used at least half a dozen weapons from inside the store to kill Jayna Murray, 30, in a 'prolonged and brutal attack' on March 11. These included a hammer, wrench, knife and peg used to hold up a mannequin. Norwood was yesterday found guilty after a jury in Montgomery County, Maryland, took an hour to reach a verdict. Weapons cache: This handout photo shows the blood-soaked weapons allegedly used by Brittany Norwood to kill Jayna Murray in a 'prolonged and brutal attack' on March 11 . Deadly: This hammer was one of the many weapons used in the murder of Jayna Murray . Crime scene: The blood-spattered evidence in the brutal bludgeoning death of Jayna Murray at a Lululemon yoga store in Bethesda, Maryland, was shown in court . Colleagues: Brittany Norwood (left) murdered her co-worker Jayna Murray (right) in a frenzied attack at a yoga store in Bethesda, Maryland, in March. A jury yesterday took an hour to reach its guilty verdict . Norwood attacked Miss Murray inside the Lululemon Athletica shop in Bethesda, Maryland - a Washington, DC suburb - and then staged a robbery. She used numerous weapons to kill her, then lied . and told police that they had been attacked by masked men. Her defence lawyer conceded that Norwood killed Miss Murray, but said it happened during a fight and wasn't premeditated. A judge's ruling prevented both sides from discussing the fight, but prosecutors have previously said it began after suspected stolen merchandise was found during a search of Norwood's bag. Weapon: Part of a metal merchandise rack that was one of at least six weapons used to murder Miss Murray. Norwood is said to have beaten her colleague over the head with it for around 15 minutes . Tragic end: Jayna Murray was bludgeoned to death after confronting Norwood about stealing a pair of pants . Mother: Phyllis Murray is comforted by a woman wearing a pin of her daughter, at security while waiting to re-enter the trial of Brittany Norwood . The legal argument was aimed at sparing . Norwood a first-degree murder conviction, which can carry a sentence of . life in prison without parole. Murray allegedly found a pair of pants in Norwood's purse at the end of the work day, when they did mutual bag checks, as per store policy. Norwood initially said she'd bought them from another employee, but Murray called the other employee, they denied it, and Murray confront Norwood for stealing. Miss Murray's family choked back tears as . the verdict was read and a 'yes' sounded from their side of the . courtroom. Norwood and her family sat impassively and declined to . comment afterwards. Brutal: A photograph inside the Lululemon Athletica shop in Bethesda, Maryland, where Norwood bludgeoning her colleague to death before staging a robbery . Brand: A black bag with a Lululemon logo belonging to Jayna Murray is part of evidence that was presented by the prosecution in the trial of Norwood . Norwood's attorney Doug Wood said she was disappointed at the speed of the verdict. She said: 'I think that we were surprised that . this happened so quick. I thought we had established a pretty good case . for second-degree murder.' Mr Wood said he expects to appeal the verdict and will argue against a life-without-parole . sentence that prosecutors are seeking. Sentencing is set for January . 27. State's Attorney John McCarthy told jurors during closing arguments that there was abundant evidence of premeditation. He said Norwood lured Miss Murray back to . the shop after closing by saying she had forgotten her wallet and . needed to get back inside. Scene of the crime: Norwood tracked bloody footprints around the shop to make it appear as if a man had been there, the court heard .

A medical examiner, Mary Ripple, . testified that she found at least 331 wounds on Murray's body and that . the woman was alive for the duration of the attack. Juror Donny Knepper, 36, said the . panel was essentially convinced from the start of deliberations. He said . he was swayed by the sheer number of wounds.

"By . Daniel Miller . Last updated at 4:08 PM on 4th November 2011 . British adults are turning their backs on children and young people and see them as violent animals who are beyond help, according to children's charity Barnardos. A recent survey of more than 2,000 people found almost half believe British youngsters are becoming 'feral' and 'behaving like animals' while a worrying ten per cent believe that badly behaved children over the age of 10 are 'beyond help'. The charity has drawn comparisons between Britain and continental Europe where people are said to be far more supportive of youngsters and parents more willing to help each other out within their communities. Grim outlook: A survey by children's charity Barnardo's has revealed a . depressing state-of-affairs where huge numbers of British adults see . youngsters as 'animals', 'feral' and 'beyond help' In countries such as Spain, children are seen as everyone's responsibility while in Britain adults have become judgemental and less ready to step in if they notice a mother struggling to cope, they claim. The charity points to figures which show that in continental Europe there are fewer child deaths and fewer numbers of children taken into child protection. Barnardo’s chief executive Anne Marie Carrie said: 'It is depressing that so many people are ready to give up on children, writing them off as ‘animals’ and ‘feral’. 'What hope is there for childhood in the UK today if this is how adults think?' Tarred with the same brush: While only a tiny proportion of children took part in the recent riots across London and other urban areas, Anne Marie Carrie, the head of Barnardo's, believes all children are at risk of being stigmatised . Ms Carrie believes that children who behave well, working hard at school, volunteering for charity or joining groups like the Brownies or the Cubs are being stigmatised by a small minority who behave badly. She points to the recent riots in London and other urban areas, where only a tiny proportion of children took part, as an example of how people's views can be distorted. Chief executive of Barnardo's, . Anne Marie Carrie, hopes attitudes in Britain can become more like those in continental Europe . She added: 'We seem to have forgotten the fact that most children are well behaved and instead we are unquestionably accepting a stereotype of young people as criminal and revolting. 'We aren’t asking people to put up with yobbish behaviour, but we do need to change our attitudes towards troubled children. The small minority of children who come across as angry and abusive have sadly often been scarred by their upbringing. 'But it’s never too late to believe in children and change their life story – it doesn’t have to end how it began.' ICM Research reveals that the public holds a negative view of all children, despite the majority being well behaved, attending school, taking part in activities and a significant number contributing to their communities and volunteering. Barnardos argues that the difficult behaviour of youngsters in contact with the youth justice system needs to be tackled more effectively pointing to the numbers who have experienced troubled upbringings or who have speech or language difficulties. Evidence shows that the sort of whole family approaches Barnardo’s runs which challenge and support parents and their children to face up to their behaviour and accept responsibility for their actions have a major impact. Life Story will premiere across the Channel 4 network, after 8.20pm, on Thursday, November 3 and will run until Friday, November 18.","Children' charity Barnardo's fear well behaved children are being stigmatised by a tiny minority .

"By . Michael Seamark . Last updated at 12:11 PM on 3rd November 2011 . Almost £1billion was wiped off Lloyds’ market value yesterday after the boss of the state-backed banking group went on immediate sick leave. Shares plummeted after António Horta-Osório began an enforced break barely eight months after taking on one of the biggest jobs in British finance. The Portuguese-born banker, who became chief executive in March with a package worth around £8.3million, has been diagnosed with extreme fatigue and stress due to overwork. Fatigue: António Horta-Osório, pictured with wife Ana at a charity event, was put on sick leave just six months after becoming chief executive of Lloyds with a package worth £8.3m . Doctors ordered the 47-year-old father of three – who was also promised a ‘golden hello’ worth up to £4million in shares – to rest for six to eight weeks because he is physically and mentally exhausted. City sources say he is unlikely to return to his post. The unexpected announcement caused turmoil in the part- nationalised bank and sent Lloyds shares sliding. By the close of trading last night they had dropped by 4.4 per cent, ending the day 1.36p down at 29.2p. That was the biggest percentage fall in the FTSE 100 and wiped £930million off the value of Lloyds Banking Group. It left the taxpayer, which owns 40 per cent of the bank, £372million worse off. After an emergency board meeting, Lloyds group finance director Tim Tookey was appointed ‘interim’ chief executive. But he has already announced his resignation and leaves early next year. Mr Horta-Osório – distinguished by his slicked-back hair and designer stubble – has lured many former colleagues from Santander, his former employer, to Lloyds. Exhausting work: The banking chief was in the process of implementing his vision for Lloyds, which included the layoff of around 15,000 . Mr Tookey was one of the last of the . old guard remaining from the regime of ex-chief executive Eric Daniels, . who was behind the disastrous takeover of HBOS and until recently was . still being paid almost £100,000 a month by Lloyds for doing nothing. Mr . Horta-Osório’s ‘leave of absence’ means Lloyds is left with no boss and . a new management team to confront a deepening economic crisis. His . illness comes at a bad time as he was implementing his strategic vision . for the bank, which included overseeing an EU-imposed sale of 632 . branches, a revamp of its Halifax brand and around 15,000 job losses. Lloyds is due to announce its third-quarter results next week which, given the state of the economy, are unlikely to be good. In . a recent interview, Mr Horta-Osório, whose hobbies include swimming . with sharks and scuba diving, described ‘working 24/7’ in his efforts to . turn around Lloyds. First . signs that all was not well with the banker – hailed at home as . Portugal’s third-greatest export behind footballing stars Jose Mourinho . and Cristiano Ronaldo – followed his non-appearance at a parliamentary . committee meeting on Tuesday. The . bank issued a statement yesterday saying: ‘The board of Lloyds Banking . Group announces that following medical advice António Horta-Osório is . taking a temporary leave of absence from his duties as group chief . executive due to illness.’ The bank added: ‘Antonio is expected to return to his position before the end of the year.’ But . last night doubts remained about whether he will return to one of the . toughest jobs in British banking, second only to Stephen Hester’s task . as boss of state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland. One banking source said: . ‘There’s no way he can come back.’ By Alex Brummer City Editor . Financial fatigue: Lloyds CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio has been signed off sick due to 'overwork' The stress-related absence of António Horta-Osório from Lloyds is the latest in a succession of shocks that have undermined the strength and reputation of what was once considered Britain’s best-run bank. It leaves Lloyds rudderless at a time of ferocious storms in the financial world, with the flood waters from the euroland crisis already spilling over on to this nation’s shores. What is even more shocking is that Mr Horta-Osório was seen as the great hope for retail banking in Britain. In conversations we had over recent months he pledged to bring a laser-like focus to improving customer service and ensuring that small businesses would be treated with the care and respect they deserved. His leave from the boardroom – officially a short break but already being interpreted as a permanent departure – means those ambitions have been thwarted for the time being. His temporary successor, finance boss Tim Tookey, will need to concentrate on steadying the ship and controlling the panic in the shares rather than overhauling and improving the business model. The troubles at Lloyds are a parable of mishandling by government. Lloyds is Tesco-like in its dominance of high street banking, with a 30 per cent share of retail operations as a result of the calamitous merger with Halifax Bank of Scotland in the wake of the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The then Prime Minister Gordon Brown nodded the deal through without reference to the Competition Commission, which polices bids that threaten customer choice. Until that point Lloyds, run by the cautious American Eric Daniels, had taken a totally different path to that of its rivals on the high street. Final straw: The financial crisis in Europe sent Lloyds' shares tumbling . Instead of rushing into investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages and dodgy property lending, it had concentrated on serving the domestic consumer and business market. The conservatism of Lloyds made it a very popular share with private investors (including this writer) and its stock was famous for offering a dividend interest rate yield far better than anything that could be obtained in the savings accounts offered by  its branches. The HBOS takeover changed the group. It provided Lloyds with a dominant role on the high street through Halifax and its offshoots but it also brought with it Bank of Scotland, which had become a favourite lender to every business spiv that knocked on its door. 'The big question now is whether the star banker will ever be robust enough for the challenges ahead' The enormous mistakes made by HBOS meant that when the banks were required to strengthen their balance sheets in October 2008 the enlarged Lloyds accepted £20billion of cash from the Government, which grabbed a 40 per cent share of the enlarged bank in exchange. When he arrived, the new Portuguese chief executive had a huge legacy of problems to deal with. What he found most difficult, however, was running a publicly quoted company in the full glare of the media. In his previous job, as the boss of the British subsidiary of the Santander bank, he was not exposed to the same pressures. By all accounts he found the constant juggling of different interest groups very trying. He needed to deal with the Government, the Bank of England, UKFI (the holder of the Government’s 40pc stake), the City shareholders and a vast workforce. And behind the steely façade and handsome head of slicked back hair Mr Horta-Osório was struggling. The final straw was the financial crisis in Europe, which sent Lloyds’ shares tumbling. The quick exit from the heavy hand of government ownership has looked impossible as the shares have tanked. The big question for Lloyds chairman Sir Win Bischoff now is whether his chosen star banker will ever be robust enough for the tremendous challenges ahead.","Antonio Horta-Osorio became Lloyds boss in March .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 5:49 PM on 3rd November 2011 . A British woman working for a multinational oil company has revealed she was asked to recruit mercenaries to take part in an operation to rescue Muammar Gaddafi, it emerged today. Sarah Penfold, who is of Kenyan descent and works in security, claimed her brief was to round up a team of South African 'soldiers of fortune' as revolutionary forces closed in on the now-deceased Libyan tyrant, the Independent reported. When Gaddafi was captured and killed last month as he tried to escape the city of Sirte he was accompanied by South African mercenaries. Meanwhile, the dictator's son Saif . al-Islam Gaddafi is thought to have disappeared into the Sahara Desert . accompanied by mercenaries recruited at the same time. Revolutionary fighters inspect a storm drain where Muammar Gaddafi was found last month. A British woman working for a multinational oil company claims she was asked to recruit mercenaries to join an operation to rescue the Libyan tyrant . When Gaddafi was captured and killed last month as he tried to escape the city of Sirte he was accompanied by South African mercenaries . It is feared he could remain hidden for months as the International Criminal Court and Libya's new rulers argue about who should try him. Based in Nairobi, Ms Penfold - an 'executive protection and security specialist' - has frequently been associated with private forces working in Africa. She denies ever having had any contact with the Gaddafi family. According to the Independent, she told an acquaintance in South Africa: 'I was asked by a friend to get some guys together to do private security detail and training in Libya for a well known oil company to protect their assets and personnel. 'I sent an email round asking guys to go for an interview and forward it to others. That's all.' But it is thought that some of these mercenaries went on to take part in assisting Gaddafi in his unsuccessful attempt to flee Libya. At least two were killed, and several injured, when Gaddafi's convoy was attacked by a Nato air strike, before the dicatator was pursued by rebel forces on the ground. Meanwhile, the hunt continues for Saif Gaddafi, who is thought to be hiding out in the border region of Chad, Niger and Algeria. Nothing has been heard of Saif since sources said almost a week ago that Tuareg nomads were escorting him and that he was close to the Mali border. Mali legislator Ibrahim Ag Mohamed indicated Saif is not in Mali or Niger. He could be feeding disinformation as . he considers his options out in the desert that is impossible to police . and favoured by other outlaws like drug dealers and Al-Qaeda fighters. Various . sources indicate he could be plotting a counter-revolution, scheming . about a getaway to a friendly country, or negotiating his surrender. Exact whereabouts unknown: Saif Gaddafi is thought to have disappeared into the Sahara Desert accompanied by mercenaries recruited by the British woman . Saif and his late father's former chief of military intelligence, Abdullah al-Senoussi, have reportedly been travelling in separate convoys escorted by Tuaregs, who understand best how to survive in the desert. Loyalty to the ethnic group trumps nationality, and the Tuareg's traditional stomping grounds stretch across North Africa, from Morocco and Algeria to Libya and south-west to Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad. Saif and al-Senoussi are both wanted by the ICC for allegedly organising and ordering attacks in Libya that killed civilians during the revolt. More than a dozen countries in Africa do not recognise the international court, but even some that do ignore its arrest warrants amid criticism that the Hague-based court goes after a disproportionate number of Africans. Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir, wanted for genocide and war crimes committed in Darfur, attended a conference in Malawi last month with no problem, though Malawi is a member of the ICC. In the area where Saif is believed hiding, only Algeria is not a signatory.Algeria was a staunch supporter of Muammar Gaddafi and has given refuge to his wife, a daughter and two other sons, but now is trying to establish ties with Libya's new leaders.","Nairobi-based Briton works for multinational oil firm .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 10:11 AM on 3rd November 2011 . Controversial: Government expert David Norgrove, pictured, says that grandparents do 'damage' children during divorce cases . Badly behaved grandparents 'damage' children because they interfere in divorces and ramp up conflict between couples, it was claimed today. Acrimonious couples also use their parents as 'weapons' to get one over their partners as they break-up, according to the Government's legal advisor on families. David Norgrove has been leading a review on family law and said while he accepted that grandparents are often 'extremely important in a child’s life' they can be demanding when it comes to access to their grandchildren. He says this can mean that children do not always come first in a bitter divorce, hurting the innocent youngsters involved. 'Grandparents can be used by parents as a way of getting at their ex-partner. Grandparents are not always straightforward in the way they behave and the result can be damage to children,' he said. 'Not all grandparents are good grandparents. One of the separating parents can use his or her parents as a weapon against the other partner. 'We should not be putting all the emphasis on the rights of the adults. The question is wrong: it should be what is in the best interests of the child, not what is right for the adults.' Controversially his review has dashed fathers’ hopes of securing equal rights to share custody of their children in the event of a split. He also rejected any claims that Grandparents also do badly after a divorce saying they must still go through the courts over access to children. Interfering: Grandparents are also used as 'weapons' in break-ups while children are left to suffer, it has been claimed . 'There is no evidence that courts unreasonably refuse the ability of a grandparent to bring an application for contact with their grandchildren,' Mr Norgrove said. A new DIY system is being proposed to speed up divorces away from court. The 'divorce information hub' would be online with a step-by-step guide showing how to end a marriage legally as well as set up maintenance and access arrangements for children. The new report suggests this route is the best way to keep parents and their children out of the courts. New parenting agreements will help decide where the child will live and also how much contact the other parent will have. The plan will mean that couples will only go to court as a last resort if the process above fails and they cannot agree. But critics say that the Tory-ordered report does not follow through on their promises for equal rights for all family in child-access arrangements. James Deuchars, of Grandparents Apart UK, said: ‘The Tories said before the election that grandparents were going to have more rights. This is a betrayal of that promise. It was all a con and a gimmick.' Mr Norgrove's 220-page review has been denounced as a ‘betrayal’ of the family as mothers still have more rights. Ken Sanderson, chief executive of Families Need Fathers, said the review's failure to recommend shared parenting legislation or a statement on the importance of both parents in law represents 'an abdication of their responsibilities to children and their families'. 'The core failing of the current family justice system is that the rights of children to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents, as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, are not adequately supported or enforced,' he said. Nadine O'Connor, campaign director of Fathers 4 Justice, added that the review was 'a monstrous sham and a bureaucratic exercise in improving the efficiency of injustice.' Sham: David Cameron's Government has been accused of reneging on promises made before the last General Election . The review called for parents to be encouraged to develop a parenting agreement 'to set out arrangements for the care of their children post-separation' to help eliminate disputes over contact and where the child should live. Mr Norgrove's report is also suggesting that more parents should spend less time in . court instead using 'do it yourself' websites where divorce forms can be . downloaded. The online process would force the couple into mediation before being put in front of a judge as a last resort. 'At the moment it is very hard to get hold of the forms. The aim is to . make it easier for people to do it themselves because the tendency is . for it all to get out of control,' he said. The report also called for the Government to develop a child arrangements order, which would set out plans for the upbringing of a child when a court is required to get involved. These orders should also be available to grandparents and wider family members with the permission of the court. The review also called for the duration of court cases to be restricted to six months - instead of the average 13 months now. Mr Norgrove said that making children wait well over a year for their futures to be settled was 'shocking'. 'This is why we are recommending legislation to ensure that child protection cases must not be allowed to take any more than six months, save in exceptional circumstances,' he said. He added: 'Every year 500,000 children and adults are involved in the family justice system. They turn to it at times of great stress and conflict. 'It must deliver the best possible outcome for all the children and families who use it, because its decisions directly affect the lives and futures of all those involved, and have repercussions for society as a whole.'","DIY divorces being proposed to force couples to avoid court apart from in the most acrimonious cases .

"'You need a structure, and this is a structure,' the judge . told Lohan before the actress accepted the terms of her new probation . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:38 AM on 3rd November 2011 . Lindsay Lohan has been sentenced to serve 30 days in jail after admitting she violated her probation. The troubled actress waived her rights at her probation violation hearing at the Los Angeles Superior Cour Airport Branch and admitted the violation. Judge Stephanie Sautner ordered the actress so surrender to the jail by November 9. She was not immediately put behind bars because the judge decided to allow her time to complete her nude photo shoot for Playboy, according to TMZ. Heading back to jail: Lindsay Lohan, pictured here arriving at an LA court today, has until November 9 to surrender for a 30-day term . Another day, another court hearing: The star admitted to violating her probation in theft and DUI cases . The star's lawyer, Shawn Holley, is . understood to have told the judge in chambers that her client had a $1 . million contract with Hugh Hefner's publication. Lindsay's jail sentence wasn't the only talking point today. The mark on the actress' left arm also caught the eye of some observers. While at first glance it appears to be a mere grimy smudge or bruise, it is in fact, an unfinished tattoo.She had outline of a young angelic girl (illustrated in full below) inked on last year. It was chosen because 'she liked the innocence of the girl', according to reports at the time, but it has never been completed. She must completed the shoot this . week or face being in breach of her contract and Sautner decided to . allow her one week to surrender, the website reports. In court, the judge imposed an otherwise strict probation regime, telling the actress: 'I'm giving you the keys to the jail.' Judge Sautner said: 'Miss . Lohan you are going to waive your right to the hearing and admit the . violation, do you understand?' Lohan replied: 'Yes, your honour' Sautner then sentenced the actress to . 30 days in jail with 270 days to be stayed as long as Lohan complies . with her probation conditions. The jail time can be reduced due to . overcrowding in Los Angeles jails - but Saunter was firm there was to be . no house arrest or electronic monitoring. TMZ reports that she may serve just minutes behind bars. A source within the Sheriff's Deptartment told the website that if someone receives a misdemeanor sentence of 90 days or less, they are routinely processed in and then released. 'She'll be out without even having to change her clothes,' the insider says. Judge Sautner told Lohan: 'You are to surrender by November 9 and begin serving 30 days. 'You will not be eligible for house arrest or electronic monitoring. 'When you get out you will report to the . probation department and Ms Mansfield. Good luck to you with Ms . Mansfield - she is no nonsense.' As well as serving the jail time the actress must continue her community service at the Los Angeles county morgue. In order to comply with the judge's strict order Lohan will spend virtually every day she is not in jail at the morgue. Judge Sautner said: 'The sentence I am going to impose is known as putting the keys to jail in the defendant's hands.' If she fails to abide by the schedule she could be sent locked up for another 270 days. Demure: The actress opted for a high-neck polka dot dress . Judge Stephanie Sautner may have sentenced Lindsay Lohan to 30 days in jail. But in all likeliness, the actress may not even spend a single night there - due to jail overcrowding. Lohan has to surrender to jail by November 9. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department, told TMZ said how long she stays in jail depends on when she decides to check herself in. Officials told the website that misdemeanour inmates only tend to serve 20 per cent of their sentence - although inmates sentenced to 90 days or less are processed and released immediately. Home from home: Lynwood Regional Justice Center where Lindsay has served jail time in the past . Only a backlog of people to process or delays in paperwork might mean Lindsay would have to stay the night. Even though Judge Sautner was strict about the terms of Lohan's sentence, prison officials told TMZ that a federal court order on overcrowding 'trumps everything'. In another twist, Lindsay could be in jail on the same day as her father Michael, who is currently in solitary confinement in the infirmary of the Orient Road jail in Florida. While Lindsay has to surrender to jail on November 9, her father will appear in court on the same day to face a judge on charges stemming from the breach of a restraining order against his former fiance Kate Major. It follows allegations he assaulted her - and he could face jail time for allegedly breaching the restraining order and contacting her. At the beginning of the hearing the . Los Angeles prosecutor told Judge Sautner Lohan had failed to keep . appointments at court mandated psychologist therapy sessions and failed . to attend mandated service at a downtown women's shelter in Los Angeles' rough skid row area. Judge Sautner said she had . made enquiries for Lohan to work at the Good Shepherd shelter for abused . families in Los Angeles but they did not want her. She said: 'They were . unwilling to take you because they do not think you are a good example . for women trying to put their lives back together.' However, the Los Angeles morgue where . Lohan has already been serving community service was happy to keep the . actress on, Sautner said. Ready for her close up: The media gathered outside the courtroom to capture the star's arrival . 'I am converting all your community service to the morgue,' Sautner said. When Lohan is released from jail she . will have to report back to the court December 14th having already . completed 12 days at the morgue. She will then have to complete 12 . days community service before a hearing on January 17 to have the 270 . day jail sentence stayed. She will have to complete an additional 12 . days by February 17 to have the sentence stayed again. And finally she . must complete another 17 days by March 29, which if she completes . successfully will result in her sentences being commuted to summary . probation without her having to appear in court or see Judge Sautner . again. 'You need a structure, and this is a structure,' the judge told Lohan before the actress accepted the terms of her new probation. Judge Sautner also told Lohan she must attend every court ordered psychological therapy session without fail. Sautner said Lohan should be under no . illusion that if she fails to stick to the letter of her orders she . will serve the additional 270 days. 'If probation officer Ms Mansfield notifies me I will put a warrant out for your arrest,' she said.","Actress likely to serve 'just minutes' behind bars because of overcrowding .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 3:33 PM on 5th November 2011 . A young Tory newcomer who was inspired by David Cameron to enter frontline politics has been elected leader of the party in Scotland. Openly gay Ruth Davidson, 32, only took a seat at the Scottish Parliament at the Holyrood election in May, but has already become the first overall leader in a shake-up of the party north of the border. She was immediately congratulated by Prime Minister David Cameron. He said: 'I am delighted to congratulate Ruth on winning this leadership election and look forward to working with her to strengthen the Union and build a better future for Scotland.' Elected: Ruth Davidson smiles moments before being announced as the new leader of the Scottish Conservative Party last night . Ms Davidson, a kick-boxer and former Territorial Army member, was elected in a closely fought campaign against three other candidates. Runner-up Murdo Fraser, who was eliminated in the last of three rounds of counting, had pledged to scrap the 'tainted' Tory brand, proposing to set up a new centre-right party for Scotland. The controversial plan prompted Ms Davidson, a regional MSP for Glasgow, to enter the race and defend the current Scottish Conservative and Unionist party. After being declared winner at the count in Edinburgh, she said: 'The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party is very much alive and kicking. 'It is now up to all of us to build on that momentum and drive the party forward to a new and exciting age of success.' As the successor to former leader Annabel Goldie, Ms Davidson will head a group of 15 Tories at the 129-seat Scottish Parliament, which is now dominated by First Minister Alex Salmond's SNP. Turning to the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence, she said: 'We in the Scottish Conservatives have a duty as well as an opportunity to be the party that stands up for Scotland as a vital component of the Union. Ms Davidson is congratulated by runner-up Murdo Fraser, was eliminated in the last of three rounds of counting . 'We must not allow the SNP to tear up . that right. Scotland is not being served if politicians behave like . rabbits caught in the headlights of Salmond's separatist steamroller. 'We must have the courage and . conviction to stop him in his tracks by always presenting and promoting . the positive case for the Union. 'Of course, a union that does not . adapt and evolve will inevitably become stale, so it is essential that . we adjust, refresh and revitalise the partnership. 'But strong, enduring marriages do . not end in divorce, they continue to provide safety, security and mutual . benefit and respect. That will always be worth fighting for. 'This is a time of generational . change for the Scottish Conservatives, a party for all, regardless of . age and of background. I want everyone to feel that they have a place, a . role and a voice that can and should be heard. 'I want to engage the whole party from the grass roots up and to extend that conversation with the electorate at large. 'The hard work starts here. Today is the first day of a new and bright future of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.' Ms Davidson will head a group of 15 Tories at the 129-seat Scottish Parliament, which is now dominated by First Minister Alex Salmond's SNP . Following the result, Mid Scotland and Fife regional MSP Mr Fraser underlined a potential division in the party. He said: 'Clearly I'm disappointed that I was not able to persuade more of our members that my vision for the future is the correct one. 'But I congratulate Ruth Davidson on her victory, and she will have my full support, as she tries to take the party forward. 'I think the bold and radical proposal that I had - to create a new centre-right party for Scotland, to replace the Conservatives - was a leap too far for the majority of our members. 'A sizeable minority, 45 per cent, voted for my proposal but it was not enough.' He secured 2,096 first preference votes against Ms Davidson's 2,278. David Mundell, the only Tory MP in Scotland, supported Ms Davidson's bid and said: 'Ruth embodies the radical, generational change that the party needs to rebuild and reclaim its place at the heart of Scottish politics and Scottish life. 'I look forward to working closely with her and I am certain she will be a first-class leader for the whole party.' Leadership challenger Margaret Mitchell, a late entry to the race, was knocked out with 472 votes in the first round. The fourth contender, Jackson Carlaw, who was taken to hospital with appendicitis during the campaign, was tipped by some to win, but was third with 830 first-choice votes. There were 5,676 votes cast in a turnout of 63.4 per cent.",Ruth Davidson is a former Territorial Army member .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:54 PM on 3rd November 2011 . Thirty large and profitable U.S. corporations paid no income taxes from 2008 through to 2010, despite making combined pre-tax profits of $160billion, a report out today said. A comprehensive analysis of 280 corporations on the Fortune 500 list found that their tax subsidies amounted to $222.7bn in the last three years. The report, from Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, arrives as Congress faces rising demands for tax reform but seems unable or unwilling to act. Under half: Corporations are paying far less income tax as a percentage than the statutory rate of 35 per cent, shown in graph of 2008 totals . Sliding: The 2009 graph shows how corporations started paying less tax, with the industrial machinery industry hitting negatives . Minimal input: Four major industries paid less than 10 per cent tax in 2010 . Pepco Holdings Inc, a Washington, D.C.-area power company, had the lowest effective tax rate, at negative 57.6 per cent, among the 280 Fortune 500 companies studied. The statutory U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 per cent, one of the highest in the world; but over the 2008-2010 period, very few of the companies studied paid it, said the report. The average effective tax rate for the companies over the period was 18.5 per cent, said Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, both think tanks. Their report also listed General Electric Co, Paccar Inc, PG&E Corp, Computer Sciences Corp, Boeing Co and NiSource Inc as among the 30 that paid no taxes. Corporations will say rightly that the loopholes that let them slash their taxes were perfectly legal, the report said. 'But that does not mean that low-tax corporations bear no responsibility. The laws were not enacted in a vacuum; they were adopted in response to relentless corporate lobbying, threats and campaign support,' the report said. Some of the 30 companies disputed the report's findings.

A Pepco spokesman said it 'pays all its required taxes.' Boeing paid its taxes 'between 2008-2010 ... Our effective income tax rate was 26.5 percent, 22.9 percent, 33.6 percent in 2010, 2009, 2008,' said a spokesman for the aerospace group. As Congress and the Obama administration struggle with a sluggish economy and high deficits, corporations are pressing Capitol Hill for more tax breaks and a lower corporate rate. Taxes are on the agenda of the congressional 'super committee' tasked with finding at least $1.2 trillion in additional budget savings by November 23, but it is so far deadlocked across a familiar divide - Republicans refusing any tax increases, Democrats defending social programs. On Tuesday, a panel of budget experts warned super committee members they would fail the country if they did not meet their goal. Financial markets have been waiting for many months for signs that Washington can get its financial house in order, but few have been forthcoming. The report referred back to the 1986 tax reform pushed through by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, who approved the largest corporate tax increase in U.S. history, largely by ending tax breaks, while cutting individual tax rates. Tax-dodge? Wells Fargo tops the list of 280 U.S. corporations receiving the most in tax subsidies, getting nearly $18 billion in tax breaks from the U.S. treasury in the last three years . 'Reagan solved the problem by sweeping away corporate tax loopholes,' said the report, which was coauthored by Citizens for Tax Justice chief Robert McIntyre. His research 25 years ago played a key role in convincing Mr Reagan reform was needed. The industrial machinery business enjoyed the lowest effective tax rate during the study period, while the highest rate was paid by healthcare companies, the report said. 'Big Business is getting away with taxation murder,' said Frank Knapp, vice chairman of the American Sustainable Business Council, a progressive business coalition. 'They pay little or no taxes on massive U.S. profits and then have the gall to lobby for a tax holiday to 'repatriate' profits they have stashed offshore.' What are some of the tax breaks that corporations enjoy? One big one is accelerated depreciation that lets them write off equipment faster than it actually wears out. Deductions on executive stock options help. So do tax breaks for research and development and for making products in the United States instead of overseas. Offshore tax shelters play a role, too. Power group Duke Energy Corp was one of the 30 companies listed as paying no income taxes in 2008-2010. Big profits: AT&T was another top tax subsidy recipient with $14.5 billion . Chief Executive James Rogers told Reuters that Duke cut its taxes thanks to accelerated depreciation, which he said helped the company build new plants and hire construction workers. Rogers is a frequent spokesman for a coalition of large multinationals seeking a tax break that would let them bring foreign profits into the United States at a reduced tax rate. Others among the 30 companies included power producer American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP), chemicals company DuPont and toymaker Mattel Inc. Like Duke, AEP said it benefited from accelerated depreciation. A Mattel spokesperson said the report's claims were inconsistent with the company's public financial filings. 'DuPont complies with all tax laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which it operates,' said a DuPont spokeswoman. The average effective corporate tax rate, as calculated by McIntyre's group, was about 14 percent before the Reagan reforms; afterward it shot up to 26.5 percent in 1988. As companies found their way around the reforms, the effective rate fell back to about 17 percent by 2002-2003. Unlike in Reagan's time, taming corporate tax breaks alone will not solve the deficit problem. Such breaks cost the government about $102 billion in lost revenues in 2011, a year when the federal deficit was an estimated $1.3 trillion. Corporate loopholes are dwarfed by tax breaks that benefit individuals, such as the mortgage interest tax deduction -- a middle class sacred cow, on its own worth $104 billion. Still, said the report: 'If we are going to get our nation's fiscal house in order, increasing corporate income taxes should play an important role.'","Average tax rate for 280 companies in study was 18.5 percent - less than half the statutory rate of 35 per cent .

"By . Stewart MacleanCreated 3:27 PM on 15th August 2011 . A Warthog might not be every housewife's first choice of pet - but Erika Tempel's beloved Org is firmly part of the family. The two-year-old wild pig has the run of her home, tucks into dinners of dog food and sleeps every night under a blanket on her sofa. The lucky animal is treated to his cosy existence after Erika adopted and hand-raised him when he was orphaned as a baby. Hogs and kisses: Tempel with her house-trained pet warthog Org at their home in South Africa . Erika, 50, who lives in South Africa, said: 'Some people think I'm crazy having a pet warthog, but Org is really loveable and an absolute darling to have around the house. 'We got him as a baby when one of the neighbours brought him in after his mother was killed. 'He was so tiny and vulnerable, and I nursed him by hand until he was old enough to be by himself. 'He lived in our front room, and when he was big enough I used to take him on long walks outside so he could get used to his natural surroundings. Pucker up: Erika gives her pet a goodnight kiss . Who's a boar? Erica's hog takes up most of the sofa . 'I always imagined he would go back and live in the wild again, but he obviously liked it too much with us.' Org is now firmly settled at the rural home Erika shares with her husband Hendrik, also 50. The warthog weighed just a few pounds when they adopted him in November 2008 but has since grown to around 12 stone. A helping ham: Org is bottle fed as an orphaned youngster . He now munches his way through at . least two kilograms of Pedigree dog food each evening, served up for him . in the kitchen from a dog bowl. And . on top of that he devours a pile of daily treats including dried . sweetcorn kernels, ginger biscuits, marshmallows and his favourite . Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Life imitating art: A warthog named Pumbaa featured in Disney's The Lion King . By . day tourist managers Erika and Hendrik let Org roam freely outside in . the private Fahad game reserve which they run in South Africa's northern . Limpopo province. But the loyal animal returns to their home each evening at dusk for his dinner and to relax in front of the television. Erika, a mother of three, said: 'He . has the best of both worlds because he goes out and spends the day with . the other warthogs but almost always comes home when it gets dark. 'We feed him and cuddle him, sometimes we clean him, and then he goes to sleep on the sofa. 'He's . getting really big these days and his tusks are sharp so we have had to . recover the sofas with a tough canvas lining or they would get ripped . apart. 'We also have to keep an eye on him . because if we leave him unattended he can open the door to the kitchen . and empty all the cupboards looking for food. 'Sometime we think he thinks he's a dog because he gets really affectionate and likes to be loved. 'I often share a sofa with him when we watch TV. We'll snuggle under a blanket as he likes to be close to me. Favourite spot: Erika's Jack Russell doesn't stand a chance as the warthog settles down for the night . 'Sometimes he'll take the whole sofa for himself and Hendrik and I will sit on the floor.' Warthogs are related to pigs and common across many parts of Africa. The tough animals usually live in burrows and survive by eating grasses or digging for roots. They were made famous by Pumbaa, the friendly warthog in Disney's 1994 cartoon movie The Lion King. But in the wild the animals are far from cuddly and are often known to attack a potential predator when cornered. Males can use their protruding tusks . to fight with others for dominance, and warthogs are reportedly able to . inflict deadly wounds even to lions. Org has also become a firm friend with . the couple's other pets, which include a pair of parrots and a lively . Jack Russell named Cody. Erika, who also runs a jewellery design business, said: ""You might not imagine that a warthog and a Jack Russell would get on but they are the best of friends. 'Cody often perches himself on Org's back when he's sleeping, and although they sometimes fight over the food it's always good natured.' She added: 'We have never forced him to stay here but he keeps coming back. 'It is great that he has time outside and now that he has reached maturity, he has found himself a girlfriend and this year will probably become a father. 'But we're delighted that he likes to come home every day, and people are always amazed when they see him sitting on the sofa. 'We have three daughters, and they all get on brilliantly with Org too. He really feels like part of the family now. 'I know some people might look at my Org and think he's ugly, but he's actually really loving and affectionate. 'They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I think he's gorgeous.'","Watches telly, eats marshmallows and pedigree chums .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Last updated at 11:27 PM on 25th October 2011 . Barack Obama jokily side-stepped a question about the GOP presidential candidates from Tonight Show host Jay Leno today. Leno had tried to get the President to talk about the Republican race, but all Mr Obama offered was a gag referencing television's Survivor programme. 'I'm going to wait until everybody is voted off the island,' Mr Obama said of the Republicans, provoking much laughter in the crowd at the studio in Burbank, California. Waiting game: President Barack Obama, pictured during an interview on the 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno' at the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, today, said he would not comment on GOP nominees . Cosy: Mr Obama got close to NBC producer Michelle Tasoff during the interview, where he joked he would wait until the Republican candidates had been voted off the island . Crying game: The President did not get the warmest of reactions from all those at San Francisco International Airport after recording the Tonight Show with Leno . 'Once they narrow it down to one or . two, I'll start paying attention,' he added, according to clips of the . interview released by NBC. Mr Obama also discussed the toxic . political environment in Washington DC, telling Leno that: 'I think the . things that folks across the country are most fed up with  - whether you . are a Democrat, Republican, Independent - is putting party ahead of . country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation.' The Tonight Show interview of Mr Obama airs in its entirety at 11.30pm ET. Mr Obama also discussed the fall and death of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. 'Well, this is somebody who, for 40 years, has terrorized his country and supported terrorism,' Mr Obama said. 'And he had an opportunity during the . Arab spring to finally let loose of his grip on power and to peacefully . transition into democracy. We gave him ample opportunity, and he . wouldn't do it. Latino event: Antonio Banderas hosted the fundraising dinner at the LA home he shares with his wife Melanie Griffith, where Eva Longoria told the crowd Mr Obama 'speaks to the Latino community' Common touch: Before attending the functions, President Obama made an impromptu stop at Roscoe's chicken diner . Loud applause: When the President vowed to tackle an overhaul on immigration laws the crowd, including comedian George Lopez and host Melanie Griffith, cheered . As for Gaddafi's shocking killing, Mr . Obama said: 'Obviously, you never like to see anybody come to the kind . of end that he did, but I think it obviously sends a strong message . around the world to dictators that people long to be free, and they need . to respect the human rights and the universal aspirations of people.' After the taping, Mr Obama headed to San Francisco for a Democratic campaign fundraiser. He was warmly welcomed at San . Francisco International Airport by all apart from one baby, who despite . the President's best hug, would not stop crying. Mr Obama arrived at the Today Show . having spoken to a star-studded crowd at the Los Angeles mansion of . Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith as part of the first ever Latino . fundraiser to support his candidacy. Guests paid between $5,000 and . $35,800 to attend yesterday evening's canapé event, where actress Eva . Longoria introduced the President and said: 'We applaud you from our . community; we thank you for everything you're doing.' In . one of his busiest donor outreach trips of the season Mr Obama also . went to film producer James Lassiter's LA home to adress an intimate . dinner crowd, which included actor Will Smith and basketball legend . Earvin 'Magic' Johnson. The gatherings were part of a three-day, . cash-generating trip through Nevada, Colorado and California, the . latter being Mr Obama's biggest donor state. Another stop: Mr Obama earlier attended a fundraising dinner at film producer James Lassiter's Hancock Park home, where he spoke to a crowd of 40 . Jokes: Will Smith, left, and Magic Johnson, right, were at Lassiter's house, where the President joked his bills could save billions so Americans can buy tickets to Smith's films and products from Johnson's business . Fascinated: Hilary Duff was at the first function and later tweeted: 'Wow just had the most interesting dinner' He raised about $1 million . in the Los Angeles area alone during the past two fundraising quarters, . according to the Associated Press. At Banderas' and Griffith's house, its entrance path lined with rose . petals and votive candles, Mr Obama told about 120 mostly Latino . contributors that he has kept a list of his campaign promises and that, . by his count, he has accomplished about 60 per cent of them. 'I'm pretty confident we can get the other 40 per cent done in the next five years,' he said to loud applause. The Griffith-Banderas event was the first Latino fundraiser for Obama's . candidacy, with donors giving at least $5,000 per person to attend. Alongside Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria was comedian George . Lopez, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, and mayors Antonio Villaraigosa of . Los Angeles and Julian Castro of San Antonio. The President drew the loudest applause when he vowed to tackle an . overhaul of immigration laws, a promise from 2008 that has gone . unfulfilled in the face of Republican opposition. Introducing Mr Obama, co-host Longoria told the group that he 'speaks to . the Latino community because he knows he's the President of all . Americans. 'And we applaud you from our community; we thank you for everything you’re doing.' There was a smaller crowd of about 40 present at Lassiter's home, which he shares with his wife, Mai. Hollywood star Smith, in an elegant three-piece suit, Magic Johnson, the . standout former point guard for the Los Angeles Lakers, and actress . Hilary Duff, each contributed $35,800 for the cozy dinner and a chance . to chat with the President. Mr Obama indulged in name-dropping during his speech, joking that his . mortgage refinancing plan 'could free up billions of dollars for . American consumers who can then shop and go to Will's movies and spend . money at whatever business Magic has and could help grow the economy . overall.' Mr Obama, eager to reinvigorate his supporters, ticked off his administration's accomplishments. 'Sometimes I think people forget how much has gotten done,' the . President said as he urged his backers to rally once again, at the same . time joking, as he often does, that he is older and greyer now. 'This election won't be as sexy as the first one. Back then it was still fresh and new. 'I didn't have any grey hair. Everybody loved the 'Hope' posters and all . that. This time, we've got to grind it out a little bit. Doing it for the kids: Obama poses for a picture with some young diners . Pressing the flesh: Customers seemed delighted that the president had stopped by to pick up a snack . 'We've got to grind it out. But the cause is the same. And my passion is the same. And my commitment is the same.' Singer-actress Duff tweeted afterwards: 'Wow just had the most interesting dinner with about 20 couples and @BarackObama !!Always fascinating to talk to such influential people!' Others at Lassiter’s Hancock Park home included Troy Carter, the manager . of Grammy award winner Lady Gaga. The singer herself was a guest at a . fundraiser last month at the Atherton home of Facebook chief operating . officer Sheryl Sandberg. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Mr Obama headed to a diverse neighbourhood . minutes from Lassiter's home south of Hollywood and stopped at . Roscoe's, a popular Los Angeles chicken restaurant chain. Displaying a campaign-style vigour, Mr . Obama roved through the dining booths greeting customers, leaving at . least one awestruck young boy holding his hand aloft after shaking the . President's hand. One man gave him a hug and a Hispanic man told his daughter that if she studied hard 'you'll be like him.'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:43 PM on 12th September 2011 . The plot of land known for a decade as Ground Zero today opened to the public for the first time since that terrible morning in 2001, transformed into a memorial consisting of two serene reflecting pools ringed by the chiselled-in-bronze names of the nearly 3,000 souls lost. The 9/11 memorial plaza opened its gates at 10am under tight, airport-style security. Visitors were allowed to walk among hundreds of white oak trees on the eight-acre site and gaze at the water on the exact spots where the World Trade Center's twin towers stood. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; Joe Daniels, Memorial President; Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council; and John Liu, City Comptroller (left to right behind queue) greet the first visitors on the first day that the 9/11 Memorial is opened to the public at the World Trade Center site today . Touching: Shauna Camp and Anthony Camp, who lost their uncle, Faustino Apostol Jr. in the attacks, view the panel containing his name during the first day that the 9/11 Memorial is open . Treasures: Visitors today make etchings of the names of victims inscribed on the wall surrounding one of the pools at the 9/11 Memorial plaza . They will also be able to run their fingers over the names of the 2,977 people killed in the terrorist attacks in New York, at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania, as well as the six who died in the bombing of the trade centre in 1993. Electronic directories with a 'Find a Name' button will help people locate their loved ones. One of the first members of the public to visit was Eileen Cristina, 64, of Lititz, Pennsylvania, who volunteered her services as a massage therapist to the landfill workers who handled the trade centre debris. She was today moved to tears by the moment. 'For me, the water element is very important, because water is so cleansing. Water can cleanse the energy of the area,' she said. Julio Portalatin, of Jersey City, New Jersey, had a ticket for 10.30am. 'I'm very, very drawn to this place,' said Mr Portalatin, who survived the attack on the North Tower, where he worked for an insurance company. He added: 'It's such a classy way to honour those who perished.' Prayer: Michael Barschi says a prayer for his cousin Neal David Levin, who perished in the attacks, as he kneels and makes a rubbing from one of the panels containing the names of the victims . Smiles: Olivia Norton (left) and Aubrey Finamore, children of Amy Norton and Peter Finamore, whose cousin Kevin Bracken was lost in the 9/11 attacks, play near stone benches . He and his wife got their tickets online three weeks ago 'to pay tribute, to pay honour, to the eternal-ness of it all.' The memorial plaza opened to the families of the victims for the first time on Sunday. Donald Rumsfeld has cancelled his subscription to the New York Times after being offended by Paul Krugman's column, which said the government reaction to 9/11 was 'shameful'. Mr Rumsfeld, Defense Secretary at the time of the attacks, tweeted this morning: 'After reading Krugman's repugnant piece on 9/11 I cancelled my subscription to the New York Times this AM.' Among the visitors on both Sunday and Monday was Jelena Watkins. Mrs Watkins' brother died at the trade centre, and she came from London for Sunday's 10th anniversary of the attacks. At the memorial, she and her husband held up their two children so that they could see their uncle's name. Luka, five, ran his hands through the water that pools under the names. 'I love it. It was a huge relief to see that it's actually beautiful,' Mrs Watkins said. 'It's the right feel. It's just so right. It's so spacious.' Although thousands of construction workers have come and gone from the site over the years, today marked the first time that ordinary Americans without a badge, a press pass or a hard hat were able to walk the grounds where the victims were once entombed in a mountain of smoking rubble. 'For the vast majority of the world, the images that they remember from this site are very difficult. It's the recovery period, it's seeing those images of the towers falling,' Memorial president Joe Daniels said Monday before the memorial opened. 'So when they come on now and see this place that's been transformed into a place of beauty, it's exciting.' Admission is free, but access is tightly controlled. Visitors need to obtain passes in advance, allowing them to enter at a specified time. No more than about 1,500 at a time will be allowed in. Warm welcome: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, right, greets the first members of the public to visit the National September 11 Memorial . Kiss from a rose: A rose and an American flag are stuck into the etched name of a firefighter who died in the 9/11 attacks . Orchard: A man and woman today rest on one of the granite blocks inside the National 9/11, looking out onto some of the hundreds of trees inside the complex . Visitors must empty their pockets, walk through a metal detector and send their handbags and backpacks through an X-ray machine. About 7,000 people were issued tickets for opening day. Some 400,000 have reserved tickets for the coming months, Mr Daniels said. The museum portion of the memorial complex is still under construction. The museum pavilion, a tilting structure that evokes the sections of the trade centre facade that remained standing after the towers fell, is scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the attacks. Eventually visitors to the underground portion will be able to gaze at such sights as the giant slurry wall, built to keep the Hudson River from flooding the trade centre's foundations, and the survivor's staircase that allowed so many people to flee to safety. But seeing the names was enough for many of the 9/11 families. 'It breaks me up,' said David Martinez, who watched the attacks from his office in Manhattan and later learned that he had lost a cousin and a brother, one in each tower. Debra Burlingame, whose brother, Charles, was the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77, cried when she found his name, grouped with other crew members and passengers aboard the flight. 'These are all his crew,' she said. 'I know all their families. These passengers, I knew their families. These people are real people to me. It's very touching to see all these people here together.' Sombre: Former U.S. Vice President Richard Cheney today listens to Memorial President Joe Daniels as he looks at one of the panels containing the names of the attack victims . Waterfall: Visitors today make an etching of victim's name inscribed on the wall surrounding one of the pools . Vast: People visit the South Pool at today's public opening for the National September 11 Memorial. The waterfalls cascading down the four walls of each fountain are the largest such fountains in North America . The letters in the names have been entirely cut out of the bronze, with only emptiness beneath them. The cost of the memorial and museum has been put at about $700million, with an annual operating budget of $50million to $60million. The non-profit organisation that runs the project has raised about $400million in private donations and is seeking federal funds so that the memorial and museum can be free of charge. The centrepiece of the memorial is the two giant, square pits and reflecting pools that sit in the footprints of the two towers. The waterfalls cascading down the four walls of each fountain are the largest such fountains in North America. Skyscrapers are now pushing upward all around the plaza, and the roar of construction will be a constant at the site for some time. One World Trade Center, the spire once called the Freedom Tower, is now 1,000 feet high and well on its way to becoming the tallest building in the U.S. at 1,776 feet — higher even than the twin towers. The steel skeleton of the new 4 World Trade Center is 47 stories high and counting. The memorial foundation has arranged for a separate entrance for relatives of the victims and plans to set aside certain days or hours where the plaza will be open only to firefighters, police officers and other emergency workers. 'People will have that very special feeling of stepping on ground that the public has not in the last 10 years,' Mr Daniels said last week. As for the tight security, he said: 'It's an inconvenience, but if you think about any site in the world, I think this is a place that people will expect to go through some security.' A look at the Sept 11 memorial and eight-acre plaza, which opens publicly at the World Trade Center site today:DESIGN: The memorial occupies half of the 16-acre World Trade Center site. Twin reflecting pools with cascading waterfalls are set within the one-acre footprints of the original twin towers. More than 400 swamp white oak trees are planned for the plaza (225 trees have been planted so far).NUMBERS: The memorial is 176 feet in perimeter. The waterfalls are 30 feet deep from street level. Each pool pumps 26,000 gallons of water per minute.NAMES: The 2,983 names of the victims of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade Center truck bombing are inscribed into bronze parapets surrounding the twin memorial pools.ARCHITECTS: Architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker created the memorial design selected from a global design competition that included more than 5,200 entries from 63 nations.COST: $700 million-plus to build. Annual operating budget, $50 million to $60 million.ADMISSION: Public admission is free but requires reserving a ticket.","Airport-style security and long queues greet visitors to $700m plaza .

"Head to the north of this chic Italian region and find an affordable bolthole . By . Mary Wilson . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 14th October 2011 . Tuscany somehow always sounds expensive, but Garfagnana, a lesser-known area in the north, offers value for investors and second-home owners. It has dramatic topography, quite different to southern Tuscany, tucked as it is between the Apuan Alps and the Apennines. It is ideal for outdoor pursuits, and like the rest of the region is famous for its food and wine — in particular chestnuts. Chestnut trees abound among the oaks and pines. Value for money: Homes in need of renovation are available for less in Garfagnana . If you enjoy renovating homes, there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation. Alfa Immobiliare, with an office in Lucca, has a number of ‘wrecks’ on its books, including a small estate at Fosciandora, near the medieval walled town of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana. This comes with around seven hectares with chestnut and oak trees, a small vineyard and stone farmhouse, two barns and a shed, all aching for more than a spruce up. It is on the market for £329,000, but something of this size would cost almost double in Chiantishire. ‘Prices have dropped over the past couple of years, some properties by 10-15 per cent and there is still room for negotiation on the asking price. It’s a very good time to buy,’ according to Alfa Immobiliare’s Marco Haney, a Scot with Italian heritage who moved to the area  ten years ago. ‘Abandoned villages and hamlets are also coming onto the market, often being sold by people who no longer have the money to fulfil their dream.’ One project well under way, is Selva Piana. This four-and-a-half hectare estate sits near the hamlet of Fiattone, five minutes from the town of Gallicano. The developers, Dennis and Jane Cardosi, who live partly in Essex, partly in Italy, have converted the original farmhouse and are building eight new detached villas, four semi-detached villas and ten apartments with a communal pool. Cheaper alternative: The entrance to the old town of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana where there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation . These are high specification with marble or granite kitchen worktops, bespoke chestnut doors and window frames. The rooms are spacious, some with vaulted wooden ceilings, and all have glorious views across the Garfagnana valley. Prices range from £310,000 for a two-bedroom apartment and from £568,000 for a three-bedroom villa. The main towns are Barga and Castelnuovo di Garfagnana. With its walled historic centre, Barga is a charmer — Scottish singer Paolo Nutini’s family hail from here. The town is home to a large contingent of Scots, and at the end of July it even holds an annual Fish and Chip festival. Florence is an hour and 45 minutes away by car, but just 50 minutes to the south is the bustling town of Lucca, where Puccini was born. It is full of historic buildings with a  famous summer music festival in July. This year, Elton John, B.B. King and James Blunt performed under the stars in the Piazza Napoleone. ‘Property in the area is excellent value for money,’ says Linda Travella, of Casa Travella. Northern Tuscany is more accessible than the south in her opinion, with Pisa between one hour and an hour-and-a-half away from most locations. There are also a number of main and local stations with regular services. She is selling a three-bedroom, semi-detached stone house with cellars, patio and garden, in the hamlet of Ponte Coccia, six miles from Barga, for £87,000. This is on the road to Abetone, which in winter becomes a ski resort. And in a hamlet near Molazzana, two-and-a-half miles from Barga, a two-bedroom apartment with garden is on the market for £118,000.

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 10:05 PM on 4th November 2011 . An unidentified GP from Kent has an annual salary of £770,444 (posed by models) The top-earning GP in the country receives an annual salary of more than £750,000, it emerged yesterday. The astonishing pay packet is his or her pre-tax income even after all outgoings – including the salaries of all locums, nurses and receptionists they employ – have been taken into account. The unidentified GP from Kent is believed to be reaping the benefits of a new contract that allows doctors to run several surgeries that rake in NHS cash for providing extra treatment. This can include minor operations, tests for diabetes or help for drug addicts. The extraordinary salary, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, marks the rise of the ‘Super GP’. The request by the Mail was to obtain figures specifically for individual pay of the top-earning GP for every health trust in England. It uncovered the highest was recorded by NHS Kent and Medway at £770,444. A second doctor in Birmingham has been found to be earning an annual sum of £665,000, while another in Essex was paid £412,400. The figures have angered patients’ groups and other family doctors who say the standard of care provided by these doctors does not match their exceptional pay packets. Their vast salaries, funded by the taxpayer, come at a time of supposed financial austerity and severe cutbacks within the NHS. Dr Vijayakar Abrol, a GP in Birmingham, said: ‘These Super GPs are more like businessmen. They employ slaves to run their practices – practice nurses and half a dozen locum doctors. ‘But if you look at all the indicators, they show that the care they are providing is not better, it is worse. 'The smaller practices are better and patients see a familiar GP, not a locum.’ Family doctors have to provide details of their salaries to their Primary Care Trust every year so the NHS can calculate how much to pay into their pension pots. Earlier this year, it emerged that 950 GPs earned more than £200,000 in the 2008/09 year – up from 910 the year before – despite repeated promises by ministers to get to grips with doctors’ pay. The average GP earns around £105,000, with many earning between £53,000 and £80,000. But the average figure rose dramatically from about £70,000 in 2004 thanks to a new pay deal negotiated by Labour. It enabled doctors to top up their pay by meeting targets for treating a range of conditions as well as allowing them to opt out of working evenings and weekends. But many patients are now finding  it increasingly difficult to see their doctor and in some parts of the country they are forced to wait up to three weeks for an appointment. As part of the Labour deal, GPs could also choose to become an Alternative Provider of Medical Services – enabling them to run one or more practices that could earn extra NHS cash for providing additional services. This could include minor surgery to remove cysts or ingrowing toenails, treatment for drug addicts or alcoholics or screening for cervical cancer. Their practices also earn up to £120 a year for every patient on their books – and the largest will have tens of thousands on their lists. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the GPs Committee of doctors’ union, the British Medical Association, said: ‘To earn this amount of money as a GP is unheard of – indeed the 44,000 other GPs in the UK earn absolutely nowhere near this amount. ‘The vast majority of GPs have seen their salary fall in the last few years and most expect that to be the case this year too.’ This week, the Government ordered GPs to take a pay freeze for a second year running as part of a new contract negotiated with the BMA. This actually works out as a pay cut once inflation has been taken into account. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said: ‘With patients telling our helpline that services are being cut across the country, these GP salaries are going to be a bitter pill to swallow.’","Shocking salary revealed through Freedom of Information request by the Mail .

Claire Marquis, 33, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, 'met' the teenager by using PlayStation and Xbox gaming networks and claimed she was a 24-year-old nurse to entice him. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she then swapped mobile phone numbers with boy before sending him explicit images using the device. She also persuaded the boy to send her explicit pictures. Trial: Chelmsford Crown Court, pictured, heard that Claire Marquis sent the boy explicit images and also encouraged him to watch her perform sex acts online . Marquis also encouraged the teenager, who lived in Cheshire, to watch her perform sex acts online. The court was told that Marquis even suggested arranging a hotel for sex although the meeting never took place. Her actions carried on for 18 months and only came to light when her husband discovered what she was doing and informed both police and the teenager of the deceit. By the time that Marquis’s lies were exposed her innocent teenage victim had fallen in love with her and was devastated when he discovered the shocking truth. Marquis - branded as 'sinister' by the judge escaped prison after pleading guilty to five sexual offences. She was handed a 12-month suspended sentence and given a care and intervention order. She was also sentenced to 200 hours . community service and put on the sex offenders’ register for 10 years. She had previously admitted two . counts of inciting a child to commit a sexual act, two counts of causing . a child to watch a sexual act and possessing indecent images of . children. Judge Christopher Ball QC, said: 'The offences you have admitted occurred over a considerable period of time and have elements to them which are both sexual and which are actually cruel. Meeting place: Marquis met the boy via an online gaming network. Police have now warned parents of the dangers they pose to their children (posed by model) 'You quite wittingly came into this relationship over the internet with a young boy and led him down an emotional path which has caused him emotional upset and anguish. 'You, as a mature woman, were in control and had the power to stop it at any moment. 'It was a scheme dreamt up to give you some degree of excitement in what was becoming a dull and monotonous life. 'But you had the good sense to stop short of engaging him directly and had the good sense to plead guilty.' Afterwards Detective Sergeant, from Essex Police’s online investigation team, said: 'It is hoped that this investigation will highlight to parents the risks associated with the use of gamer networks. 'The risks of social networking are regularly reported on, but parents should be aware that the gamer networks are just another form of this. 'I would encourage parents to take an interest in what there children are doing and who with, when on these networks.'","Claire Marquis sent explicit photos and performed sex acts online for the boy .

She said she went into the living . room and was facing the bedroom when the naked 62-year-old appeared. ‘Oh . my God, I’m so sorry,’ she said, to which he allegedly replied: ‘You . don’t have to  be sorry.’ The Frenchman then started behaving . like a ‘crazy man’, she claimed, and grabbed her breasts before slamming . the door to the suite. He allegedly told her: ‘You’re . beautiful’ as he began to wrestle her towards the bedroom, but she . pleaded with him and said: ‘Sir, stop this. I don’t want to lose my . job.’ She claimed Strauss-Kahn assured her: ‘You’re not going to lose your job.’ Miss Diallo said she was ‘so afraid’ and could not even look at him as he ‘pulled her hard on to the bed’ and . tried to force her to perform a sex act on him, which she resisted. ‘I push him. I get up. I wanted to . scare him. I said, “Look, there is my supervisor right there”.’ Strauss-Kahn allegedly said no one was there to hear. According to the maid’s account, she . carried on trying to push him away, but Strauss-Kahn shoved her back . down the hall before pulling her uniform down and tearing her underwear. She claims he pushed her on to her knees with her back to the wall and forced her to perform a sex act. Accused: Ms Diallo said that she wants former IMF boss Strauss-Kahn to be sent to jail . Afterwards, she said, she got up and . fled. ‘I run out of there. I don’t turn back. I run to the hallway. I . was so nervous, I was so scared. I didn’t want to lose my job,’ she . said. Miss Diallo claimed in the interviews . with ABC News and Newsweek magazine that it was only later, when she . was watching TV, that she realised her alleged attacker was the head of . the International Monetary Fund, a position he was forced to quit over . her allegations. ‘I was watching the news and they . said he was going to be the next president of France. I said, “Oh my . God, they’re going to kill me, I’m going to die”. If that was in my . country and a powerful man like that, they’re going to kill me.’ Prosecutors have admitted the case . against Strauss-Kahn has been ‘weakened’ because of issues with Miss . Diallo, including the fact that she lied on her asylum application to . the U.S. She has also been accused of having Aids and of being a prostitute. With tears streaming down her face, . she said: ‘I’m not and I’ve never been called that. God is my witness . I’m telling the truth. From my heart. God knows that. And he . [Strauss-Kahn] knows that.’ Strauss-Kahn is accused of six  charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse, to which he has pleaded not guilty. However stringent bail conditions . have been lifted and he is free to move around the United States ahead . of a court hearing scheduled for Monday. Violent: Nafissatou Diallo describes how she alleges Strauss-Kahn grabbed her as he started to act like 'a crazy man' Shocking: Nafissatou Diallo claims Strauss-Kahn appeared naked in front of her and demonstrates how she says he groped her breasts . A civil case would involve a lower . standard of proof so is more likely to be a success. For example . O J Simpson was acquitted over the death of his ex-wife Nicole but later . lost a civil case brought by her family. New York lawyer Dan Bright, who  is . representing Naomi Campbell’s  former manager in a lawsuit against the . model, said: ‘Strauss-Kahn is wealthy enough that he might settle . rather  than go through the embarrassment of a civil trial. ‘The amount of damages claimed could potentially be huge.’ Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers William Taylor . and Ben Brafman said Miss Diallo’s interviews, for which she was not . paid, were a ‘circus’. ‘The obvious purpose is to inflame public opinion against a defendant in a pending criminal case,’ they said. But Miss Diallo’s lawyer Kenneth . Thompson said: ‘There’s no mystery. There’s no hiding the fact. This man . attempted to rape her.’ Strauss-Kahn also faces charges in . Paris that he tried to rape French journalist Tristane Banon during a . 2003 interview in her flat.","Hotel maid waives her right to anonymity and says she hopes God punishes the former IMF boss who she accuses of sexual assault .

The incident was the second firework-related accident to happen to a child in Greater Manchester yesterday after a nine-year-old boy received blast injuries to his hand earlier in the evening. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said they were called to Daubhill in Bolton at around 9.20pm last night after the girl was struck in the face by a ‘multi-shot display’ type firework which had fallen over and discharged horizontally. Firework injuries: Two separate incidents left a baby girl and a boy, 9, injured in Greater Manchester during firework displays . The girl was treated at the scene and taken to hospital for further treatment. At 8.34pm fire crews were called by the ambulance service to a separate incident in Ashton-on-Mersey to a report of an injury to a nine-year-old boy caused by an exploding firework. A spokesman for the fire service said: ‘The injury is thought to have happened when a firework the boy was holding exploded - damaging his hand. The boy was taken to hospital for treatment.’ He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital for treatment. Station manager Paul Duggan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Two children have been injured and any injury is one too many. 'Therefore we are maintaining our vigilance and will see what Bonfire night itself brings.' He said apart from the two children injured the rest of Greater Manchester had been relatively quiet. The incidents came as fire chiefs issued a safety warning ahead of Bonfire Night. Emergency treatment: The boy was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital (pictured) for treatment . With dry weather forecast and a Saturday Bonfire Night, crews at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service are expected to have one of their busiest nights in years. The service received 468 calls last year and attended 327 incidents. Senior firefighters are warning people to take extra care this year. They have been working hard to get the safety message to school children. Mr Duggan said: 'With Bonfire Night taking place on Saturday night, and dry weather forecast, we're anticipating a busier period than the last few years. 'We've made the appropriate preparations - including weeks of visiting schools and hosting community roadshows - to get the safety messages across. 'We want everyone to have a happy and safe Bonfire Night. To ensure this, people can visit the safe4autumn website for sensible tips on how to keep safe.' They have been using data from previous years to target 'hot spot' areas for anti-social behaviour. Bosses have also used advertising on social-networking sites such as Facebook to get their message across. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is encouraging people to attend organised bonfires and firework displays wherever possible.","In a separate incident, also in Greater Manchester, a boy, 9, was hit in the hand by a firework ."

Dawn Wheatcroft, office manager at . partitioning company Waterson's Projects, which is based on the site, . said that the storm seemed to 'last forever'. She said: 'It seemed like forever whilst it was happening, although it probably lasted less than a minute. 'It was a bit of a grey day but you never expect something like that to happen, it was one of the worst storms I've ever seen.' Flooding: Heavy rain in the south . caused road closures in Southampton yesterday .

A carer who stole more than £42,000 from a frail man of 65 to bankroll her bingo addiction has been jailed for 15 months. Dawn Kyle, 61, became addicted to bingo and withdrew up to £800 a day from the accounts of her victim who was now in debt, a court heard. Kyle, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, admitted four offences of theft between January and October 2009 totalling £42,140. Judge Roderick Newton told her: 'What you did over a period of time was to steal a substantial amount of money from someone who was a childhood friend and who relied on you for his well being.' The judge said the OAP, of nearby Ipswich, was now penniless and was having to deal with creditors who wanted their bills paid. 'The message needs to go out that in circumstances such as this there can only be one sentence,' warned Judge Newton. 'My duty is such that I would be failing if I didn't send you to prison.' Matthew Gowen, prosecuting, told Ipswich Crown Court that Kyle's victim had become a heavy drinker after his marriage collapsed 20 years ago. He had been diagnosed with manic depression and reduced brain function. The vulnerable man lived independently but needed help with his day to day needs. Kyle, who had known him for decades since their schooldays, began cleaning his house and cooking for him. She became his carer but started plundering his money as his health deteriorated. 'This was a gross and flagrant breach of trust,' said Mr Gowen. Addict: Kyle had taken out over £4,000 while at Mecca Bingo in Ipswich (pictured) and Joy Wheel in Ipswich . The victim spent some time in a residential care home in 2009 and his cousin spotted that property had vanished from his house and alerted police. Mr Gowen there was no evidence Kyle had stolen any property from the house. But it emerged that a 'huge' number of cash withdrawals had been made from his accounts. Mr Gowen said Kyle had taken out over £4,000 while at Mecca Bingo and Joy Wheel in Ipswich. Matthew Gowen, prosecuting, told Ipswich Crown Court, pictured, that Kyle's victim had become a heavy drinker after his marriage collapsed 20 years ago . At other times she had made cash withdrawals on an almost daily basis of sums of up to £800 and had also used her victim's money to pay the £4,700 deposit and six months rent on her flat. Kyle told cops she had three credit cards which were 'maxed out' and claimed she had made the withdrawals with her victim's consent. Judge Durr, defending, said that after initially playing on fruit machines Kyle had become addicted to bingo. He said she had looked after the victim for 15 years before succumbing to temptation in 2009. Mr Durr said Kyle had cared for her husband until he died and was currently looking after her elderly parents who were in poor health.",Dawn Kyle withdrew up to £800 a day from the accounts of her victim .
"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 10:41 AM on 4th November 2011 . Fears that the book Tintin in the Congo could warp young minds have led publishers to market it with protective packaging with warning labels similar to those on explicit top-shelf magazines . The new film may be good clean family fun, but one of Tintin’s classic adventures has been banished to the adult shelves of bookshops because it is overtly racist. Fears that Tintin In The Congo could have a negative effect on children have led publishers  to market it in protective  packaging with warning labels similar to those on explicit magazines. With a new generation of fans enjoying Steven Spielberg’s movie, The adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn, enthusiasm for collecting all 24 of Herge’s original comic books has never been higher. Unfortunately, Tintin In The Congo was written in 1930 and depicts African natives as ignorant, simple and backward people, who are far less intelligent than their white visitors. Leading booksellers such as Waterstones have taken the book out of the children’s section, fearing it ‘could get into the wrong hands’. But critics claim that selling the book like a soft porn magazine is politically correct censorship, especially when children are regularly allowed to see graphic violence and sexually explicit material in the media. The book, which was not published in English until 2005, shows the black population bowing down to the boy reporter after he smashes a diamond smuggling racket involving Al Capone. The black people are depicted as stupid with thick lips. They end up worshipping Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy like gods. Stereotype? One scene from the book depicts Tintin being carried in a bamboo chair to meet the King . Nick Seaton, secretary of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘As long as children understand times have changed it seems ridiculous to separate this book into the adult section. ‘Much of children’s literature is extremely graphic and sexually explicit these days and no one seems to bother about that.’ He added: ‘All these silly attempts at censorship do not do a lot of good. Bookshops have to be responsible about things like this but it can go too far and this is ridiculous.’ Publisher Egmont UK has put a protective band around the book with a warning about the content. Inside is an introduction by the original translators explaining the historical context. Hit: A new generation of fans are being attracted to Tintin following the recent release of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn . Victory: The restrictions on Tintin in the Congo were in response to a complaint about the book by leading human rights lawyer David Enright. He is pictured here with his wife Gifty and children Finn, left and Tadg . The warning informs readers Herge’s portrayal of the Belgian Congo reflected ‘the colonial  attitudes of the time’ and the ‘stereotypes of the period’ which some people ‘may find offensive’. The restrictions followed a complaint about the book by human rights lawyer David Enright. He said: ‘It should be in the adult graphic novels section and even then some thought should be given to it. ‘There is no way of reading it without thinking it depicts black people as sub human and less mentally able than the apes. They all end up worshipping the dog. ‘I always enjoyed Tintin growing up and thought the books were excellent. Then I opened this one up and was shocked to say the least.’","Concern Tintin in the Congo could warp young minds .

Stephen Fry was on board a Qantas plane which was forced to make an emergency landing after one of its engines failed. The London-bound A380 was four hours into a flight from Singapore when it suffered oil problems today. The star Tweeted: 'B****r. Forced to land in Dubai. An engine has decided not to play.' He was flying back to London tonight after being allocated a seat on an Emirates flight following a 16-hour delay. There were 258 passengers on board the Qantas flight when the pilot was forced to shut down one of the four engines and make the unscheduled stop. Fry complained that he had been left waiting on the plane before he was allowed to go into the building. His misery was then compounded when he left his wallet on the plane. The author and comedian wrote: 'I've left my wallet on the sodding plane. Hell's teeth this really isn't my day. Will not leave without it.' The incident comes a year to the day after the engine of another Qantas A380 blew up over Singapore. Emergency landing: This A380 today made an emergency landing in Dubai after the pilot shutdown one of the four engines because of oil problems . A spokesman for Qantas said the superjumbo had suffered a problem with oil pressure in its number four engine, describing the incident as a 'one off'. He confirmed it was not the same A380 that was involved in last year's incident, adding that the timing of the problem was a 'coincidence'. The airline said it is working to arrange alternative flights to take the passengers on to London. Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight last year after the midair explosion over Singapore, caused by a faulty pipe in the Rolls Royce engines. Last weekend the airline grounded its entire fleet as a result of an ongoing battle with the unions, affecting thousands of passengers. Frustration: Stephen Fry was delayed by 16 hours following the unscheduled stop . Fry later wrote: 'I think plan is to bus us to the transit lounge and await International Rescue. This plane, the crew tell me, is going nowhere.' He added: 'So either Sydney send another one out or they come to an accommodation with Emirates. Either way not a great week for #qantas!' The 54-year-old also posted a picture of an apology letter given by the airline to the stricken passengers, which warned passengers they faced 'an extended delay'.

With a sinister grin and his arm around his wife, this is the chilling face of the alleged mastermind behind the Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people nine years ago. Umar Patek, 41, took part in a police reconstruction at the scene of the 2002 bombings on the resort island of Bali along with his wife Ruqayyah binti Husein Luceno. A suspected member of the Al Qaeda-linked terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, Patek is set to be charged with premeditated murder in relation to the 202 victims, mostly Western tourists, killed at the Sari Club in the Kuta tourist district. Stare: Umar Patek, said to have built the explosives used in the Bali bombings in 2002, takes part in a reconstruction of the attacks with his wife Ruqayyah . Armed guard: Patek and his wife are followed closely by police officers carrying weapons during the reconstruction in Jakarta, Indonesia . He was only captured in January by commandos in Pakistan after travelling there to plan a major terrorist attack with Osama Bin Laden at his secret compound in Abbottabad. Four months later, the Al Qaeda leader was killed after U.S. Navy Seals stormed the compound in a secret operation. Patek assembled the explosives used in the Bali attack and has also confessed to carrying out a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000, police said. In an interview with the Jakarta Globe newspaper last week, Patek reportedly said he had recommended that jihad be waged in Pakistan instead of Bali. Deadly: Patek faces charges in relation to the deaths of 202 people, mainly Western tourists . Captured: Patek was only arrested in January . He told the paper: 'I was just making a recommendation because at that point the preparations for the Bali bombing were almost done and there was no way it would have been called off.' The explosives were built at a . boarding house on Bali, before they were loaded on to the back of a . vehicle and driven to the club. A separate device was carried in the . backpack of a suicide bomber and a smaller device went off outside the . U.S. consulate. Some 26 Britons and 88 Australians were among the 202 people killed in the attacks in October 2002. After . the attacks, Patek went on the run as one of Asia's most wanted terror . suspects and had a $1million bounty on his head under the U.S. rewards . for justice programme. Three members of the violent Jemaah Islamiyah group were sentenced to death and executed for their involvement in the bombings. Luceno has also gone on trial over charges of immigration violations.

Michele Bachmann's New Hampshire campaign team say they were ignored and treated as second-class citizens before they quit in frustration last week. The five former staffers said they hold no ill will toward the Minnesota congresswoman, but they could not continue working for her because the national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them. A press release issued by the New Hampshire team also accused the campaign as being 'abrasive, discourteous, and dismissive' of the state's voters. Scroll down for video . Problems: The five former staffers said they could not continue working for Bachmann because her national campaign team had been 'rude, unprofessional, dishonest, and at times cruel' to them . 'These are our neighbors and our . friends, and some within the national team treated them more as a . nuisance than as potential supporters,' the group wrote. The letter went on to tell how they had all been . full-time, paid employees until September 11, when they were asked to . temporarily go 'off payroll' due to financial concerns. Mrs Bachmann's New Hampshire campaign manager, Jeff Chidester, voluntarily took himself off payroll at the beginning of September until the end of the campaign because funds were so poor. 'It saddens this team to see a dedicated . patriot – a person so desperately needed in the White House – . sequestered behind a wall of pretense, guarded by political operatives . consumed by their own egos,' the group wrote. Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's national spokeswoman, responded by labelling the group 'name callers' and admitted the national focus was on Iowa. Stranger: Michele Bachmann has visited New Hampshire just twice since announcing her campaign blaming her absence on the debt limit debate . 'Name calling': Alice Stewart, Mrs Bachmann's spokeswoman, dismissed the allegations . Mrs Bachmann has visited New Hampshire just twice since announcing her campaign in late June. During her latest trip earlier this . month, she blamed her absence on the August debate in Congress over . raising the nation's debt limit. In an interview with John King on CNN, Ms Stewart responded to the criticism of the national team, of which she is a senior part, by saying: 'That's unfortunate. They want to call names, that's their prerogative. We wish them the best.' 'It is disheartening when members of the staff or volunteers or people who are working with the team decide to communicate with the media as opposed with the campaign,' Ms Stewart continued. 'We haven't heard anything from these people. It is unfortunate they chose to make it in such a public way.' However, the staffers made clear they tried to inform people within the national operation of their concerns well before they issued the press release. Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager, Keith Nahigian, sought to discredit the authenticity of the people behind the letter. 'The unauthorized news release was sent by a person who doesn't even work for the campaign and has never had authority to speak on behalf of the campaign,' he said. 'We are not responding to comments made by a person who was not even a staff member in New Hampshire.' Ms Stewart said that while the New . Hampshire operation was important, winning Iowa was the primary focus . for Mrs Bachmann and her campaign. 'First . and foremost, we have to get through the important first caucus state,' Ms Stewart told CNN. 'That's what she's focused on.' Little chance: Former campaign manager Ed Rollins quit in September, stating, 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race' Praying for miracle: The latest poll numbers are not good for Mrs Bachmann, pictured with husband Marcus, with support at five per cent . The New Hampshire exodus is the the latest staffing dilemma to to hit Mrs Bachmann's campaign. In September, campaign manager Ed Rollins made a high-profile exit, saying the congresswoman's chances of winning the GOP nod had dwindled. He called her the 'third-candidate'  and said: 'I think legitimately it's a Romney-Perry race.' Mr Rollins revealed that his deputy David Polyansky would also stand aside. Earlier this month, seasoned Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who served as an adviser to Mrs Bachmann, and senior policy adviser Andy Parrish left her 2012 campaign. Since winning the Iowa straw poll in August, Mrs Bachmann's poll numbers have been on the slide and according to the latest Gallup poll, constucted between October 3-7, she has just five per cent support for the nomination. Harsh words: The press release which accuses Mrs Bachmann's national team of rudeness . Mitt Romney, on 20 per cent, Herman Cain, 18 per cent, and Rick Perry, 15 per cent, are out in front. Recent polls have also shown that despite earlier success, Mrs Bachmann is now rated no higher than fourth place in the Hawkeye State.

The Democrat - who will turn 74 in the election month of November 2016 - said that his immediate focus is to help President Barack Obama get re-elected in 2012. But when pressed on the possibility of his own future run, he replied, 'I'm not closing anything.' Eyeing the prize? Joe Biden, pictured with his wife Jill and daughter Ashley on the campaign trail in 2008, has refused to rule out running for president in 2016 . He added: 'My one focus now is getting the president re-elected. That is the focus. 'And I'll make up my mind on that [the 2016 election] later.' The 68-year-old also said he was in the best shape of his life and was enjoying being in the thick of politics and government. Mr Biden, who ran for president twice before being chosen by Mr Obama in 2008 as his running mate, is expected to be a key player in the president's re-election effort next year. Running mate: Mr Biden insisted that his immediate priority is to get Barack Obama re-elected in November 2012 . He is known as a people person and Mr . Obama's political advisers see him as someone who will be particularly . effective with working-class voters in key East Coast battleground . states like Pennsylvania and with older voters in states like Florida. Mr . Biden also has a tendency to make verbal gaffes and stirred controversy . last week when he warned that the number of rapes and murders in U.S. cities would climb if states were forced by budget cuts to lay off . police officers. The idea of a 74-year-old Joe Biden being inaugurated as U.S. president in 2016 isn't as far fetched as it sounds. In 1981, Ronald Reagan was inaugurated less than 3 weeks before he turned 70. Following his re-election in 1984 aged 73, he eventually left office  in January 1989 shortly before turning 78. More recently, Republican candidate John McCain, 72, was beaten by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race. In 1996, the-then 73-year-old Bob Dole secured the Republican nomination to challenge Bill Clinton for the presidency. Critics questioned the statistics behind his comment. Meanwhile, Mr Obama is today trying to get his re-election campaign back on track as he visits Las Vegas to tout his revised jobs bill. Mr Obama will stop in Nevada - which has the nation's highest unemployment rate at 13.4 per cent - for a campaign fundraiser at the Bellagio Hotel. He will then visit a poverty-stricken neighbourhood on the city's far eastern side. In his four-hour trip, scheduled to take place between 12pm and 4pm local time, he will talk about the American Jobs Act that he has put forward to boost his beleaguered country's economy. It would see a $447billion combination of fresh spending and tax cuts, offset by tax hikes on the rich. The American Jobs Act was shelved in the Senate last week and on Friday a plan to finance $35billion for states to stop layoffs to teachers and public safety officers was defeated. Democrats are now trying to pass a series of actions, to confront housing, education and other economic problems, in segments under the mantra 'We Can't Wait'. The next segment will be $50billion in funding and a $10billion infrastructure bank to finance roads, bridges, aviation and transit projects. Mr Obama will kick off his new offensive in Las Vegas by promoting new rules for federally guaranteed mortgages so that more homeowners, those with little or no equity in their homes, can refinance and avert foreclosure.",Vice-president says his current priority is to get Barack Obama re-elected .

The trekkers, who are thought to include a number of Britons, been forced to stay in the small hill resort of Lukla, the gateway to Mount Everest. Lukla, which sits 2,800metres (9,186ft) above sea level, has been covered by thick cloud this week, forcing airlines to cancel flights to and from the remote region. It is located 78miles (125km) north-east of the Nepalese capital. Stranded: Foreign trekkers stand outside Katmandu airport in Nepal after their flights were cancelled yesterday. Two thousand hikers have been trappedon the slopes of a mountain near Mount Everest due to bad weather . Tens of thousands of trekkers and climbers visit the Solukhumbu region, home to Mount Everest, each year. Many start and end their trek from the windswept resort where a small airstrip is carved into the rugged mountainside. Utsav Raj Kharel, chief of Lukla's Tenzing Hillary Airport, said tourists, who were not in physical danger, had been waiting for their flights back to Kathmandu for the past four days. Mr Kharel said: 'Visibility is almost nil. Fog and clouds have covered the entire area making flights by fixed-wing small aircraft impossible.' Weather officials in Kathmandu said the clouds could continue to cover the region for a couple of days, worsening the plight of the trapped tourists who could face a food shortage. Remote airport: Lukla sits 2,800metres above sea level and has been covered by thick clouds this week . Gateway to the Himalayas: The town is located 78miles north-east of the Nepalese capital . Mr Kharel said: 'Though a few small private helicopters had picked some tourists from nearby Sirke village, they are inadequate to clear the rush.' Santa Subba, chief of the Himalayan Rescue Association Nepal, said authorities were expected to make arrangements to rescue the trapped hikers in big helicopters once the weather conditions allowed them to reach the area. Autumn, which runs from September to November, is peak tourist season in South Asia's poorest but scenic country, which gets nearly 4 per cent of its gross domestic product from tourism.","Small town of Lukla has been covered by thick cloud .

A British salesman pushed a naked prostitute from his Dubai hotel room window after they argued during sex about her fee, a court heard yesterday. Zoubair Ali, 37, faces up to ten years behind bars if convicted. Dubai Criminal Court heard how the vice girl fell 20ft from the first floor window and landed on the roof of a car. Charges: British salesman Zoubair Ali, 37, yesterday appeared before the Dubai Criminal . Court, pictured, to answer sex, drink and assault allegations . The British worker allegedly pushed her after a drunken row over her £85 fee. According to the Ukrainian prostitute she met Ali in a bar before returning to his luxury room. But they began arguing over her £85 fee during sex in his private first-floor suite and she refused to continue until he paid more. The sex worker - known only as A.K. - said she was then thrown from the bedroom's window and on to the roof of a car. She ran to the reception and alerted hotel staff who contacted police. Ali was then stopped by security staff trying to get into his car to flee the scene before officers arrived, the court heard. The prostitute, 36, said: 'I went with him to his hotel room because I felt lonely and needed company. I was interested in continuing the evening with him,' she said in her witness statement, website Gulf News said. 'As soon as we walked into his room, we quarrelled… I ran to the bedroom and closed the door from inside. Then I opened the window and cried for help.' It was then that she was allegedly pushed. A worker at the hotel said that he heard a loud crash seconds before a naked woman ran into the hotel's reception. Ali is charged with having sex while unmarried and assault, which he denies. He admitted drinking on unauthorised premises. The prostitute is accused of prostitution and having unmarried sex. She did not turn up at court for the hearing. A British friend has claimed they met the prostitute in a bar and she offered a massage and sex in return for money. Judge Mohammad Majid Mohammad adjourned the case until December 1. Ali was released on bail. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of reports of the detention of a British national in Dubai. 'We are urgently looking into these reports so we can provide consular assistance if required.' A court source added: 'This gentleman could be in serious trouble. He could get ten years if found guilty of assault, plus time for sex and drink offences.'","Ukrainian prostitute plunged 20ft from the first floor suite .

The Archbishop of York has told how he set free the spirit of a girl who was terrified she would be used as a human sacrifice after visiting a witches coven. The child was terrified she would be killed by witches after she saw the ritual slaughter of a goat, Archbishop John Sentamu said during a debate in the House of Lords. She was so afraid she would wake in the night screaming in terror, he revealed. Cure: Archbishop of York John Sentamu told the House of Lords how he set the spirit free of a girl who was terrified she would be made a human sacrifice . He said the young girl had been paralysed by fear and despite a GP, a psychiatrist and a psychologist visiting the child's south London home, the girl was petrified she would be coven's next sacrifice. Speaking to peers on Wednesday the . Archbishop said: 'When I first became a vicar of a parish in south . London I was invited into a home because somebody said that there was a . presence there. 'I did not understand that phrase but . I went into the home where there was a young girl who had not been able . to move for nearly three weeks. 'The GP, a psychiatrist and a psychologist had visited the house. Sometimes the girl shouted a lot in the middle of the night. Somebody said that they had been to a witches' coven that night where a goat had been sacrificed. Terrified: The Archbishop said the girl had visited a witches coven, similar to the one . pictured in Nepal, and witnessed the sacrifice of a goat. She then became terrified that she . would be next . 'She was absolutely petrified that she would be sacrificed next. She could not speak apart from shouting.' To rid the child of the spirit, the Archbishop said he anointed her with oil and lit a candle. He told the House of Lords: 'I left and received a telephone call later to say that the young girl was no longer terrified and had started to speak. 'That was not mental or physical illness; there was something in her spirit that needed to be set free.' Dr Sentamu was speaking during a debate on an amendment of the NHS bill for England where he called for spiritual health to be part of the government's agenda for health. During the debate the Anglican Archbishop said schools now emphasised students' spiritual side, as well as their physical and mental well being. If passed the Health and Social Care Bill would give doctors more responsibility for their own budgets while greater competition with the private sector would be encouraged.","Child had witnessed ritual slaughter of a goat, he tells House of Lords .

A father who accidentally killed two swans while riding a jet ski has admitted causing criminal damage to the Queen's property under an ancient law. Edward Johnstone, 34, was towing his children on an inflatable raft when the line between them whipped across the water hitting the birds. The tow rope struck two swans at Sale Water Park, Greater Manchester, where they were seen flapping and unable to lift their heads as the family careered around the waterway. They died shortly after the incident, Trafford Magistrate's Court heard. Johnstone, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, told the court . he did not intend to kill the creatures but admitted he was reckless . while riding the powerful water bike. He was charged with criminal damage because under an ancient law swans are the property of the Queen. Johnstone pleaded guilty to the offence and was given a four-week . community order with a night-time curfew - he was also ordered to pay £85 . court costs. Lynn Rogers, prosecuting, said witnesses rode out into the water park and removed the swans. Johnstone . said he and his children were mortified by what had happened and . left his name and contact details and was later arrested. He . denied the offence at earlier hearings but pleaded guilty on the day of . his trial on the basis his actions were reckless and not intentional. Lyndsay Knaggs, . defending, said the single dad-of-two, had all the relevant jet ski . licences and had been to the water park before. The swans were seen flapping about and unable to lift their heads after being hit by the jet ski. They died shortly after the incident at Sale Water Park, Greater Manchester . Johnstone told the court: 'That day was just about having fun with the children. I just wanted them to have a good time. My actions caused the swans to die but it was reckless.' Chairman of the bench Barry McKenzie said it was an exceptional case and told Johnstone: 'Two living creatures were killed. When swans are killed it's not easy to replace them and there's a loss to public amenity.' The Queen owns all of Britain's Mute . swans. The monarchy's ownership of mute swans dates back to the twelfth . century, when they were considered a delicacy. In the fifteenth century, the Crown granted livery companies Vintners and Dyers some rights of ownership of mute swans. Traditionally the swans belonging to . each company were marked on the beak every year in a ceremony known as . swan-upping, which still takes place on the river Thames every year in . the third week of July. Nowadays though it is used to monitor swan populations. The monarchy's swans were marked by a . royal Swan Marker. The position is still held today, but the Queen's . Swan Marker's job now includes advising organisations on swan welfare . and incidents involving swans such as vandalism. The Queen still owns all unmarked . mute swans in open water – but only exercises these ownership rights on . some parts of the Thames and its tributaries. As native wild birds, swans also enjoy statutory protection under the . Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and it is an offence to intentionally . injure, take or kill a wild swan.","Rope towing his children on inflatable raft ripped into birds .

"By . David Gardner In Los Angeles . Last updated at 12:21 PM on 4th November 2011 . Conrad Murray's criminally negligent care of Michael Jackson robbed the King of Pop's three children of their father, a court heard today. 'For Michael's children, this case will go on forever, because they do not have a father,' prosecutor David Walgren told jurors in his closing speech in the trial of Jackson's private doctor. 'The evidence in this case is abundantly clear - that Conrad Murray caused the death of Michael Jackson and that Conrad Murray left Prince, Paris and Blanket without a father. The jury heard closing arguments on Thursday in the manslaughter trial of Conrad Murray, who defense attorneys say is criminally liable for the death of Michael Jackson . 'They do not have a father because of the actions of Conrad Murray,"" he added. The Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney told the hushed courtroom how Jackson's daughter, Paris, now 13, discovered Murray frantically trying to revive her father in his bedroom and screamed out 'Daddy!' The children have not been in court during the five-week trial, but Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine, were in the public gallery yesterday along with siblings LaToya and Randy. Murray showed no emotion as he was accused by the prosecutor of breaking the 'hallowed trust' of the relationship between a doctor and his patient. 'Conrad Murray is criminally liable. Justice demands a guilty verdict,' he said. 'Michael Jackson trusted Conrad Murray. He trusted him with his life. He trusted him with his own life and with the future lives of his children. Conrad Murray corrupted that relationship and because of that, Michael Jackson paid with his life,' the prosecutor added. He said the evidence in the case was 'overwhelming' that Murray, 58, was criminally responsible for the June 25 2009 death of the 50-year-old superstar. Jackson's children, seen her last weekend at daughter Paris's soccer game, have not been in the courtroom for the trial, although his mother and various siblings have made appearances . Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by injecting Jackson with a lethal dose of the hospital anaesthetic propofol. Mr Walgren claimed Murray's administration of the powerful drug to treat Jackson's chronic insomnia was an 'obscene experiment.' He said Murray should never have given propofol to Jackson outside a hospital setting and then criminally botched his resuscitation efforts after Jackson stopped breathing and lied to paramedics and hospital doctors to try and cover up his own guilt. He condemned the cardiologist's delay in calling 911 as 'bizarre.' 'What on earth would motivate a medical doctor to delay making that call other than self preservation?' he asked the jury of seven men and five women. 'He knew his acts killed Michael Jackson. Maybe he's panicked, maybe he's cleaning up. But he's putting Conrad Murray first. He's intentionally not calling 911. He's intentionally delaying help that could have saved Michael Jackson's life.' The prosecutor blasted the defence claim that Jackson injected himself with the deadly knock-out drug as 'junk science.' Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said in his closing argument that Jackson's children were robbed of a father who loved them very much by Dr Murray's actions . He also attacked anaesthesiologist Dr Paul White, the star defence witness, for 'sullying' the trial with his 'garbage' theories and flimsy research trying to support the suggestion that Jackson died at his own hand. Michael Jackson was 'optimistic and excited' about his upcoming 'This is it' concerts at London's O2  Arena and was looking forward to the future and performing for the first time in front of his children,' he said. But just 12 hours after his final, exuberant rehearsal the star was 'lying in his bed, palms up, his head tilted to the side, dead in his bedroom. 'Michael Jackson was not reckless. He had a life ahead of him. He had three children he loved dearly,' said Mr Walgren. 'He wanted propofol to help him sleep. He wanted a doctor with eyes on him to keep him safe,' he added. Jackson, seen here on a trip to Berlin with all three of his children in 2002, when he controversially dangled newborn Blanket over a hotel balcony, died when Prince was 12, Paris was 11 and Blanket was seven . Defence lawyer Ed Chernoff questioned whether the case would have ever been launched if the victim had not been Michael Jackson. 'We have been dancing around this for . six weeks, maybe two years. Somebody has got to just say it - if it . were anybody else but Michael Jackson would this doctor be here today?' he said. 'There is a tremendous desire to . paint Dr Murray as the villain. They want to paint this perfect villain . and this perfect victim. But there is not perfect villain and no perfect . victim. 'He was just a little fish in a big dirty pond,' he added. 'Dr Murray's greatest defect is his . greatest strength. He got brought into this situation because he thought . he could help. He thought he could help Michael Jackson succeed. He . thought he could help Michael Jackson sleep. He was wrong.' Mr Chernoff said the prosecution 'is trying to convict Dr Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson.' Murray insists that his star client . self-administered a lethal dose of the drug propofol after the doctor . left him alone for a couple of minutes while he went to the toilet. Mr Chernoff said Murray gave Jackson a safe amount of propofol and was not using an IV drip, as the prosecution speculated. 'It doesn't matter if you go outside . and play basketball or if you leave the patient or if you are on the . phone, it doesn't matter. Dr Murray did not kill Michael Jackson,' he . told the court. But in his closing argument defense attorney Ed Chernoff, right, questioned if the jury and Judge Michael Castor, left, would ever have heard of the case had the alleged victim not have been Michael Jackson . He said it was ridiculous to suggest Murray delayed calling 911 when the doctor was desperately treeing to revive his patient. Mr Chernoff complained that . prosecutors were claiming everything was a deviation of the standard of . medical care because Murray 'has to go down.' He said a prosecution witness who . compared Murray leaving Jackson alone in his bed to leaving a baby on a . counter top was 'the most insulting thing' you could say about the star. 'Michael Jackson was an adult and he made his own decisions. He had plans for the future and he knew what he was doing. 'This is not a reality show. This is real life,' he added. The jury will start its deliberations Friday morning after a final speech by prosecutor David Walgren. 'Poor Conrad Murray,' said Mr Walgren, who angrily denounced the doctor's 'bizarre behaviour.'If they had time to argue I am sure they would haver found a way of blaming Michale Jackson's son, Prince,' he added. 'Everything this doctor did was bizarre. None of it was consistent with a trained medical doctor who was putting his patient first. 'What is unusual is that Michael Jackson lived as long as he did under the care of Conrad Murray. 'Michael Jackson is dead and we have to hear about poor Conrad Murray and how no doctor knows what it was like to be in his shoes. You've got that right.' The way Murray treated with propofol in his bedroom 'has never been seen before, ever,' he added. Mr Walgren also said Murray lied to Jackson's mother, Katherine, when he 'pulled a chair up next to her in hospital and told he he didn't know what happened' to her son on the day he died.","Meanwhile defence lawyer questioned whether the trial would exist if the victim had not been Michael Jackson .

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 4:56 AM on 4th November 2011 . Faith Findlay, 7, who suffers from a rare form of dwarfism (left) with her younger sister Hope, 6 (right) When you see Faith and Hope Findlay, you could be forgiven for thinking there is a big age gap between the two sisters. Six-year-old Hope, after all, towers over her sibling. But Faith is actually a year older than Hope. Sadly, she suffers from a form of dwarfism, that is so rare there are just 30 cases in the world. It means strangers always think Faith is the youngest sister. She only weighs the same as an 18-month-old toddler and her school uniform is for a child aged three. Mrs Findlay, 40, a nanny, said: ‘Her condition was so rare it took doctors years to find out what was wrong with her. ‘She . may be tiny but she has such a big heart. And she loves being small. She tells me that she doesn’t want to be bigger. All good things come in . small packages - and that's what Faith is.’ When Faith was born, she was a normal weight for an average baby, . weighing 8Ib 1oz, and she was the heaviest of the couple’s three children. Her older sister Grace, now nine, weighed in at a smaller 5Ib 6oz, and her younger sister Hope weighed 6Ib13oz when she was born. But by the age of three months Faith was constantly being sick and had recurrent coughs and chest infections. Mrs Findlay, who lives with husband . Flint, 41, a civil servant, in Newcastle, said: ‘We never thought there . was anything wrong with Faith when she was born - she seemed just . perfect. But then when . she was just a few months old, she started being poorly all the time. She just seemed to pick up infections one after the other.’ When Faith was 11 months old, she . suddenly started gasping for breath and the couple rushed her into . hospital. She was placed on a ventilator and doctors discovered that her . lungs were full of fluid. Tests showed that she had an abnormal heart . valve that was leaking directly into her lungs. Mrs Findlay said: ‘She looked so frail lying there and we didn’t know what was wrong. She still weighed only 11Ibs, and she’d had her first birthday. We couldn’t understand why she was only so tiny. The doctors thought at first that the leaking valve had caused problems with her digestive system which had restricted her growth.’ Faith then underwent a nine-hour . operation to replace her faulty heart valve with a mechanical one. The . operation was a success, but as the months went by she still didn’t . grow. From left: The Findlay sisters Grace, 9, Faith, 7. and Hope, 6, at home in Newcastle . Mrs Findlay said: . ‘People used to think she was so cute because she was so tiny, but by . her second birthday, she was still no bigger than she had been at her . first birthday. 'She seemed too little. When her sister Hope reached her . first birthday, she was the same size as Faith. People used to think . they were twins.’ Faith was referred to a genetics centre . in Newcastle who found that she was producing growth hormones normally. All the tests for growth conditions were negative. When she started school at the age of . four, the school had to fit extra steps in the classroom and she had a . booster seat to be able to sit down for mealtimes. Then doctors finally discovered an answer. Tests showed that Faith had a . condition called Geleophysic Dysplasia, an incredibly rare form of . dwarfism. It is caused by inherited genetic . mutations which result in very short stature and abnormalities to the . bones, joints, heart and skin. Unlike many forms of dwarfism is doesn’t . cause shortened limbs - just a miniature frame. It can also cause abnormalities to the heart and an enlarged liver. It . is often life-threatening, but sufferers can live in to adulthood. Mrs Findlay said: ‘We were absolutely . devastated when Faith was diagnosed. We had never even heard of this . condition before. The chances of her having it were a staggering 200 . million to one. ‘She had just been incredibly unlucky.’ Judith Findlay, pictured here with her husband Flint, said that they were both devastated when Faith was diagnosed with the rare form of dwarfism and they had never heard of the condition before . The couple’s other two children were tested for the condition and been given the all-clear, but there is no cure for Faith, who has been the subject of a medical journal in Newcastle. She has had another two heart operations and her chest cavity is now struggling to hold her growing organs. Mrs Findlay said: ‘She has been in hospital recently because she was struggling to breathe. Her organs are getting squashed in her chest, so we don’t know what the future holds for her. ‘But she is just taking one day at a time. She may be tiny, but she has the heart of a lion. She’s so fearless and feisty - if she thinks her younger sister is being picked on, she’ll stand up to anyone. 'She’s full of fun and says she wants to be a princess when she grows up. She’s an absolute mini marvel and a real inspiration.’","200million-to-one chances of being born with this form of dwarfism .

Jaguar bosses told a motorist it was his own fault his £45,000 luxury car repeatedly broke down - because he wasn’t driving fast enough. Jonathan Dines was astonished by to be told that it was his 'inappropriate' driving style that was responsible for a year of trouble with his dream car. During that time, the saloon ground to a complete halt on three occasions, needed a week-long repair on another, and regularly went into a 'protective mode' when it he didn't drive above 30mph. 'Too slow': Jonathan Dines was told he is to blame for his £45,000 Jaguar XF Sport repeatedly breaking down - because he wasn't driving fast enough . A light warning that indicates a problem with the diesel particulate filter (DPF) has turned on 15 times since he bought the three-litre Jaguar XF Sport last November. Jaguar blame the failures on a 'driving style issue'. They say the DPF – which eliminates black exhaust fumes - becomes clogged up unless the car gets a good, fast run. Otherwise it can cause the vehicle to stop. Mr Dines, 47, from Prestwich, Greater Manchester, works as an estate agent and says most of his journeys are short, within a few miles of his office. He said: 'I was never told I had to drive in any particular way. You buy a prestige car and you expect to be able to drive it at whatever speed you want. 'As it happens I consider myself to be naturally a fast driver, and I’ve had points for speeding. 'You don’t imagine that a quality car would suffer from you going too slowly. I dreamed of owning a Jag but it’s not been a great experience.' The father-of-three bought the car second-hand when it was just 18-months-old. Now Manchester-based dealers Stratstone Jaguar have not only told him that problems are down to the way he’s driving the car, they’ve also said that further failures won’t be covered by the three-year warranty. Warning light: The diesel particulate filter - which eliminates black exhaust fumes - becomes clogged up unless the car gets a 'good, fast run' Mr Dines said: 'They’ve told me that the problem is that I’m driving too many short journeys and driving too slowly. I’ve driven a diesel before and the salesman knew I was an estate agent doing local, short journeys. 'They say I’m doing too much town driving. 'I think there’s a fault with the car. If I’d bought a Ferrari or a Lamborghini I would accept what they’re saying, but the car in question is a luxury saloon.' Mechanics at Stratstone carried out tests on the DPF and sent the data to Jaguar. Their response was: 'Looking at the average speed for both trip computers and the DTC’s stored in the vehicle, this is a driving style issue and will be chargeable to the owner. 'Please educate the customer on the driving cycles required to clean the filter reference the owner’s handbook.' Mr Dines said he has been stung by the criticism of his driving style and feels the dealers have tried to wash their hands of him. He is now considering legal action unless he gets a replacement car. He said: 'They were very good when they wanted to sell me the car. At first they treated it as a genuine problem, but now they just don’t want to know.' On one occasion the car failed when he was 200miles from home in London, forcing him to make an unplanned overnight stay.“The slower you drive, the less you clear the DPF,” said Mr Dines.  “The orange warning light comes on if the filter is full and after that it’ll go into protective mode.  On one occasion it did that after just two miles.  That light’ s come on 15 times altogether.“The car’s computer tells you what average speed you’ve been doing. They told me if I shouldn’t average below 15mph. Since then I’ve been monitoring the computer and the warning light’s come on at 18mph. Mr Stratstone said: 'We have a policy of not commenting on customer issues.' Jaguar declined to comment.",Estate agent astonished when told his driving style is responsible for his Jaguar XF Sport's breakdowns .
