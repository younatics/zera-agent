These breathtaking cloud formations all bear an incredible likeness to countries or animals - including the mythical song character Puff, The Magic Dragon. With a perfectly clear blue sky for a backdrop, the long snout and an eye can be seen as well as a large belly, two legs and even a tail. The cloud looks remarkably like the creature described in the 1963 popular song Puff, The Magic Dragon by music group Peter, Paul and Mary. Puff, The Magic Dragon: An unusual cloud forms the appearance of a dragon in the sky above Krakow, Poland . Taking shape: A large cloud appears to form the mainland of the United Kingdom - but with Northern Ireland missing . The lyrics were based on a 1959 poem by Leonard Lipton, a 19-year-old Cornell University student. It tells the story of the ageless dragon Puff and his playmate Jackie Paper, a little boy who grows up and loses interest in the imaginary adventures of childhood and leaves Puff alone and depressed. The story of the song takes place 'by the sea' in the fictional land of Honalee. The unusual cloud was captured on camera by Henryk T Kaiser, from Krakow, Poland, above his home town. Eerie: A cloud formation pictured by Henry T Kaiser resembles a face . Different interpretations: A cloud appears to form the appearance of Pegasus or a jockey riding a horse . He has managed to photograph several striking cloud formations - including one that looks like a face and another that forms the shape of a pyramid.

Killed: Jill Meagher was found dead in September last year after failing to return home from a night out . The man accused of raping and murdering Irish journalist Jill Meagher left her body in a dark alley then returned home to fetch a spade with which to bury her, a court heard today. Adrian Bayley is alleged to have attacked the victim as she was coming home from a night out, then strangled her to stop her reporting the crime. The 41-year-old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates' Court today in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid being committed to a higher court. Mrs Meagher, 29, from Co Louth, left a Melbourne bar to walk the short distance home at 1.30am on September 22 last year, prosecutor Gavin Silbert said. Eight minutes later she was accosted by Bayley, who dragged her into a deserted alleyway, raped her three times and then strangled her 'because she was the only witness to the crime', according to the prosecutor. Mr Silbert said Bayley left his victim lying in the alley and went back to his home in the suburb of Coburg, not far from where Mrs Meagher lived with her husband Tom. Bayley then allegedly returned to the scene at 4.22am in his white saloon car after picking up a shovel. He put Mrs Meagher’s body in the boot of the car and four minutes later drove to another town where he used the spade to dig a shallow grave at the side of a road and bury the Irish woman, the court heard. Suspect: Adrian Bayley is accused of raping Mrs Meagher three times then killing her by strangling . Mr Silbert said that five days after the murder Bayley was interviewed by homicide detectives in a 22-hour interrogation. During the interview, Bayley allegedly admitted to raping and strangling Mrs Meagher, and directed homicide detectives to where she was buried. Mrs Meagher's husband, parents and brother were in the court for the first day of the committal hearing. Mr Meagher had to leave the court in distress several times as the graphic details of his wife's murder were recounted. Couple: Mrs Meagher with her husband Tom, with whom she lived in Melbourne having left her native Ireland . Distraught: Mr Meagher with his brother-in-law Michael McKeon outside a court hearing . Pathologist Matthew Lynch told the court that Mrs Meagher had been strangled with ‘sustained force’. He said he had gone to the site where Mrs Meagher was buried at about 2am on September 27 after being told by homicide detectives that there had been a development in the search for the woman. Dr Lynch said he helped remove dirt from the burial site and then assisted in bringing her body from the ground. She was wearing some clothes, he said, and was lying on her left side. When he carried out a post mortem examination later that morning he found evidence of neck compression. He discovered haemorrhages and bruising on her neck, along with bleeding in neck muscles and fractures to her larynx. Police: Forensic officers involved in the search for Mrs Meagher's body after she went missing in September . Tribute: Flowers were left outside the shop where Mrs Meagher was last seen alive via CCTV footage . Dr Lynch said those injuries suggested manual compression involving sustained force. Under cross examination from Bayley’s defence lawyer, Dr Lynch said it was possible Mrs Meagher could have died if the force of the neck compression had ceased when she was unconscious while lying on her back with her airway blocked. At the end of today’s hearing, Bayley stood in the dock and pleaded guilty to one count of rape but not guilty to murder. He also pleaded not guilty to a further two counts of rape. Mr Meagher stormed from the court, visibly upset, after Bayley announced his pleas. The defendant has been committed to stand trial in the Victorian Supreme Court on a date to be arranged.

A former KGB agent suspected of murdering Alexander Litvinenko has told a press conference that he will no longer assist the UK-based inquest into the spy's death. Andrei Lugovoy, who is now a Russian politician, told a conference in Moscow hosted by Russian news agency Interfax that he could not receive 'justice' in Britain. According to Interfax, Lugovoy told the . press conference: 'I have no hope to get justice in the UK. I finally . lost faith in the possibility of an impartial investigation of the case . in England. I have to say that I'm out of the coroner's investigation . and I will not participate in it.' Mr Litvinenko, 43, died in November 2006 after he was poisoned with polonium-210 while drinking tea at a London meeting - allegedly with Lugovoy, who denies all involvement. Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko at London's University College Hospital shortly before his death in 2006 . While attempts to extradite Lugovoy . to the UK have been rejected by the Russians, it was thought he might . have provided video-link evidence to the inquest in London.The prime . suspect in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko will ask a British judge . to allow lie-detector evidence to be admitted at the inquest into the . death of the Russian dissident. Andrei Lugovoi, who is accused of . poisoning Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210  at a London . hotel in 2006, says the results of  the polygraph test he took in Russia . earlier this year prove he was not involved. The Crown Prosecution Service has . named Mr Lugovoi as the prime suspect in the case and is seeking his . extradition to the UK to face trial. But the former Russian intelligence . officer has refused to surrender himself to British justice and has . agreed only to provide video evidence to the inquest next year. He has asked his lawyers to challenge . rules which prevent  lie-detector evidence being admitted in court . because it is considered unreliable. It has been claimed that Lugovoy and another former KGB agent, Dmitry Kovtun, poisoned Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. Lugovoi said charges against him were part of a smear campaign by Kremlin foes and British secret services aimed at discrediting Russia . A previous hearing was told that Mr Litvinenko had been hired by MI6 for a number of years and was working with the Spanish secret service investigating the Russian mafia shortly before his death. He was said to regularly meet with an MI6 handler, named only as Martin, in central London and was paid by both the British and Spanish secret services into a joint bank account he held with his wife. Last month, coroner Sir Robert Owen ruled that sensitive evidence alleged to expose Mr Litvinenko's ties to MI6 will be examined in secret. His family have urged the Government to reveal the documents but Foreign Secretary William Hague has argued that the disclosure could pose a risk to national security. The nature of the evidence contained within the files remains unclear but lawyers for the Litvinenko family claim the documents could point towards Russian state involvement. The inquest is due to formally open on May 1, more than six years after Mr Litvinenko was killed. A spokesman for the inquest said: ""It is too early to say whether Mr Lugovoy will be called to give evidence and, if he is, how it would be given.""","Andrei Lugovoi says he will no longer assist coroner .

A Washington mother has been arrested and her 22-month-old child put into care after shocking footage of her feeding the boy marijuana from a bong was anonymously handed into police. The cell phone footage shows the young boy taking a hit from the top of the device while his 24-year-old mother, Rachelle Braaten laughs uproariously with a group of adults. Arrested on Friday at home in Centralia along with the boys 25-year-old father Tyler J. Lee, police recovered 40 marijuana plants inside the property in addition to illegal firearms. The boy's name has not been released. Scroll down for video . The little boy is seen here breathing in from the bong - given to him by his 24-year-old mother Rachelle Braaten . Braaten appeared before a Lewis County Superior Court judge in Chehalis on Monday where prosecutors requested she be held for 72 hours - but Braaten was released yesterday on $20,000 bail - she has yet to be formally charged . Parents of the year: Rachelle Lee Braaten and Tyler Lee were arrested after police discovered they let their toddler smoke marijuana from a bong . When the police arrived at her door, Braaten is alleged to have said, 'I guess it was a joke and stupid mistake that wasn't really funny.' Claiming that her son displayed no ill-effects from the cannabis hit, Braaten said that she felt 'horrible' for what she did and said that it happened five-months ago. 'Because he is two and he shouldn't have known about that,' said Braaten. 'He shouldn't have that in his body.' In the disturbing video the young child rears back and coughs after inhaling the drugs as people are heard to laugh in the room. 'At this point, the other people in the room begin laughing louder and the child looks at the camera taken aback, and the video ends,' prosecutors wrote in court documents. Braaten appeared before a Lewis County Superior Court judge in Chehalis on Monday where prosecutors requested she be held for 72 hours - but Braaten was released yesterday on $20,000 bail according to the Lewis County Sirens. Lewis County Deputy Prosecutor Shane O’Rourke told the judge there is probable cause for the offense of delivery of a controlled substance by a person over 18 to a person under 18. Father knows best: Both Lee's son and another unidentified child at the house are now in state custody . O’Rourke’s court documents outline how police in Centralia received the anonymous video with information regarding the parents and obtained a search warrant for Braaten's home. Initially denying responsibility, in subsequent police interviews, Braaten allegedly admitted it was her in the video and that she and a number of other people were passing around a bong. She claimed it happened four or five months ago. The wayward mother said to police that she was pressured by the group around her to administer the hit and knew she shouldn't be doing it. Braaten does have history with the police. In 2011, she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a household member 2:20 a.m. at her home in Centralia. It is not known who the family member was. The boy's father, Braaten's fiance Tyler Lee, claimed he was a medicinal marijuana user. But he too was arrested, allegedly confessing he also sold the marijuana to a dispensary. Going down: Lee is accused of unlawful possession of a firearm and manufacturing marijuana . Child protective services took custody of Braaten's boy and put him into care along with her other five-year-old son, while authorities process the accusations against her. The child's father was released on Monday while the police work out what charges to file against him. Braaten was booked on one count of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance to a minor and one count of manufacture of marijuana - she is expected to be charged on Tuesday.","The infant was given the drug hit by his 24-year-old mother Rachelle Braaten and the incident was recorded on a cell phone .

A woman suffocated her elderly mother in a suspected mercy killing before stabbing herself to death, it emerged today. Kathleen Sawyer, 64, and her frail mum Irene, 95, were found dead in their terraced house in Kings Heath, Birmingham, on February 11. Police initially treated the deaths as 'unexplained' but a post mortem has now confirmed Irene died as a result of suffocation, and that Kathleen was killed by blood loss from a chest injury. Tragic: A post mortem has shown Irene Sawyer, left, died as a result of suffocation, while her daughter Kathleen, right, died from blood loss due to a chest injury . West Midlands Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths and the matter has now been referred to the coroner. It had been feared the pair, who were found in the living room of the home they shared, had died after breathing in fumes from the gas fire. 'Doting' daughter Kathleen was a full-time carer to her mother, who had experienced a sharp decline in health in the 12 months before her death. An inquest will now be held to probe the possibility that Kathleen killed her mother out of mercy before taking her own life. Speaking after their deaths, Irene’s sister-in-law Hilda Goodwin, 84, said Irene, who worked in a curtain shop until she retired, could no longer get upstairs and slept in a bed in the living room. Hilda said: 'Irene’s legs had gone so she slept downstairs in the living room and Kathleen would usually go up to bed after making sure her mum was warm and had enough blankets. 'Kathleen doted on her mum completely, she never went out apart from to get groceries. Kathleen lived in that house all her life - 64 years. 'She only had one job her whole life, working for social security and she went about as high as she could go in that job. 'It’s strange that they died as they lived - together.' 'They died as they lived': The mother and daughter were found in the living room of their home in Kings Heath, Birmingham, on February 11 . Detective Inspector Pete Dunn, of West Midlands Police, said at the time of the deaths: 'Neighbours contacted police out of concern that neither woman had been seen for some time. 'They could see the fire was on through the window but weren’t getting an answer at the door.' Neighbour Janet Wheatley, 69, said her daughter raised the alarm after they hadn’t seen the pair for four days. She said: 'They kept themselves to themselves mostly, Irene had been very ill so she mostly stayed in the house. You’d sometimes see Kath push her out in a wheelchair but only to go to the park or something like that.' Mrs Wheatley said she had gone round to the house three times after her husband noticed uncollected milk bottles piling up outside. 'I went around there three times, I was banging away on the window, lifting the letterbox up, calling Kath’s name, thinking they’d answer but they didn’t,' she said. 'My daughter came round and called the police at about half past six.' Officers found the pair in the living room of their £140,000 terraced house in Balaclava Road. Mrs Wheatley told of her shock at the deaths of her neighbours. 'They were nice people, Kath was a very caring girl, a lovely person really,' she said. 'I used to see her leaving for work and she’d just be walking up the street looking back and waving goodbye to her mum.' She added that Kathleen Sawyer, who had never married, was an only child and her father Frank died around 30 years ago from a stroke.","Kathleen Sawyer, 64, and mother Irene, 95, were found dead in their home .

Alan Bennett said being touched on his legs by older men when he was a child did not bother him . Alan Bennett has revealed he was ‘touched up by old gentlemen’ as a young boy – but claims it didn’t bother him. The 78-year-old playwright and author said the incidents happened when he was about ten or 12, and never went any further. In Bennett’s acclaimed play The History Boys, English teacher Hector is known to fondle some of his pupils while driving them home on his motorbike. But the character is portrayed sympathetically and the 17-year-old students tolerate his advances. It now seems Bennett may have been drawing on his own experiences. He told the Radio Times: ‘When I was young, ten or 12, one often found one’s legs were touched up by old gentlemen, in a mild sort of way. ‘It never got beyond that. I remember thinking, “Oh God, here we go again”. But it didn’t bother me. I knew it was wrong, but I shouldn’t say anything about it because I knew they would get into trouble. ‘But the notion that one would be scarred for life…’ In his short autobiographical play Cocktail Sticks, which was first shown last year, Bennett revealed he was once ‘interfered with’ in a Leeds cinema by an adult male customer. But in the Radio Times interview Bennett played the episode down, saying it was ‘in a mild way’.

Britain could be forced to hold European elections on Sundays as part of a blatant EU bid to erase our long democratic tradition. For 72 years, elections to Westminster have been held on a Thursday, with local elections also being held on the first Thursday in May. Proposals from the European Commission would see the UK having to fall in line behind most of the continent, where elections are held on Sundays. The plan would force Britain to ditch its tradition of voting on a Thursday for the first time in seven decades . The plan, which would come into force in time for the 2014 elections for the European Parliament, is described as a step to cement further ‘political union’. Would you rather vote on a Sunday, as Europe wants Britain to do, instead of a Thursday? In addition, Britons would also have to sit through party political broadcasts on TV to encourage them to choose the next President of the European Commission. The last time a British election was not held on a Thursday was in 1931 – in the midst of the Great Depression – when polling was on a Tuesday. The last vote to be held on a weekend was 1918, when a Saturday poll – the first to feature women – was held in the aftermath of the First World War. The proposal is contained in a European Commission discussion paper, the Daily Telegraph reported. It said: ‘A common European voting day with polling stations closing at the same time would better reflect common participation by citizens across the union and therefore is part of the representative democracy on which the EU is founded.’ UKIP MEP Nigel Farage vowed to oppose a common voting day for euro elections . The next Euro election is due in early June 2014. It had been expected that the voting dates would be between 5 and 8 June. The UK would have expected to vote on Thursday 5 June, and there were plans in train to move the local election voting day from early May to 5 June to coincide with the European vote. But instead, if the Commission gets its way, the UK would vote on Sunday 8 June. There are fears that turnout could fall if the Euro poll was not held on the same say as the council elections. Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, said: ‘We absolutely oppose a common voting day for euro elections and would be appalled if local elections were held on a different day.’ Aside from the UK, only the Netherlands vote on Thursdays. Ireland and the Czech Republic hold the euro vote on Friday. Cyprus, France, Italy Latvia, Malta, and Slovakia hold the polling day on Saturday and all other 17 EU countries hold it on Sunday. David Cameron may be forced to use his veto to prevent a change in the voting day. The proposed plans also require Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and UKIP party political broadcasts to ask voters to choose between candidates for president of the European Union’s Brussels executive during euro-elections next May. The Commission proposal says: ‘European and national political parties should make known, ahead of the elections to the European Parliament, the candidate for the function of the President of the European Commission they support. ‘National political parties should ensure that their political broadcasts in view of the European Parliament elections are also used to inform citizens about the candidate they support.’ Ashley Fox MEP, Conservative spokesman on EU constitutional affairs, said: ‘There is no need for an elected President of Europe because there is no country called Europe. Only sovereign countries need an elected head of state, whereas the EU is an international organisation.’ The proposal includes the requirement that national parties must state their affiliation to European political parties, which are not well known in Britain or elsewhere in Europe. Elections to the European Parliament in Brussels are to be held in June next year . ‘National political parties participating in the elections to the European Parliament should make publicly known ahead of those elections their affiliation with European political parties,’ the proposal says. ‘National political parties should prominently display their affiliation with European political parties in all campaign materials, communications and political broadcasts.’ Under the Lisbon Treaty, the next president of the commission will be the candidate selected by the European political party with the most votes in the euro elections. ‘It would increase the legitimacy of the president of the commission and more generally, the democratic legitimacy of the whole EU decision-making process,’ says the proposal. ‘It could also contribute to raising the turnout for European elections by strengthening the link between the election of the representatives of the citizens with the selection and election process of the head of the European executive.’ Since the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, turnout has declined in each successive vote.","European Commission wants to end seven decades of British voters going to the polls on Thursdays .

Voyeur: Married Graham Bevan, 53, watched the 'explicit' footage on his home computer of three women in the bathroom of the Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks . A voyeuristic support worker at a care home filmed female colleagues using the toilet for his own 'perverted sexual gratification', a court heard. Married Graham Bevan, 53, watched the 'explicit' footage on his home computer of three women in the bathroom of the Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks. Today, a remorseful Bevan - who is 'ashamed and embarrassed' - was given a three-year supervision order, with a 9pm to 7am curfew, ordered to complete 100 hours unpaid work and sign the sex offenders' register for five years after pleading guilty to two counts of voyeurism and one of attempting to observe a person doing a private act, without their consent. Bradford Crown Court heard Bevan, of Haworth, had worked at the residential home since 2007 and had secretly rigged up his Sony Ericsson mobile in the communal toilet and successfully recorded a number of colleagues. Prosecutor Shamalia Qureshi said the phone was discovered on 1 December 2011 when a woman using the lavatory heard it vibrating and removed it and showed it to her supervisor. 'The defendant snatched it from her and went to the rear fire exit,' said Ms Qureshi. 'He was pressing buttons on the mobile phone and said he was deleting everything on the phone.' Bevan apologised to the woman who'd found it, but the police were informed and he was arrested and admitted it was a 'silly thing to do.' Police seized a Dell computer from his home and discovered seven videos had been downloaded featuring three of his female colleagues, and a male using the toilet. Ms Qureshi said his victims viewed the footage. She said: 'They were sickened and disgusted by what they had been shown and felt their privacy had been violated.' Another stated: 'I'm upset someone I trusted and worked with could do this. He makes my skin crawl. He makes me feel so sick.' Mitigating Arshad Mahmood said Bevan had not shown the videos to anybody else and he had initially set up the phone to record how many people were using the toilet. 'However, it transpired that when he saw the videos he was aroused and so he accepts he kept these on his computer system,' said Mr Mahmood, who added Bevan had been fired by the residential home. Captured: Bevan had worked at Three Sisters and Bronte View residential home, in Haworth, West Yorks., since 2007 where he secretly rigged up his Sony Ericsson mobile in the communal toilet and successfully recorded a number of colleagues . 'He is extremely ashamed and embarrassed.' Sentencing Judge John Potter told Bevan: 'The purpose of these offences was to fulfill your own perverted sexual gratification. 'This was in any view an insidious offence which must have caused distress to your victims when they were told what had occurred.

A boy playing in his bedroom hanged himself with his shoe laces in a tragic accident, an inquest heard today. Lee Warren, 13, was found alive by his mother but later died later in hospital. An inquest heard that she discovered Lee hanging from his bunk bed at his home in Kingshurst, Birmingham. Birmingham's assistant deputy coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe said Lee had a habit of playing with his laces, putting his arms and legs through them. 'This is the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy,' she said. 'He was not anything other than a happy child on the day he died.' Ms Ormond-Walshe told the inquest that Lee was found at 9.10pm on February 10 last year. There was no suggestion he had mental health problems or was under the influence of any substance, she said. 'He appears to have been playing when he accidentally caused his own death by hanging.' The tragedy was the second to hit Lee's . family. His uncle, Patrick Warren, has never been found after he . disappeared with a friend in Chelmsley Wood on Boxing Day in 1996.

A student who was left in a coma after a minivan driven by a classmate crashed in New Zealand last year has returned to university, almost a year after the near-fatal accident. Meg Theriault was seriously injured in the crash which killed three Boston University students in May 2012, while they were spending a semester studying in New Zealand and Australia. The promising 21-year-old had to have a chunk of her skull removed to heal a dangerous blood clot in her brain, but now she has made a remarkable recovery and has been attending classes at BU again. Scroll down for video . Return: Meg Theriault has attended her first class at Boston University since being involved in a car crash . Learning: The BU student is auditing an accountancy class and received a B on her first test . Reunion: Meg with Dustin Holstein, another student who was involved in the accident in New Zealand . Meg does not remember the crash, which saw the minivan driven by Stephen Houseman drift off the road and roll over, killing Austin Brashears, Daniela Lekhno and Roch Jauberty. Five other students were injured - but none so badly as Meg, who was discovered at the scene by classmate Dustin Holstein breathing in a way 'where it's like you're on the verge of dying'. Rather than returning home to Massachusetts a few days later as she had planned, the business major was confined to a hospital bed in New Zealand. She had a fractured skull and blood clots in the brain, causing doctors to remove part of her skull to relieve the swelling. Hospital: Meg slipped into a coma after the minivan driven by a classmate rolled over on the road . Damage: The popular student had part of her brain removed and replaced with a plastic implant . Care: Meg's mother Deb helps her navigate the stairs in their home in Salisbury, Massachusetts . Her parents Todd and Deb - who later said they did not blame Mr Houseman for the crash, because 'that could have been any one of our kids at the wheel' - flew across the world to be at her side. It took a month before Meg smiled again, and at that time she was still confined to hospital in Boston. Her flowing hair brunette hair had been cut short and she was made to wear a hockey helmet to protect her brain where the skull had been cut out. She insisted she would complete her degree at BU and get a top job as an accountant - but two months after the crash, she still could not remember her multiplication tables. Meg underwent intense physical and speech therapy intended to teach her how to feed, bathe and dress herself. Agony: The student had to wear a hockey helmet for months to protect her brain from further damage . Rehab: A therapist worked with Meg in the months after the accident to help her walk again . In early August, she was allowed to return home, to a house in the town of Salisbury which had been specially kitted out to take account of her condition. With the help of extra bannisters and railings and a modified bathroom, she started to be able to take care of herself - but she still needed her parents to drive her in to Boston twice a week for therapy. Meg started seeing other people again around this time, but was humiliated by having to wear her helmet and told two friends: 'Sorry you have to see me like this.' She was still plagued by her injuries - and doctors said the damage to her brain had caused her to overestimate the pace of her own recovery. But in September, on the first day of the new academic year, she finally had her skull repaired, with surgeons inserting a custom-made piece of plastic where the bone had been cut away. Prep: Meg with a nurse before the operation to repair her skull last September . Surgery: Surgeons, nurses and anaestheologists laying Meg out on the operating table . Procedure: The operating table at Massachusetts General Hospital during Meg's surgery . She was keen to return to college following the operation, but her therapist advised her to attend community college or audit a BU class instead. University officials allowed her to audit an accounting class this semester, and in January she made a triumphant return to the campus. She slipped in to her first class a few minutes late, blaming traffic - the lecturer jokingly replied, 'Excuses.' The results from Meg's first test came in February - 'I got a B, which is OK,' she said. 'Not great, not phenomenal.' Disaster: The minivan carrying eight BU students which crashed in New Zealand in May last year . Fatal: Austin Brashears (left), Roch Jauberty (centre) and Daniela Lekhno (right) were killed in the crash . In addition to her return to college, the student has reunited with some of those who were also involved in the horror crash in New Zealand during what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. She has reunited with Mr Houseman, who was banned from the road for six months after pleading guilty to careless driving. And she has also seen Mr Holstein, who has suffered flashbacks since the accident but said that having Meg back at BU would help heal the mental scars. 'She can tell her story on how she fought back from such a terrible accident,' he said. 'And that alone, at least people will remember who was lost on that day and the good that can come out of a situation that was so horrible.'","Meg Theriault, 21, had part of skull removed after being injured in crash .

In a text message to his son, Chris Huhne wrote he had ‘no intention of sending Mum to Holloway Prison’. But that is exactly where Vicky Pryce was last night as she began her eight-month jail sentence. Conditions in the prison, Europe’s largest women’s jail, will be a world away from her £2million Clapham townhouse ten miles across London. Behind bars: Chris Huhne (left, arriving at court with partner Carina Trimingham) will be starting his eight month sentence at Wandsworth Prison, while Vicky Pryce (right) will be at Holloway Prison . Victorian walls: Wandsworth Prison, in South London, which is home to 1,600 hardened cons . Institution: HMP Holloway Prison holds up to 500 criminals from murderesses to petty thieves . The jail, which holds up to 500 criminals from murderesses to petty thieves, has a reputation as a brutal and unrelenting institution where bullying and pilfering is rife. Petty squabbles frequently erupt into violence. Huhne’s destination was similarly bleak: the Victorian walls of Category B Wandsworth Prison in South London, which is home to 1,600 hardened cons. Both the former Cabinet minister and his economist ex-wife were ferried from the court in the back of a prison van known as the ‘sweatbox’ which carries convicted felons to nearby prisons. On arrival at Holloway, Pryce’s handcuffs will have been removed and she will have stood in line with the other arrivals waiting to be processed. After a pat down search (women inmates are not required to strip) for any contraband, she will have confirmed her personal details to a prison officer, including her name and date of birth. She will have handed over her purse, handbag, keys and mobile phone to be placed into secure storage, have had her fingerprints taken and have posed for a prison mugshot. Like all other women prisoners she will be allowed to wear her own clothes while behind bars. Vicky Pryce (left) outside her South London home, prior to being sentenced for perverting the course of justice, and Chris Huhne (right) leaving his home in central London on Sunday . Holloway has a mixture of cells: single, shared between two and larger dorms. But a prison source said it was unlikely Pryce would have to share. Her high profile and wealth leave her more open to threats and blackmail – and prison bosses will want to ensure she comes to no harm. Holloway has a gym, pool table and hairdressing salon and televisions in cells, but the institution and its occupants will still be a terrifying prospect for Pryce. A recent inspection report exposed widespread bullying and violence. As well as violent drug addicts, prostitutes and petty villains, the prison holds lifers with little to lose. Former residents include Tracey Connelly, the mother of Baby P, and Rochelle Etherington, 21, who beat her neighbour to death. A Wandsworth Prison officer watches over the cells on E wing . Huhne’s new neighbours behind Wandsworth’s walls will be no more savoury, from violent killers to armed robbers, thugs and burglars. Unlike his wife, he will have no choice about what he can wear behind bars. At the weekend it emerged he once visited a stylist to get his ‘colours’ done – before throwing out any shirts and ties that didn’t match recommended tones. But at ‘Wanno’, it will be prison-issue blue trousers or jeans and grey sweatshirt. If he wants a haircut, it will be the prison barber, rather than his usual £75 affair. He too is unlikely to be in a shared cell, even after he is transferred onto a main wing of the prison after a few days of acclimatisation. His cell will have a television and a toilet at the end of the bed, which has a duvet and a single pillow. Tracey Connelly, the mother of Baby P, is among the former residents of Holloway Prison . Jonathan Aitken, another onetime cabinet minister jailed for lying, writes in his autobiography of the terrifying chants other inmates struck up when the lights went out, describing how they wanted to hurt him. He writes: ‘I do not think I have ever felt more lonely, more frightened or more vulnerable.’ Huhne’s notoriety means he can expect similar treatment. Both he and his ex-wife will be grateful their stays in central London jails will be short. After a week or two at most they will be moved to a low security ‘open prison’, probably East Sutton Park in Maidstone, Kent, for her and he to Ford Open in West Sussex. Under these low security Category D conditions both will have more freedom to leave their cells, mix with other white collar criminals and take part in prison activities. Both are likely to be granted early release after just a quarter of their sentence, and will return home wearing an electronic tag and under a strict eight-hour curfew. But last night that will have felt a long way away. After processing at their respective prisons, each was handed a simple arrival pack containing basic toiletries such as a soap and a toothbrush and a chocolate bar. Both will have been allowed a shower . and then a short phone call of a few minutes. Then it will be off to the . cells, the key turning in the lock and then lights out. Mark . Leech,an ex-convict turned prisons expert and editor of inmates . newspaper Converse, believes Huhne will be deemed at risk to self harm . or even suicide and placed in the prison hospital. ‘He . has fallen an incredible distance from grace in a very short space of . time, until recently he was in complete denial of his offence and this . is his first time in prison,’ he said. ‘He’s a convict now, no different to . anyone else in the prison and he needs to knuckle down, accept his fate . and get on with progressing through the prison system’ - Mark Leech, ex-con and editor of inmates newspaper Converse . ‘As such he bears on his face all the classic hallmarks of a person susceptible to self harm and suicide.’ The cells in Wandsworth are 12ft by 7ft with a window high in the back wall and a toilet and wash basin behind a small modesty screen in the corner. Huhne will have to leave fine dining behind for now, as he is presented with typical Wandsworth grub, such as a stew dubbed the ‘mystery bowl’ and a cup of a bitter tea known as ‘diesel’. Mr Leech said he expected Huhne to be mocked by his fellow prisoners and even by the prison staff – with jibes about his privileged background almost inevitable. Mr Leech added: ‘Life as he has known it before today will never be the same again. It’s important to his safety that he doesn’t put on airs and graces. ‘He’s a convict now, no different to anyone else in the prison and he needs to knuckle down, accept his fate and get on with progressing through the prison system.’","Vicky Pryce began her eight month sentence at Holloway Prison .

For years, Lisa Faulkner tried everything to conceive the baby she so badly wanted. Round after round of costly IVF treatment wiped out the actress’s savings and left her ‘a walking mess’ – all for nothing. The 41-year-old, now the proud mother of an adopted daughter and dating MasterChef host John Torode, has spoken of her struggle to start  a family and the heartbreak of  failed IVF. Miss Faulkner said: ‘It’s a really, really tough process. I don’t think people have any idea until they go through it. ‘It’s not just the physical stuff – it’s the emotions and the hormones that are pumping through your body. ‘You’re on this whole trip of desperation for a baby and you’ll do  anything. I was determined that I would be a mother.’ She underwent four rounds of  treatment, at a total cost of £35,000. In an interview in The Lady magazine, she added: ‘I said I’d give IVF three goes, and I ended up doing four. I spent all of my savings. But also mentally, I couldn’t go through it again.’ Miss Faulkner, who starred in BBC show Holby City and won Celebrity MasterChef in 2010, married actor Chris Coghill in 2005, three years after they met on the set of the drama Burn It. They began trying for a child, but she suffered an ectopic pregnancy at six weeks which left her with only one working fallopian tube. Miss Faulkner decided to seek private fertility treatment when she was in her early-30s. She would have been eligible for free NHS treatment but chose to pay to avoid long waiting lists. Couple: Lisa has been dating MasterChef host John Torode since October last year . During IVF, an egg is removed from a woman’s ovaries. It is fertilised in a laboratory and returned to the womb. Private treatment can cost £10,000. Miss Faulkner said: ‘Every day I was injecting myself [with medication]. I was a walking mess of hormones – crying all the time. I was emotional, sad and just desperate for it to work. It was horrendous.’ Exhausted, the couple researched surrogacy before adopting their daughter Billie in 2008 when she was 15 months old. She is now six. Success: Lisa presents daily Channel 4 food show What's Cooking? with Ben Shepherd . Miss Faulkner, who presents a daily Channel 4 food show, What’s Cooking?, added: ‘I wanted to be a mum for a very, very long time and I feel very blessed that I finally am. ‘I love Billie so much and I want her to have everything that she could possibly have.’ She and Coghill split in April last year and she began dating Torode, 47, in October after they met on MasterChef. She has spent time working at his Smiths of Smithfield restaurant in London, and they appeared together on BBC1’s science series Food Factory.

In 2008, Scott Douglas and his brother-in-law Rich St. Pierre were thrown overboard from their fishing boat off the coast of Nantucket during a horrendous storm, but were able to swim to safety. More than three years after the Queen Bee was lost at sea, it turned up in the most unlikely of places - off the coast of Spain. The ship made an incredible three-year journey across the continental shelf, startling the Spanish Coast Guard and surprising the boat's former owners. Out of the sea: The Queen Bee emerged at the coast of Spain after a mysterious journey across the Atlantic . Before Davey Jones' locker: The Queen Bee looked like this Regulator 26, a fishing boat with two external motors . The 26-foot Queen Bee is a little worse for the wear and is covered in mould, rust, and barnacles, but its two motors are still attached, the Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror reports. The word ‘Nantucket’ is clearly visible written across the ship’s starboard. According to Spanish media, the boat still contained a first-aid kit, a radio, fire extinguishers, and maps of the U.S. East Coast. Mr Douglas, 58, was shocked to see the vessel again, and in a different form. ‘It looks entirely different,’ he said after he saw photos of the Regulator 26. ‘That’s amazing.’ Mr St Pierre agreed. ‘It’s a good ending and it’s nice to have some closure,' he told CBS Boston, 'but I’d love to know what happened to it over three and a half years.' According to U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Lt Joe Klinker, the boat most likely travelled so far by catching the Gulf Stream. Still visible: The word 'Nantucket' - where the ship sank more than there years ago - is still clear and legible on the ship's bow . The incredible journey: Coast Guard officials believe the Queen Bee caught the Gulf Stream along the ocean's continental shelf, allowing it to travel so far . Lt Klinker said it was incredibly rare, but not unheard of, for a ship to make such a long journey, or emerge from the depths of Davey Jones' locker. It was uncommon that the 26-foot Queen Bee made a trans-Atlantic journey without being destroyed. 'It’s a good ending and it's nice to . have some closure, but I’d love to know what . happened to it over three and a half years.' -Survivor Rich St. Pierre . Mr Douglas told msnbc.com that the weather was very violent in August 2008 when he was out fishing in the Queen Bee. ‘You wouldn’t want to be dumped in the ocean out there.’ But a rogue wave sent him and Mr St Pierre, 68, overboard and into the tumultuous currents. While Mr Douglas could tread water easily enough, Mr St Pierre had open heart surgery the year before and was struggling. Miraculously, a survival kit had fallen overboard, the only thing to fall from their stricken boat. That helped the two of them swim about an hour to an island, where they were able to use a cabin’s phone to call the Coast Guard. ‘At the end of the day, it just wasn’t our time,’ Mr Douglas told msnbc.com. He now lives in New Jersey and has no interest in getting his boat back. But he said it might make a good children’s book to be read to his four grandchildren.","26-foot Queen Bee disappeared in Nantucket in 2008 after a storm .

The father of Ram Singh, the key accused in the December 16 gang-rape case, has dismissed the police version of his son's death inside Tihar Jail and demanded a CBI probe to bring out the truth. Mange Lal Singh said his son could not have committed suicide even though he was reportedly facing harassment inside the prison. ""We had been meeting him during trial and otherwise, and we know that he couldn't have committed suicide… he had only one good, functional arm, how could he have committed suicide,"" he said. Ram Sing's parents, Ram Bai (left) and Mange Lal Singh do not believe their son took his own life in prison . In a shocking claim, the father said . Ram Singh had told him that he was sodomised inside the jail. ""Jail mein . uska balatkar hua."" He also claimed that he had seen blade marks on his son's body during a jail visit. Mr Singh said: ""He (Ram Singh) was murdered and hanged...evidence is being tampered, and I want a CBI probe and commitment of security for my other son (Mukesh, also an accused in the gang-rape case)."" Many people at the Ravi Dass camp who knew Ram Singh expressed disbelief at his alleged suicide. The infamous slum cluster in South Delhi's R.K. Puram was home to four of the six accused in the gang-rape incident which triggered national outrage in December last year. ""We can't be sure that a man like him could commit suicide. Anyway, it couldn't have been better that the monster is dead. No one should cry over it,"" said an elderly woman living close to the house of the deceased. Ram Bai wept at her home as she spoke of the death of her son Ram Singh. The family suspect 'foul play' by the authorities . Inconsolable: Ram Singh's parents said he appeared fine and gave no hint of despair when his father visited four days ago . Ram Singh's father occasionally visits the family's house in the R.K. Puram slum cluster, though the families of the gang-rape defendants are treated as social outcasts in the area . In the wake of the incident, which was discovered early on March 11, the families of two other defendants - Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta - were worried about their safety inside the jail. These families are already treated as social outcasts in the locality. ""Even though my son didn't have anything to do with the (gang-rape) incident or Ram Singh, we know that Singh couldn't have committed suicide. Not at this stage when the police's case is so weak. Will they do the same to Vinay too? I am worried. He's innocent. Someone save him,"" said Champa Devi, Vinay's mother. She said she found out about the alleged suicide through neighbours, and maintained her son was innocent. ""He has only been arrested because of that unfortunate association with monster Ram Singh,"" she said. Champa Devi claimed her son's reported statement of guilt, in which he reportedly said the accused should be hanged for what they had done, was made ""under duress"". ""That was extracted out of him by force... I am really worried about him now,"" she said. Champa Devi, the mother of defendant Vinay Sharma, said he was arrested because of his links to 'monster' Ram Singh . Ram Singh's father has been visiting the otherwise locked house belonging to the family in the slum cluster. ""He (Mange Lal) comes around the time when there is a chance to meet his sons at the court, but none of us interacts with him,"" another woman at the camp said. Hira Lal, whose son Pawan is the fourth man accused of involvement in the gang-rape, lives with the rest of his family a few meters from Ram Singh's residence. He was also shocked by the news. ""I am concerned about my son, yes! I will even go to the authorities tomorrow and check with them about the safety arrangements for him but there isn't much I can do. I am poor and have to earn a living for the rest of my family,"" Lal said. Every time there's a criminal case in Delhi that attracts media attention, chief minister Sheila Dikshit raises her voice against the police working under the Union home ministry's control. Despite making public statements about it, the chief minister is reportedly yet to make an official request to the home ministry. Taking her on, Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Monday that she had made no official communication to the home ministry requesting that control of Delhi Police be transferred to the state government. Home Minister S.K. Shinde (left) said that if chief minister Sheila Dikshit (right) wants control of Delhi Police, she should make an official request to his ministry. ""She should write to us about the Delhi Police being placed under the state government. She is a senior leader, we will consider it if she writes to us officially,"" he said. Senior officers of the Delhi Police have always expressed reservations about the prospect of the force coming under the control of the state government. Nonetheless, the chief minister has pressed on with her campaign to gain control of the state police to ensure better functioning and coordination with the city government. Sheila has always been vocal about the deteriorating law and order in the Capital. After the December 16 gang-rape case, she reiterated her demand for placing the local police under the direct control of her government. Dikshit also attacked Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar after the incident, which led to mass protests demanding immediate action to make Delhi safer for women. She was not alone. Even her MP son Sandeep Dikshit joined in and openly expressed his views on the inefficiency of the Delhi Police. By Sana Shakil in New Delhi . ""He never told his family that he was depressed. There was no reason for Ram Singh to commit suicide. There is foul play,"" said V.K. Anand, the lawyer of the main defendant in the December 16 gang-rape case. He was seconded by other defence counsels in the case, who termed Ram's death a ""well-planned murder"" and refuted all theories of it being a suicide. They said they were informed by the four adult defendants on Monday that they were being subjected to harassment in Tihar Jail. Lawyer V.K. Anand, who represented Ram Singh, said his client did not appear depressed and had no reason to take his own life . Talking to reporters in Saket, where a fast-track court is conducting the trial in the case, Anand said: ""Till date, he did not say that his life was in danger or he was depressed. His family was being given access to meet him regularly."" But he added that on Monday the other accused, who appeared with their faces uncovered for the first time that day, had expressed apprehensions about going back to Tihar. ""They don't want to go back to Tihar. They are being abused, slapped around and sexually harassed. They said they are being treated like animals,"" claimed Anand, who is also defending Ram's brother Mukesh. Advocate A.P. Singh, who is representing two other defendants Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur, blamed the Delhi government for Singh's ""murder"", saying that the government had got him killed. ""The government wanted to gain some brownie points before the assembly elections,"" the lawyer claimed. Both the lawyers said they would move pleas to enhance the security of the accused in the case. A.P. Singh said he will move the Supreme Court seeking the transfer of his clients to some other nearby jail in Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, while Anand said he will seek to have the trial transferred to a court outside Delhi. Meanwhile, the fast-track court sought a report  on the alleged suicide from Tihar officials by Tuesday. The other defendants lodged in Tihar Jail told their lawyers they are being abused, threatened and sexually harassed . The family of ""India's daughter"", the young paramedic student raped and fatally injured on December 16, reacted to the news of Ram Singh's alleged suicide with a sense of resignation. ""Ram Singh should have been hanged in public, but fate had a different plan. I am shocked but not saddened,"" the victim's brother said, adding that there was no point in blaming the staff and authorities at Tihar. ""If a person wants to commit suicide, he will do it anyway. We cannot blame anyone for the incident,"" he said. Refusing to believe the conspiracy theory that Singh may have been murdered, he said he was most likely killed by his guilt. ""I think he must have felt guilty about the incident because he hurt an innocent person in such a brutal manner. Ram Singh was aware that he could be sentenced to death,"" he said. ""All the other accused should get the death sentence,"" he added. The victim's father appeared worried that the suicide might damage the ongoing trial. ""I am worried that the suicide might affect the trial, which has been going on smoothly so far,"" he said.","Father demands a CBI probe and enhanced security for his other son Mukesh, a defendant in the same case .

"By . Kritika Sharma and Neetu Chandra . PUBLISHED: . 16:55 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:27 EST, 11 March 2013 . Dead in custody: Ram Singh was on trial for murder, gang-rape, and destruction of evidence, among other charges . The death of Ram Singh, the main accused in the brutal December 16 Vasant Vihar gang-rape case, has turned a spotlight on lapses by Tihar Jail officials, and the number of 'unnatural' deaths at the high-security prison over the past 10 years. Singh's death, which is alleged to have come at his own hand, highlighted the number of suicides at the jail. According to a report by the Department of Psychiatry, Central Jail Hospital, Tihar, around 20 prisoners committed suicide in Tihar Jail over the last decade. All were pre-trial verdict inmates, . like 35-year-old Ram Singh, who became the twenty-first inmate to have . died an unnatural death. In 2012, two inmates committed suicide in the . prison. Singh, who was . lodged inside a high security cell of Jail No. 3 and had been on . suicide watch, was found hanging in his cell early on Monday. At least . one guard from the Tamil Nadu Police was stationed round the clock . outside his cell. But, around 5.45am, other inmates found his lifeless . body hanging from the ceiling and informed the jail authorities. As questions were immediately raised . over the death, and with the post mortem report yet to come, Tihar Jail . officials were unofficially sticking to the theory that Singh had . committed suicide even as senior officials including Vimla Mehra, . director general of Tihar, declined to comment on record about the cause . of death. As the death took place under suspicious circumstances, the Delhi government has ordered an enquiry by a metropolitan magistrate. A report by Tihar Jail's own hospital cites that the actual number of suicides at the prison may be higher than official figures suggest. Such deaths are under-reported in a jail that houses almost 12,000 inmates. Journalists gathered outside Tihar Jail in New Delhi as news of the defendant's death broke . The report from psychiatrists Dr Anju Gupta and Dr N K Girdhar of Central Jail Hospital says: ""Probably suicide rate has increased over last year. The method of committing suicide was hanging in all cases except one by strangulation. All were under-trial detainees and no one was sentenced. Reason might be ongoing stress related to court proceedings and anticipation of unfavorable outcome of trial."" The study revealed that more than half of all inmates who commit suicide in prison are between 25 and 34 years old. B.K. Gupta, a former Police Commissioner & director general (Prisons), said: ""You cannot stop suicides from taking place in prisons, including Tihar. There are four to five cases reported every year in Tihar. ""We have to wait for the post-mortem report and the judicial inquiry report before arriving at any early conclusion. But interesting would be to find out if the CCTV was working in the cell where Ram Singh was kept. He was in a high-risk ward with two more inmates and in such cells CCTVs work 24/7."" The defendant's family members, however, dismissed the suicide theory and were quick to claim Singh had been murdered and his body hanged from the ceiling of his cell by his murderer. Singh's father Mange Ram told Mail Today: ""I had met my son three days ago and he was fine at that time, he did not show any signs of depression. I am sure that somebody murdered him and hanged his body from the ceiling. He had told me many times that he is beaten up regularly inside the jail. The jail inmates and other staff also used to sexually exploit my son. After he told me this, I had asked his lawyer to request the jail authorities to change his cell."" V.K. Anand, Ram Singh's lawyer, repeated claims that his client had been sexually assaulted in jail . Singh's lawyer V.K. Anand seconded the claim of sexual assault. The response from Tihar jail officials was typically sterile. An official statement said: ""Under-trial prisoner Ram Singh, who was lodged in Jail No. 3, was found hanging at around 5.45am. The family members of the deceased were informed about the incident. The matter is being inquired into by judicial officer as per section 176 CrPC. The exact cause of death would be known after receipt of inquiry officer report which includes post mortem report and forensic examination."" Prone to violent behaviour and frequent mood swings, Singh was kept under suicide watch. He had allegedly shown suicidal tendencies and was said to remain aloof inside the prison. According to sources inside Tihar Jail, there were three other inmates in the cell where he was kept but all of them were asleep when Singh died. Jail sources said that Ram Singh and his cell-mates had their dinner and slept at 10pm on Sunday night. ""A guard had last checked his cell at around 2am and by then everything was all right. It is quite possible that he might have committed suicide at a time between 3.30am to 5.45am, when everybody is fast asleep in the jail,"" said a jail insider. Singh, who was to be produced before court for its daily hearing, was rushed to the jail hospital where he was declared brought-in dead. His body has been preserved in the mortuary of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Trauma Centre. A post mortem will be conducted early on Tuesday. What remains in question is why the other three prisoners couldn't hear any noise when Singh was allegedly trying to kill himself. Another question that casts doubt on the suicide theory is that Ram Singh had only partial use of his right arm, and it is not possible for such a person to hang himself using one arm. ""Let the . autopsy report come. The reasons behind the incident will only be known . after submission of the inquiry report,"" said Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Ram's father Mange Lal Singh (pictured) claims his son was sodomised in Tihar Jail and that he saw blade marks on his body . Under investigation: An ambulance leaves Tihar Jail, where Singh was being held . Union Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said security at Tihar Jail would be reviewed . Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Monday that the preliminary inquiry into the death of Ram Singh, the main defendant in the Delhi gang-rape case, suggests he committed suicide in Tihar Jail. Describing the incident as a major security lapse, he said the security on the Tihar Jail premises will be reviewed. ""There is a major security lapse. Preliminary inquiry suggests he committed suicide. The incident is being inquired into by a magistrate. Let us wait for the report,"" Shinde said. Addressing the allegations that Singh was murdered, he said that is exactly what the magistrate will probe. Sources said forensic experts and a team of Delhi Police have reached Tihar Jail to gather evidence in the case. Singh's death has raised questions over the lack of electronic surveillance inside the prison. Asked whether the home ministry will take steps to increase electronic surveillance on the jail premises, Shinde said prisons do not come under his ministry. Earlier in the day, Vimla Mehra, DG (prisons) met Shinde and briefed him about the sequence of events leading to the death of the inmate. Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who was scheduled to meet Shinde for a routine meeting, also discussed the incident with him. By Neetu Chandra in New Delhi . Every year at least two inmates commit suicide in Tihar jail. According to a report of the department of psychiatry, Central Jail Hospital, Tihar, around 20 prisoners have killed themselves in the last 10 years. All were undergoing trial like Ram Singh, who allegedly committed suicide inside his high-security cell on Monday. In 2012, two inmates committed suicide, while 20 prisoners died of other causes. The report from the Tihar Jail hospital states: ""Depression and hopelessness seem to be the two most common psychological factors driving inmates to death. Hopelessness and suicide have a stronger correlation than depression and suicide. ""A period of risk for pre-trial inmates is near the time of a court appearance, especially when a guilty verdict and harsh sentencing may be anticipated. A great deal of all jail suicides occurred within three days of a court appearance."" With various theories being bandied around over the death of Ram Singh, Tihar Jail authorities claim he was not suffering from any mental disorder. ""He seemed fine. There were no suicidal symptoms seen in him. Moreover, we have proper security in the jail. All the inmates are counselled timely, we cannot say why Singh did this,"" said Sunil Gupta, Tihar jail's PRO. Experts often blame suicides on upbringing, childhood neglect, improper parenting and uncontrolled anger. ""These problems don't arise all of a sudden and manifest during childhood. Due to poor guidance and support they tend to engage in petty crimes like stealing. Gradually if the problems are not identified and corrected, these develop into antisocial personality and problems related to drug and alcohol abuse,"" said Dr Sameer Malhotra of Max hospital.

A self-styled street preacher accused in a deadly plot to lure men with Craigslist job offers and then rob them was found guilty of aggravated murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. A jury in Akron returned the verdict in the case against Richard Beasley, who was charged with killing two men from Ohio and one from Norfolk, Virginia. A man from South Carolina was shot but survived and testified about running for his life and hiding in the woods, scared he would bleed to death. Family members of the victims hugged and wiped away tears as the verdict was read. Beasley, who also was convicted of attempted murder in wounding the lone survivor, slumped in his wheelchair, which he uses because of back problems. Richard Beasley peers into the gallery during proceedings in Summit County Common Pleas Court on March 5; he was found guilty today and faces the death penalty . Jack Kern, right, comforts his wife Ellen in court; they are the parents of victim Timothy Kern . The jury that convicted Beasley will return later to consider whether to recommend the death penalty for him. Mugshot: Prosecutors said Beasley lured his first victim, Ralph Geiger, with the offer of a non-existent caretaker job at a rural Ohio ranch . Prosecutors, who had asked jurors to . use common sense and return a guilty verdict, labeled the 53-year-old . Beasley the triggerman in the 2011 plot with a high school student he . mentored. The 16-year-old student, Brogan Rafferty, was convicted and sentenced last year to life in prison without the chance of parole. Prosecutor Jonathan Baumoel told . jurors there was no reasonable doubt that Beasley plotted the killings, . and he presented three possible theories for aggravated murder - . planning the crimes, done with a kidnapping or done with a robbery. He . said there was 'prior calculation and design,' a component of the death . penalty aggravated murder charge. 'He was the mastermind behind this plot,' Baumoel said. Prosecutors said the victims, all . down on their luck and with few family ties that might highlight their . disappearances, were lured with offers of farmhand jobs. One man was killed near Akron, and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews. The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, . of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, . of Massillon. Kern's body was found in a shallow grave near an . Akron-area shopping mall. The survivor, Scott Davis, testified . that he heard the click of a gun as he walked in front of Beasley at the . reputed job site. Davis, who was shot in an arm, knocked the weapon . aside. 'I spun around,' testified Davis, who . told a harrowing story of running through the woods and hiding for . seven hours. 'I was worried about bleeding to death.' On trial: During a prosecutor's opening statement, Richard Beasley was branded a 'false prophet' who took advantage of his victims by giving them 'a message of hope and change and a new start in life' Victims: As well as Ralph Geiger, David Pauley (left) was found buried in . a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (right) Prosecutors said it was a miracle . that Davis, who also was the star witness at Rafferty's trial, survived . the encounter with Beasley in Noble County, 60 miles east of Columbus. 'Only by the grace of God did he escape with his life,' Baumoel told the jury. It was Davis' escape on Nov. 6, 2011, . that led authorities to find Pauley's body in the same area where Davis . was shot. Geiger's body also was found in Noble County. Beasley, who returned to Ohio from . Texas in 2004 after serving several years in prison on a burglary . conviction, testified that he met with Davis and that Davis was the one . who pulled a gun. Convicted: . Brogan Rafferty has already been sentenced to life in prison without parole for his role in the murders. He is expected to testify against Beasley in his trial . Wheeled in: Beasley is confined to a wheelchair due to a back injury . 'It misfired three times about 2 feet from my face, and I ran into the woods, and he ran after me,' Beasley said. He testified that the two wrestled on the muddy ground and Davis ended up firing six shots. 'I said, `That's your six,' so if he was going to kill me, he was going to have to do it with his hands,' Beasley testified. Beasley's lawyers had said that . investigators targeted him based only on a hunch and that the identity . theft and robbery motives prosecutors offered were baseless. Lured: The attacks took place after men responded to the same advert offering work on a 688-acre cattle farm . Attorneys: Prosecutor Emily Pelphrey, left, and defense lawyer James Burdon deliver their opening statements in the Akron courtroom . Beasley's testimony came after the . prosecution rested its case without calling Rafferty, who had been . subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution. There was no explanation why . he didn't testify, and attorneys were under a gag order. Rafferty, from Stow, was tried as an . adult but didn't face a possible death penalty because he was a juvenile . when the crimes occurred. Rafferty, now 18, had said the crimes . were horrible but he didn't see any chance to stop the killings. He said . he feared Beasley would kill him and his relatives if he tipped off . police.

Ashley Cicatello (pictured at North Staffordshire Justice Centre today) ripped a Sikh supermarket worker's turban off his head . A man ripped a Sikh supermarket worker's turban off his head and told friends to film the incident and put it on YouTube during a drunken joke, a court has heard. Ashley Cicatello, 25, had spent the afternoon drinking beer and Jagerbomb shots when he spotted the victim in a Sainsbury's supermarket on December 27, last year. Cicatello, from Dunkirk, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, told his friends: 'Get this on record. This is going on YouTube' before running up behind the victim and yanking the turban off his head. The prank caused the victim to be ostracised from his own community, it was claimed. Cicatello sprinted off with the turban and was chased through the store before being wrestled to the ground by security guards. He later admitted to police that he had 'been an absolute prat' and had done it because he wanted to be the 'class clown.' Magistrates were told the Sikh father-of-two has since transferred stores after being being too ashamed to return to work. North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard the victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons after a judge ruled that the shame of the incident had led to him being ostracised from his community - had faced the most 'gratuitous degradation.' Cicatello was convicted of religiously aggravated assault following a trial on Monday. He had admitted assault but denied it was religiously motivated. Carol Brown, chairman of the bench, said: 'Mr Cicatello caused gratuitous degradation of the victim which has resulted in an ongoing effect on the injured party. 'This was a person working in the public sector in a public place. North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard the victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons after a judge ruled that the shame of the incident had led to him being ostracised from his community - had faced the most 'gratuitous degradation' 'It's our belief that the defendant demonstrated hostility to the person who wore the turban, and therefore we find him guilty.' Sikh men are not permitted to cut their hair and must keep their heads covered. Normally turbans are only removed in the most intimate of circumstances, when bathing the head, or washing the hair. The victim told the court the incident had devastating consequences for him. Cicatello (believed to be pictured here on a night out) then sprinted off with it and was chased through the store before being wrestled to the ground by security guards . Giving evidence he said: 'Taking a turban off a Sikh guy in public is just like hanging him in public. 'After this I was not able to face my colleagues. 'If this happened in India a man would never go to this place again, it is that disgraceful. 'My self-esteem and confidence - everything has been shattered because of this incident.' The court heard Cicatello had gone to the store at 5pm to buy beer with three friends. He had drunk 'four or five pints' and four Jagerbombs - a mixture of spirit Jagermeister and Red Bull. He told the court: 'I got dared to take the turban off his head. It was nothing to do with his religion or the colour of his skin. 'It was just being stupid. I just did it because I wanted to be the class clown.' He told magistrates he ran off with the turban because he 'panicked' when he saw the anger on the victim's face. Nicola Bell, defending, said he was in full-time work and had not been before the courts for five years. She said: 'He is mortified by his actions. He has given a formal apology to the injured party.' Magistrates heard Cicatello's pals had filmed the attack on a mobile phone but the footage was deleted and never uploaded to the internet. Sentence was adjourned to allow for reports to be prepared. He was bailed to appear before the same court on March 18.

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 05:41 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:44 EST, 11 June 2012 . Two U.S. students survived a week lost in . a blizzard-hit New Zealand mountain range by taking regular dips in hot . thermal springs they had stumbled across, rescuers said today. Alec Brown and Erica Klintworth, both 21, . had planned a two-day trek on the South Island's rugged West Coast but . ended up spending more than a week in the wilderness after a snowstorm . hit. They survived by rationing their meagre supplies of peanut butter and rice and eventually walked to safety after nine days. The two students, on a foreign study program in New Zealand with University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, had planned to hike and camp for a few days at some hot springs. Survival: Alec Brown and his girlfriend Erica Klintworth survived for nine days on a mountain in New Zealand with only meagre supplies . But heavy rain and a snowstorm during the Southern Hemisphere winter prevented the couple from being able to cross a river and return. 'Unfortunately it rained and rained, day after day, and snowed,' Alec Brown said. He said the nights were tough to take because the rain and sleet pounded down on the tarpaulin covering their sleeping hammock and the river roared - reminding them all the time of their predicament. When they realised they were going to be stuck they started rationing: 'a biscuit and jelly one day,' Brown wrote 'and even less another.' Brown's mother Lisa, of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, said she panicked when she first found out her son was missing. 'It's too much for a mom,' she said. 'Especially when they're that far away. I just felt so helpless.' Inhospitable: The couple were trapped on a mountain in the Arthur's Pass National Park on New Zealand's South Island for nine days before they walked to safety while a helicopter was searching for them . She had faith that Alec, an environmental science major, knew the outdoors well enough to survive, she said, adding that Erica, who is studying graphic design, is a strong woman. The couple's ordeal began on June 1 when friend Katie Jenkins dropped them off at a national park on the South Island's West Coast so they could hike in and camp for a few days. 'They were just going to the hot springs, to chill out and study for finals,' she said. It was eight days before she realised they were missing and raised the alarm. The couple didn't take much food - some carrots, rice, peanut butter and trail mix, said Police Sergeant Sean Judd, who coordinated rescue attempts. He said that after three days, a steady rain started. Hot springs: Alec and Erica dipped into hot pools to keep warm and slow down energy loss as they survived on the mountain for more than a week . 'Then on Wednesday the snowstorm hit and it got progressively worse,' Judd said. Alec Brown said that soaking in the hot pools 'helped keep us warm and slow energy loss.' It wasn't until Sunday that the river finally seemed safe enough to cross again. He prepared for their hike out by cooking up a 'good meal' of rice, marshmallows, peanut butter and chocolate, he said. 'We then left and crossed the icy waters only up to our waist,' he said. 'We were climbing the mountains under the dense tree cover when we first heard the helicopter we assumed was looking for us. The helicopter never saw us and we walked out just fine and met up with the search and rescue by the road.' It was when they attended a debriefing, he added, that 'we found out what a big deal all this was.' The student said he relied on his past experience hiking and camping and felt confident in the couple's ability to survive. 'I believe when you go into the bush you take your life into your own hands and need to be prepared to handle whatever conditions occur,' he said. 'We could have been more prepared, but in the end we were prepared enough to walk ourselves out.'

A Pakistani-born man . wanted to avenge the deaths of U.S. drone attacks in Afghanistan by . blowing up a New York City landmark but lacked the money and materials . to carry out the plan, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday. Assistant . U.S. Attorney Karen Gilbert said at a bail hearing that Raees Alam . Qazi, 20, researched bomb-making techniques on Internet sites affiliated . with al-Qaida, including one using Christmas tree lights, and the FBI . recorded phone calls and conversations linking Qazi to a purported 'lone . wolf' plot. 'He fully intended to do this, . and thankfully he didn't have enough money,' Gilbert said. Referring to . casualties in U.S. drone attacks, she added: 'He wants to avenge those . deaths and kill people.' Accused: Brothers Sheheryar Alam Qazi, 30, and Raees Alam Qazi, 20, are charged with plotting to obtain a weapon of mass destruction in order to blow up a New York City landmark as revenge for U.S. drone attacks . Home base: Terrorist suspect Sheheryar Qazi was listed as a resident of the Sailboat Pointe condominium complex in Oakland Park, Florida . Qazi traveled to New . York last month in hopes of getting a job to fund his terrorist plans, . Gilbert said, but wound up sleeping in public transportation, a mosque . and in restaurants, and riding a bicycle around the city looking for . potential targets. He then decided to return home on a Greyhound bus and . was arrested after arriving back in South Florida, she said. Qazi, . a naturalized U.S. citizen who attended local Florida public schools, . confirmed many elements of the plot in a statement to FBI agents after . his arrest in late November, Gilbert said. Investigators also found . bomb-making and related components at the Qazi family home in Oakland . Park, as well as explosives research evidence on a computer used by . Qazi. Qazi is charged along with his brother, . 30-year-old taxi driver Sheheryar Alam Qazi, with conspiring to provide . material support to terrorists and with attempting to use a weapon of . mass destruction in the U.S. Both have pleaded not guilty to the . charges, which carry a potential life sentence if the men are convicted . of both counts. Threat disrupted: Wifredo Ferrer, U.S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said any potential threat has been disrupted . U.S. Magistrate Judge William . Matthewman ordered Raees Qazi held without bail until trial, finding . that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. His older . brother has already agreed to pretrial detention, but may seek bail . later. A trial is likely many months away. Gilbert . said Raees Qazi was the intended operative, using either a suicide . attack or a remote-control device to kill people in a crowded place such . as New York's Times Square, a Broadway theater or perhaps on Wall . Street. The elder Qazi supported his brother financially and . logistically with the knowledge that Raees was planning a terror attack, . the prosecutor said. In one conversation . recorded by the FBI, Sheheryar Qazi compared his brother to a 'lone . wolf, like the Times Square bomber.' Gilbert said Sheheryar Qazi was . referring to Faisal Shahzad, who unsuccessfully attempted to detonate a . bomb at the New York landmark in May 2010. In another recorded . conversation, Sheheryar Qazi says that his brother 'wasn't going to be . in this world long.' Raees Qazi's attorney, . Daniel Ecarius, tried to persuade the judge to allow his release on . bail, noting that Qazi had made money by selling bicycles on the . Internet, had no criminal past and had already relinquished his . passport. Ecarius suggested Qazi could be released on house arrest with . electronic monitoring, but Gilbert urged the judge to keep him locked . up. 'He wanted to carry out an attack. If he is released from custody, he will,' she said. Another busted terrorist: Al-Qaida operative Jose Padilla, center, is escorted to a waiting police vehicle by federal marshals near downtown Miami in January 2006 . The Qazi brothers had initial court . appearances Friday, but court-appointed attorneys for the two did not . immediately respond to emails seeking comment. One official who spoke to ABC News . described the younger brother's intent as ‘serious,’ but the source said . it did not appear that an attack was imminent. ‘This . was not a sting,’ sources told the news channel, adding that Raees Alam . Qazi had been in contact with overseas radicals, possibly connected to . al Qaeda. Still, the FBI found evidence that Raees Alam Qazi had been monitoring recent FBI ‘sting’ cases, sources told ABC.

If your dinner parties always go a little awry, don’t blame the cooking – it might be the plates. Crockery, cutlery and music contribute at least as much to the enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, studies show. Volunteers who ate a strawberry dessert from a white plate thought it tasted 10 per cent sweeter than those who ate the same pudding from a black one. According to the study popcorn tastes less salty if served in a red container than a blue one . Oxford University psychologist Professor Charles Spence, who carried out the experiments, also found that food tasted better when it was eaten with heavy cutlery and crockery. He said: ‘For years, we have been spending a lot of time thinking about the taste and colour and sound of the food itself. ‘That is all very important but there is a whole area emerging that it seems that no one has ever thought about – the everything else that goes with food. ‘We never eat food by itself, it is always with cutlery, on a plate that’s on a table. ‘And when you change these things it seems to matter.’ A series of experiments carried out by Professor Spence show that something as simple as the colour of a plate or the weight of a spoon can make a difference. Strawberry desserts taste 10 per cent sweeter on a white plate than a black one according to the research . In the experiments, popcorn tastes saltier when eaten from a blue bowl than from a red one. Professor Spence, who has worked with a variety of top chefs including Heston Blumenthal, said that colour contrast may play a part in the phenomenon. Force of habit may also be important. Salty crisps are often packaged in blue bags, perhaps explaining why the popcorn tasted saltier when eaten from a blue bowl. Weight is also important, with heavier cutlery and crockery making food taste more appealing. Professor Spence said: ‘If you make the spoon heavier, the food tastes better and if you make the bowl heavier, the food tastes better.' This may be because we tend to associate weight with worth. Those planning a dinner party, the professor advises spending at least as much time thinking about the table setting as they do on the food. He says that when everything from the colour of the plates to the weight of the cutlery is factored in, at least half of the enjoyment of a meal may lay in how it is served rather than in how it tastes. Other ideas include matching the background music to the wine. Research from the US and UK concluded that Cabernet Sauvignon is all the more delicious when accompanied by The Doors’ classic People are Strange. The high pitch and fast beat of Atomic by Blondie is said to enhance the taste of Chablis and Chardonnay, while Enya’s Orinoco Flow might help Syrah slide down more smoothly. And Professor Spence has shown that Pavarotti’s rendition of Nessun Dorma brings out the tanginess of dark chocolate and coffee-flavoured desserts.","New study shows food tastes different depending on what plate its on .

But with many children now firmly attached to their electronic gadgets, parents are opting to punish them by confiscating their iPads, smartphones and portable games consoles instead. The only problem is that more than half said their offspring have thrown a tantrum – which some refer to as ‘an iPaddy’ – after their devices are taken away from them. The iPaddy: Researchers say eight out of 10 parents of children aged 14 or under now restrict their childrens use of gadgets as their preferred method of punishment. A quarter of British households now own tablet computers and children are becoming increasingly attached to the devices. In a survey of 2,000 parents, eight out of ten who had children aged 14 or under said they now restrict their use of gadgets as their preferred method of punishment. The research found that on average, children spend nearly two hours a day on their favourite gadgets, while more than a quarter spend more than four hours a day staring at a screen. Confiscating their digital device was reckoned the most effective form of punishment by parents as it stopped their children being able to communicate with their friends. Ghadi Hobeika, of online retailer Pixmania, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘Gadgets such as tablets and smartphones provide both a method of communication and a form of entertainment, so when parents remove them, this becomes a double whammy.’ The research also found that more than one in ten children under the age of four regularly used a tablet computer. The research found on average, children spend nearly two hours a day on their favourite gadgets . Although half of parents admitted to buying their children digital devices, more than 70 per cent were concerned their offspring had grown too attached to them. More than half of parents said they had banned their children from playing with them, or removed them for a period of time. The most popular gadget bought for children was a games console such as an Xbox or PlayStation, owned by 46 per cent of youngsters, followed by MP3 music players and smartphones, which 30 per cent possess. However not only are many children spending increasing amounts of time on their gadgets, they are also running up huge bills for their unsuspecting parents. Last month, it emerged a five-year-old had run up a bill of £1,700 in charges on a so-called ‘free’ iPad game. Luckily his parents managed to persuade Apple that it was a mistake and got their money back. However customers who accidentally rack up large bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund.","Quarter of British households now own tablet computers .

'Although generally temperatures are expected to rise, they are going to be likely to be below average for the month.' Despite the cold weather over the past week there has been no frost because the clouds covering the UK have acted as a blanket, the Met Office has said. While much of the UK has 'felt much colder than any other time this winter', there has not been the right 'ingredients' for a long hard frost. It said: 'For a classic frosty night we need a few ingredients: low temperatures, clear skies, calm winds and moisture. 'A clear, calm night gives excellent radiation conditions – by this we mean that the heat absorbed by the Earth’s surface during the day escapes readily back into space and allows temperatures to fall. 'If the temperature falls to the dew point (the temperature to which air must cool for it to become saturated with water vapour) moisture will condense and form droplets on the ground’s surface. When temperatures fall below freezing the droplets freeze and we get frost.' It said thick cloud cover was stopping temperatures from falling too much below freezing. It said: 'The wind is also important as it mixes the lower part of our atmosphere. Rather than having cold air pooling in one place and causing low temperatures, the wind can bring less cold air from another location or even bring it down from the upper atmosphere. 'This also helps to keep temperatures from falling too low. However, easterly winds this week have certainly made it feel very cold indeed!'

Accused: Ryan Romo, 18, from the upscale Dallas suburb of Highland Park, has been charged with sexually assaulting an underage classmate . The pair took a cab to Romo's Chevy Tahoe and he then drove the SUV to a street, where they parked and began making out, according to an affidavit. The victim said they were kissing in the back seat but he refused to stop when she protested his sexual advances. The girl said she told Romo, ‘No, I don’t wanna do this,’ and screamed ‘stop,’ but Romo did not listen, according to the document. When she arrived home, her mother noticed she was upset and the girl revealed the alleged ordeal. A sexual assault test performed on the girl at the Medical Center of Plano and a second exam performed by the girl's regular gynecologist confirmed signs of vaginal trauma. The alleged victim, a underclassman who attends the Highland Park High School (pictured) with Romo, told police she bumped into Romo at a concert on Saturday night and then left the venue with him . Highland Park Police recorded two phone calls between Romo and the girl in which he admitted to having sex with her without a condom and also offered to buy her an emergency oral contraception.

She died on Sunday at the age of 97 . The British-born Swedish princess whose secret 33-year romance with her royal husband became Sweden's best-known love story, died on Sunday at the age of 97. Princess Lilian was the commoner wife of Prince Bertil, who died in 1997. Their story, which began in London during World War Two, and saw the lovestruck couple keep their relationship secret for decades for the sake of the crown and to avoid a constitutional crisis, gripped the hearts of the Swedes. The royal court said in a statement that the princess, born Lillian Davies in Swansea in August 1915, died peacefully in her sleep in the afternoon at her home in Stockholm. The princess, the daughter of William Davies and his wife, Gladys Mary Curran,originally spelt her name with two 'l's, but changed to Lilian when she embarked on a career as a fashion model, ballerina and singer. Her first marriage was in September 1940, to a Scottish actor called Ivan Craig. But he went to Africa during the war and the couple divorced after a long separation. During the Second World War Lilian worked at a factory making radios for the Royal Navy, and also at a hospital for wounded soldiers. There are several versions of how she met . Prince Bertil of Sweden in 1943. Some . claim she met him at a party held to celebrate her 28th birthday, some say . they met at a club, and others have written they met on the London . Underground. Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, with his fiance Lilian Craig on October 15, 1976. The lovestruck couple kept their relationship secret for decades for the sake of the crown and to avoid a constitutional crisis . Enduring love: Lilian Davies with Prince Bertil in a portrait from 1953 - ten years after they met in 1943 . She later wrote of him: 'He . was so handsome, my prince. Especially in uniform. So charming and . thoughtful. And so funny. 'Oh, how we laughed together.' She and Prince Bertil had to keep . their love secret as Bertil's elder brother and heir to the throne, . Prince Gustaf Adolf, had died in a plane crash in 1947 while the next . brother, Sigvard, waived his right to the throne by marrying a commoner. That left Bertil next in line until his infant nephew, Crown Prince Carl Gustaf came of age. If . Prince Bertil had married a commoner he would have had to renounce his . right to the throne, probably sparking a constitutional crisis. It . was not until after the crown prince became king in 1973, and married a . few years later, that Prince Bertil and Lilian could finally get . married themselves and appear in public. Prince . Bertil married Lilian on December 7 1976 at the Palace Church of . Drottiningholm in the presence of the King and the Queen. They were both . in their 60s when they were finally given the blessing to marry. The couple holidayed in Kenya to celebrate. Princess Lilian (left) with Swedish King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia.

Workers at a French tyre-making factory clashed with riot police today as last-ditch protests aimed at saving their jobs turned violent. Staff from the Goodyear factory in northern France gathered outside the company's offices near Paris as they continued to rally against attempts to restructure or close the Amiens plant which employs 1,200 people. But as union representatives met with company management inside, protestors fought with police on the streets outside, setting fire to piles of tyres. The trouble flared as it was announced that unemployment figures in France had reached their highest for more than 13 years in the last quarter of 2012. It also comes after American tycoon Maurice Taylor - chairman of U.S. tyre giant Titan International -  refused to rescue the Goodyear tyre factory because its workers are 'lazy, overpaid and talk too much'. Scroll down for video . Clashes: Riot police are pictured near Paris today as a last ditch protest by workers to save a Goodyear plant that employs 1,200 staff descended into violence . Anger: Tyres can be seen burning in the foreground as Goodyear staff clash with police in Paris today . Riot: Police form a line to drive protestors back as a fire rages close by. The workers were told in January that their factory in Amiens is to close imminently . Maurice ""Morry"" Taylor delivered the crushing summary of how some outsiders view France's work ethic in a letter . In the letter released on Feburary 19, Mr Taylor said his company would not be buying a Goodyear tyre plant in Amiens that . is threatened with closure and the loss of 1,170 jobs, telling French industry ministry Arnaud Montebourg: 'I have visited the factory several times. 'The French workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours. 'They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three hours and work for three. I told the French union workers this to their faces. They told me that's the French way!' The letter sent by Mr Taylor sparked a . row with the government, with Mr Montebourg branding the description . ‘ridiculous’, saying that he would instruct government agencies – . including the tax office – to examine Mr Taylor’s business with . ‘redoubled zeal’. Goodyear said on January 31 that it . would be closing its main French plant and cutting its workforce in . France by 39 percent amid labor disputes and plunging car demand in . Europe. The issue is now creating unrest in Paris as one demonstrator tore away a policeman's shield while another hit the officer on the head. Only a spray of tear gas pushed the mob back. The tyre firm announced that it was to close the plant at the end of January. Today's . meetings between unions and management are said to be to discover the . findings of an independent report into the social and economic impact . that the closure of the plant will have. The . French Government is proposing to reform the labor regulation that has . held up the factory's closure after five years of attempts by the . company to restructure the plant. Line of defence: Police sprayed tear gas at demonstrators in a bid to drive them back . Burning rubber: Officers look on as a demonstrator wearing a Goodyear protest slogan T shirt throws another tyre onto a raging fire . Running battles: Protestors attempt to storm a barricade as police fend them off outside the Goodyear offices in west Paris . The workers were infuriated last month when tyre executive Taylor, CEO of Titan International, said the plant was 'not worth saving'. The fortunes of the Goodyear plant are . in stark contrast to that of a Dunlop plant just across the road which . is going from strength to strength. The . two plants, whose shared parent is Goodyear Dunlop, chose different . destinies four years ago when Dunlop's unions accepted tougher labour . conditions and Goodyear's rejected them. Now Goodyear faces closure, while Dunlop has received more than 50 million euros in investment. Union . leaders at the two plants on the outskirts of Amiens, where riots . erupted last August, were friends before a management request to merge . the plants and switch to four daily work shifts from three previously . tore them apart in 2009. Scuffle: One worker is seen kicking out at a riot policeman who tries to use his shield to protect himself . Violence: One protestor was seen taking a policeman's shield while another threw a punch at him . Defending the country's work ethic a fortnight ago, Mr Montebourg said that America was in fact the top foreign investor in France, with 4,200 US companies employing nearly half a million people within the country. Haviland & Co. has been present in France since 1842, IBM since 1914, Coca-Cola since 1933 and General Electric since 1974, while last year companies including Massey Ferguson, Mars chocolate and 3M chose to invest further in France. Mr Montebourg added: ‘But most importantly, in contrast to your ridiculous and derogatory comments, all these companies know and appreciate the quality and productivity of the French workforce and the commitment, know-how, talent and skills of French workers.’ Apparently warning Mr Taylor against further attacks, Mr Montebourg wrote: ‘In the meantime, rest assured that you can count on me to have the competent government agencies survey your imported tyres with a redoubled zeal.’ But the government is now facing a growing problem to find a rescuer for the troubled plant. Heated: A plume of black smoke billows high into the air as riot police stand close to the flames generated by the burning tyres . The trouble erupted as it was announced today that French unemployment figures had reached their highest for more than 13 years. The sixth consecutive quarterly increase means that 10.6 per cent of French residents were unemployed in the last quarter of 2012, according to the national statistics institute Insee. It also means that unemployment in the country is at its highest since the second quarter of 1999 and is the latest bad news for a government that has admitted it will fall far short of growth and public deficit targets this year. The French economy also contracted by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of the year. Other data published on Thursday showed a widening trade deficit. The figures prompted renewed calls from the French Government for action at a European level to help improve the Euro Zone's second largest economy. The European commission has predicted that unemployment in the country will reach 10.7 per cent this year, nearly double the unemployment rate in Germany and only slightly behind Italy's 11.6 per cent. But France's unemployment rate is still far better than in Greece and Spain. President Francois Hollande took power last May promising to halt a relentless rise in unemployment which has left one in four youths out of work and vowing to restore France’s industrial competitiveness. The president’s approval ratings have slumped to around 30 percent since then as his government battles against a tide of factory closures. After backtracking last month on growth and deficit targets, he conceded the unemployment goal would now be harder to reach.","Workers from the Amiens Goodyear plant gathered at the company offices .

For any family having to endure the horror of a hit-and-run would be enormously stressful, but to be forced to go through the exact same thing twice in the same week almost beggars belief. For the Givens family from Philadelphia, such a nightmare became a reality this weekend. Sarah, 10, was hit by a white SUV as she walked home with a friend on Thursday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Two sisters, two hit-and-runs: Kyle, 14 (left) and Sarah, 10 (right) were hit by cars in Philadelphia within days of one another. Police are confident they'll catch the drivers thanks to CCTV capturing both incidents . 'I had just started walking across the street when I noticed a white truck zooming down, I got hit and flew up in the air, and I fell under a parked car, that's when I kind of blacked out' she said. The police have recovered CCTV footage of the incident and saw a White GMC Yukon Denali speeding away. She was giving details to police about how the hit-and-run driver had careered into her, when the phone rang. Her sister, Kylie, 14, was crossing the street when she was also struck by another hit-and-run driver who was behind the wheel of a white 4-door sedan with tinted windows. Sarah Givens, 10: She was struck by a car on Thursday. Luckily she suffered bruising and a broken leg which means no more ice-skating for a couple of months . Kylie Givens, 14: Not quite as lucky as her younger sister, Kylie was struck on Saturday night and is now in intensive care. She is expected to make a full recovery . Their father, Jim, is having difficulty making sense of it all. He told the Daily News: 'Two daughters in two days. I just couldn't believe it. It's crazy! Why can't these people be grown-ups and turn themselves in? They're just cowards. Cold and heartless.' Dad, Jim Givens: No sooner was one daughter giving details of her hit-and-run to the police, a phone call informed him that his other daughter had also been knocked down . Incredibly, both sisters survived their ordeals but they will both have to endure painful recoveries. Sarah's leg was broken in two places and has bruised hips. As a budding figure skater the injuries will mean she'll be off the ice for a couple of months. She says that she is worried about her sister Kylie whose injuries are far more serious and is in hospital in a critical condition. She has internal bleeding, doctors have had to remove her spleen and she also has numerous arm and leg injuries. All on tape: Police are confident they'll catch the drivers involved in both hit-and-run because surveillance cameras captured the whole thing . Although police have not released details of the incident, her family have said that the driver stopped after the accident. He checked to see if Kylie was still alive before getting back into his car and driving away. As a result of the past few days, the girls' father Jim is exhausted and looking for answers. 'I just don't know why they didn't stop. Accidents happen, but when you leave, it's not an accident anymore.

A pregnant young mother and her unborn child were killed after a 'duel' between two drivers ended in a devastating car crash. Sales assistant Kimberley See, 21, was five months pregnant with her second child when the crash occurred as she was being driven home from a funfair by Ryan Williams, the boyfriend of one of her friends. The fateful 'duel' unfolded as Williams, 23, tried to block another driver, 21-year-old Christopher Cottingham, from overtaking him on a long stretch of country road, Lincoln Crown Court heard. 'Competitive driving': When Ryan Williams, left, blocked Christopher Cottingham, right, from overtaking his car, Cottingham tried to undertake him instead of keeping his distance, a court heard . Williams repeatedly touched his brakes and then moved his Citroen Saxo onto the wrong side of the road to block Cottingham from passing him, the court heard. Then, when Cottingham tried to undertake him, Williams returned to his own side of the carriageway. The two cars collided and Williams’ vehicle left the road and crashed into a tree. Ms See, who was sitting in the back of the car, suffered fatal injuries. Prosecutor Mark Van der Zwart said: 'Cottingham saw the way that Williams was driving. What he should have done was slow down or stop and create a gap so there wasn’t any danger. 'Instead of keeping his distance and not engaging in what appears to have been something of a duel he got too close. 'The two cars collided. It was enough to cause both drivers to lose control and both left the road. Kimberley See was trapped and died inside the car. 'There was no reason for this to have occurred but for the driving by the people involved,' the barrister said. Sentencing: Lincoln Crown Court was told Ms See's son Lucas, three, is now being raised by his grandparents . The court was told that Kimberley See’s three-year-old son, Lucas, is now being brought up by his grandparents.Mr Van der Zwart added: 'When Kimberley died she was 20 weeks pregnant.' Williams, 23, of Sussex Avenue, Boston, was convicted by a jury of causing death by careless driving as a result of the crash on the B1192 in Lincolnshire, on 14 October 2011. Cottingham ,21, of New York Road, Coningsby, Lincolnshire, admitted the same charge. Both drivers were seriously injured in the crash. Williams was jailed for a year and Cottingham jailed for 46 weeks. Both have been banned from driving for three years. No sentence can adequately reflect the loss of Kimberley’s life. The lives of her family have been turned upside down. 'The consequences were devastating. You were equally the cause of her death. 'This can properly be described as competitive driving. It was a bad case of careless driving.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Kimberley See was five months pregnant with second child at time of crash .

A temp is suing the agency which sent him to work at a factory where he sliced off his genitalia in a foam-cutting machine. Edgardo Toucet claims the accident has prevented him from working since and been forced to undergo treatments such as hormone therapy. He blames his supervisor at Spartan Staffing for the mishap, saying she should have taken into account the fact that Toucet cannot speak English while training him. Toucet's accident came in January 2010, after Spartan placed him in a job at Future Foam, a foam-cutting factory near Orlando, Florida. He was helping to operate the 'peeler machine', a machine with a sharp spinning blade intended to cut up carpet foam. Accident: Edgardo Toucet sliced off his penis and testicles while working as a temp at the Future Foam factory in Orlando, Florida . According to legal documents filed last week in Hillsborough County Court, this machine presents particular risks to users as it is situated at waist height, does not have a brake and takes up to one minute to stop in an emergency. Toucet claims that his only training in how to operate the machine 'consisted of directions in broken English and handsignals', as he was born and brought up in Puerto Rico and is not fluent in English. The complaint says that the worker 'came into contact with the machine's spinning blade and Toucet's penis and testicles were completely severed'. His lawyer Mike Valen told the New Times Broward-Palm Beach: 'It's a tragic story in which the man lost his entire package and his testicles. He's had multiple injuries, and now he's required to have hormone therapy.' He added that Toucet was now receiving disability benefit as he was unable to get a job, and said: 'It's awfully embarrassing for him.' The document claims that Spartan Staffing was aware of other workers receiving similar but less serious injuries while working at Future Foam. Toucet is also suing Barbara Pidgen, an employee of Spartan who was responsible for overseeing safety training. He is seeking more than $15,000 in damages for 'bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, expense of hospitalization, medical and nursing care and treatment, loss of earnings, loss of ability to earn money and aggravation of a previously existing condition'. Toucet has previously launched a legal claim against Future Foam itself, as well as the manufacturer of the peeler machine - it is unknown what the outcome was. Neither firm is involved in the lawsuit on this occasion.","Edgardo Toucet worked as temp at factory in Orlando .

A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for six weeks. Ki Chun-kei insisted that the whistling was nothing more than drunken antics, and claimed he did not know the policemen were so close when he did it. But one of the officers claimed he had become deaf for three seconds thanks to the whistling, leading the judge to impose a prison sentence on the demonstrator. Jailed: Ki Chun-kei has been sentenced to six weeks in prison for whistling at police officers during a protest . Ki, 50, was participating in an annual demonstration on July 1 last year to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong being handed over to China by the UK, the South China Morning Post reported. He was caught on camera approaching police and whistling at them, apparently without immediate provocation. One officer said Ki was less than a foot away from his ear when he whistled sharply, leaving him unable to hear for two or three seconds. The defendant's lawyer Pauline Leung Po-lam said that he had not meant to harm the policemen, and argued that 'a short ringing in their ears' did not amount to assault. But magistrate Ho Wai-yang disagreed, pointing out that the officers were clearly identifiable thanks to their uniforms, and characterised the incident as an 'illegal use of force'. Caught on camera: The defendant apparently made an officer deaf for around three seconds . Ki was found guilty in January of three charges of assaulting police. 'Every Hongkonger has the right to take part in protests,' Ms Ho said at the time. 'The court respects that. But the court does not allow the illegal use of force.' During sentencing today, the magistrate ruled that Ki should spend six weeks in prison for the three assaults. She said she was taking into account two similar offences committed by the defendant more than a decade ago. Defence: Ki, a builder, insisted he did not mean to harm the officers during the July 1 demonstration . Ms Po-Lam said that a doctors' report showed that Ki was an alcoholic, which could have impaired his decision-making. 'The offence was not made after detailed planning,' she said. 'He had perhaps become impulsive after drinking.' While Hong Kong is a partial democracy which is generally considered much more free than mainland China, many campaigners have complained of a crackdown on civil liberties and human rights in the territory.","Ki Chun-kei, 50, whistled in officers' faces during annual protest march .

The FA have decided not to take any action against Rio Ferdinand for his off-the-ball shove on Fernando Torres during Sunday's FA Cup clash between Manchester United and Chelsea. The incident was on the agenda for the FA as it went unseen by referee Howard Webb. However, the FA determined that they would take no retrospective action against the United defender and he will be available for the quarter-final replay, whenever it is played. Scroll down to watch the video . Sneaky: Rio Ferdinand shoved Fernando Torres while the referee's back was turned . Get up: Ferdinand yanks the Spanish striker to his feet . Click here for the full story of the game . Ferdinand tweeted after the let-off on Tuesday afternoon: 'My timeline is full of bitter people...come on guys we are all alive, enjoy each day + give thanks! We on the home run #EPL let's do this.' Ferdinand went in for a challenge with Torres and . after the pair had got up, barged him with his forearm and kicked his . achilles while the referee was looking the other way. The Chelsea striker fell to the ground in a heap and the United defender then dragged the Spaniard back to his feet. Last Tuesday Ferdinand was seen sarcastically clapping in referee Cuneyt Cakir's face in the aftermath of United's 2-1 defeat by Real Madrid. Head scratcher: Ferdinand out and about today - he will not be punished by the FA despite appearing to push Fernando Torres to the ground off the ball in Sunday's FA Cup tie . Cakir had controversially sent off Nani during the game and the furious Ferdinand made his feelings clear at the final whistle. He avoided censure from UEFA over the incident and the club also were not punished for not fulfilling their post-match media obligations. Sir Alex Ferguson refused to speak after the Madrid game and his players were also prevented from speaking. Ferdinand and the Scot spoke to MUTV after the Chelsea match. The 34-year-old centre back said: 'We gave them the impetus to claw their way back into the game. We played some great football at times but were so careless at times. If you are careless you are going to get punished. That was the case. 'But we are still in the Cup. Wembley is waiting for one of us to go through and hopefully it is us. 'We go to Stamford Bridge for the replay with confidence. We have the tools. We have been there before this season and done well and with the squad we have we don't fear going anywhere.' Ferguson said his team paid for their efforts against Real the previous midweek. 'We're lucky to be in the Cup. We just ran out of legs and Chelsea were far the better team in the second half,' he said. 'But I can't be critical of my side because the running they had to do on Tuesday night, against a really top side in Real Madrid, had its bearing on today's result, no doubt about that. 'The two full backs, Rafael and Patrice (Evra), are knackered and the two central midfielders tired badly. We kept giving the ball away and it made it a long day for us, going from one penalty box and back to our own.' Ramires and Eden Hazard levelled the game for Chelsea following early goals by Javier Hernandez and Wayne Rooney.

Jailed: Lithuanians Audruis Andriukaitis (pictured) and Rygintas Bloze attacked a workmate after wrongly assuming he was Russian . A Lithuanian man was subjected to a savage beating by two workmates and fellow countrymen after they downed so much vodka at a Christmas get-together they wrongly assumed he was Russian. Igor Kuznecov, 27, was knocked to the floor and had his face repeatedly stamped on as though his attackers were 'flattening a tin can', a court heard. He also was thrown around the street by Audruis Andriukaitis, 25, and Rygintas Bloze, 42 - both workmates of his at a Lancashire furniture factory - in an attack so vicious one onlooker feared he was witnessing a murder. Before the attack Mr Kuznecov and his assailants had been drinking vodka together on Christmas Day, but violence flared in the early hours of the following morning when the trio ran out of alcohol and the victim began speaking in Russian, Burnley Crown Court was told. Andriukaitis and former soldier Bloze started calling Mr Kuznecov  - who was born in Lithuania but is a fluent Russian speaker - a 'Russian' and telling him they wanted to put him in a dog kennel as they launched their attack. Mr Kuznecov was left motionless, bleeding and 'completely out of it' after his sustained ordeal, the court heard. He was later found to have suffered serious facial injuries, including a smashed left eye socket and nasal bone. Andriukaitis and Bloze, both of Nelson, were each sentenced to four years in prison after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They now face deportation. Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said the victim had celebrated Christmas Day at Andriukaitis' home. Both had been drinking vodka before they left to go to Bloze's home nearby. In the early hours of Boxing Day as the group tried to find a shop selling alcohol the two attackers became aggressive and called him a 'Russian', before the victim suddenly felt a blow to the back of the head. Eye witness Mohammed Daar, who awoken by a thud outside his bedroom window, looked outside and saw a man pinned over his car wing mirror on the street. He saw Bloze holding the victim in a headlock as he was punched, before dragging him down the street, the court heard. Mr Daar called the police and gave them a running commentary of the events unfolding outside his window. Sentencing: Burnley Crown Court was told an eye-witness to the attack feared Mr Kuznecov would be killed . Mr Parker said Andriukaitis kicked the victim three or four times in the face and Bloze punched him in the stomach. Mr Kuznecov was released, taken in a bear hug from behind and the attackers threw him onto the road. The pair kicked their workmate in the stomach and head repeatedly before dragging him to his feet and pushing him into a parked car, the court heard. Andriukaitis then pinned him down and hit him in the face more than 10 times before Bloze walked over and kicked Mr Kuznecov in the face. The court heard the witness had described the attackers stamping on their victims face as though they were trying to 'flatten a can', and using so much force that Mr Daar had feared Mr Kuznecov was dead. Mr Parker said: 'Mr Daar says he honestly thought he was witnessing somebody being murdered, such was the nature of the attack. 'Mr Kuznecov later told police the defendants had wanted to put him in a kennel. The victim said to them they did it because they were Lithuanians and he was Russian.' Mr Kuznecov still suffers flashbacks and headaches and his sleep has been affected as a result of his ordeal, the court heard. Philip Holden, representing father-of-one Andriukaitis said: 'He is, to all intents and purposes, a hard- working member of society but he had drunk more than was good for him.' Defending Bloze, Mark Stuart said : 'It can only be more by luck than by management that the injuries weren't more serious than they were.'Mr Recorder John Barrett, sentencing, said the attack was in many ways inexplicable, but added it was plain alcohol had played a part. 'This was a persistent and sustained attack in the street,' the judge said. 'It took place over a period of 15 minutes or so. It caused distress to members of the public, in particular Mr Daar. The injuries are astoundingly modest.'","Igor Kuznecov had his face repeatedly stamped on by two work colleagues .

Oscar Pistorius' representatives have said the substance found in his bedroom after his girlfriend was shot dead was Testis compositum - a herbal remedy used to aid muscle recovery. South African police said during the athlete's bail hearing that they found needles in his bedroom along with the substance which they initially named as testosterone. Prosecutors later withdrew their statement saying the substance had been sent for laboratory tests and that they would not be able to name it until tests had been completed. Lawyers for Oscar Pistorius have said the substance found in his bedroom was a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery . According to Pistorius' family spokesman, Lunice Johnston, the athlete's lawyers have confirmed that the substance is Testis compositum. The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina. Some online retailers advertise oral and injectable forms as testosterone boosters and say it can aid sexual performance. In court last week, Pistorius' defence lawyer Barry Roux said the substance was not banned by sports authorities, but it had been unclear what it was and what the exact name was. The product called Testis compositum is made by Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, based in Baden-Baden, Germany.

The company website says it is one of the world's leading makers of homeopathic combination medications. A U.S. subsidiary, Heel USA Inc., markets the product in tablet form only and spokeswoman Joan Sullivan said she didn't know if injectable versions are sold in other countries. The product is also marketed as a sexual enhancer which can improve stamina . Heel U.S. website says the product provides temporary relief for men's 'sexual weakness' and lack of stamina. The tablets sold in the U.S. contain 23 ingredients, including pig testicles, pig heart, pig embryo and pig adrenal gland, cortisone, ginseng and other botanicals. It also contains several minerals, according to a list Ms Sullivan provided. Charles Yesalis, a professor and expert on steroid use in sports, said animal steroids wouldn't likely have an athletic performance-enhancing effect unless taken in huge quantities. Even so, he said many elite athletes would be wary of using such supplements because they can be laced with banned substances and few would want to risk it. Pistorius was charged with premeditated murder on February 14 after shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. He says he shot her by accident after mistaking her for an intruder in his home. Prosecutors allege he intended to kill her. Meanwhile Pistorius was last night due to hold a private memorial service for his girlfriend. Confirmation . of the service to be held at the house of Pistorius’s uncle Arnold in . Pretoria, where he has been staying since his release on bail, came . after a leak in the media, reported Sky News. A . family statement said: ‘Since it is such a sensitive issue, Oscar has . asked for a private service with people who share his loss, including . his family members who knew and loved Reeva.’ Pistorius says he killed Miss Steenkamp accidentally, opening fire after mistaking her for an intruder in his home. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally shot her after the couple had an argument. Last week, the chief investigator in the case against Pistorius, Hilton Botha, was removed from the inquiry after it was revealed that attempted murder charges against him had been reinstated in early February. Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus. In another twist, a lawyer for the Pistorius family said on Sunday that Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a charge of unlawful, negligent killing for a 2008 road death. That charge had also been dropped and later reinstated.","South African police initially named substance as testosterone .

A teenager who plotted to massacre his classmates in revenge for being bullied was thwarted by the FBI after agents received a tip off from a concerned internet chat-room user in America. The 16-year-old, from Northamptonshire,  kept a stockpile of explosives, became ‘fascinated’ by mass killings and drew up a hit-list of his fellow students - including detailed blueprints of where they sat. But when he bragged on web chat site Omegle that 'twenty minutes from now he would be armed with a Magnum .44 . revolver, a Beretta 92FS and various other weapons', one worried user across the Atlantic raised the alarm. He was arrested after boasting anonymously to the American that he would keep shooting until his classmates were wiped out or the police arrived before killing himself, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The American user alerted the FBI who immediately contacted UK police. 'I'll be ready in 20 minutes': He was arrested after boasting anonymously to a fellow user of chat room Omegle. The American user alerted the FBI who raised the alarm with UK police . Prosecutor . Mark Topping told the court: 'The boy told the person he was going to stage a massacre at his school using handguns then committing suicide. 'He said he would keep shooting until . the police arrived, at which point he would commit suicide. He also . made a comment about how people shouldn't have bullied him so much.' At . his house, police found explosive chemicals bought online with his . father’s PayPal account, plans of his school, terrorist e-books and . manuals on how to construct a bomb. Following . his arrest last February, the teenager was transferred to a secure . mental unit and has since been diagnosed with Asperger’s  syndrome, . which Birmingham Youth Court heard ‘severely limits his ability to . relate to others’. When police searched his home in . Northamptonshire they also found chemicals used to make explosives which . had been bought from the internet. Raising concern: Birmingham Crown Court heard how the boy boasted on the chat room that in 'twenty minutes from now' he would be armed with a Magnum .44 revolver, a Beretta 92FS and various other weapons (picture posed by model) 'The boy also posted pictures of himself - some holding weapons which he uploaded to the website. In others pieces of paper were being held up with comments relating to a high school massacre.' The boy pleaded guilty to one charge of possessing explosive materials and one charge of possessing terrorist materials. 'There were plans of class rooms, desks at which pupils sat and who was to be targeted. It . is interspersed with references to [the boy] feeling himself to be weak . and powerless, excluded from social activities and being bullied.' Prosecutor Mark Topping . He also admitted a third charge of possessing 'Lollicon' images - Japanese cartoons depicting child sex abuse. Mr Topping added that the boy had been arrested on February 26 before being transferred to a secure mental unit. He said: 'He told both his carers and the police he had the desire to carry out a mass killing. Because . he suffers from severe Asperger's syndrome the assessment was that he . may carry out such an attack if he was given the means to do so. 'His condition causes him to be less inhibited and severely limits his ability to relate to others.' A police search of the boy's home . found twenty publications, including 'The Terrorist Handbook', 'The CIA . Explosives for Sabotage Manual' and bomb-making guide 'An Anarchist's .

The court heard that police also . found diaries and hand-written notes containing detailed plans for the . planned high-school massacre and research on 'Lone Wolf' killers . including Black Panther Donald Nielsen. A 16-year-old boy appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court and admitted possessing explosive chemicals and bomb-making books and diagrams . Mr Topping added: 'He spent some time . looking for this material and wrote out a quotation on a notice board . at school which was quickly erased.

Officers also found sealed containers . of potassium nitrate and sulphur powder - 'precursor chemicals' for . gunpowder - which the boy had bought online using his father's PayPal . account. Giving evidence, the boy's . psychiatrist said he believed the massacre plans had been a 'fantasy', . and that his disorder caused him to obsess over his interests. Consultant Dr John O'Brien said the boy had developed a fascination with school shootings and serial killers. He said: 'He has said in hospital . that although he knew it was a crime and was wrong and would result in . his arrest, it was part of a fantasy to deal with his interest in serial . killers and school shootings and he didn't intend to carry it out.

A dead soldier's family has hit out at the 'serious failings' of an officer in charge of an exercise in which he was found to have been unlawfully killed. Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, was shot dead as he ate his lunch in what was supposed to be a safe area at an Army training range in Castlemartin, Pembrokeshire. He had taken his helmet off to eat a sandwich when he was hit in the temple by a stray machine gun bullet. His brother Jimmy Maguire said the inquest left the family with unanswered questions over the 'planning, setting up and conducting' of the training exercise. Shot: An inquest jury found Ranger Michael Maguire, who died after being shot as he stood in a 'safe' area at an Army training range, was unlawfully killed . The hearing was told that targets had . been set up in 'dangerous' positions half a mile from where soldiers . were eating their lunch. The . inquest heard Ranger Maguire - who was 6ft 7in and known as 'High . Tower' - had taken off his helmet to eat his lunch with colleague Ranger . Matthew Hewitt. Ranger Hewitt said: 'I was smoking a cigarette and he was eating his lunch when the rounds started coming. I could hear the sound of live weapons being fired from close by. 'Michael . commented they sounded too close. He looked round to see where the . noise was coming from and then he fell to the ground. I realised immediately he had been hit, but I couldn’t believe it - it all happened in a split second.' The soldier was airlifted to a hospital in Cardiff where he was pronounced dead. Lieutenant Jonathan Price, the range . conducting officer, passed the training course which allowed him to take . charge of the exercises on the day Ranger Maguire was killed last May. Castlemartin: The 21-year-old was in a 'safe' zone at the range in Pembrokeshire when he was shot . But . just nine months before, the inquest heard, course tutors had . recommended he receive extra supervision due to perceived weaknesses in . his understanding of the course. Lt Price went on to make a series of mistakes in the planning and carrying out of the live fire exercises. The conducting officer told the inquest he was unaware of his shortcomings and finished the course 'quite happy'. 'We . note the verdict that the jury has reached, which reflects the very . serious failings of the range conducting officer in the planning, . setting up and conducting of this training exercise,' said Jimmy Maguire. 'The inquest heard that he was a competent person, qualified to conduct this exercise. 'We . are surprised and puzzled how somebody could have been considered . competent to conduct an exercise of this nature when at the same time he . made so many fundamental errors, and how this could not have been . picked up through the chain of command and at the range. 'We . are left wondering how someone with such limited experience could have . been put in charge of the training exercise and the range with no senior . officer present and without appropriate supervision,' Mr Maguire added. Forensic scientist Andre Horne said the bullet had left the gun at 680mph, missed the target and travelled more than a kilometre over sand dunes before striking Ranger Maguire. Ranger Peter Jones, who fired the fatal bullet, told the hearing he was unaware that Ranger Maguire was in the line of fire. 'If I’d known there were people in line with the target, I would never have fired,' he said. The inquest in Cardiff heard the targets on the range had been set up incorrectly, leading to bullets being fired in 'dangerous' directions. Captain Gary Palmer told the hearing: 'They were firing in a dangerous direction. 'The targets should have been to the West and not to the North. It was in a dangerous position.' Unanswered questions: (l-r) Ranger Maguire's father Michael Maguire senior, sister Sheila Maguire and brother Jimmy Maguire outside Cardiff Central Police Station, where the inquest was held . Ranger Maguire, from Bantry in Cork, Ireland, joined the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment in 2010 and was sent to Afghanistan four months later. The inquest heard the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head. After a day of deliberations the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. Cardiff Coroner Miss Mary Hassell said: 'The jury have asked me to pass on their condolences to Michael’s family.' Mr Maguire said the family hoped lessons would be learned 'Army wide' as a result of his brother's death. 'We know that nothing can bring Mike back - our primary concern throughout this process has been that nothing like this ever happens again,' he said. 'Soldiers should not be killed in training and we hope lessons are learned Army wide. 'Mike was a dearly loved son and brother and he’s much missed by his family and everyone who knew him. 'Mike was a very well-liked member of his battalion who served in difficult conditions in Helmand Province. It makes it all the more ironic that he should lose his life on a training exercise in Wales,' his brother said. Investigations by the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police and the Health and Safety Executive are continuing.","Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, died after being hit by machine gun bullet .

Boone Pickens has been arrested for allegedly removing evidence from the apartment where Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV died. Police say Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, 21, removed heroin, drug paraphernalia, syringes and marijuana from his apartment, where Pickens died from an alleged drug overdose on January 29. Rodriguez, a student at Texas Christian University where Pickens had attended, was arrested last Wednesday in Fort Worth, Texas. He was released immediately after posting $5,000 bail. Charged: Brennan Trainor Rodriguez, pictured, has been charged with taking evidence from an apartment and hiding it from police investigating the death of Thomas 'Ty' Boone Pickens IV . Unspeakable tragedy: Pickens, 21, was a junior at Texas Christian University and died after a suspected 'heroin and Xanax' overdose. He had probably been dead for hours when a friend finally drove him to the hospital . A student found the grandson of the wealthy oil and gas titan at Rodriguez's off-campus apartment on the morning of January 29. The unidentified student who found Pickens said that the victim wouldn't wake up and that he had probably been dead for several hours. Sources told the local news they believed that the 21-year-old had overdosed after witnesses told police that Pickens injected heroin and took the prescription pill Xanax the day before his death. The Tarrant County medical examiner has still not officially ruled on the cause and manner of death. Now police say Rodriguez removed evidence of the suspected drug use from Pickens' apartment and hid it from police. The TCU student was charged on March 8 with tampering with evidence with intent to impair an investigation. It is a third-degree felony and if convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Tycoon: Oil executive Pickens is worth over a billion dollars after starting his career in 1956. He has also been active in national politics . Though TCU did confirm Rodriguez was a student at the private university in Fort Worth, they declined to comment on the recent charges. 'It is difficult to hear about this development, as the TCU community is still mourning Ty's death,' the school said in a statement on Monday. 'Because this is a police investigation, all we can do is verify that he is a TCU student. As in all such cases, he has been suspended from the university pending a hearing through the university's disciplinary process.' Pickens was a junior at Texas Christian University where he was majoring in strategic communications. Scene: Pickens was found unconscious at this off-campus in Fort Worth, Texas . 'Ty’s loss at such a young age is an unspeakable family tragedy for the entire Pickens family and his many friends,' the family said in a statement. 'We mourn his passing and respectfully request that the family be allowed to grieve in private in this time of sorrow.' His grandfather is worth more than $1.2 billion and spent a lifetime in the oil industry. Ty's father, Thomas Boon Pickens III, is the industrialist's youngest son. T. Boone Pickens, 84, got his career started in 1956 when he founded Mesa Petroleum. He later gained a reputation in the 1980s as a corporate raider with planned takeovers of numerous other companies. Campus: Pickens was a student at Texas Christian University. The school confirmed that Rodriquez is also a TCU student . Pickens has also been actively involved in national politics. He . was one of the leading opponents against Democrat Sen. John Kerry's bid . to unseat President George W. Bush from the White House in 2004. And now, after a career in the oil industry, he has championed a plan to . get America to use fewer fossil fuels by promoting alternative energy . such as wind, solar and natural gas.

Internet trolls have launched a hate campaign against Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell, who is accused of child sex offences, comparing him to paedophile Jimmy Savile. The 48-year-old actor faces charges including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity with a child at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Now internet bullies have created pictures of him, mocking him up as the late DJ and prolific child abuser. Michael Le Vell has become the target of online bullies who have created photos of him comparing him to paedophile Jimmy Savile . There is a false advert pretending that he has been axed from the soap opera, and another picture shows him with other celebrities who have been accused of sex offences, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter. Users have shared the vicious photographs and comments with others, as the actor said he would 'vigorously deny' the charges brought against him. Now police are looking into the pictures to see if they break the law, the Daily Star reported. The images could be seen as contempt of court - which would hamper an individual's right to a fair trial. Le Vell, a divorced father of two, plays mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 series, but has recently said he fears he will not be allowed to return even if he is found innocent. Police say they are looking into the images, which could be in contempt of court, which preserves the individual's right to a fair trial . The ITV1 actor 'vigorously denies' the charges that have been brought against him . The alleged sex offences all relate to one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told in February. The actor was first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale in September 2011 after a girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her. But three months later, after a police investigation, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take the allegations to court. But last month it was announced that after a review of the evidence, he had been charged with 19 sex offences. In a statement Le Vell said he would fight the allegations 'vigorously'. He appeared at Manchester Magistrates Court to hear the charges and was bailed on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 14. He is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court this month. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Internet bullies have created vicious pictures of the actor .

Russian scientists believe they may have discovered new life forms sealed off for 14 million years in a subglacial lake deep under the Antarctic ice. Scientists say the icy darkness of Lake . Vostok, under 3,700 metres of ice, may provide a glimpse of the . planet before the Ice Age and clues to life on other planets. 'After excluding all known contaminants, . bacterial DNA was found that does not match any known species in world . databases,' Sergei Bulat of the St Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute . told a Russian news agency. Drilling into history: Russian researchers have reached Lake Vostok, and believe they may have found evidence of previously unseen bacterial life in water samples - although they need further research to confirm . The head of the drilling rig used by the research team to drill to the Vostok underground lake . 'If it (the bacteria) had been found on Mars, then without a doubt we . would have said there is life on Mars - but this is DNA from Earth,' he . said. 'We are calling this life form unidentified or unclassified.' The Russian discovery came from analysing water that froze onto the end . of the drill bit used to bore through to Vostok - the largest of a . network of hundreds of lakes under the ice cap that acts like a blanket . trapping the Earth's geothermal heat. Bulat told RIA that scientists are waiting for more samples from the lake to confirm their discovery. Because of the technology used to keep from polluting the pristine lake, . Russia will only obtain clean water samples - uncontaminated by . drilling fluid - for analysis later this year. To answer concerns kerosene and anti-freeze from the borehole would seep . into the lake, Russian engineers withdrew the drill to allow the water . to percolate up into the borehole and freeze there, only returning this . year to collect it. But Bulat said the unknown microbes were found after separating out . species of bacteria that are known to exist in the drilling fluid. 'When we tried to identify the DNA, it did not coincide with any known species. It's degree of similarity was less than 86 percent,' Bulat told RIA. 'That is practically zero when working with DNA. A level of 90 percent tells us the organism is unknown.' Frozen samples from deeper in the borehole collected during this year's . Antarctic summer season in February are now being carried back by boat . and are due in St Petersburg in May. 'If we again identify the same group of organism in that pure sample of . water, then we can confidently say we have found new life on Earth,' Bulat said. Scientists from the United States and Britain are close on Moscow's . heels to probe what life may exist in one of the most extreme . environments on Earth. Russian scientists have drilled into the prehistoric sub-glacier Lake Vostok, which has been trapped under Antarctic ice for 14 million years and say they may have found a new form of life . An aerial view of the Vostok research camp in Antarctica where Russian have drilled into the prehistoric sub-glacier Lake Vostok . Vostok Station was set up by the Russians in 1956, and their seismic soundings soon suggested there was an area of liquid underneath. However, Russian specialists, supported by . their British counterparts, finally discovered Lake Vostok in 1996. Sonar . and satellite images later proved the lake to be one of the world’s . largest freshwater reservoirs. With . its area reaching 15,000 sq. km and a depth exceeding 1,200 meters, . Lake Vostok is one of the biggest among 370 sub-glacial lakes in . Antarctica. This year, a U.S. expedition said they had seen living cells under a . microscope in field samples taken from the shallower subglacial Lake . Whillans, but more study is needed to determine what kinds of bacteria . they are and how they live. A British effort to reach a third body, Lake Ellsworth, was called off in December because of problems drilling. What life is found in the icy depths may provide the best answer yet to . whether life can exist in the extreme conditions on Mars or Jupiter's . moon Europa. In February Russian researchers became the first in the world to reach the waters of Lake Vostok after more than decades of drilling work. They managed to reach the fresh ice at a depth of 3383 meters and took samples at 3,406 meters. Ice formed as the water from the lake rose into the hole due to upward-pressure in the crack researchers drilled last February. Last year Russian scientists managed to drill through 3700 meters of ice, reach the surface of the lake and take 40 liters of prehistoric water. A general view of the research camp in Antarctica, where researchers have spent years drilling into the ice . Russian specialists, supported by their British counterparts, discovered Lake Vostok back in 1996. Sonar and satellite images later proved the lake to be one of the world’s largest freshwater reservoirs. With its area reaching 15,000 sq km and a depth exceeding 1,200 metres, Lake Vostok is one of the biggest among 370 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica. In 1998 scientists had to halt the drilling just 130 metres from the lake’s surface after alarming concerns the ancient and unblemished waters risked being polluted if special precautions were not taken. The relevant technology was developed only in 2003 in St. Petersburg, and work resumed in 2005 after further tests.","Russian scientists have discovered 'unknown' bacteria that has never been seen before .

But sadly for this baby seal, who hauled itself out of the sea and flip-flopped across the road to a nightclub, it was shut when it got there. The creature had managed to waddle across a busy road in Herne Bay, Kent, to arrive at the doorstep of the Talk of the Town club and amusement arcade at 9am today. Let me in! The baby seal seemed eager to go clubbing - but was ushered back to sea by the RSPCA . You're not coming in: The little pup popped up in Herne Bay, Kent, and managed to waddle across a busy road . The seal popped up this morning after making its way 50ft from the sea. Local Steve Caira tweeted a photo of the seal this morning after spotting it outside the club at 9am. He wrote: 'Saw a seal outside Herne Bay arcades. How did it end up there? 'He looked OK and was moving. Quite a few folk about helping.' Another local, James Craddock said the seal was helped back into the sea within an hour by RSPCA workers. The nightclub in Kent clearly interested the curious creature - or perhaps he wanted to try his luck at the Bingo next door . He said: 'The seal was outside the club for quite a while as nobody seemed quite sure what to do. 'It's not every day you see a seal wander across a road and stand about outside a nightclub, which sadly for him was closed at the time!' The grey seal and common seal are permanent residents in Britain and spend most of their time at sea, only usually coming ashore to breed and moult. They sometimes bask peacefully on beaches, sandbanks or rocks. But, being curious creatures, they sometimes swim up to boats to investigate what's going on. Grey seals have long been a common sight on the shores of Scotland - but now scientists believe that there could be a breeding ground in the south east, as there have been pups spotted on the south coast, the Marine Conservation society said.","The seal waddled across a busy road in Herne Bay, Kent today .

He said he was 'shocked' when she went down when his hand struck her face. Judge Dugan said the footage of the incident in the video was 'troubling,' but that there was more going on at the scene than the clip revealed. He said the scene of the confrontation between the policeman and Ms Guzman was 'chaos' and 'volatile,' according to CBS. Josey said outside the courtroom that he had never intended to hit Guzman.

Lopez is accused of saying that he found a 14-year-old intern 'sexy' A powerful New York lawmaker is accused of saying that he found a 14-year-old intern so 'sexy' that he wished he lived in a state where it was legal to sleep with underage girls. Brooklyn Democrat Vito J. Lopez, 71 told his twisted fantasy to at least one person from his district office, a source told the New York Daily News. The 14-year-old girl he allegedly made the crude comments about is the daughter of Brooklyn Judge Pamela Fisher. Fisher helped Lopez get elected and the politician and her family remain close, reported the New York Daily News. After the comments were reported to police by another staffer the young intern was interviewed - she told investigators she had only been working for Lopez for six days. She also told police that she had never heard him say anything inappropriate - authorities determined 'nothing of a criminal nature' took place, a source said. Today Sonia Ossorio, president of the . National Organization for Women’s New York City chapter has called for . his resignation as a result of the allegations. The claims add to the growing sex scandal engulfing the once-powerful politician, who was first elected in 1984. Mr Lopez, has been in embroiled in . sexual harassment claims in the past and only a few days ago the . newspaper revealed that police were notified after he told one . 24-year-old intern, Chloe Rivera to dress 'sexier.' Powerful: Lopez speaks at the state assembly. He was first elected in 1984 (file photo) The former Brooklyn Democratic Party boss reportedly pointed to Fisher’s . daughter while talking to Rivera and said Rivera needed to 'dress like . that intern' and should 'go shopping for sexier clothes.' When Rivera’s mother heard about the comment, she felt it necessary to alert police last July and Rivera also notified authorities. His comments prompted Rivera and another memeber of the team to quit, reported the Daily News. They also filed a complaint against Lopez with the Assembly ethics commission. After it was upheld by the commission Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver stripped Lopez of his leadership positions. But it also revealed a second sexual harassment complaint from two women who worked for Lopez and received a $103,000 taxpayer settlement after putting forward their allegations. Silver was later forced to admit he made the wrong decision giving the June settlement the go-ahead -  while defending the payment as 'legally correct and ethical,' Silver acknowledged that keeping the deal quiet was not the right move. Lopez was forced to resign from his party boss job, but he was re-elected to the Assembly in November - he is now the subject of a criminal probe. Neither Lopez nor his lawyer returned messages seeking comments from the New York Daily News. A spokesman for the state ethics commission declined to comment.","Brooklyn Democrat Vito J.

Gifts: Tanya Strangeway allegedly received cash gifts from DC Nicholas McFadden who is accused of making thousands of pounds from selling drugs that had been seized in raids . A 'corrupt' detective constable accused . of making thousands of pounds from selling drugs that had . been seized in raids was cheating on his wife with his ex-fiancee, a . court has heard. Detective Con Nicholas McFadden, 38, had an on-off affair with colleague Tanya Strangeway after they called off their engagement in June 2006, his trial was told on Wednesday. DC McFadden's wife, Clair, and Ms Strangeway, both gave gave evidence, one after the other, at Leeds Crown Court - telling the jury how he had began spending large amounts of money on them. The policeman is currently on trial accused of stealing heroin, cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis and then plotting with his older brother Simon, 41, to supply the drugs. They are alleged to have made around £600,000. Ms Strangeway told how she had started seeing him when he was newly married to Clair, but that they had ended it when she became pregnant. She said: 'We had been happy but both of us had had debts. I guess I blamed Nick for those debts but I did have my own credit card debts and had a loan I needed to pay back. 'I brought the relationship to an end because I'd fallen out of love with him but we kept in contact as friends. We used to text and send the odd email. I became aware in December 2006 that he'd met Clair but early in 2007 my relationship with Nick became intimate. 'When me and Nick started seeing each other again we started making plans to get back together.' The court heard how DC McFadden had ended his relationship with his ex-lover when his wife discovered she was pregnant in May 2007. 'After Nick decided to stay with Clair, we didn't have much contact,' said Ms Strangeway. 'Then, in June 2011, I received a text message off Nick saying we were going to be working together on a job. Then we became close again. He told me that he had something he wanted to give me and when we met up, that's when he surprised me.' Trial: DC McFadden is on trial at Leeds Crown Court. He denies stealing and conspiring to sell drugs . Ms Strangeway said DC McFadden had given her a parcel which contained bundles of ten and twenty pound notes. 'There was £10,000 in total, she said.' 'I made an assumption that the money came from the sale of his house. It was a life-changing amount of money from a house we shared together. I didn't feel like I had to ask questions about it. I had no reason to doubt him.' The court heard how McFadden bought an Audi A4 for his ex-lover in July 2011, costing £10,000, gave her £2,000 in cash for a shopping trip and posted parcels of money through her letterbox, amounting to around £1,000. The gifts came to light when Ms Strangeway was asked to declare them after the vetting procedure changed at her work. 'Nick was very concerned about his wife finding out that he'd given me the money and the car,' she said. Giving evidence, Mrs McFadden, an assistant headteacher at a primary school, said: 'Our daughter was born in January 2008 and Nick changed. It really brought us together. We were really happy and I couldn't have asked for more. 'Flattered': DC McFadden's wife Clair told Leeds Crown Court that she was 'flattered' by the expensive gifts her husband gave her . 'Towards the end of 2010, he seemed to have more money and started paying for things but I assumed he was just taking more responsibility after he became a father.' Mrs McFadden said she was 'flattered by the attention and the extravagance'. 'In December 2010 he changed all the windows in the house and bought me a private number plate for my car. He gave me £8,000 in cash and told me not to pay it into a bank.' She said DC McFadden told her the money had come from the overtime he was doing and said he had remortgaged his property. 'I accepted what he said because he was my husband and a police officer. He thanked me and said it was all down to me organising him.' The court heard how DC McFadden organised a lavish trip to London for a weekend, forking out for first class train tickets, fitted a new kitchen and built an orangery at the back of the house. But things changed following a luxury family holiday to Egypt in August 2011, after the policeman had resumed his affair with his ex-lover. She said her husband began having mood swings, 'and just acted like he didn't want to be there,' and was always on his mobile phone. At their home in September 2011, Mrs McFadden said she found him crying and shaking whilst 'curled up in a ball on the bed.' 'He said he wanted to leave but I managed to calm him down and he stayed. Another night I left him decorating and went to bed,' she said. 'He never followed and when I woke up in the middle of the night I had a text message off him saying he had taken some lads, who he'd caught doing things they shouldn't be, in our street to the police station.' On October 13, when Ms Strangeway had been questioned by police following the declaration of the money and the car, the court heard that she received a text message from DC McFadden apologising for what he had done. It read: 'You did the right thing. I have dragged you into something I shouldn't have. I cannot express how deeply sorry I am for what I have done to you. I've ruined a lot of lives. Sorry.' The court heard previously how police first became aware of DC McFadden's suspicious activities in the middle of 2011 when his bank alerted officers to the fact that he had deposited a total of £30,000 in small payments into their cash machines over three months. When police arrested him at work in October 2011 they searched his Ford Focus car and found £6,000 in wads of cash hidden in different compartments, the jury were told. They also found wads of cash stashed in bags, totalling £19,755, and a further £157,560 in the garage of his home in Castleford, West Yorkshire. Between the homes of DC McFadden and his brother, there was over £600,000, the court was told. DC McFadden has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of stealing and conspiracy to supply drugs between 2007 and 2011, with his brother, of Leeds, pleading not guilty to four charges of conspiracy to supply and one of money laundering. DC McFadden and Simon McFadden's wife Karen have pleaded guilty to money laundering. The trial continues.

Instead of switching off the TV, parents may just need to switch the channel their kids are watching if they want to see improved behavior. A study at the Seattle Children's Research Institute has found that parents who switched their kids' television from the violent stuff to more educational programming can improve preschoolers' behavior. More or less: Joe Jensen was part of a Seattle study that wanted to know if changing, not reducing, TV habits could improve kids' behavior . The modest but promising results may lead to ways to avoid aggressive and violent behavior in young children. 'It's not just about turning off the television. It's about changing the channel' said lead author Dr. Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrician and researcher involved in the study. New rule: Joe's sister Elizabeth (right) also participated in the study that taught parents to modulate their kids' television habits . The research was to be published online Monday by the journal Pediatrics. The study involved 565 Seattle parents, who periodically filled out TV-watching diaries and questionnaires measuring their child's behavior. Half were coached for six months on getting their 3-to-5-year-old kids to watch shows like 'Sesame Street' and 'Dora the Explorer' rather than more violent programs like 'Power Rangers.' Toy time: Elizabeth and Joe's mom Nancy (right) says her kids now play with toys more often because what the study taught her . The results were compared with kids whose parents who got advice on healthy eating instead. At six months, children in both groups showed improved behavior, but there was a little bit more improvement in the group that was coached on their TV watching. Too soon: The study's findings were modest but may pave the way toward curbing aggressive behavior in children . By one year, there was no meaningful difference between the two groups overall. Low-income boys appeared to get the most short-term benefit. 'That's important because they are at the greatest risk, both for being perpetrators of aggression in real life, but also being victims of aggression,' Christakis said. But the study has some flaws. The parents weren't told the purpose of the study, but authors concede they probably figured it out and that might have affected the results. Before the study, the children averaged about 1½ hours of TV, video and computer game watching a day, with violent content making up about a quarter of that time. By the end of the study, that increased by up to 10 minutes. Those in the TV coaching group increased their time with positive shows; the healthy eating group watched more violent TV. Nancy Jensen, who took part with her now 6-year-old daughter, said the study was a wake-up call. 'I didn't realize how much Elizabeth was watching and how much she was watching on her own,' she said. Baby steps: Researchers admit the study had flaws but some say its a smarter alternative to research that seeks to demonize nearly all TV . Jensen said her daughter's behavior improved after making changes, and she continues to control what Elizabeth and her 2-year-old brother, Joe, watch. She also decided to replace most of Elizabeth's TV time with games, art and outdoor fun. During a recent visit to their Seattle home, the children seemed more interested in playing with blocks and running around outside than watching TV. Dr. Michael Rich, director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children's Hospital Boston, was not involved in this study but works on similar research and commended the Seattle team's efforts. 'Because no one's going to stop watching TV, we have to have viable alternatives for kids.'","Seattle Children's Research Institute study finds that children who watch educational TV are less prone to violent or aggressive .

Spectators travelling to Stratford on the Central line at around 7am were told all services were terminating at Liverpool Street due to an incident at Leyton. A defective westbound train was awaiting the arrival of the London Fire Brigade, a train driver said. Fire alert: A driver smelled smoke on a train at Leyton resulting in the part closure of the central line . At least four fire engines and the British Transport Police arrived at Leyton station, and the Central line service between Liverpool Street and Woodford/Newbury Park did not reopen until 10am, with severe delays remaining on the line. A number of passengers at Leyton were forced to wait in the dismal weather for buses to get to their destinations. The fire alert meant there was no service for a large part of the Central line, and on the branch of the line that remained open there was severe delays. A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said this morning: 'The suspension is due to a train being taken out of service at Leyton after the driver reported smelling smoke. 'This has been investigated and all passengers left the train and station without reported problems.' Station announcers at Bank told passengers there were reports of a fire on board the train. Not in the rain! Passengers were forced to wait in the bad weather for replacement buses to their destinations . TfL advised Olympic spectators to use other Tube and main line services to reach Stratford, including the Underground's Jubilee line, the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway. To add to the Olympic travel problems, rail services in and out of Liverpool Street main line station were disrupted due to an overhead wire problem between Elsenham and Stansted Mountfitchet in Essex. This was affecting travellers on services run by the Greater Anglia and CrossCountry train companies. The problems around Liverpool Street come on another busy day for public transport as the first weekday evening football match takes place at Wembley Stadium. This is only one of a number of Olympic events taking place in the capital, with Transport for London (TfL) advising that London is expected to be exceptionally busy throughout the day. Final destination: Many people were struggling to get to the Olympic Park in Stratford to watch the Games . TfL said people were heeding advice to avoid London if possible.It added that while Tube journeys were up 4 per cent yesterday, road journeys in London were down by 20 per cent. London’s Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Public transport in general, and the Jubilee line in particular, will be exceptionally busy today as spectators make their way to events at key Olympic venues across the capital. Struggle: Passengers travelling to the Netherlands' 3-2 hockey victory over Japan earlier this morning will have been pushed to make the event on time . 'We are very grateful to customers for following our advice to avoid London Bridge station and for major businesses who are enabling their staff to work flexibly during the Games. 'Our advice to all users of the transport network continues to be to plan ahead, avoid hotspot areas, and leave plenty of time for your journey.' One passenger, who was forced to wait for a bus in the pouring rain to get to work, described the situation as 'absolute chaos'. She said: 'The train was packed to capacity as there were lots people on the way to the Olympics, including people in the Games uniform. Coping: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt claims the transport network in London is 'coping incredibly well' with the Olympics . 'It stopped initially for about 10 minutes and then we were told it was suspended at Leyton due to a fire alert. 'So many families with young children who were not from England were panicking about how to get to Stratford and couldn’t work out the best route. 'People were queuing in the pouring rain and the local cab rank was full of ticket-holders desperately trying to get to the Olympic park.  Not a good impression for London!’ The Central line was not the only section of the Tube network to suffer problems. Heathrow Terminals 1,2 & 3 station was closed for around 20 minutes due to yet another fire alert. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed that the transport network has 'coped incredibly well', despite the Central line grinding to a halt earlier for three hours. He said: 'The Central line is up and running. 'It's a totally normal feature of London's transport network which, let's face it, this is the first Tube network in the world - something we are very proud of - but (it is) also something that gives us challenges. 'But the question is how do people cope? Did people get to the Olympic Park on time? Did people get to their events on time? 'Systems were put in place... and the systems worked. Overall things are very much on track at this stage of the Games.' He said the 'real success' of the Games was that fears of the capital's transport grinding to a halt had not been realised, adding that it 'coped incredibly well'. The RMT union claimed that a likely cause of the closure is Leyton train's brakes seizing up . He added: 'The reason it has coped is because Londoners have listened to the messages, we've got lots of people who are working from home. 'Actual overall traffic numbers on the transport network are four per cent up compared to a normal summer, but it's working extremely well.' Meanwhile the RMT transport union called for an immediate investigation into 'the real impact of cuts to fleet maintenance schedules' following the Central line incident. The union claimed that the likely cause of today's part-closure are the Leyton train's brakes seizing up. This afternoon there were minor problems on the Tube, as a signal failure led to minor delays on the Docklands Light Railway - another link to the Olympic Park. A more significant worrying for Olympic organisers is this afternoon's closure of the Southeastern Javelin - the high-speed Games rail service - between Ebbsfleet and Stratford International stations. The service was suspended for around two hours, and spectators - depending on where they were travelling from - were forced to use the Greater Anglia trains, get either underground services to West Ham or overground services from Liverpool Street this afternoon in order to get to the events on time. There was severe delays between Stratford and St Pancras, but normal service has since resumed.","Central line part suspended because of defective westbound train .

Lamar McKay, who was president of BP America at the time of the disaster, became the first BP executive to testify at a federal trial intended to identify the causes of BP's Macondo well blowout and assign percentages of blame to the companies involved. Rig owner Transocean and cement contractor Halliburton are also defendants at trial, which opened Monday. Scroll down for video . Lamar McKay became the first BP executive to testify at the federal trial intended to identify the causes of BP's Macondo well blowout and assign percentages of blame to the companies involved . A plaintiffs' attorney pressed McKay to agree with him that BP bore ultimate responsibility for the blowout, but McKay insisted that managing the hazards of deepwater drilling are a 'team effort.' 'I think that's a shared responsibility, to manage the safety and the risk,' said McKay, now chief executive of BP's Upstream unit. 'Sometimes contractors manage that risk. Sometimes we do.

McKay also defended BP's internal probe of the spill, which outlined a series of mistakes by rig workers and faulted decisions by other companies but didn't assign any blame to BP's upper-level management. 'I think it was a substantial investigation,' McKay said. 'I think we've learned what we can from the accident and we're trying to put those things into practice right now.'

Barring a settlement, Barbier will decide how much more money BP and other companies owe for their roles in the disaster. McKay's testimony followed that of an expert witness for people and businesses suing the company. University of California-Berkeley engineering professor Robert Bea testified that BP didn't implement a two-year-old safety management program on the rig, which exploded on April 20, 2010. 'It's a classic failure of management and leadership in BP,' said Bea, a former BP consultant who also investigated the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and New Orleans levee breaches after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. BP has said its 'Operating Management System' was designed to drive a rigorous and systematic approach to safety and risk management.

During cross-examination by a BP . lawyer, Bea said the company made 'significant efforts' to improve . safety management as early as 2003. However, the plaintiffs say BP only . implemented its new safety plan at just one of the seven rigs the . company owned or leased in the Gulf at the time of the disaster. Bea said it was 'tragic' and . 'egregious' that BP didn't apply its own safety program to the Deepwater . Horizon before the Macondo well blowout. Transocean owned the rig; BP . leased it. BP lawyer Mike Brock said the company . allows contractors like Transocean to take the primary responsibility . for the safety of rig operations as long as the contractor's safety . system is compatible with BP's - an arrangement that Brock suggested is a . standard industry practice. In his May 2010 congressional testimony, McKay said BP's Operating Management System is 'as good as anyone.' 'I know of nothing that points me in a direction that we have deficiencies' in the system, McKay said. As he questioned Bea, Brock recited a . long list of steps that BP took to improve safety, citing them as . evidence that the company wasn't 'cutting corners' on safety. A plaintiffs' lawyer showed Bea a . transcript of a deposition of Tony Hayward, BP's CEO at the time of the . disaster. Hayward was asked if the blowout could have been averted if BP . had implemented the safety management program in the Gulf. 'There is possible potential,' Hayward responded. 'Undoubtedly.' Bea said BP's 'culture of every . dollar counts' was reflected in a May 2009 email sent by BP well team . leader John Guide: 'The DW Horizon embraced every dollar matters since I . arrived 18 months ago,' Guide wrote. 'We have saved BP millions and no . one had to tell us.' 'Financially, BP had the resources to . effectively put into place a process safety system that could have . prevented the Macondo disaster,' Bea testified.

Cold case: Jennifer Odom (pictured) disappeared on Feb. 19, 1993 in Florida and her body was found six days later . It's been 20 years since Jennifer Odom stepped off her school bus in rural Brooksville, Florida, the last anyone saw of her before the 12-year-old's body was found six days later on a nearby horse trail. Today, it has been revealed that the cold case is being re-opened and detectives say all of the physical evidence will be retested for DNA. Following the murder on February 19, 1993, a number of unsuccessful efforts had been put in place find her killer, including billboards, a story on NBC's ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and a $20,000 reward for information. Now, the Hernando County Sheriff's Detective Jim Boylan, who heads the agency's cold case division, says: ""Everything is going to be looked at under a microscope."" He and his detectives will also take a fresh look at convicted serial killers in the region, to see if they were possibly in the area at the time. Boylan said the FBI is also assisting with information and leads that could link out-of-state criminals to Jennifer's killing. ""It's just one of those cases that grabbed the whole community and never let go,"" Boylan said. The slaying shook this rural community nestled among orange groves, horse farms and gently sloping green hills two decades ago. ""I just remember everyone being so afraid,"" said Madeline Beaumont, who lived in the area and was one of hundreds who searched the woods and groves for Jennifer in the six days she was missing. ""I started looking around and suspecting anybody that looked cross-eyed, `I wonder if they're the one that killed Jenny Odom.'"" Hernando County Sheriff Al Neinhuis recently announced he was dedicating a new, full-time detective to the case. Family portrait: Jennifer (far right) posing with her mother and younger sister Jessica as a young child . The investigator's salary will be paid for with a grant. Furthermore, two civilian volunteers will do a top-to-bottom review, going through every document, report and piece of evidence gathered. Thousands of tips have come in over the years, and a dozen more have been given to authorities in the week since the sheriff's announcement. The tips have led to possible clues as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, though investigators have not elaborated on what led them to those states. Murder scene: Jennifer's body was found in Brooksville, Florida, near the 12-year-old's home . Evidence found at the time suggested Jennifer's killer knew the area well, though where that person is now is a mystery. ""Is there reason to believe he's here now? No,"" Boylan said. Boylan oversees 20 unsolved cases, most of them missing persons, unidentified skeletons and mysterious killings. Jennifer is the only child among them. Jennifer's family reported nothing unusual in the days leading up to the girl's disappearance on Feb. 19, 1993. Jennifer and her sister Jessica normally came home from school on two different buses; the girls played hide-and-seek, and one would sometimes try to lock the other out of the house, depending on who arrived home first. When Jessica arrived home Feb. 19, the door was locked. Jessica, who was 9 at the time, went to her grandmother's home nearby and got a key. When she looked around her home, Jennifer wasn't there. The girls' parents came home from work and called authorities. Over the next six days, volunteers on horseback and worried parents scoured the horse farms and orange groves looking for the honor roll student. ""There was definitely a loss, a loss of innocence,"" said Beaumont, whose daughter was in the same class as Jennifer and who had been to Jennifer's home for a slumber party just months before the disappearance. ""I can't think of anybody allowing their child anymore, just get off the bus and walk home alone."" On the sixth day of searching, Jennifer's body was found on a horse trail several miles from her home. The family lived in Pasco County, but the girl was found in neighboring Hernando County. It's been 20 years since Jennifer Odom stepped off her school bus in Florida, the last anyone saw of her . Investigators identified the girl by her gold chain with a half-heart charm that said ""best friends,"" and through fingerprints. Authorities have not released details about exactly how the girl died. Jennifer's mother and stepfather didn't view the body. ""For me, it was hard to believe it was really her, because we didn't see her,"" the girl's mother, Renee Converse told the Tampa Bay Times in 2003. She could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press. Investigators had few clues. Some students and other witnesses said they saw a light blue pickup truck near the bus stop that day. Boylan said he wants to talk to whoever was in the pickup truck; it's such a remote, out-of-the way area that whoever was in the truck probably has good information. Two years later, Jennifer's book bag and clarinet were found in a trash pile in the woods, 30 miles from her home and 18 miles from where her body was found. At the time, investigators said the way those items were concealed suggested the killer was local and familiar with back roads and out-of-the-way places to hide things.

The blockbuster BP oil spill trial opened today with a scathing attack on the poor safety standards which led to the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. Billions are at stake in the New Orleans courtroom where a federal judge is tasked with determining how much the British oil giant and its subcontractors should pay for the devastating blast and subsequent oil spill at the Deepwater Horizon rig in April 2010. BP has said it already has racked up more than $24 billion in spill-related expenses and has estimated it will pay a total of $42 billion to fully resolve its liability for the disaster that killed 11 workers and spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Scroll down for video . Protesters display placards as the trial against BP begins today at the Federal District Court in New Orleans, Louisiana . However, trial attorneys for the federal government, Gulf states and private plaintiffs hope to convince the judge that the company is liable for much more. BP is equally determined to avoid a finding of gross negligence, which would drastically increase its environmental fines to as much as $17 billion. The oil giant is also hoping to shift much of the blame -- and cost -- to rig operator Transocean and subcontractor Halliburton, which was responsible for the runaway well's faulty cement job. Attorney Jim Roy, who represents individuals and businesses hurt by the spill, said BP executives applied 'huge financial pressure' on its drilling managers to 'cut costs and rush the job' before the blowout of its Macondo well triggered the explosion that killed 11 workers and spawned the massive spill. The project was more than $50 million over budget and behind schedule at the time of the blowout, claimed Roy. 'BP repeatedly chose speed over safety,' said Roy, quoting from a report by an expert who may be called to testify later in the mammoth trial. Activists protest in front of the Hale Boggs Federal Building on the first day of the trial over the Deepwater Horizon oil rig spill in New Orleans, Louisiana today . Lawyers for BP and the U.S. Justice Department are in court today for the opening day of a trial to determine liability in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon, off Louisiana, in this April 21, 2010 file image . U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier said he would hear several hours of opening statements Monday and the first witness would take the stand Tuesday. Unless a settlement is reached, the judge, not a jury, ultimately will decide months from now how much more money BP PLC and its partners on the ill-fated drilling project owe for their roles in the 2010 environmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. Roy said the spill also resulted from rig owner Transocean Ltd.'s 'woeful' safety culture. He said the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig failed to properly train its crew, calling it a 'chronic problem allowed by Transocean management to go uncorrected.' 'The workforce was not always aware of the hazards they were exposed to,' Roy said. 'They don't know what they don't know.' Transocean and BP will make their case's later on today in New Orleans. Oil can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico, more than 50 miles southeast of Venice on Louisiana's tip, as a large plume of smoke rises from fires on BP's Deepwater Horizon offshore rig in April 2010 . With billions of dollars on the line, the companies and their courtroom adversaries have spared no expense in preparing for a trial that could last several months. Hundreds of attorneys have worked on the case, generating roughly 90 million pages of documents, logging nearly 9,000 docket entries and taking more than 300 depositions of witnesses who could testify at trial. 'In terms of sheer dollar amounts and public attention, this is one of the most complex and massive disputes ever faced by the courts,' said Fordham University law professor Howard Erichson, an expert in complex litigation. Barbier has promised he won't let the case drag on for years as has the litigation over the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, which still hasn't been completely resolved. He encouraged settlement talks that already have resolved billions of dollars in spill-related claims. 'Judge Barbier has managed the case actively and moved it along toward trial pretty quickly,' Erichson said. In December, Barbier gave final approval to a settlement between BP and Plaintiffs' Steering Committee lawyers representing Gulf Coast businesses and residents who claim the spill cost them money. BP estimates it will pay roughly $8.5 billion to resolve tens of thousands of these claims, but the deal doesn't have a cap. BP resolved a Justice Department criminal probe by agreeing to plead guilty to manslaughter and other charges and pay $4 billion in criminal penalties. Transocean reached a separate settlement with the federal government, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge and agreeing to pay $1.4 billion in criminal and civil penalties. But there's plenty left for the lawyers to argue about at trial, given that the federal government and Gulf states haven't resolved civil claims against the company that could be worth more than $20 billion. One of the biggest questions facing Barbier will be to determine if BP was guilty of gross negligence. The Justice Department and private plaintiffs' attorneys have said they would prove BP did. A decomposed fish lies in the water as workers pick up oil balls from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in Waveland, Mississippi more than three months after the April 2010 disaster . Under the Clean Water Act, which is designed to punish companies and prevent future spills, a polluter pays a minimum of $1,100 per barrel of spilled oil; the fines nearly quadruple for companies found guilty of grossly negligent behavior. BP, meanwhile, argues the federal government's estimate of how much oil spewed from the well — more than 200 million gallons — is inflated by at least 20 percent. Clean Water Act penalties are based on how many barrels of oil spilled. Barbier plans to hold the trial in at least two phases and may issue partial rulings at the end of each. The first phase, which could last three months, is designed to determine what caused the blowout and assign percentages of blame to the companies involved. The second phase will address efforts to stop the flow of oil from the well and aims to determine how much crude spilled into the Gulf. The trial originally was scheduled to start a year ago, but Barbier postponed it to allow BP to wrap up its settlement with the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee. A member of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's staff wearing a glove reaches into thick oil on the surface of the northern regions of Barataria Bay in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana in June 2010 . The Deepwater Horizon rig blew up 50 miles off Louisiana on April 20, 2010, in an explosion that investigators blamed on time-saving, cost-cutting decisions by BP and its drilling partners in cementing the well shaft. Following several failed attempts that introduced the American public to such industry terms as 'top kill' and 'junk shot,' BP finally capped the well on the sea floor after more than 85 days. By then, the well had spewed an estimated 172 million gallons of crude into the Gulf, fouling marshes and beaches, killing wildlife and closing vast areas to fishing. Scientists warn that the spill's full effect on the Gulf food chain may not be known for years. But they have reported oil-coated coral reefs that were dying, and fish have been showing up in nets with lesions and illnesses that biologists fear could be oil-related. Oil churned up by storms could be washing up for years. A series of government investigations has exhaustively documented the mistakes that led to the blowout, spreading the blame among the companies. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said witnesses scheduled to testify at trial will reveal new information about the cause of the disaster. 'I think you're going to learn a lot, particularly about the culture that existed at BP and their priorities,' Strange said.","Billions are at stake in the New Orleans courtroom in damages trial which began today .

Three military-trained dolphins have gone AWOL from the Ukrainian Navy - apparently in search of love. The marine mammals, who can attack enemies using guns and knives strapped to their head, failed to return after a training exercise near the port of Sevastopol in the Black Sea. But Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, said he believes they have probably left to find a mate and will soon return. Highly trained: A sensor is attached to the snout of a dolphin in Sevastopol, left, and a U.S. Navy diver and marine mammal handler plays with another as part of the Marine Mammal Program in Virginia, right . Mr Plyachenko, said based on his experience in the Cold War, he expects the amorous dolphins to return. 'If . a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he . would immediately set off after her. But they came back in a week or . so,' he said. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry has denied the reports that the dolphins have gone missing, or that such a unit even exists. Reports emerged last year that the Ukraine was planning to start training dolphins for military action, a tactic made famous in the Soviet era. During the Cold War, dolphins were trained by the Soviet Navy at Sevastopol, to locate mines on the seabed and attack divers. They could also carry explosives on their heads to plant them on enemy ships. When the USSR collapsed two decades . ago they were redeployed to work with disabled children. The former top secret military base on the Crimean peninsula became a leading place for dolphin-therapy - a controversial alternative technique to soothe ailments - after the Soviet collapse. New purpose: The dolphins at Sevastopol had been redeployed to help treat children with disabilities such as cerebral palsy . Dolphins who previously were engaged in military service turned their highly trained minds away from office to helping cure children with a range of problems from nightmares to autism to cerebral palsy. The U.S. Navy also trained dolphins for military use in Virginia as part of its Marine Mammal Program. But the Ukraine's plans to resurrect the elite unit has suffered an embarrassing setback with the disappearance of the love-sick trio.","Love sick trio disappeared during training exercise near port of Sevastopol .

The results of a post-mortem are expected back today and a magistrate is now investigating his death. Singh's body was pictured being loaded onto an ambulance outside the All India Institute of Medical Sciences today, accompanied by his family. It comes as a new report says Singh had 'no fear of the law' and forcibly married his wife Rekha, who died within a year of the couple adopting his brother's son. According to The Times of India, locals remained silent about the marriage because of intimidation and Singh was known for his heavy drinking and fighting. The newspaper quoted a 'police source' as saying: 'Throughout his interrogation, he showed no remorse, his voice remained frosty, emotionless as he narrated his gory deeds. 'It was so brutal that the policeman jotting down his interrogation report could barely write. His hands shivered.' Singh was among the five men and a . juvenile awaiting trial for the brutal attack on the 23-year-old trainee . physiotherapist in the Indian capital in December last year. The assault triggered nationwide protests and an intense debate about rampant crime against women in India. He was facing the death penalty if found guilty. The Times of India said it has seen his confession in which he describes driving around to find a 'woman for sex'. He said he hit 'the boy' with a rod and then raped the student.

Dark origins: The New Year's Concert originated as a propaganda instrument in 1939 to promote Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels' desired image of Vienna . The country will solemnly mark the 75th anniversary tomorrow of its annexation by Nazi Germany. The Vienna Philharmonic is best known for its annual New Year Concert, a . Strauss waltz extravaganza broadcast to an audience of more than . 50million in 80 countries. Few realise that the concert originated as a . propaganda instrument under Nazi rule in 1939. The orchestra rarely played the music of the Strauss family, known for . the Blue Danube and numerous other waltzes, before this period. The New Year Concert helped promote Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph . Goebbels’s desired image of Vienna. He wrote in his diaries that the . Austrian capital should be seen as a city of ‘culture, music, optimism . and conviviality’. Fritz Truempi, one of three  historians commissioned by the orchestra to . produce articles on its Nazi era which will be published on its . website, said: ‘The New Year Concert was invented under the Nazis.’ ■ Nearly half the population of Austria – the birthplace of Adolf Hitler . – think that there were ‘positive aspects’ to Nazi rule, according to a . poll. And 54 per cent think if there were no law forbidding Nazis they would be ‘successful’ in elections. The results of the survey have shocked academics who say they are proof . that Austria still has not come to terms with its Nazi past. German . troops marched into Austria on March 12, 1938 and the terror which . befell the Jews in Vienna was far worse than anything which had taken . place up until that time in Germany. Austria housed one of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps – . Mauthausen – where 200,000 people were murdered, worked to death or . subjected to terrible medical experiments.

Ever since David Beckham was snapped running around Los Angeles in his underpants filming his new H&M campaign, the women of the world have been eagerly awaiting the results. Now they need wait no longer as today sees the launch of the new Guy Ritchie-directed TV advert - due to hit the small screen at 9.50pm this evening. The film kicks off with Beckham waving goodbye to his three sons in his dressing gown, only for it to be shut in the door of the car. Scroll down for video . Oh pants! Beckham realises the car has driven off with his dressing gown shut in the door . Athletic: He sprints off in pursuit, vaulting over hedges and running through a tennis court in the process . That's torn it! Unfortunately for Becks, cotton vests and hedges don't mix well and the star is left topless . Stripped down: David makes a dash across a Los Angeles garden in his skimpy green boxers . As the car drives off, the dressing gown is pulled away, leaving Beckham clad only in a vest and tight pair of pants. A chase ensues with Beckham losing his vest (but not his slippers) in the process, thanks to some athletic hedge-vaulting and a dip in one of his neighbour's pools. Unfortunately for Becks, he doesn't quite manage to catch up with his dressing gown and comes to a halt in front of a tour bus filled with Japanese tourists, who, as one, whip out a phalanx of cameras. Beckham, 37, is no stranger to modelling and has starred in campaigns for H&M, Armani and Police sunglasses - most of which have required him to remove his top. But his latest campaign appears to be among his favourites, with the footballer singing the praises of director Guy Ritchie. Diver: While Beckham might not be much of a diver on the field, he proves adept off it . Uh oh... Becks screeches to a halt, only to discover a bus crammed with Japanese tourists pulling up . As he looks around, the tourists whip out their cameras to record a moment they (and we) won't forget . Speaking about the RocknRolla director, Beckham said: 'Working with Guy has been a fantastic experience. 'I hope everyone has as much fun watching the film as I had making it.' Director Ritchie seemed equally enamoured, saying: 'David makes the perfect leading man, . 'For me this felt more than a campaign – it was like directing a short film.'

Marius Tanase, an ethnic Roma, has worked in Spain and Britain before to provide for his five children. But when border controls are relaxed in 2014 he plans to move to the UK permanently to escape a life of poverty in his home country. His home town of Dilga, in Romania, has a population of 2,500 people but only dirt roads, no running water and unemployment is at 70 per cent. Hopeful: Marius Tanase, and his daughter Denisa, six, wants to move to Britain in 2014 so his children can get a better education . Better future: Tudora, Marius's wife, has a two-hour commute to work as a cleaner in Romania . Searching: Costin Costea (left), 19, and his brother Florin, 17, are struggling to find work in Dilga, Romania, which has 70 per cent unemployment . Most of the working-age men and women have at some point worked abroad, mostly in Italy or Britain, as many say they are unable to find adequate work in Romania. Marius says he will move not because of the possibility of earning more money, but because he thinks his five . children will have a better chance at a full education in Britain. Currently his wife Tudora works as a cleaner at a university in Bucharest which is a two-hour train commute away. Another resident, Aneta Enache has three children who all live and . work in Italy, send money home and only come to Dilga once a year to . visit. Aneta's grandaughter Madelina lives with her and her . husband, who is unemployed after he lost his job at Romania's state-run . railways. Success: Mioara Costea and her husband Costel are comparatively wealthy as they own cows, turkeys, geese and chickens . Struggle: Xenia Costea (right), who runs one of just six shops in Dilga. She say customers often buy on credit . Tough: Viorica Gheorghe, left with her daughter Gabriela, three, says her family survives on her husband's salary of 200 Euros a month. Ten-year-old Madelina, right, does her English homework . During the communist era most Roma people worked in nearby state-run factories . Costin Costea, 19, recently finished high school . and is helping his father Marian build a house while he looks for a job. Marian worked for two years in Italy as a construction worker until he lost his job when the economy declined. Viorica Gheorghe says her family of four survives on the 200 Euros a month her husband bring in from his job in Bucharest, a two-hour . train commute. But others are not quite as desperate to change their fortunes. Mioara and her husband Costel, who own cows, turkeys, geese and chickens, are comparatively wealthy. Costel says he owes his success to his decision not to sell the ten hectares . of land given to him after the fall of the Romanian communist . government in 1989. Most other Roma in Dilga did sell their land for . money when times got hard. Although his mother works in Italy as a . nurse, Vasile Nedelcu says he would rather stay in Romania despite the . difficult employment situation. Aneta Enache, left, works at her sewing machine while her grandaughter Madelina, 10, does her English homework in the living room . Florin Costea, 17, digs out iron columns and other builng scraps that were part of a shed to make way for a vegetable garden . Staying: Vasile Nedelcu (right), with his friend Florin Arapu, says says he wants to stay in Romania, even though the employment situation is difficult . When Romania and Bulgaria first joined the EU in 2007, they instantly became the poorest countries in the union. GDP per head in Romania is less than £8,000 per head, under a third of that in the UK. This . huge disparity in wealth has prompted fears that Britain and other . western countries will see an influx of Romanian immigrants once the . final restrictions on their working throughout Europe are lifted at the . end of this year. These worries have been emphasised by media reports of widespread rural poverty, especially among the Roma or Gypsy communities. Romania's Roma belong to a myriad of different tribes defined by their craft, and Dilga's belong to a group called the Rudari, who until the 1930s specialised in woodcrafts. During the communist years most worked in nearby state-run factories and agricultural cooperatives, though the majority of these went bankrupt after 1989 and the local Roma lost their jobs. Since then they have struggled to make ends meet and find a better future for their children, though projects initiated by the European Union and NGOs are helping some to launch small-scale enterprises and improve their children's education.","Dilga, Romania, has no running water and 70 per cent unemployment .

Tipping the scales at nearly 26 stone, IT teacher James Bentley wasn't setting a healthy example to pupils at his Oldbury school - and they weren't afraid to point it out. Now James, 25, fed up with the teasing, has lost nearly half his bodyweight - an amazing 11 stone 3lbs - in just two years. At his heaviest, James weighed 25 stone 11lb, had a massive 60in waist and was so large it took him 10 minutes to bend down and put his shoes on every morning. Mr Tubby: James has lost more than 11 stone (left) and is now fitter and healthier than ever before . Hefty: At his most well-padded, James tipped the scales at nearly 26 stone and had a colossal 60in waist . The 6ft 2in cycling fan now weighs 14st 8lbs and sports a trim 36in waist but says he has had to spend hundreds of pounds on a new wardrobe because he is swamped by his old super-sized clothes. 'I'm 6ft 2in which probably means I could get away with carrying a bit of extra weight, but now I feel much healthier,' said James . 'When I put the weight on I was quite happy in myself and felt I didn't need to diet. I did get some comments from the pupils, nothing too bad but the word 'tubby' was used a few times. 'I took it in good humour because I have a good relationship with the students but things came to a head when I had my picture taken on sport's day. 'My body virtually filled the entire picture which was embarrassing and I knew I had to do something to change my appearance. I looked in the mirror and thought 'who is that person?'. 'I decided to lose weight over the summer holiday and just saw it as a short-term thing.' Suits you sir! Thanks to the loss of nearly half his body weight, James now gets compliments from his pupils . Unusually, James had thought he had a healthy diet . because he always skipped breakfast and lunch before binge-eating in . the evenings. 'During the day I would just . have fizzy drinks, no food at all, but then at night I would have an . Indian, Chinese, pizza or go to the chippy after marking the pupils . work. 'Now I usually have porridge for breakfast, a chicken wrap for lunch and then a steak and jacket potato for dinner. I do still have treats like an Indian meal but I tend to go for a lighter option.' But the real change came courtesy of a healthy new hobby: cycling. 'My friends suggested I start cycling and I just couldn't stop,' he explains. 'I was clocking up hundreds of miles a month and went as often as I could. 'I decided to carry on and the weight has managed to keep coming off and now I feel much better. 'When you are used to seeing yourself every day you don't notice the change but I do think it's ridiculous when I look at photos of myself from a few years ago, or I get my big trousers out. Slim: James' healthy new diet and passion for cycling long distances has had impressive results . What's more, even James' pupils have noticed his rapidly dwindling waistline - and changed their tune to boot. 'The children at school tell me that they can see I'm losing weight - they think my face has changed quite a bit and people are always telling me I look younger,' their teacher adds. 'Now I weigh 14st 8lb and my goal is 13st 13lb so I haven't got too far to go.' Teasing: Pupils at Oldbury Academy branded James 'tubby' but after his weight loss, he's had the last laugh .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 16:20 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 13 March 2013 . The introduction of the new unleaded petrol, called E10, could have alarming consequences for motorists . Britain’s transport minister has asked oil giants to delay introducing a new ‘green’ petrol that could put up the cost of driving and even damage older cars. The Daily Mail revealed yesterday how plans to introduce the new unleaded petrol, which is called E10, could have alarming consequences. Estimates suggest it could add around £80 to the annual driving costs of a family and might even cause some components on the engines of older cars to melt. Transport minister, Norman Baker, is particularly worried about the impact on poorer families who tend to drive older cars. UK petrol companies are planning to introduce the new fuel, which contains 10per cent ethanol created from corn, later this year. The firms are required to start selling the ‘green’ petrol under EU directives requiring them to increase the amount of biofuel they sell or face large fines. The idea is that this will reduce the use of fossil fuels and the resulting creation of greenhouse gasses linked to global warming. Britain’s Department for Transport (DfT) has calculated that the new fuel is not compatible with as many as 8.6million older vehicles on the roads in this country. The high ethanol content means the fuel could effectively melt seals and components in the engines of older cars, motor cycles and even lawnmowers. Significantly, a study published by the respected think-tank Chatham House, points out that E10 petrol is less efficient that standard petrol, which means drivers do fewer miles to the gallon. The net effect is that a family driving 10,000 miles a year will end up buying more fuel and paying around £80 a year extra if they use E10. In theory, oil companies could introduce E10 at any time that suits them, however Mr Baker has asked them to delay. E10 will be sold from pumps alongside E5, which is 5per cent ethanol and compatible with all petrol engines, standard unleaded petrol and diesel. Mr Baker is particularly concerned about the impact of the new fuel on poorer families who tend to drive older cars. They may find the engines fail if they inadvertently use the E10. Ministers wants the oil firms involved to give the government at least three months’ notice of any move to sell the fuel. Transport Minister Norman Baker is worried about the impact E10 will have on older cars . In the meantime, DfT officials are drawing up a public education campaign about the new fuel and compiling a database of vehicles that are not compatible, which would be made available to drivers. Significantly, the UK government has no legal powers to stop petrol suppliers from launching E10 here. Mr Baker said: ‘I have made it clear to fuel suppliers that we would like them to delay supplying E10 until the number of incompatible vehicles has reduced and the market is ready. ‘I am particularly conscious that it is often poorer people with older cars who may be particularly affected. ‘Although it is ultimately a commercial decision, we believe this is the right approach to minimise the impact on hard-pressed families.’ Quentin Wilson, of FairFuelUK, said the government has the power to mitigate the increase costs of using E10. ‘The government should protect the motorists from any increase in the cost of motoring caused by the introduction of E10 by cutting the rate of duty. Currently, the combination of duty and VAT, means the tax on fuel is about 80p a litre,’ he said. Suppliers, such as BP, Shell and Total, are working on the introduction of E10 petrol through a body called the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP). BP said it would not disclose the details of discussions with politicians about the timing of the introduction of E10. A spokesman said: ‘EU member states are committed to increasing the amount of biofuels in the fuel mix by 2020 as a means to using more renewable energy. ‘BP is working with industry on a wide range of measures to ensure that our customers will be properly informed well in advance of any future changes to our products.’ Shell referred calls to LowCVP, which said it had no date for the introduction of E10. The organisation will co-ordinate a public information campaign when the fuel is launched in the UK. E10 was launched in Germany two years ago, however most motorists have refused to use it amid fears it might damage their cars. A spokesman for LowCVP said: ‘We are trying to make sure that as and when it is introduced, that happens without the problems seen elsewhere. There will be a database showing which cars can and can’t use it.’ It is difficult to find reliable figures on the number of vehicles that are not compatible with E10. A Department for Transport study published in 2010 put the figure at 8.6million and predicted this would fall to around 4.3m by 2013. Motor industry estimates suggest some two million vehicles are known to be incompatible, and a further one million might be. There is also an unknown number of motorcycles, power tools and ride-on lawnmowers that will also be incompatible with E10.","Unleaded petrol called E10 could add £80 to a family's annual driving costs .

Getting engaged is meant to be one of the most exciting times of a woman's life but for many it heralds the start of a desperate diet so they can look slim on their big day. Health and fitness expert Joanna Ebsworth was alarmed by the number of brides-to-be she met through her work who are going to drastic measures to be thinner. She told MailOnline: 'Unfortunately for many women, it seems as soon as . they get that ring on their finger, a signal goes off inside them telling them . they need to start losing weight for the wedding.' I do... want to be thinner: Many brides are going to extreme measures from starvation diets to surgery to fit into their dream dress . Joanna said she was horrified by the steps some women are taking because they are so driven to achieve 'perfection' when they say their vows. A common mistake many made was buying a wedding dress one or two sizes too small to give them an incentive to lose weight - but then flying into a panic when they realised close to the day that their dream dress still didn't fit. Joanna recalls how this led to disaster for Claire Humphries*, 26, from Nottingham: 'After ordering her dress in a size 10, the bride-to-be realised two weeks before her wedding she hadn’t lost nearly enough to even get the dress done . up, she went into a complete panic and basically went on a starvation diet, . eating only steamed courgettes when she did eat. 'In the two days before the . ceremony, nothing passed her lips apart from fluids and not one person, . including her husband-to-be, could get her to eat. 'In the end, she passed out weak . from hunger as she walked down the aisle, at the very moment when all eyes were . on her, which is terribly sad and distressing to imagine.' Bridal woes: Worries about their figure can lead to women being miserable on what should be the happiest day of their life . Joanna also met Louise Jones*, 34, from Sheffield who took the drastic measure of going under the knife so she could fit into her perfect dress. She went abroad weeks before her ceremony to have a tummy tuck operation that cost £7,000. Joanna explains: 'While the operation did get her into her dress, she was in serious discomfort . leading up to the wedding and on the day, and then spent her dream beach honeymoon . covered up because the bruising and swelling had yet to go down.' Another women took the term 'bridezilla' to a whole new level when she wanted to lose weight. Amy Lomas*, 29, from London, bought diet pills online but the side effects meant she became 'erratic, moody and anxious'. Joanna said: 'In the end her fiance told her if she didn’t stop taking . them, there wouldn’t be a wedding. He said he'd rather have his fiancée back to normal . at the size she was, than live with a monster in the run up to the big day.' Shape up: Joanna Ebswoth recommends exercises including sit ups, left, and lunges for a defined figure . Joanna, who has had many brides-to-be come to her for advice after failing miserably on calorie control diets, added: 'There are loads of other women I could mention, from . brides who’ve felt the need to have boob jobs to fill their dresses out after . losing weight too fast, to women who’ve spent a small fortune on laser therapy . treatments to improve the appearance of bingo wings or loose skin. 'Others packed . themselves off to an intensive bootcamp weeks before the wedding (one of whom . I know sprained her ankle while she was there and unfortunately ended up hobbling . down the aisle instead of gliding down it!) 'It's concerning because many women don’t realise the . potentially damaging long-term effects their efforts can have on their health, and they often end up detracting from their experience of . their own wedding.' Joanna points out that women shouldn't feel the need to lose weight before they tie the knot. 'It’s a bit bizarre when you think about it really, because . surely, when a man asks you to marry him, he’s declaring that he loves you for . you, and accepts you exactly the way you are? He’s not secretly hoping that if you . accept his hand in marriage, you might drop a dress size or two,' she said. However, she appreciates that in our digital age, brides are bound to feel more pressure to look good when they could be snapped from every angle and then have their picture instantly uploaded on social networks without their approval. Expert advice: Joanna Ebsworth, left, has written a magbook, right, to help brides-to-be prepare for their big day healthily . But rather than going to extreme measures, Jo says there are much healthier ways for brides to look beautiful. Losing weight gradually - a couple of pounds a week - is much better than trying to crash diet while exercise is an important element to looking and feeling great as a newlywed. She has pulled all her health and fitness advice into a 'magbook' called Shape Up For Your Wedding: The Complete Bridal-Body Plan'. The book contains tips on healthy eating and ways to lose weight while still eating often so you don't feel hungry. There is also a large section on workouts and exercises brides-to-be can do to tone up. Different sections focus on certain areas of the body including tricep dips to banishing bingo wings, core stability moves to get a flat stomach and lunges with hand weights to firm up the bottom. The exercises are all explained and illustrated and can be done at home with the aim of achieving a trim and defined figure. 'I designed the workouts to give maximum results very quickly . but safely,' Joanna explained. 'The main workout works the entire body, with time saving but highly . effective ‘compound’ exercises that work lots of large muscle groups (like the . thighs, glutes and core) in one go. 'Because you’re working so many muscles with one move, you’ll burn serious . calories, tone up and give your metabolism a huge boost so you continue to burn . calories long after the workout has ended, even when resting.' Aside from the diet and exercise tips, Joanna's book also includes advice on how to boost your body confidence and self-esteem, how to find the right dress to suit your shape, how to beat stress, and beauty tips on how to get radiant skin, shiny hair. She said: 'It was very important to me to include information on these . areas, because I believe brides need to keep things in proportion, and . understand that their health, happiness and their relationship with their . partner is so much more important than being thin. 'When you picture a bride, you picture someone who is . glowing, radiant, and happy – not tired, stressed and scrawny!'

Two bosses from Butlins flew out to Eastern Europe on Thursday to carry out interviews to fill 20 'Dream Team' roles in mixed accommodation and catering. Catering boss Paul Todd and head of accommodation Tommy Todd made the three day trip this week after a recruitment 'open day' at the Job Centre in Minehead, Somerset, where one of the company's holiday camps in based, saw just six applicants gain second interviews, according to reports. Bosses from the holiday company Butlins have flown out to Poland to recruit workers .

The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday signalled a softening of his opposition to gay marriage – and suggested the Church of England could even back civil partnerships for straight couples. In a surprise intervention, the Most Reverend Justin Welby suggested his main concern about the Government’s gay marriage proposals is that ‘they don’t actually include people equally’. Speaking to LBC Radio he said it would be ‘completely absurd’ to suggest that gay relationships were less loving than heterosexual ones. He said the Church was ‘open to discussions’ on the issue. He added: ‘I think that the problem with the gay marriage proposals is that they don’t actually include people equally, it’s called equal marriage, but the proposals in the Bill don’t do that. ‘I know plenty of gay couples whose relationships are an example to plenty of other people and that’s something that’s very important. ‘I’m not saying that gay relationships are in some way … you know, that the love that there is is less than the love there is between straight couples – that would be a completely absurd thing to say. ‘And civil partnership is a pretty … I understand why people want that to be strengthened and made more dignified, somehow more honourable in a good way. It’s not the same as marriage.’ Dr Welby, who highlighted the difficulty of keeping the worldwide Anglican community on board, confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month. His comments will be seen as a significant softening of the Church’s stance. They seem to suggest that if straight couples were allowed to have civil partnerships he would be prepared to accept gay marriage. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, a complex set of proposals that would allow gay marriages to be conducted by registrars and those religious organisations that wish to, is going through Parliament. Civil partnerships for same-sex couples, which were introduced in 2005, carry the legal rights of marriage but lack the full symbolic commitment. The new Archbishop, who will be enthroned next week, has already caused controversy this week after he signed a strongly-worded letter from 43 bishops that claimed the Coalition’s welfare reforms would ‘disproportionately’ affect children and were ‘unacceptable’. But he later appeared to soften his stance, saying that the current benefits system is ‘shot full of holes, wrong incentives and incredible complexity’. His latest remarks came as it emerged that the Church had indicated support for heterosexual couples to be allowed to form civil partnerships – despite warnings that the move would undermine marriage. Justin Welby confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month . The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, told MPs considering the Bill that extending civil partnerships to straight couples would ‘fulfil a need’ for couples who wanted to make a commitment that falls short of marriage. But a Government source said it was ‘utterly illogical’ for the Church – which is traditionally a key defender of marriage – to be promoting civil partnerships. Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams has tabled an amendment calling for civil partnerships to be extended to straight couples. This is a key demand of gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who argues that the new gay marriage laws will otherwise discriminate against heterosexuals. Ministers are resisting the move, arguing that it would undermine marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury's comments are being viewed as a softening of the church's stance on gay marriage . The Bishop, who was representing the Church of England in discussions on the Bill, told MPs: ‘It seems a strange anomaly that heterosexual couples cannot register a civil partnership. ‘You have only got to look at the figures for marriage. There are now 100,000 fewer marriages in this country each year than there were 20 years ago.  The figures are quite striking, and that has given much greater acceptance of remarriage after divorce. ‘A great many heterosexual couples decide not to get married, and they do so conscientiously – it is not an accident. It may well be that heterosexual civil partnerships might fulfil a need for them.’ A Government source said ministers were astonished by the bishop’s comments, given that the Church had previously argued strongly in favour of marriage as ‘part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together’. The source said: ‘Our Bill is about opening up marriage to more people. ‘It’s a bedrock of our society binding families together and promoting stability – we see it as a gold standard. ‘It seems utterly illogical that the Church of England would advocate opening up civil partnerships at the expense of marriage, especially when they have previously been arguing it’s fundamental importance to our way of life.’ The support for extending civil partnerships also came under fire from the Dean of St Albans, Dr Jeffrey John, who hit the headlines a decade ago when he became the first openly gay priest to be nominated as a Church of England bishop. He declined the post  in the face of protests from traditionalists. Mr John said civil partnerships should be abolished altogether once gay marriage has been legalised. He told MPs: ‘My worry is that civil partnership may bring about the very thing the Church says it fears, which is that somehow the idea of faithfulness and monogamy will be diluted.’","Justin Welby confirmed his opposition to gay marriage as recently as last month .

It's one of the most iconic James Bond scenes, Daniel Craig sauntering out of the water in his pants showing off his muscular physique in his first outing as 007 in Casino Royale. And now David Beckham has channelled the super spy and mimicked the moment for a new television advert, promoting his new H&M underwear range with the special treat. The footballer just can’t seem to keep his kit on these days. Scroll down for video... Diver: While Beckham might not be much of a diver on the field, he proves adept off it . It’s probably a good thing the former England captain will soon be back playing again in France. At least then the new Paris-Saint Germain midfielder will have to keep the shirt on his back. In Los Angeles – as illustrated in a new video ad for cut-price fashion retailers H&M – Beckham, 37, took every opportunity to show off his heavily tattooed torso. That rings a bell! David Beckham seemed to mimic the moment Daniel Craig steps out of the water in Casino Royale during the new advert . Oh pants! Beckham realises the car has driven off with his dressing gown shut in the door . Athletic: He sprints off in pursuit, vaulting over hedges and running through a tennis court in the process . He says in interviews that he’s still shocked looking up to see giant billboards of him in his underwear. But everyone else is getting well used to it. The latest ad campaign is not the first time that Beckham, who signed a short-term deal last week to play in Paris, has posed in his smalls. The father-of-four first launched his line of undergarments and casual lounge,where costs range from £7.99 to £24.99, wear a year ago with a photo campaign. That's torn it! Unfortunately for Becks, cotton vests and hedges don't mix well and the star is left topless . Stripped down: David makes a dash across a Los Angeles garden in his skimpy green boxers . But this time he gets the opportunity from Madonna’s ex-husband Guy Ritchie, who directed the clip, to try a bit of acting. In the 90-second advert, Beckham is filmed sprinting topless around Beverly Hills trying to save the day in just his pants and slippers after his dressing gown gets caught in the car door as he sees off his children going to school. After his front door closes behind him he dashes after the car, running across a tennis court, kicking a football and leaping a lawnmower on a short cut through the gardens of the multi-million pound homes. Star of the clip: Beckham caused a stir when he was spotted filming the advert in his underwear in Los Angeles last year . Pecs appeal: The footballer happily showed off his chest and tattoos in the commercial . Somehow along the way he loses his vest jumping through some bushes. He dives in a pool and emerges dripping wet in the Bond homage before carrying on with the chase, pausing again only to hitch up his pants when a busload of tourists stop to snap his picture. If the 37-year-old former LA Galaxy star is hoping the ad will serve as an audition for the big screen, he’s already won over Ritchie, who called him ‘the perfect leading man.’ Making his getaway: Beckham runs along in his underwear in the video in search of clothes . That'll get their attention: David filmed the advert to publicise his new range for H&M . Teaming up: Sherlock Holmes director Guy Ritchie was behind the masterpiece . Comedic: Throughout the clip Beckham runs through tennis courts and gardens during his scantily clad run . The ‘Sherlock Holmes’ director said he tripled the length of the film from 30 to 90 seconds. ‘For me this felt more than a campaign, it was like directing a short film,’ he said. ‘Working with Guy has been a fantastic experience,’ said Beckham, who was coy about a possible acting career. ‘It was good fun playing an action hero for the day, getting to do all the stunts and ending up in unexpected situations, but acting full-time is not something I see myself doing in the near future,’ he added. Fans on Twitter were quick to voice their approval with posts like ‘Hot!’ and ‘Yummy.’ Watch out! The footballer ran passed two fierce looking dogs during the skit . He must be fast: The dogs even seemed in awe of the underwear clad superstar . Athletic: David jumped over tables to the shock of one house owner in thew new underwear commercial . Crowd pleaser: The new advert will no doubt please his scores of female fans happy to see him in his smalls . Run, Beckham, run! The advert was shot by Ritchie last year before David moved away from Los Angeles . Fancy seeing him here: He even ran through a group of children during his frantic sprint . But at least one fan was left confused by the ad, tweeting: ‘Since when did Beckham have that much pace?’ Although he doesn’t have a personal Twitter account – wife Victoria has more than 5.4 million followers – Beckham took over H&M’s feed yesterday to answer questions. He turned up late after a training session but posted a photo of him sitting at his laptop and told how London was his favourite city and ‘shaved’ was his preferred hairstyle. It's Beckham! In real life the children would have no doubt been ecstatic to see their idol . Action man: The sporting hero eventually covered up in shorts and a vest top as he climbed over a wall . Predictably, the former Manchester United star tipped his old club to win the Premier League this season. Beckham, 37, is no stranger to modelling and has starred in campaigns for H&M, Armani and Police sunglasses - most of which have required him to remove his top. But his latest campaign appears to be among his favourites, with the footballer singing the praises of director Guy Ritchie. Uh oh... Becks screeches to a halt, only to discover a bus crammed with Japanese tourists pulling up . As he looks around, the tourists whip out their cameras to record a moment they (and we) won't forget . Speaking about the RocknRolla director, Beckham said: 'Working with Guy has been a fantastic experience. 'I hope everyone has as much fun watching the film as I had making it.' Director Ritchie seemed equally enamoured, saying: 'David makes the perfect leading man, . 'For me this felt more than a campaign – it was like directing a short film.'

Two police officers choked up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, called 911 after making the grizzly discovery. She gave birth in her parents' affluent home secretly in September 2011 and covered the newborn twin boy's mouths with her hand to stifle the screams so no one would hear. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were revealed to the jury . Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville . Dumped: The court was shown grizzly pictures of the laundry basket in which the dead newborns had been discarded by Lowe after she gave birth to them and smothered them . Blood: The bathroom were Lowe gave birth to her twins while she was on the toilet and then smothered them to stifle their screams . Grizzly discovery: Police find the tiny bodies of the newborn twin boys . Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand . on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe . and pulling back a bloody towel. He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.' Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing. The . newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the . two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, . about 20 miles northeast of Nashville. The . second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready . to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he . discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the . basket. Fentress held the . body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover . the second one – who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first . baby back in the basket beside his brother. Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday. Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty . She had told police she gave birth to . the twin boys in the bathroom of the home on the night of September 12, . 2011, and smothered them so that her parents would not hear their cries. Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth. Defense attorney John Pellegrin told . jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth . where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures. The night before the births, one of . her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, . he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant. Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live. 'Officers, during their search of the . house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District . Attorney Blanton said during opening statements. 'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.' They pointed out that Lowe had been . engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when . she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins. 'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the . births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her . life,' Blanton said in opening statements. But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple. Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today . Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death . Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty . Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied . 'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said. He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom. 'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury. Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense. In earlier hearings, Lowe's father . Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in . with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in . 2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor. The final witness Tuesday was Detective Steve Malach, who interviewed Lowe after the babies were discovered. Upset: Lindsey Lowe cries as she listens to testimony while she sits with her attorney, John Pellegrin . He testified how Lowe told him she gave birth and then put the babies in a laundry basket. When he asked if she ever checked on them, 'she said she couldn't face it,' he told jurors. If convicted of first-degree murder, . Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said . previously they would not seek the death penalty. Testimony continues Wednesday.","Lindsey Lowe, now 26, smothered her newborn twins after giving birth in her parents' bathroom .

Sir John Major has revealed how he was left ‘seething’ by Margaret Thatcher when she made a ‘wildly over the top’ personal attack on him. The former Prime Minister said the ‘soup went cold’ when she turned on him at a dinner with Tory MPs. Sir John lifts the lid on his stormy relations with Lady Thatcher in a new book, The Real Iron Lady, extracts from which are published today in The Mail on Sunday. Sir John Major described how Margaret Thatcher's soup went cold while she verbally attacked him at a dinner party . Baroness Gillian Shephard's book 'The Real Iron Lady' contains revelations that Margaret Thatcher flirted with leaders . Written by Gillian Shephard, a Cabinet Minister under Thatcher and Major, it reveals: . It is well known that, though Sir John succeeded Lady Thatcher in Downing Street with her support in 1990, they later fell out. Until now, he has never spoken about their behind-closed-doors quarrels. But in Baroness Shephard’s book, he gives a dramatic blow-by-blow account of how she was capable of ‘great intimidation’. Sir John recalls a private dinner with Margaret Thatcher when she was in No 10 and he was a Treasury Whip. He had been asked to spell out Tory MPs’ concerns about her policies. Baroness Gillian Shepherd says there was a 'sexual' spark between former French president Francois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher . Cabinet ministers mocked Margaret Thatcher for her habit of breaking off meetings to make tea for everyone . ‘I said the party was not enamoured of our policy. We were close to facing a rebellion. “What exactly are they concerned about?” came an icy voice from across the table, as her soup went cold. Margaret Thatcher was married to Denis Thatcher but is said to have flirted with Francois Mitterrand . 'Margaret was livid and began attacking me .  .  . her reaction was wildly over the top. Infuriated by the injustice of her behaviour, I said it was my job to report the party view whether the PM liked it or not. ‘At the end of the evening, the Deputy Chief Whip whispered in my ear that I “might care to make peace with the Prime Minister”. I did not. I was still seething at the injustice of  her attack.’ In sharp contrast, the book says that Lady Thatcher ‘flirted’ with political leaders such as Mitterrand and President Ronald Reagan. Baroness Shephard told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Mitterrand thought she was very attractive and there  was definitely an electric current –  a sexual spark – between them. ‘He was a renowned ladies’ man and regarded her as a challenge.’ Lady Thatcher’s Chief Whip, Lord Jopling, praises her ‘caring’ treatment of Tory MPs brought down in sex scandals. As . a barrister she had learnt that some men could not resist ‘feasting . with leopards’ and adulterous male MPs kicked out by their wives were . invited to join the Thatchers for Christmas lunch at Chequers.

Diplomat Sir Richard  Parsons, . former envoy to Spain, was ‘shocked by their distinctly satirical . attitude’ towards her.

Former aide Harvey Thomas recalls that Lady Thatcher wept uncontrollably when told of the  sinking of the Atlantic Conveyor in the Falklands War, which resulted  in the deaths of 12 British sailors. He says: ‘Margaret’s tears flowed for almost 40 minutes as she felt the burden of being, as she put it, “the first Prime Minister in decades to have to send young British soldiers to their death in conflict”.’ The Real Iron Lady is published by Biteback on March 24.","Margaret Thatcher's soup went cold while she ranted at John Major at dinner .

A father has admitted waterboarding four children - including his two sons - after claiming it was a learning experience for them. William Province, 42, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child and was given two years' probation. Province from Jefferson County, Montana, carried out the torture, which simulates drowning, on his nine and 12-year-old sons and two other children aged 13 and 15, according to court documents filed by prosecutors. William Province admitted waterboarding four children and was given two years' probation . His girlfriend at the time said he broke her wrist and some fingers on December 5 when she tried to stop him from punishing the children, court records said. She said Province straddled each boy with his hands over the child's face and mouth and dumped water on their faces to simulate drowning. The woman told investigators that the man described it as a learning experience for the boys. Waterboarding is an extreme form of torture which can result in oxygen deprivation to the brain and lungs. Prosecutors dropped felony charges that included making threats against public officials and others. In keeping with the plea agreement, District Judge James B. Wheelis sentenced the man to 180 days in jail for each charge, all suspended. That amounts to two years of probation, minus the 80 days he has already spent in custody, the Independent Record reported. Prosecutors said in court records that a witness had reported that the man had body armor, assault rifles and armor-piercing ammunition. Province was arrested as he landed at Helena Montana Airport after his then girlfriend reported him to police (file picture) Investigators found some ammunition and three rifles that may have belonged to Province. Authorities did not elaborate on what kinds of weapons specifically were found or suspected. Jefferson County Attorney Mathew Johnson said the plea deal was reached after a thorough review of the evidence. The agreement calls for deferring prosecution of the man on a charge of partner or family member assault. Police launched a hunt for Province after his girlfriend told them about the punishment. He was arrested when he exited a plane at Helena Airport on his return from travelling in Alaska.","William Province admitted using the technique on four boys as young as 9 .

He earns £120,000 a week, likes to drink vintage champagne straight from the bottle and once famously put hundreds of pounds on to a church collection plate. But Mario Balotelli's generosity doesn't appear to extend to his  mother, who works as a cleaner in an office only a few miles from her son's £3million mansion. While the Manchester City footballer glides around in his gleaming £120,000 Bentley Continental GT, Rose Barwuah has a more humble mode of transport – the number 11 bus. Five times a week, she catches the bus  to start her job as a cleaner at a car lease  firm on the outskirts of Cheadle, near  Manchester, earning little more than the minimum wage of £6.08  an hour. Home for her is a council home in Wythenshawe, the area used to  film Shameless, the Channel 4 comedy about feckless families living on benefits. The 46-year-old gave Balotelli up for adoption when he was two, and she and her husband were living in poverty in a tiny flat in Brescia, Italy. Last Christmas she moved to the Manchester area to be near her notoriously eccentric son, now 21. A source said: 'When she came over from Italy with her daughter, Rose, she said she wanted to be close to her son and didn't want any of the huge wealth or luxury he now enjoys. 'And it appears she is staying true to her word, living within her limited means and working hard. It is hard work she is doing but she previously worked in a market so she is pretty tough. 'Mario doesn't live very far away in Alderley Edge but it is a world away as far as lifestyle.' Tough start: Balotelli was put up for adoption when he was two, while Rose and her husband were living in poverty in a tiny flat in Brescia, Italy . He added: 'His mother keeps a low profile – she doesn't want Mario to feel pressured by her being in the UK. She just wants to rebuild her relationship with her son as any mother would want.' Balotelli has visited his mother on several occasions at her small semi-detached home, parking his white Bentley outside. She and her husband Thomas, who are originally from Ghana, were advised to give him up when he was two because he had a life-threatening intestinal condition made worse by their cramped living quarters. His mother later claimed the Balotelli family, who adopted Mario, had turned him against his birth relatives and she had to work hard to build a relationship with him. She recently said: 'Mario has been over to see me a few times. We don't see each other all the time as he has his life and I have mine.'","Balotelli was put up for adoption at the age of two .

He was swimming in the hotel pool with a group of children including his little brother, Christopher, and a cousin around 9.30pm when the incident occurred. Tragedy: Anthony Johnson, 13, was pulled from the pool at Disney's Pop Century Resort on Sunday and died this morning . Accident: The Missouri teenager died while on holiday with his father and step-mother at Disney World Orlando's Pop Century Resort . His father Kenneth and a fellow vacationer tried to save his life performing CPR at the poolside but he died at Florida Hospital Celebration Health this morning. There are no lifeguards on duty at the pool beyond 8pm but it remains open for use. A local broadcaster filmed children playing in the same pool tonight and said there are signs warning that pool users are unattended. Anthony's family back in Missouri paid tribute to him today as a much-loved boy with a passion for dirt-bikes and rap music. His mother Jessica Gilbreath thanked well-wishers on Facebook. It is understood that she flew to Orlando to be by his bedside last night. No lifeguards: Lifeguards leave the pool at 8pm but it remains open to holidaymakers, who are warned about the possible danger by signs around the pool area . Much-loved: Several family members paid tribute to Anthony last night who was a keen skateboarder and loved rap music. 'He touched a lot of people, he is loved by so many. And that makes us all family, thank you for loving him,' she wrote. It is believed Anthony was on holiday with his father and step-mother Chelsy Garcia and their three younger children when the incident occurred. A firefighter on vacation, William Cybulski, rushed to the family's aid at the resort when he heard the commotion and saw the unconscious child being pulled from the water. He performed CPR until the emergency services arrived. He told WKMG 6: 'You never want to see something like that on vacation or to any child in general no matter where you are.' Family holiday: Anthony Johnson was on the vacation to Disney World, Florida, with his father and step-mother when the accident occurred . His girlfriend Crystal Loschiavo told the channel that she helped get other upset children out of the pool, which is around 4ft deep, as her partner desperately tried to rescue the teen. 'I heard someone say, 'Call help, call help',' she said. 'The little brother was really upset he kept saying, 'This is my only brother, this is my only brother, I don't want anything to happen to him.' The Orange County Sheriff's Office confirmed Anthony had died this morning. A statement from Disney said: 'We are saddened by Anthony Johnson’s passing and our hearts go out to his family, friends and loved ones. We have reached out to his family to offer care and assistance during this difficult time.' The Pop Century Resort hotel is one of several Disney owned hotels located in the grounds of the theme park. It is made up of kid-friendly, brightly-colored buildings decorated with giant toys.","Anthony Johnson, 13, was playing in the Pop Century Resort pool around 9.30pm on Sunday with a group of children when he started drowning .

'Social pioneer': Maud Davies conducted a sociological study of her home village after returning from the London School of Economics . The scandalous observations of a social pioneer who documented the 'moral lapses' of neighbours in her rural village have been revealed a century after her death. Graduate Maud Davies, 29, described villagers in Corsley, Wiltshire, as 'rather rough' and a 'dirty lot' in her sociological study, prompting her mortified neighbours to try and block the paper from being published. Ms Davies' in-depth investigation includes details of everything from her neighbours' drinking habits to their personal hygiene, and notes how she considered reporting one couple over their 'dirty children'. Ms Davies, who is likely to have . been the first girl from the area to attend university, embarked on the . study of her village in 1905 after returning from the London School of . Economics. But her no-holds-barred report - in . which local children are described as 'rascals', 'slow', or 'lazy' - . caused outrage in Corsley. Villagers, . fearing their identity would be revealed and their secrets laid bare, . lobbied the parish council in a bid to have Ms Davies' paper withdrawn . before it was sent to be published. Now, . exactly 100 years after the sociologist's death, local historian John . Chandler has printed her forgotten paper for all to read. He . said: 'The trouble was that, although she did not name them . individually, they found it easy to identify who she was describing. 'Her . frank comments about their drinking habits and moral lapses did not go . down well. The parish council tried to suppress and have it withdrawn.' Ms Davies returned to Corsley in . 1905 to embark on an in-depth investigation into the daily lives of . ordinary villagers, and was allowed into homes to record every detail of . their day-to-day survival. In . one extract describing a market gardener and his wife she notes: 'Drank . a good deal of their profits, wife got so drunk she could hardly sit in . the cart.

'Seen one day in public at Frome . having glass of port - more than such people could afford,' wrote the . frank sociologist, who went on to investigate and expose British . prostitutes being trafficked to America and the West Indies. In . another extract she describes a labourer, his wife and four children: . 'Can't say much for them. Wife hard-working woman, but bad manager. 'Not much of it [debt]. A poor lot, drink too much and don't pay. Dirty lot. Inspector has been down on the once or twice - woman keeps house so dirty. 'Dirty children. Noted family. Have been on point of reporting parents to Officer of Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 'Yet children wouldn't be so bad with careful training. Attendance [at school] bad, they take turns to come.' Pioneer: The results of Ms Davies' groundbreaking study have now been published in paperback . Ms Davies divided more than 200 houses into six categories; family, probably income in money or kind, amount above or below primary poverty, general character, promptness in paying debts and thrift generally, school report. The resulting book, 'Life in an English Village', took Maud more than five years to complete and even includes an hourly census of the numbers and types of people in the village's six pubs over a period . Mr Chandler, from Stroud, stumbled across the book in the 1970s while running a library in Wiltshire. He said: 'Maud's book, though rare, was not completely suppressed, and has been valued and quoted by social historians for more than a century. 'Now there is a new edition of this fascinating document, edited by Dr Jane Howells and published as a paperback by Hobnob Press available for all to read.' Ms Davies asked households to . complete a questionnaire during the winter months from 1905 to 1906 to . form the basis of her study. She also sought reports 'as to the characteristics of the various households' and information on incomes. The . publication of the paperback comes 100 years after the sociologist's . tragic and untimely death, when she was found decapitated on a London . Underground line. Ms . Davies, then 37, had just returned from a sea voyage to the West Indies . and America investigating the 'white slave trade' which saw prostitutes . being trafficked from England.

With their pure white feathers and long, elegant necks, swans normally look the picture of grace and tranquility. But feathers flew when these birds began vying to build a nest for their mate's eggs. Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset is gearing up for the swan nesting season with 400 swans on site and another 200 expected to fly in during the next few months. You shall not pass! These two male swans ripped into each other in Dorset, as nesting season got under way . A duck looks pleased to be out of the action as the two swans fought and tangled their necks in the battle . Ouch! The birds become fiercely protective during nesting season, which lasts between March and May . And one bird was determined to mark his territory, chasing away any other swan that came within flapping distance. However, the aggressive male then came up against a competitor, and a violent fight ensued, with the pair kicking, beating the other with their wings, snapping their beaks and even attempting to push the other below the water. But eventually the initial bully was defeated, and peace returned to the Swannery. Between March and May swans construct a huge nest, in which the female swan - known as a pen - typically lays a clutch of between 3 and 7 eggs. Causing a splash: These male swans - known as Cobs - will fight to the death during the season, but in this case they stopped sparring when one admitted defeat . The Swannery in Dorset has more than 400 swans - and inevitably feathers will fly when the female swans lay their eggs . Take that! The swans were initially kept in Dorset by monks who would cook them for banquets - but now they are kept to breed (And occasionally squabble) During the breeding season the male swan - known as a Cob - becomes very territorial and aggressive to any intruders. This behaviour has been known to extend to swans fighting to the death. They will often threaten humans who venture too close to their nests, and deliver a warning call before attacking by beating their wings. The swans pictured show mute swans, which have long S-shaped neck, and an orange bill with black at the base of it. Recently the UK population has increased recently, perhaps due to better protection of this species. Giving chase: The Cobs will do anything to protect their eggs, and females usually lay between three and seven at a time . The two swans squared up to a match after one became too cocky in the Swannery and began attacking everyone . But eventually the bullying swan calmed down and accepted defeat after he got a taste of his own medicine . In wintry weather, some birds arrive from Europe into eastern England. The Swannery was established by Benedictine Monks who built a monastery at Abbotsbury during the 1040's. The monks farmed the swans to produce food for their lavish Dorset banquets. But St Peter's monastery was destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution and today it has become a popular family attraction. Located on the Dorset coast, the habitat is popular with film makers and has been used as a location for Harry Potter filming.","Feathers flew during the nesting season in Abbotsbury Swannery, Dorset .

Charged: Former PCSO Peter Bunyan is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, charged with abusing his position to have affairs with five women and having sex with them while on duty . A married PSCO confessed to sleeping with one woman up to 10 times while he was supposed to be on uniform foot patrol. Peter Bunyan, 40, admitted wasting police time, but insisted he had not neglected his duty because he kept his radio on. Father-of-two Bunyan is said to have conducted illicit affairs with five women he met on his beat with Devon and Cornwall police. He denies 12 charges of misconduct in a public office but conceded that he had been 'negligent' in failing to attend to his duty. Bunyan said that most of the affairs were carried out before, during or after his shift and had never got in the way of his duty. But he admitted at Taunton Crown Court to sleeping with one lover up to 10 times while he was supposed to be on daytime foot patrol in her neighbourhood. Bunyan described how his beat would take him past the address of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and he repeatedly called in to continue their affair. He told the jury: 'I tended to see her during the day time. I was on duty a lot of the time. 'I would have been in full uniform with my radio on, I was supposed to be on foot patrol. I was not taking advantage of my position, I don't feel I was doing that at all. 'I would not say I was abusing my position but I was not doing what I should have been doing. 'I admit was wasting police time and being negligent and not attending to my duty.' He claimed: 'I never turned my radio down, on the occasion when someone did call I would answer it and leave straight away. I would attend all calls when required. 'I accept that by being in the house I was failing to do my duty and not attending to my duties, but I always answered my radio. 'For most occasions I wouldn't have . had my radio on me because I was not in uniform and not on duty, it . would have been back at the station.' On trial: Police community support officer Peter Bunyan (pictured, left, outside court and, right, in his uniform) is accused of using highly sensitive police data to strike up affairs with vulnerable women while on duty . Bunyan agreed that over the course of . the affairs there were times he failed to correctly fill in police . notebooks and records and even days which were left blank. The police community support officer . is also accused of using the police database ‘as a dating agency’ to . have affairs with single mothers and domestic abuse victims while on . duty. The court heard that he used the . Criminal Information System to research his lovers - one up to 17 times - . and obtain their mobile phone records. Prosecutor Simon Burns told the Court yesterday: ‘If he was not in uniform or on duty, there would not be a trial. ‘But . if on duty or in his uniform he should have been at work but he was in . bed with somebody, he was not exercising his proper role as a police . officer. ‘You do not use the criminal intelligence system as a dating agency.’ But he told the court he had never . used the database to conduct 'welfare checks' on vulnerable women or . take numbers from the files and use them to start a relationship.

He added that if his searches were . related to women he was having affairs with he would immediately hand . them to a superior officer to handle. Bunyan admitted keeping a secret mobile phone at the station but denied any wrongdoing and being in . full uniform when conducting the affairs with all five women. He said on most occasions he visited them before or after work when he was casually dressed and his uniform was at his base. Mr Burns said Bunyan’s first affair was with a woman who . was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The woman previously . had reason to call the police following a dispute with someone.

The phone spontaneously combusted . during landing, ‘emitting a significant amount of dense smoke, . accompanied by a red glow’, the airline said. The fire was put out by a flight . attendant and the device, thought to be an iPhone4, given to air traffic . safety investigators for checks. No passengers or crew were harmed. iFlame: An iPhone began smoking after landing in Sydney, Australia. The fire was extinguished by a flight attendant . A picture released by Regional . Express, Australia’s largest independent regional airline, shows the . rear casing to be shattered in parts and scorched in others. Apple Australia says it is ‘looking forward to working with officials’. The cause has yet to be identified . but experts say that it may be due to the phone’s battery overheating or . to the device being a counterfeit model. Earlier this month, Apple recalled . first generation iPod Nano music players due to concerns about defective . batteries overheating. However, these devices were made in 2005 and . 2006 and so are much older than the exploding mobile phone. The drama began when the crew smelt . smoke in the cabin as a flight from Lismore in New South Wales landed in . Sydney on Friday evening. In a statement headed ‘mobile phone . self-combustion’, Regional Express said: ‘In accordance with company . standard safety procedures, the flight attendant carried out recovery . action immediately and the red glow was extinguished successfully. ‘All passengers and crew onboard were unharmed.’ Battery issues: Customers have had problems with iPhone batteries in the past, though none have been dangerous in nature . It added that it has reported the . incident to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Civil . Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The ATSB, which has listed the . incident as involving ‘smokes, fumes and fire’ will strip down the phone . to ‘try and understand what happened’. A CASA spokesman said that anecdotally he had never heard of a similar incident occurring during or after a flight. Mobile phone experts said it is possible the fire was caused by the phone’s battery overheating. Rechargeable lithium ion batteries . are widely used in mobile phones and laptops and, when shipped in large . numbers, have been linked to fires on planes in the past. Last year, the Federal Aviation . Administration in the U.S. issued a safety alert after a cargo plane . carrying a large shipment of the batteries went on fire and crashed near . Dubai, killing both pilots. It read: ‘Overheating has the . potential to create thermal runaway, a chain reaction leading to . self-heating and release of a battery’s stored energy. Flames on a plane: The phone ignited on Regional Express Airlines . ‘In a fire situation, the air temperature in a cargo compartment fire may be above the auto-ignition temperature of lithium. ‘For this reason, batteries that are . not involved in an initial fire may ignite and propagate, thus creating a . risk of a catastrophic event. ‘The existence and magnitude of the . risk will depend on such factors as the total number and type of . batteries on board an aircraft, the batteries’ proximity to one another, . and existing risk mitigation measures in place.’ There are also suggestions that the phone – or battery – may have been fake. Rob Temple, of Technology magazine . T3, said: ‘This is a very rare thing and so it makes you suspect it . might be a counterfeit battery. ‘When you think about the number of people who have iPhones and other smartphones, it doesn’t really happen.’ Chris Althaus, of the Australian . Mobile Telecommunications Association, told ABC News: ‘We urge people to . be very careful if they are buying batteries that they buy them from a . reputable dealer, look for products that are identified by the . manufacturer of your phone as compatible and be very aware of cheap . imitations.’ Many iPhone 4 users have already complained that their battery drains faster than expected.","Apple device now with air traffic safety investigators .

Controversy: Mark Kelly on Friday posted a photo of him filling out paperwork at a gun shop before buying two guns . The husband of former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords went to a Tucson gun store a week ago to buy a .45-caliber handgun and a military-style rifle the day before he appeared with his wife at the supermarket where she was wounded in a rampage two years ago. It didn't take long for the purchase to draw criticism from both sides of the gun debate. Mark Kelly said he bought the AR-15-style weapon to draw attention to the relative ease with which people can get the type of gun that the shooter used in the Newtown school and Colorado movie theater killings. Gun-rights advocates attacked him for being a hypocrite for buying the same gun that he has been lobbying Congress to ban. Kelly on Friday posted a photo on Facebook of him filling out paperwork at the gun shop. He also posted a statement on the gun debate in Washington that included his reasons for buying the rifle. The postings generated a flurry of nearly 4,000 comments about his motivations and the rules for purchasing such guns. Kelly said on Facebook that the background check from the purchases took only a matter of minutes to complete and that it's scary to think people can buy similar guns without background checks at gun shows or on the Internet. Kelly also said he intends to eventually hand in the rifle to Tucson police. The AR-15 is among 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a bill pending before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Kelly and Giffords started the Americans for Responsible Solutions gun control group amid the wave of mass shootings in recent months and have been touring the country in recent months in support of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Couple: Kelly is pictured with his wife, former Rep Gabrielle Giffords, left, during a return to the supermarket where she was wounded in a rampage two years ago in Tucson, Arizona . Point of sale: Kelly purchased the guns at Diamondback Police Supply in Tucson, Arizona . Giffords was among 13 people wounded in a January 2011 shooting as she met with constituents outside a Tucson supermarket. Six were killed. She resigned from Congress last year as she continues to recover from her injuries. Doug MacKinlay is the owner of Diamondback Police Supply, the shop where Kelly bought the guns. He said Kelly bought the rifle on March 5 but couldn't immediately take possession of it because the shop had bought it from a customer. As a result, the store is required by a Tucson ordinance to hold the gun for 20 days to give the city enough time to make sure the weapon wasn't used in a crime, MacKinlay said. Husband: Kelly hangs on to his wife as the two appeared at the Tucson supermarket where she was shot two years ago . Horrific scene: Kelly and Giffords appeared on Saturday at the same supermarket where she was shot on January 8, 2011 . MacKinlay said Kelly never revealed . to the store's staff why he was buying the guns and added that it would . be wrong to refuse to sell a gun to someone because of their personal . views. 'He is a U.S. citizen, an Arizona citizen and expressing his Second Amendment right to purchase and own a firearm,' MacKinlay said. Killer: Jared Lee Lougner gunned down six people when he opened fire at a Giffords event in Tucson. She was shot in the head but survived . Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the . National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA . board member, questioned the point that Kelly was trying to make in . buying the guns, saying a model citizen such as Kelly should be able to . buy a gun relatively quickly. He also noted that such a purchase could have been a good investment as the value of those types of weapon soars amid heightened demand from gun owners. 'If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt,' Rathner said. 'If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.' The advocacy group started by Giffords and Kelly had no immediate comment Tuesday on Kelly's gun buys. But the group released a statement from Kelly on the Senate Judiciary Committee's approval Tuesday of a proposal to expand federal firearms background checks to nearly all gun purchases. Kelly said the 10-8 vote was a huge step in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and mentally ill people. Kelly's statement didn't address the controversy over his own gun buys. Kelly, a former astronaut who plans to keep the handgun, told CNN on Monday that it was important for him to have firsthand information on the ease of buying guns such as the AR-15 and that he looks forward to buying a firearm at a gun show in the future. Kelly and Giffords have long been supporters of gun rights and owned handguns themselves.

Terminated: Gresham Elementary School Principal Tom Klansnic claims he is losing his job of 10 years because of his sexual orientation . A beloved elementary school principal in Oregon claims he's being forced from the job after coming out as gay sparking anger among parents but no comment from his school district. Tom Klansnic has worked as principal of North Gresham Elementary School for the last 10 years but this year will be his last according to a vote by the school board last week without a reason for his abrupt termination cited. During his seventh year as principal in 2010, Mr Klansnic and his wife divorced with him soon after revealing to family and friends that he is gay. It's after that admission, his attorney Judy Snyder says, that his supervisors treatment toward him dramatically changed. ‘He's . been a very successful principal and he's continued to be a very . successful principal even under close scrutiny of the last two years,’ Ms Snyder told KOIN. Before that, the suburban Portland district had twice renewed his contract without performance complaints, said Ms Snyder. 'He's . had a great deal of difficulty getting specifics as to what he has . failed to do to meet performance expectations,' she said. Officials of the Gresham Barlow School District said they couldn't comment because it's a personnel matter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Issues: The suburban Portland school district had twice renewed the principal's contract without performance complaints his lawyer claims and now refuses to share any new ones . 'I think it is unfortunate,' parent Denise McCloud told the Associated Press on Thursday during a public vote by the school board that reaffirmed his termination. 'I don't see how anyone's sexual orientation has anything to do with the job that they do.' Capri Parker, president of the school's parent-teacher group also agrees saying that nothing in his job performance which she has access to would suggest an issue. 'He is a fabulous principal. My kids have loved him... I have seen everything he has done and built at this school,' she told the Oregonian. Support: Mr Klanscnic's supporters have since created a Facebook page, pictured, and a Change.org petition, both receiving more than 400 supporters . She believes Mr Klansnic's belief of being terminated because of his sexual orientation is credible. Last spring the school board voted not to extend his three-year contract. On Thursday the board reaffirmed that decision in a public vote that was taken without public discussion. Standing up: Two boys wear shirts in support of Mr Klansnic with many others having worn pink anti-bullying T-shirts to the final vote by the school board last week . Without Mr Klansnic’s supporters’ voices permitted on the floor, they instead showed their support by showing up to the vote in pink T-shirts from an anti-bullying campaign held earlier in the day at the school. It was a platform the principal himself had initiated. As of Wednesday morning a Change.org petition to save Mr Klansnic job had received more than 444 signatures. The page appears covered with comments in support of Mr Klansnic, many sharing their personal experience with him. 'Tom is a top notch professional. He loves and is loved by his students.

It is a . terrible decision that the GBSD is making in not extending his contract.' Ms Snyder says the school board has been notified that Mr Klansnic is considering a discrimination suit that includes working in a hostile work environment and retaliation. Mr Klansnic was not at the meeting on Thursday but in a text message to the Associated Press said that being principal was a dream job. 'The teachers, kids, and parents at NORTH GRESHAM GRADE SCHOOL are an awesome group of people,' it read. He says that after his 24th year in education he plans to continue working in the field even after his planned dismissal this spring.

Sir Michael Caine is in mourning after the death of his younger brother who starred alongside him in hit films such as The Italian Job. Stanley Micklewhite, who played Coco in the hit 1969 film, was 77 when he passed away in January. The actor and writer also joined his older sibling on screen in Billion Dollar Brain in 1967 and Play Dirty in 1968. Despite being devastated by his brother's death, Sir Michael did not attend Stanley's funeral as he was so concerned that it would turn into a circus.

A case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault will be reviewed at the top levels of the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a letter released on Monday. But it seems unlikely that the ruling would be changed. Hagel said that under military law, neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to reverse Lt Gen Craig Franklin's decision to overturn the November conviction against Lt Col James Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy. Second look: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says he will reexamine a case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault . Reversal: Lt Gen Craig Franklin (left) made the decision to overturn the sexual assault conviction against Lt Col James Wilkerson, right, a former inspector general . Hagel's letter is dated March 7 and was sent to Sen Barbara Boxer, D-California, who released it publicly. The Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday on sexual assaults in the military and the Wilkerson case is expected to be a major topic of discussion. Boxer and Sen Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, wrote to Hagel last week asking him to look into the case. They called Franklin's decision to overturn the jury verdict 'a travesty of justice.' Franklin is commander of the 3rd Air Force at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Sen Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, told Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Gen Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, in a March 5 letter that Franklin's decision 'shows ignorance, at best, and malfeasance, at worst.' Advocates: Sen Barbara Boxer, left, released the letter from Hagel on Monday, while Sen Claire McCaskill, right, has told Air Force officials that Franklin's decision 'shows ignorance, at best' Franklin's decision undermines efforts by the Air Force and the other military branches 'to erase a culture that has often turned a blind eye on sexual assault,' McCaskill added. Shaheen and McCaskill are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Air Force has been grappling for months with the fallout over a sex scandal at its training headquarters in Texas. Dozens of young female recruits and airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped them. During January testimony before a House committee, Welsh likened sexual assault in the Air Force's ranks to a cancer and vowed to tackle the problem by screening personnel more carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that can lead to misconduct. But Welsh also acknowledged that the Air Force recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last year even as it worked to curb misconduct. The preliminary figures for 2012 show there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, according to Welsh. Wilkerson is a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy before he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a conviction that was later overturned . That would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. The 2012 figures are being audited and will be included in a report the Defense Department will submit to Congress next month. In his letter to Boxer, Hagel refers to Franklin as the 'convening authority,' a term for a commander who is responsible for establishing a court-martial. The Uniform Code of Military Justice gives a convening authority the 'sole discretion' to reduce or set aside guilty verdicts and sentences, or to reverse a jury's verdict. Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. The incident involved a civilian employee. Wilkerson was sentenced to a year in prison and dismissal from the service. Time for a change: Rep Jackie Speier is looking to propose legislation that would strip commanders of authority to block decisions made by courts-martial . But Franklin exercised his discretion and reviewed the case over a three-week period and concluded 'that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt,' Hagel wrote. Although convening authorities are not required to provide reasons for their decisions, Hagel said he has directed the Pentagon's general counsel and the Air Force secretary to examine Franklin's decision 'to determine how the factual basis for the action can be made more transparent.' Hagel also said the Wilkerson case raises the question of whether it is necessary or appropriate 'to place the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to review the findings and sentence of a court-martial,' particularly when military law allows for a rigorous appeal process. He said he is ordering the Air Force and other military services to examine that question and determine if changes to military law are necessary. Boxer said in a statement that she is encouraged by Hagel's response. 'I believe that we should end the ability of senior commanders to unilaterally overturn a decision or sentence by a military court and from the tenor of his letter, I am hopeful that Secretary Hagel will reach the same conclusion,' Boxer said. Rep Jackie Speier, D-California, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said she is planning to introduce legislation on Tuesday that would strip commanders of the authority to overturn decision or lessen sentences made by courts-martial. Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School, credited Speier for pushing for change, but warned that it could take months to get a bill through Congress. Among the thorny issues to be resolved are what, if any, role commanders should have in the administration of military justice and how current law should be adjusted to reflect a shift, he said. 'No one should be under any illusions that it can be done overnight,' Fidell said.","Hagel responded to letter from Sen Barbara Boxer, asking him to take another look at sexual assault case .

Global demand for luxury British brands including Jimmy Choo and Burberry could help drag the UK out of the economic gloom, Vince Cable claimed today. The Business Secretary plans to cash in on a shopping boom in China, Brazil and India to promote the cream of British fashion and design, including Aspinal of London, Hackett London and Turnbull and Asser. While the UK high street is in the doldrums, exports of some of the country’s biggest brands are soaring. By 2015 global demand for luxury goods is expected to soar by almost 60 per cent. Going global: Romeo Beckham features in the Spring Summer 2013 campaign for Burberry, one of the British brands which ministers think can cash in on global demand for luxury goods . Mr Cable wants to make it easier for firms to sell their clothes and accessories online, targeting ‘the rapidly growing number of middle class consumers in priority markets where British luxury brands are highly prized’. Ministers have pinpointed Mumbai, Beijing, Istanbul, St Petersburg, Shanghai, Mexico City, Sao Paulo and Warsaw as key markets. A two-year GREAT Britain campaign will be launched in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, India, Russia and Mexico. The Shanghai F1 Grand Prix next month . will see the start of a ‘British Luxury in China’ campaign, which will . also tour 11 other Chinese cities in the next year. Similar weeks are planned in Mumbai and Dubai, as well as in Milan, New York, Paris and London. Jimmy Choo shoes, another global success story singled out by Business Secretary Vince Cable, are a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge . The retail sector in the UK already employs more than 3million people and generates more than £300billion every year. Britain is also among the world leaders in internet shopping, with 228,000 online retailers already exporting more than the rest of Europe’s e-retailers put together. Mr Cable believes more can be done to promote the likes of Jimmy Choo, Asprey and Turnbull and Asser in key markets, which will potentially mean more jobs in the UK. Speaking at an event in London today, Mr Cable said: ‘The Government is banging the drum for these great British companies across the globe. ‘Our campaign to promote these brands from China to Brazil will help companies to export and manufacture more, creating jobs across the UK.’ Ministers want to build on the UK's reputation as a centre for fashion. Here Andy Murray (left) sits alongside his girlfriend Kim Sears and Vogue Editor Anna Wintour while they watch the Burberry Prorsum Womenswear catwalk show at last year's London Fashion Week . Best of British: Hotel Chocolat is looking to expand its sales in the US and Europe while accessories brand Aspinal of London sought to capture the patriotic mood with its 'Cool Britannia' Brit range . Government agency, UK Trade and Investment, is also planning to ‘redouble its efforts’ in the traditional luxury brand markets. Ministers want to harness the growing middles classes in emerging markets, and persuade them to buy British before other brands dominate. Other well-known firms to have signed up include Marks & Spencer, TM Lewin, Boots, Tesco, The White Company and Waitrose. Mr Cable added: ‘The retail sector adds much to London’s distinctive edge, drawing in millions of tourists every year. ‘It’s vital that we get out and sell the message that capital is open for business and welcomes international investment,’ he said as he launched the UK Retail Industry International Action Plan at Retail Week Live in London. London is the shopping capital of the world, and ministers hope the ad campaign will persuade more overseas shoppers to buy British . In a speech at Retail Week Live, Business Secretary Vince Cable vowed to bang the drum for British brands around the world . Chocolate store Hotel Chocolat is among those planning to expand its UK manufacturing base to grow its base in the US and Europe while Waitrose now has products in 35 countries, including new markets such as Chile, Lebanon and Gibraltar. Bosideng, one of China’s leading clothing, recently opened a £35million store in central London. With more than 11,000 shops worldwide, it now has a dedicated London collection, designed by its UK design team and mostly made in the UK and Europe.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:55 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 13 March 2013 . Samantha Lewthwaite at school. Lewthwaite was plotting an armed rescue effort to free accomplice Jermaine Grant from court custody in Kenya, a state lawyer claimed today . The fugitive ‘white widow’ of a 7/7 London bomber was plotting a violent attack to spring her British accomplice out of a prison, it emerged yesterday. Kenyan police believe Muslim-convert Samantha Lewthwaite masterminded a scheme to break Jermaine Grant out of jail before a court appearance yesterday. Prosecutors said two men, who were arrested with grenades and bullet proof vests, later confessed to the mission to free Grant. As a result, the trial, at which six British anti-terror officers were due to testify, will be moved to ‘safe’ court inside the grounds of a high security jail. Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is being hunted by Kenyan police after they foiled a plan to blow up Western hotels in Mombasa in 2011. Her co-accused, London-born Grant, 30, was arrested, while Lewthwaite fled with her three children. It is thought she could be being sheltered in Somalia by Al Shabaab, the East African arm of Al Qaeda. Lewthwaite was seven months pregnant when her husband Jermaine Lindsay blew up a Piccadilly Line train in 2005, killing 26. British security services have so far failed to explain how she slipped off the radar, travelled to East Africa on a stolen passport, and became, as police believe, an integral member of Al Shabaab. Details of the alleged escape plot emerged . today as Grant, from Newham, east London, appeared to face a string of . terror charges before a magistrate in the port city of Mombasa. He was working with Lewthwaite, who is also in hiding, to free Grant as he was being brought there from prison, Mr Ondari said. Mr Ondari urged the judge to move Grant's trial to a secure court inside the grounds of a high security prison amid security concerns. Kenyan prosecutor Jacob Ondari urged the judge to move Grant's trial to a secure court inside the grounds of a high security prison amid security concerns . He said: 'I pray that this case be moved to Shanzu courts within the prison premises for the sake of the court's security. 'There are intelligence reports indicating that there are plans to rescue the first accused from the prison.' Mr Ondari added that one man allegedly linked to the operation was recently arrested in Mombasa with a grenade, and another was stopped crossing into Kenya from Tanzania with bullet-proof vests and face masks. The Telegraph reports both indicated they were in Kenya to help free Grant, he said. Grant and Manswab, a Kenyan, were . arrested in Mombasa in December 2011. Chemicals found in their home were . identical to the ingredients Lindsay used in the 7/7 attacks - killing . 26 and himself. The Telegraph reports Mr Ondari said that both men claimed they were acting under the direction of Lewthwaite. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Ondari said police believed Lewthwaite had been actively involved in the alleged plot to free Grant. Jermaine Grant appears before the Law Court in Mombasa, Kenya today. Details of the alleged plot emerged today as Grant, from Newham, east London, appeared to face a string of terror charges before a magistrate . He said: 'There is evidence that associates of the first accused masterminded a plot to free him from custody. 'We believe the group secured weapons and planned a violent attack on the court or on vehicles used to transport him from jail. 'It is believed that the fellow . British suspect Samantha Lewthwaite was among the group. We believe she . would have been involved in the rescue mission, which was foiled by . police.' The claims against . Lewthwaite came as police continued their hunt for the fugitive mother . of three, who is believed to have been on the run for 15 months. The British Muslim convert, from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is suspected of helping to fund terror groups in Kenya. Accused: Grant on trial for terror related charges in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2012 . She was questioned by police in December 2011 but managed to slip away and vanished with her children. Kenyan . police have since been hunting for Lewthwaite, who was married to the . Kings Cross bomber Lindsay, within the east African country but fear she . may have slipped across the border into neighbouring Tanzania. Mr . Ondari today said officers believed Lewthwaite remained in contact with . a close-knit group of bomb suspects who were accused of plotting . attacks around Mombasa. He added: 'There is evidence that Samantha Lewthwaite remains actively involved with the group. 'We do not know where she is, but believe she could be operating from either Kenya or from a border area of Tanzania.' Police provided extra armed security at court today as Grant appeared in the dock alongside his alleged accomplices. The British suspect was arrested in December 2011 and has already been convicted of entering Kenya illegally. He is being held at the high security Shimo La Tewa near Mombasa and is facing charges of possessing explosives and plotting to launch a terror attack alongside fellow suspects Fuad Abubakar, Frank Ngala and Warda Breik Islam, 19, to whom Grant is believed to be married. Six British police officers were due to testify at the group's trial today before proceedings were postponed amid concern over security. Magistrate Joyce Gandani accepted the prosecution's plea for the case to be moved and ordered future hearings to take place at a court within the secure boundaries of the prison. The court heard detectives investigating the alleged plot had arrested two people, one of whom was detained at the Kenyan border in possession of bullet proof vests. Lewthwaite, the widow of the 7/7 Kings Cross bomber Germaine Lindsay . Grant's defence lawyer Mwita Chacha disputed the allegation that there had been a plot to free his client from jail. He said: 'We expect the state counsel to table some police statement in court to proof his assertion and we knew he will be coming up with theories to delay the trial because of lack of sufficient evidences. 'He is a very crafty man and I don't think what he said is right, I have never witness and only seen on a movie like CSI. 'This investigation is never ending, they will keep on delaying hoping something new will pop up.' The court heard the case would continue on May 15 and 16 in the absence of the second accused, who is believed to have skipped bail. Grant, the first named accused, is already serving a three year prison sentence after being convicted of passport offences. The Muslim convert is accused of being part of a gang who plotted bomb attacks on targets around Mombasa. The British suspect has also been charged separately over an incident in May 2008 when he allegedly attacked a police outpost near the border with Somalia. Grant denies all the charges against him and the trial continues.

A man who appeared before a Belgian court on an assault charge has been granted bail - on condition he doesn't drink any more Red Bull. The court in Bruges banned the 56-year-old slaughterhouse worker from consuming the energy drink after hearing how he went berserk with two knives, a starting pistol and a lead pipe after drinking cans of Red Bull. First he hammered on the door of his former boss- who refused to open - and then he had an accident while driving his car. The court was told he beat up the other driver and injured two policemen, who tried to arrest him. They were treated in hospital. The Red Bull fan spent two months in pre-trial custody before appearing in court to ask for bail. His lawyer, Mathieu Langerock said his client had forgotten to take his tranquillisers before he began downing cans of Red Bull. 'That was the reason why he became so worked up,' said Mr Langerock. 'I think the decision to ban him from this particular drink is remarkable because the judge didn't say anything about not consuming alcohol. 'The ban will remain in force until the trial.'

Sisters Maxine Preston and Dawn Larkin have been enjoying Mother's Day with their twin daughters - born on the same day three years apart and delivered by the same doctor. The mothers, who also have husbands called Paul and work as market traders, made headlines in 1995 when Mrs Larkin gave birth to Louise and Charlotte. The babies were born one week early at Solihull Hospital in Birmingham, but exactly three years after Mrs Preston gave birth to Nicky and Shelley at Birmingham Maternity Hospital. Happy Mother's Day: Sisters Maxine Preston (left) and Dawn Larkin (right) with their twin daughters (l-r) Shelly and Nicky, 21, and Louise and Charlotte, 18, who were born on the same day but exactly three years apart . Sheer coincidence: Maxine Preston (left) and Dawn Larkin (right) in 1995 with Shelly and Nicky, aged three, and newborn Louise and Charlotte, who this year celebrated their respective 21st and 18th birthdays together . By sheer coincidence, the four girls were delivered by the same consultant and have recently been celebrating their respective 21st and 18th birthdays together with a fancy dress party. Mrs Preston, 49, who lives in Northfield, Birmingham, with her 54-year-old husband said: 'Dawn and I are very close. 'I couldn't believe it when she told me she was having twins too. She'd only had a little boy the year before. 'Mine were three weeks early, her's were one week early - but both arrived on the same day. I was with Dawn at Solihull Hospital when she was having the twins. 'When the same consultant who delivered mine at Birmingham Maternity Hospital three years earlier walked into the room I nearly fainted. Dawn's twins were born at noon, mine at 9pm.' Mrs Larkin, 46, from Arley, north Warwickshire, said: 'After my girls were born, we both said, 'what an amazing party they will have for their 18th and 21st birthdays'. It has been arranged from birth.' We are family: Louise and Charlotte were delivered by the same consultant as cousins Shelly and Nicky . Their party was at Harborne Golf Club in Birmingham with 150 family and friends. Every year Shelley signs her cousins' birthday cards with the same joke: 'I hope you enjoy my birthday.' Mother-of-three Mrs Larkin said: 'Louise and Charlotte dressed up as the blokes in the 118 118 ad. 'When they walked in, everyone laughed as they are quite pretty girls but they were wearing wigs and moustaches. 'Nicky dressed up as a clown. She looked amazing. My mum bought a '21' shaped cake and an '18' shaped cake for the twins. They all had a fantastic time.' Louise and Charlotte are both studying A-levels at Cockshut Hill College in Garretts Green. Cousin Nicky is hoping to enroll on a sports course, while twin Shelley, who has mild special needs, is recovering from a recent bout of illness. Mrs Preston, who runs a pet supplies business with husband Paul, 48, and son Thomas, 19, added: 'Our girls are like chalk and cheese - and so are Nicky and Shelley. Generation game: Maxine Preston and Dawn Larkin with their twin daughters and mother Beryl Morris (middle) 'Louise is doing A levels in cookery, travel and tourism and business studies; Charlotte is studying maths, business studies and psychology. 'Louise is very outgoing and bubbly, while Charlotte is very studious and gets on with her work. 'We were surprised as you think twins will be similar. They don't even look like sisters - one is light-haired and the other dark-haired. 'I did not expect to have twins. When I went for my scan, it was a shock and my sister cried her eyes out. It is hard work when they are babies. It's amazing now. 'We are part of a big family yet Maxine and I are the only ones of this generation to have twins. They have been a big support for me.' The sisters were expecting a Mother's Day surprise from their 'thoughtful daughters', who were born on February 27, with Mrs Larkin hoping Lousie would put her baking skills to good use. But they added that they have been so busy organising the twins' birthday patry that they had not had time to think about it. Strange but true: Sisters Dawn Larkin and Maxine Preston also both have husbands called Paul . The sisters were planning to visit their own mother, Beryl Morris, who lives in Woodgate Valley, near Harborne, Birmingham. Mrs Larkin, Mrs Preston and their younger sister Lisa Hassall followed Mrs Morris into the market trade, with their mother, who has retired, setting up her business in 1972. Mrs Preston said: 'Our mum is absolutely wonderful and always helped us. My sisters and I are all market traders like she was. 'She's had quite a rough time lately - last year we lost our youngest sister, Tina who was 36. She had a rare cancer and had been ill for six of seven years.

Legal battle: Stella English, pictured left, is claiming constructive . dismissal by Sir Alan Sugar, pictured right. Her lawyer told the employment tribunal hearing the business tycoon can't admit when he's in the wrong . Philippa Jackson, representing Ms . English, said: 'He's not going to be seen to be backing down. 'He doesn't think much of employees running off and complaining - they should get on with it. 'What's more, he doesn't like it when people cross him. That became evident in the course of his evidence. 'He doesn't even attempt to countenance he might have committed a breach and done something wrong.' She said as Ms English was Lord Sugar's . apprentice, she had the right to expect 'a degree of mentoring' during . her time working for him - something she alleges was lacking. For there to be 'a relationship of trust . and confidence' between an employer and employee, both sides must . consider the job to be 'a genuine occupation', added Ms Jackson. Addressing the fact that Ms English did . not make any complaints about the way she claims to have been treated . before resigning, Ms Jackson said: 'She was clearly in a difficult . situation. She was overpaid. She's come into an established company in . very unusual circumstances. 'All that is relevant in understanding why she did not raise any issues.' Row: Lord Alan Sugar, pictured left, said . that his former employee, pictured right, was is a 'headline-grabber' deliberately 'courting' the media to try and ruin his reputation . Lord Sugar met his former employee Stella English (second from left, front row) on the series that was aired in 2010 - but now she is suing him . But Lord Sugars' representative Seamus Sweeney argued Ms English was 'courting' the media to ruin the tycoon's reputation and compared her to the wife of Chris Huhne. He said: 'The claimant has, in the . eyes of Lord Sugar, deliberately courted the media with a view of . damaging his reputation.' He told how Ms English had 'sold her . story' to the press several times and accused her of being a 'headline-grabber', deliberately sensationalising aspects of her . evidence. Referring to yesterday's sentencing of . former Lib Dem cabinet member Chris Huhne, Mr Sweeney said Lord Justice . Sweeney - who is no relation to him - described how Vicky Pryce using . the media as a weapon. He told the tribunal the same was true . of Ms English, adding: 'Using the media, in this case, was a weapon of . choice... It was a first weapon of choice. 'On the contrary, Lord Sugar has maintained his position, his dignity, until he comes here. 'He can be forgiven in these circumstances for reacting passionately in his cross-examination because he feels wronged.' The hearing has finished and the tribunal will make its decision within a month. If there is to be a remedy hearing, depending on the verdict, it will take place on April 22. Lord Sugar did not comment as he left the hearing in his Rolls- Royce, which has a personalised number plate.

And with stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle MacPherson crediting acupuncture with their healthy physique, Sophie Dahl, Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue preaching the benefits of green tea and Simon Cowell extolling the virtues of natural diet pills, the allure of the diet aid is a powerful one. But according to a new study, these complementary medicines could have no absolutely no effect as weight loss aids - and could in fact be causing more harm than good. Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle Macpherson credit regular acupuncture with helping keep them red carpet ready . The Times reports that a study by the University of Exeter . into natural diet aids has found that there is no evidence that natural . diet remedies work . to help with weight loss. Edzard Ernst, Professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, went as far as to call them 'bogus', saying that while natural remedies have a better image than diet pills, his extensive research has found no evidence that they work. In his latest study, published in the Journal of Dietary supplements Profesor Ernst reviewed control trials which reported a positive effect on weight loss of African Bush Mango, or Irvingia gabonensis, which is found in many natural diet products. Although all three studies claimed the African Bush Mango was more effective than a placebo, Professor Ernst found their methodology was flawed and the supplement could not be recommended as a weight loss aid. He said: 'Over the years we have looked into a lot of treatments and there is not a single one I recommend.'

He says: ‘They are easy victims of the . irresponsible promises that are being made on the internet and . elsewhere.' Ernst's own complex theory on weight loss? 'Eat less and do more exercise.'

The mother on trial for the murder of her twin newborns told police they drowned in the toilet after she gave birth to them, before eventually breaking down and admitting she smothered them to stop them from crying. Lindsey Lowe, 26, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, was taken into custody after her father discovered one of the baby's tiny bodies in the laundry basket of her bedroom. He called 911 and police picked Lindsey up at the dental office where she worked. It was only when she was being questioned that authorities found out there were in fact two babies, after Lindsey eventually revealed this to the officer in charge of questioning her. Scroll down for 'confession' video . Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today . Testimony: Detective Steve Malach takes to the witness stand at the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe today . The jury today were shown a tape of the lengthy interview on the third day of the murder trial. Lowe is accused of keeping her . pregnancy a secret, giving birth on the toilet, smothering the twin boys . to death and hiding their bodies in the laundry basket at her parent's . affluent home in September 2011. During the first half of the . interview, Lowe explained briefly what happened to Detective Steve Malach, . telling him she had been having back pain and shooting pains the day of . the births and it was only when she went to the toilet later - because . she thought she was having a 'bowel movement' - that she realized she was . giving birth. She explained that the first baby fell . into the toilet and she left him there and did not check on him, yet . said she was sure he was dead. She said the same thing happened to the . second baby. The detective pressed her on how much . the babies were under water and if they had been crying. It was only . when he told her that an autopsy would reveal exactly how the babies . died did she breakdown and confess to smothering them. Sobbing uncontrollably, Lowe said she . did not want her 'conservative Christian parents' hearing the newborns . cry so she put her hand over the first baby's mouth for 'a few minutes' until he stopped crying. She did the same with his twin brother, the . court heard. When the officer asked her, 'You knew you killed the babies?' She replied, 'Yes.' Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were revealed to the jury . Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville . Dumped: The court was shown grizzly pictures of the laundry basket in which the dead newborns had been discarded by Lowe after she gave birth to them and smothered them . Blood: The bathroom were Lowe gave birth to her twins while she was on the toilet and then smothered them to stifle their screams . Grizzly discovery: Police find the tiny bodies of the newborn twin boys . Though she told the detective at the very beginning of the interview the father was her fiance, she later admitted she had had an affair with a man called Jeremy Smith and that he was likely the father. Though she never took a pregnancy test to confirm what she expected, Lowe said she gained weight, her periods had stopped and she began lactating towards the end of the gestation period. When questioned about why she didn't tell anyone or seek any help, she revealed she was too shocked and too scared of what both her fiance might think and her parents, who she described as 'very conservative, Christian people'. Lowe admits to the detective that she never checked on the babies after she dumped their bodies in the laundry and didn't even look at what their sex was. Yesterday, two police officers choked . up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the . father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from , called 911 after making the grizzly . discovery. Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand . on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe . and pulling back a bloody towel. He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.' Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing. The . newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the . two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, . about 20 miles northeast of Nashville. The . second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready . to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he . discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the . basket. Fentress held the . body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover . the second one – who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first . baby back in the basket beside his brother. Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday. Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty . She had told police she gave birth to . the twin boys in the bathroom of the home on the night of September 12, . 2011, and smothered them so that her parents would not hear their cries. Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth. Defense attorney John Pellegrin told . jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth . where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures. The night before the births, one of . her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, . he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant. Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live. 'Officers, during their search of the . house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District . Attorney Blanton said during opening statements. 'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.' They pointed out that Lowe had been . engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when . she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins. 'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the . births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her . life,' Blanton said in opening statements. But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple. Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death . Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty . Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied . 'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said. He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom. 'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury. Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense. In earlier hearings, Lowe's father . Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in . with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in . 2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor. The final witness Tuesday was Detective Steve Malach, who interviewed Lowe after the babies were discovered. Upset: Lindsey Lowe cries as she listens to testimony while she sits with her attorney, John Pellegrin . He testified how Lowe told him she gave birth and then put the babies in a laundry basket. When he asked if she ever checked on them, 'she said she couldn't face it,' he told jurors. If convicted of first-degree murder, . Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said . previously they would not seek the death penalty. Testimony continues Wednesday.","Lindsey Lowe, now 26, smothered her newborn twins after giving birth in her parents' bathroom .

Millions of families face a double-digit increase in the cost of gas  and electricity after EDF became  the latest energy supplier to announce a price hike. The firm – which has 5.5million  customers and is the country’s biggest electricity supplier – is raising tariffs by an average 10.8 per cent. It means the annual bill for a dual fuel customer who pays via monthly direct debit will be £1,252 – an increase of £123. Heating up: EDF Energy is pushing up gas and electricity bills for customers by nearly 11 per cent from December 7. It is the fifth of the 'big six' energy firms to impose a price rise this winter. EDF . is the fifth of the ‘big six’ energy firms to raise tariffs in the last . few weeks. The sixth, E.ON, is expected to follow suit in January. The companies have blamed Government policies for the rise in prices, . including requirements to pay for a switch to green and nuclear energy, . and funding the insulation of cold homes. Earlier this month, David Cameron told suppliers he intends to bring  in . legislation forcing them to offer customers the cheapest tariff. Currently, 75 per cent of households are on their supplier’s most . expensive scheme, with 60 per cent admitting to having never switched . firms in the past 15 years. Downing Street yesterday confirmed the law will be changed to force firms to charge a fair price. Audrey Gallacher, energy expert at customer group Consumer Focus, said: . ‘Another price rise, hot on  the heels of those we’ve already seen, will . again feed into consumer concerns on pack behaviour and whether price . changes are driven by real supply and demand issues.’ EDF's 10.8 per cent hike, . which will affect three million customers from December 7, is due to rising cost of distribution, efficiency, . buying energy and wholesale prices. EDF director Martin Lawrence said: 'We know that customers will not welcome this news and do not want to see prices going up. 'Our . new prices will however be cheaper on average than those of all the . other major suppliers which have announced standard price rises so far . this autumn.' Rising bills: EDF's price rise, announced ahead of winter, will add £120 per year to household bills, affecting 3 million customers . Mr Lawrence also . added that it is the first supplier to automatically switch vulnerable . customers, for example those receiving pension credits, to its cheapest tariff, . benefitting 85,000 customers. A nine per cent . rise from Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) started earlier this month, . while price increases from Scottish Power, British Gas and nPower will hit . customer bills before the end of the year. The EDF hike . is the biggest percentage rise, so far, this year – however, a spokesman said . that its average price is still cheapest average tariff, even after the increase. It brings an EDF . annual duel fuel direct debit bill to an average of £1,251, just £7 cheaper . than its nearest rival nPower which will charge customers £1,258 annually, after . its rise. Audrey Gallacher, from Consumer Focus, said: 'The latest energy price rise will leave even more customers worried about their energy bills. 'EDF Energy’s tariffs will still be slightly cheaper on average than other suppliers who have increased their prices – but this will be little comfort to those seeing a double-digit percentage rise on their bills.' The . news will come as a blow to millions of households who have little . escape from energy price rises this winter just as the cold weather . hits. Ann . Robinson, from uSwitch.com, said: 'This is the final hammer blow for . energy bills this side of Christmas. Consumers now face a winter of . rationing their energy usage - many will be forced to turned their . heating down or off for fear of the impact of these hikes.' How much? How EDF Energy compares in the average duel fuel bill price league after the hike . Mark Todd, from Energyhelpline.com, said: 'The . energy price rise domino effect is in full swing, and we expect E.ON to . make their announcement soon for price increases in the New Year.' EDF Energy . said that the rise is due to sharp increases in its costs since the start of the . year, with distribution charges going up by 9 per cent and energy efficiency . schemes increasing by more than 50 per cent. A spokesman . also said that the cost of buying energy had gone up by 4 per cent, a fee which . makes up around 50 per cent of the typical gas and electricity bill. Gary Hornby, an energy analyst at Inenco, said the current price rises were just the start, with further increases in bills expected next year. He said: 'Wholesale gas and power prices have risen by approximately 8 per cent since the lows seen in June, and investment in cleaner forms of generation is still costly and these increases were always going to be passed onto the consumer. 'These rises come at a time when household budgets are already stretched and, despite the positive GDP figures released yesterday, the UK economy continues to struggle. 'In addition, more gas will be needed as a fuel for power generation from 2013 onwards with older, more pollutant coal power stations coming offline due to emission regulations. 'As gas burn is much more expensive than coal burn currently, the recent spate of price rises could be in anticipation of higher wholesale prices in the future.'","EDF's announced price rise will add £120 a year to household bills .

Antipsychotic drugs given to the elderly could triple the risk of potentially fatal strokes, The Alzheimer’s Society claims. The charity also suggests that the medication could double the risk of death and leave patients unable to walk or talk. Antipsychotics, which are prescribed . to elderly patients to treat symptoms such as agitation, psychosis, . anxiety, insomnia and depression, should only be given for a limited period. But they are often seen by care home staff as an easy way to calm dementia patients. Antipsychotic drugs given to the elderly could triple the risk of potentially fatal strokes . Previous research has suggested that at least 1,800 dementia sufferers die each year from the 'chemical cosh' drugs. Just . one in five of the 180,000 dementia patients prescribed the . anti-psychotic drugs benefit, meaning nearly 150,000 are given them . needlessly, the government-commissioned report found. Now, new research suggests that antipsychotics can raise the risk of a potentially fatal stroke. Researchers at the National Taiwan University claim that stroke risk is greatest in patients who are older or who have dementia. Writing in the journal Biological . Psychiatry, they found that the risk is also linked to the duration and dosage of . treatment. Patients who received high doses of antipsychotic treatment, . or who were treated for a short period of time, were at greater risk of . stroke. The . researchers believe this suggests the risk is highest in the . initial weeks of antipsychotic treatment and for those with a higher . average daily dose. In their study, the Taiwanese scientists focused on the wide range of brain mechanisms targeted by antipsychotic medications. Researchers at the National Taiwan University claim that the risk of stroke is sufficient that some guidelines discourage the prescription of antipsychotics to the elderly . ‘The . stroke risk profiles from this study suggest that it may be possible to . use antipsychotics more safely in the elderly,’ said Dr John Krystal, . Editor of Biological Psychiatry. The researchers recommended that doctors start antipsychotics at low dosages, closely monitoring . for side-effects in the initial treatment, particularly for individuals . who are older or who have dementia. An Alzheimer’s Society spokesperson . said: ‘Tens of thousands of people with dementia . are having their lives put at risk every day by being inappropriately . prescribed this “chemical cosh” which can double the risk of death, . treble the risk of stroke and can leave people unable to walk or talk. ‘Whatever the situation, . antipsychotics should only ever be used as a last resort. They should be . prescribed at low dosages and should be closely monitored. ‘Only by empowering staff with the . knowledge they need to understand dementia and the person behind the . condition can we ensure that the inappropriate prescribing of these . harmful is stamped out for good.’ Dr Clare Walton, Research Communication Officer from the Stroke Association, said: 'This research shows doctors need to be cautious about the dose and type of antipsychotics they prescribe, especially for older people or anyone at risk of stroke. Previous research suggested that at least 1,800 dementia sufferers die each year from the 'chemical cosh' drugs . 'If antipsychotics are being used, we recommend patients are closely monitored for the first few weeks when stroke risk seems to be highest.' Dr Simon Ridley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, added: 'This study provides yet more evidence highlighting the potential dangers of antipsychotics for people with dementia. 'Research funded by Alzheimer's Research UK revealed in 2009 that long-term use of these drugs increases the risk of death for people with dementia, and we have since seen positive steps to reduce their use. 'Where antipsychotics are prescribed for these people it's vital that their use is closely monitored. Symptoms such as agitation and aggression can be extremely difficult for doctors and carers to deal with, and research must continue into alternative treatments for these symptoms.'","The Alzheimer's Society claims antipsychotic drugs can triple the risk of strokes and double the risk of death .

Many city dwellers have resigned themselves to the fact that living in close proximity to pet owners means sharing the sidewalks with their four-legged friends. But in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, authorities are thinking about banning dogs altogether. The radical measure, if passed, could ban any canines from walking along a key 10-block stretch of Beaver Falls’ downtown business district. No dogs go downtown? Officials in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania are toying with the idea of banning dogs from a 10-block stretch of the downtown strip . The Beaver County Times reported that officials in Beaver Falls believe part of the problem is that larger dogs, including pit bulls and Rottweilers, sometimes left tied to parking meters by their owners. City Manager says some of the dogs are ‘as big as ponies.’ Another concern is simply that some owners don't clean up after their dogs. One elderly resident nearly tripped over a leashed dog as he tried to make his way down the sidewalk, said City Manager Steve Johnson. The city is still researching a possible ban and council doesn't expect to act on it until later in the year. While some residents applaud the move, others say the city should focus on drug crimes and prostitution in the city about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Revitalizing: Officials say that large dogs that are curbed downtown just congest the sidewalks . Checkered past: The downtown strip is battling image problems due to drug deals and prostitution . Many businesses along the stretch of downtown have complained that dogs along the strip are unsanitary, and prevent potential customers from strolling along the storefronts. But the paper notes that even if dogs were banned, the downtown section has a checkered past with drugs and prostitution. Resident Gary Davis told the Times that the whole endeavour is a ‘waste of time,’ adding that having officers patrolling the streets would be much more effective. As it stands, the city is still looking into the parameters on a possible ban, and won’t vote on any until later this fall.","City officials in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania eying possibility of banning dogs on downtown strip .

The daughter of a former professor and south Mississippian who 'despised phonies' loved bacon, women and his 'over-sized old man remote' has penned a touching and honest tribute to her father which has captured the imagination of thousands. Amanda Lewis, an attorney from Dallas, decided to eschew formality when it came to remembering her father Harry Weathersby Stamps in her obituary for the Sun Herald. And she was right. Since it appeared yesterday it has been read by thousands and spread around the world with some readers calling the light-hearted tribute 'the best obit ever'. Special bond: Amanda Lewis, pictured with her father Harry Stamps, wrote a heart-warming obituary of him following his death on Saturday . 'Foodie': Thousands have read Amanda Lewis' tribute to her father Harry Stamps which has spread online since it was published yesterday, pictured . Mr Stamps, a Korea war veteran and former government and sociology professor at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College died at home on Saturday, leaving his wife of 50 years, Ann Moore, two daughters and two grandsons. Lewis wrote the obituary on the journey to her parents home in Long Beach, Mississippi, with her English teacher sister, Alison, helping with the editing process. 'I kept thinking of things -- there are a lot of things I just couldn't put in there -- and I thought, 'Mama's not going to let me run that.' But she read it and said, 'That's him,'' she told the Sun Herald. 'He wouldn't know what going viral means. He would have thought that was a disease he contracted, which would have excited him to have another illness to lord over folks,' she joked in response to the tribute's overnight popularity. One typical paragraph of the obituary reads: 'He excelled at growing camellias, rebuilding houses after hurricanes, rocking, eradicating mole crickets from his front yard, composting pine needles, living within his means, outsmarting squirrels, never losing a game of competitive sickness, and reading any history book he could get his hands on.' 'Natty dresser': The obituary poked fun at Harry Stamps' refusal to let go go of this t-shirt. He and his wife Ann saw their Mississippi home damaged in Hurricane Katrina, pictured . 'He loved to use his over-sized 'old man' remote control, which thankfully survived Hurricane Katrina, to flip between watching The Barefoot Contessa and anything on The History Channel.' It adds: 'The women in his life were numerous. He particularly fancied smart women.' Speaking of his close relationship with his daughters, she adds: 'He taught them to fish, to select a quality hammer, to love nature, and to just be thankful. He took great pride in stocking their tool boxes. One of his regrets was not seeing his girl, Hillary Clinton, elected President.' On his 'natty dressing' she writes: 'Harry . took fashion cues from no one. His signature every day look was all . his: a plain pocketed T-shirt designed by the fashion house Fruit of the . Loom, his black-label elastic waist shorts worn above the navel and . sold exclusively at the Sam's on Highway 49, and a pair of old school . Wallabees (who can even remember where he got those?) that were always . paired with a grass-stained MSU baseball cap.' She also listed his loves and hates writing: 'He despised phonies, his 1969 Volvo (which he also loved), know-it-all Yankees, Southerners who used the words 'veranda' and 'porte cochere' to put on airs, eating grape leaves, Law and Order (all franchises), cats, and Martha Stewart. In reverse order. He particularly hated Day Light Saving Time, which he referred to as The Devil's Time. It is not lost on his family that he died the very day that he would have had to spring his clock forward. This can only be viewed as his final protest.' As an added tribute the family have requested well-wishers write to their senators to make a protest against Day Light Saving Time. Stamps was also a foodie - the obituary mentions his trademark dish - a bacon and tomato sandwich. 'Harry was locally sourcing his food years before chefs in California starting using cilantro and arugula (both of which he hated),' it says. Family man: A daughter's touching remembrance of her father has captured the imagination of thousands. Amanda Lewis is pictured here as a child with beloved father Harry Stamps . Food-lover: A young Harry Stamps leisurely mans the BBQ. He was remembered for his love of good food . 'As a point of pride, he purported to remember every meal he had eaten in his 80 years of life. He had a life-long love affair with deviled eggs, Lane cakes, boiled peanuts, Vienna [Vi-e-na] sausages on saltines, his homemade canned fig preserves, pork chops, turnip greens, and buttermilk served in martini glasses garnished with cornbread. 'It's hard to capture him in just one story,' Lewis told the local newspaper. 'For all of us, he was like this.' 'After he was diagnosed with diabetes, he told me, 'Life's not worth living if I can't have butter on my sweet potatoes.' That pretty much summed up his point of view on things.' 'Probably the best compliment I've gotten is that at least six people asked if he wrote it,' she added. One such compliment came from friend Wayne Catlett who said it 'captured the essence of Harry'. 'He definitely was one of a kind,' he said. 'He always found humor in every situation. It was a great way to cope with life.

"He said one household was costing the public purse £600,000 a year . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:17 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 12 March 2013 . A mother gave her daughter three ecstasy tablets as a present for her 13th birthday, it emerged last night. The woman was reported to social services after handing over the Class A drugs as a special prize for becoming a teenager. It is understood the family, from Middlesbrough, are now being monitored by social workers – although the mother was not prosecuted. Tough ex-detective Ray Mallon, formerly known as RoboCop, has spoken out about problem families in Middlesbrough, where he leads the council . The  case was exposed by the town’s mayor, Ray Mallon, in a bid to highlight widespread social problems. Mr Mallon said it was just one example . of the terrible parenting he had encountered, and added that such . incidents led him to ‘despair’. Social problems blamed on bad parenting are placing a huge strain on council budgets, with many children being taken into care. One family with six children in care is costing Middlesbrough Council more than half a million pounds a year. He claimed he knew of one nother who gave her daughter three ecstasy tablets for her 13th birthday present . Mr Mallon, a former policeman who . earned  the nickname ‘Robocop’, said: ‘No one wants to take children . into care, but when we have parents whose own upbringing makes them feel . giving their children drugs is acceptable, we sometimes have little . choice.’ He said one household was costing the public purse £600,000 a year. Mr . Mallon said children should be targeted 'in the womb' to stop problems, . as he claimed that they were being let down by parents who abused . alcohol and drugs. Mr Mallon, who has been elected Middlesbrough's mayor three times, said there were 360 children in care in the town. He highlighted the case when speaking to BBC's Look North about hundreds of troubled families being supported on Teesside. He told the BBC as an ex-police officer, he often recognised the same family names getting involved in crime. He said  we should target children whilst they're in the womb 'because it's clear that you can work out by the parents which kids are likely to have problems.' The Government has set up the Troubled Families programme so authorities and their partners can help 120,000 households in England turn their lives around by 2015. The scheme will see councils receive funding if they tackle problems such as truancy, anti-social behaviour and youth crime. Mr Mallon was heralded by politicians in the late 1990s when he adopted a zero tolerance stance against crime while a detective superintendent with Cleveland Police. He was elected on an independent ticket in 2002, and will stand down in 2015. He has also said today that of the borough’s 23 wards 16 were socially deprived - one of the biggest challenges facing the town right now. He said for every 16 children taken into care it costs the council £1.2m.","Children should be 'targeted in the womb to stop problems', Ray Mallon said .

And soon they might be proved right – as books sold in good old-fashioned bookshops begin promising more material. Extra chapters will appear in copies bought from high street retailers that will be absent from ebooks or printed copies sold by online stores such as Amazon. Secret weapon: Joanne Harris fans who buy their copy of her latest book from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available anywhere else . The move is an attempt to end the dominance of the internet retailers – and bring shoppers back to the high street. Fans of Chocolat author Joanne Harris who buy her follow-up novel, Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available to those who snap up their copy at a reduced rate from Amazon or other web retailers. The book chain signed an exclusive deal with the popular writer in the hope it will encourage readers to turn their backs on internet stores and e-books and return to browsing the shelves at high street bookshops. The chapter is not essential to the plot of Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, but can be read either as an epilogue or the 'prologue to an as-yet-unwritten story', the author has said. Bonus material: Author Joanne Harris, left, has penned an extra chapter of her latest book (right) exclusively available to readers who buy their copy from Waterstone's . Internet giant Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year, racking up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter. It put the surge in sales down to boost from Kindle e-book sales, which were up a staggering 70 per cent. Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year in a clear indication of the continued mass migration of shoppers from the high street to the web. The web giant racked up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from £10bn in the same period of the previous year. Kindle e-book sales -up a whopping 70 per cent - were credited for the surge in profits. Overall sales were up by 22 per cent, driven by the popularity of the Kindle Fire. 'After five years, electronic books is a multibillion dollar category for us and growing fast,' Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time. The figures are in stark contrast to the picture on the high street, which is home to less than half the number of bookshops today as seven years ago due to book lovers deserting physical stores in favour of downloading e-books for Kindles and other tablets, or of ordering cut-price copies over the internet. That supermarket shoppers can add a bestselling paperback to their trolley for as little as £4 in Tesco or Asda has also contributed to the demise of the high street bookshop, where the same copy might cost twice as much. The partnership between Harris and Waterstone's is among a number of novel tactics being employed by traditional booksellers as they attempt to preserve their place on the beleagured British high street. Alexander McCall Smith, author of the smash hit No1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, recently teamed up with Foyles to produce an extra short story to accompany copies of his novel Trains And Lovers on sale in its stores, while acclaimed author Ian Rankin has also penned bookshop-only bonus material. Waterstone's also previously offered a limited edition of Claire Tomlinson's biography of Charles Dickens which included a map of London and other extra material. Fight back: Alexander McCall Smith wrote an extra short story for fans who buy his book Trains And Lovers from Foyles . Tom Tivnan, features editor at book industry magazine The Bookseller, said it was essential for bookshops to seek new and innovative ways of ensuring their survival. 'They have to work out what things they can do that online retailers can't,' he told the Independent, citing membership clubs, coffee shops, and creches as means of luring bookworms away from the internet and back into stores. 'Physical bookshops have to survive,' said Mr Tivnan. 'Authors and publishers really want to keep bookshops and libraries open.' Competition: More readers are choosing to download e-books, left, rather than buy copies from bookshops . Despite the backing of top authors . the traditional bookshop still has its work cut out when it comes to . winning back customers. The number of bookshops in the country now stands at less than 2,000. Seven years ago the figure was double that. The bookworms' mecca of Hay-on-Wye, home to one of the world's biggest literary festivals, has lost five of its 30 independent bookshops from 2011. The blow led to local booksellers including Derek Addyman, who runs three second-hand bookshops in the Welsh border town, to call for Kindles to be banned from last summer's festival. Mr Addyman branded the devices 'an enemy' that needed to be driven out. It is not just independent bookshops that have been wiped out by internet giants and the rise of the Kindle, the collapse of 40-year-old chain Borders was blamed on increasing pressure from cut-price books available online and in supermarkets. And bookshops' online competitors are not blind to the potential of exclusive offers for their customers, with many authors coming up with short stories that are available solely for e-readers to download.","Big name authors penning exclusive bonus material for bookshops .

They want the 'plain vanilla' products to protect customers from being ripped off, especially by misleading introductory interest rates. The products will be backed by an official kitemark to reassure people that a savings account or insurance deal 'does what it says on the tin'. Ministers want more easy-to-understand savings accounts to be offered by banks . The move is a victory for Money Mail's Get Britain Saving campaign, which has called on banks and building societies to end confusion and offer savers simpler, easy-access accounts. They will now introduce new and straightforward products including an easy-access savings account, a 30-day notice savings account, a regular savings account and fixed-term life insurance. The savings accounts will not offer bonus or introductory interest rates and all new and old savers will be paid the same rate, regardless of the length of time they hold the product. There has been increasing concern about customers being lured in with tantalising initial rates on saving products, not understanding that returns fall to almost nothing later on. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show £1trillion is invested in UK deposit accounts. Yet, according to the consumer group Save Our Savers, 40 per cent of this cash is in poorly paying products – some with interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent. The onus is on the saver to shop around and switch, allowing banks to make huge profits from those who fail to do so. Savers with some of banks are told about rates only once every 12 months and are not told when they fall, or when a bonus lapses. In many cases, the details are hard to find on the internet. The Government's plans will be outlined today following a review by Carol Sergeant, the former chief risk officer at Lloyds Banking Group. Sajid Javid, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'People need to be able to manage their everyday finances with confidence and ease. 'The products outlined in this report represent a milestone towards achieving this, and I am impressed with the way that such a diverse group of organisations has worked together to develop them. 'The challenge now is to ensure that the work that has gone into the Sergeant Review is transformed into tangible changes for consumers.' Miss Sergeant said: 'We have known for a long time that being able to manage your finances effectively leads to increased well-being and a better quality of life, at every given level of income. 'I hope the simple financial products initiative will make it easier for people to understand and compare the key financial products they need and make good choices with confidence. It is now really important to make the recommendations a reality.' British Bankers' Association chief executive Anthony Browne said: 'The development of a suite of simple financial products should help customers to save for a rainy day and to protect themselves against the unexpected.'","Products will be backed by an official kitemark to reassure people .

On course to become a world record breaker, 14-year-old Lee Norton can already stack and unstack cups faster than anyone else in Britain. Lee, from Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, is the national sport stacking champion, a speed game in which competitors build plastic cups in a pyramid formation and take them down as fast as they can. He has become an internet sensation, clocking up more than 500,000 hits on YouTube with his record attempts and tutorials. Lee is so keen to work for the world title that his parents have to make him cut down on practice so he can finish his homework. Scroll down to watch the record-breaking video . Record-breaking teenager: Lee Norton, 14, is Britain's champion at sport stacking, a speed game where competitors stack and unstack plastic cups . Cup champ: The Hertfordshire teenager says it is 'fun and addictive' and impresses all his school friends . Enthusiastic family: Lee is pictured with his father Martin, far left, mother Assumpta, left, and sister Kara, far right, at home in Waltham Cross . 'It's weird thinking you are the fastest in England for something,' he said. 'My friends at school find it amazing . that I have the UK record but they just treat me normally because I . don't always bring it up or anything.' Determined to stay ahead of the game, he often competes online against other teenagers across the world, as far away as Japan. His PE teacher at primary school introduced him to the sport when he was 11. Full of concentration: Lee begins demonstrating his unusual skill on his custom made table . Quick as a flash: His hands move so fast that they become a blur . He asked for a set of his own for Christmas and spent hours each day practicing, and the hard work paid off. Just two years later Lee was the UK record holder for the 3x3x3, 3x6x3 and cycle disciplines. Lee, whose record for the 3x3x3 is just 1.9 seconds, said: 'When you get a good time all of a sudden you get an urge to go faster and it just makes it more unique, a lot of fun and addictive.' The current world record for 3x3x3 is 1.5 seconds, held by American Chandler Miller. Lee is on 2.1 seconds for the  3x6x3 and 6.1 seconds for the cycle discipline. So he is aiming for the world record of 2.0 seconds for the   3x6x3 and 5.7 seconds for the cycle. To record the split-second times sport stackers need to use custom tables like Lee's, which record the moment their hands leave the surface and stops a timer when they have finished the move and returned to the start. Lee said the unusual sport is growing in popularity and estimated there are around one million stackers around the world. Hand-eye coordination: The P.E. teacher at Lee's school introduced him to the sport as a way of improving muscle tone and reactions . Aiming for the top: Having become British champion, Lee is hoping to become a world beater . Quick reactions: Lee has traveled to Germany and the U.S to compete on the international stage . He has competed in Germany and USA, usually accompanied by his supportive father Martin, 50, and mother Assumpta Norton, 50. They have spent hundreds of pounds so far to help him realise his dream. Martin said: 'To have a son who has got three British records in his sport is just amazing.' Lee's talent also comes in handy when older sister Kara, 18, is entertaining guests who find it 'absolutely amazing'. 'My friends love that he is a British champ - he's my little party trick now,' she said. Last year Lee and the rest of the British team took second place in the international team relay event ahead of 19 other countries. Sport stacking has grown at a steady pace since it was invented in the early 1980s. In the UK there are about 5,000 sport stacking clubs and last year it was included in the Amateur Athletic Union's Junior Olympic Games. Lee's next big challenge is securing . the Individual All-Around Grand Champion title at the 2013 World Sport . Stacking Championships in Orlando, Florida, in April. He rates his chances at about 50-50 - as all the world record holders are in his age division. 'I'm definitely hoping to get to the finals, though getting into the top three would be nice,' he said.

We thought we’d seen off the . second-wettest year on record – but now scientists have found that 2012 . has left a legacy of less nutritious vegetables and fruit. The heavy rain is being blamed for a reduced mineral content in a host of British crops. Vital natural chemicals such as nitrates and sulphites were washed away, leaving many fruits, cereals and vegetables depleted. Depleted: Heavy rain in 2012 is being blamed for reduced mineral content in British crops, with vital nutrients such as nitrates and sulphates washed away . The deluge ‘leeched’ crops of vital substances, according to one expert. Some wheat harvests were found to have a third less iron and zinc than average. A lack of sunshine last year has also led to some edible plants having reduced nutritional value. The . findings are particularly bad news for non-meat eaters, who cannot . easily get key nutrients such as iron, copper and zinc from other food . sources. Mike Gooding, a . professor of crop science and agronomy from Reading University, said . that nitrogen, which is crucial for plants to manufacture protein, is . present in the soil as soluble salts and can be washed away by heavy . rain. He said: ‘You . need nitrogen to help the plant absorb iron. So we would expect to see . less iron in last year’s harvest because of the wet weather. ‘Plants . can’t manufacture minerals, so if there are less of them in the soil, . it stands to reason that there will be less of them in the crop. ‘When . you get a lot of leeching because of heavy rain close to harvest, then . you will have a knock-on effect on the quality of the crop. ‘It is very obvious in cereals and the ensuing bread, and root crops like carrots, potatoes and parsnips.’ Prof Gooding also warned that fewer sunny days has resulted in less sugar and starch in our fruit, making it taste different. Delicious: But fruit and veg in Britain has been threatened by wet weather and a lack of sunny days causing less starch and sugar to be produced . Washout: Reading University's Mike Gooding said that nitrogen is present in the soil as soluble salts and can be washed away by heavy rain . But he said there is no need to consume more than the recommended five-a-day amount of fruit and veg. Prof . Gooding’s advice is to vary your diet and ensure you eat produce . harvested from diverse locations and grown at different times of year. ‘With . the diversity of fruit and veg on offer, there is no real reason for UK . consumers to suffer from a nutritional point of view,’ he said. But . vegans and vegetarians may struggle with their limited diet, warned . Professor Steve McGrath, an expert in soil protection at Rothamsted . Research. ‘The wet weather has had an effect on the amount of nutrients in grains, fruit and vegetables. ‘Last . year’s cereals we tested have been found to contain a third less iron . and zinc than you would normally expect.’ He said the wet weather had . two effects on the crops. Firstly, it removed nitrogen from the soil. Without it plants struggle to absorb other nutrients. Dull: Professor Gooding also warned that fewer sunny days has resulted in less sugar and starch in our fruit, making it taste different . The second reason is that the . wet weather benefitted some wheat crops, which had a bountiful harvest, . diluting the amount of nutrients available for each grain. But not all scientists agree that home-grown produce had suffered after the downpours. Paul . Finglas, head of Food Databanks National Capability at the Institute of . Food Research, said: ‘There is little direct evidence that the poor . weather has drastically reduced nutrient content in fruit and . vegetables. ‘Most crops are . efficient in obtaining the nutrients they need and so would contain a . “normal” range of nutrients. The largest effect would be on . water-soluble compounds such as nitrates, but most farming systems . supply this through fertilisers. ‘Some . water-soluble vitamins may be reduced, such as vitamin C in potatoes. However, in the overall diet it makes little impact as we get our . nutrients from a wide range of different fruit and veg. ‘The major effect the weather has had is on reducing overall yield, which in turn increases prices.’","Heavy rain is being blamed for reduced mineral content in British crops .

A fraudster has been jailed after stealing more than £100,000 charity cash from his dead neighbour. Darius Kersys, 37, syphoned off £112,000 from the bank account of 86-year-old neighbour William Carrington, who lived next door, following his death in October 2010. The generous pensioner had left the money in his will to be split equally between three charities: Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Asthma Campaign and Cancer Research UK. Kersys, who moved to England from Lithuania with his family, blew the cash on lavish spending sprees and bought a £22,500 Audi Q7 luxury 4x4, a Playstation games console and a top of the range mountain bike. Today the unrepentant conman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. His pregnant wife, who was found guilty of possession of criminal property, was given an eight-month suspended sentence and ordered to undergo 80 hours of unpaid work. Recorder Matthew Lowe said: 'You, Darius Kersys, befriended your neighbour and came into possession of his house key.

Guilty: Kersys (right) moved to England from Lithuania with his wife Inga (left) and went on lavish spending sprees with his next door neighbour's cash . 'This was a mean-spirited and nasty piece of offending which involved exploiting not only the death, but also the lonely and isolated life, of your next door neighbour. 'Inga Kersiene, though not involved in the fraud, you befitted significantly from the fraud.' A trial at Southend Crown Court in January heard how the 'unsophisticated' fraudster, from Southend, Essex, transferred thousands of pounds from Mr Carrington's savings account directly into his own account. Kersys also used Mr Carrington's bank card for extravagant shopping sprees as he enjoyed an affluent lifestyle well beyond his meagre income. Trust: The couple lived next door to William Carrington who left his money to three charities when he died . Mr Carrington died at Southend Hospital on October 26, 2010. The generous pensioner had requested in his will that his hard-earned savings to be split equally between three charities: Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Asthma Campaign and Cancer Research UK. Mr Carrington received a new Visa debit card at his home address in August 2010 shortly before his death. Mr Kersys used a key, given to him in good faith by his elderly neighbour before his death, to intercept cards and PIN codes in the post. The court heard how mother-of-three Mrs Kersiene is 12-weeks pregnant with the couple's fourth child . Three months after Mr Carrington's death in January 2011 he was registered for internet banking and large money transfers began to occur from his savings account across to his current account. Kersys then used the Visa card and PIN code to purchase items at a number of high street stores including Next, Tesco, Comet, B&Q and Halfords throughout early 2011. Purchases included an Apollo mountain bike, Tom Tom satellite navigation system and a grey suede jacket. Receipts for these purchases - and the mountain bike itself - were later found at the Lithuanian couple's home address in St Mary's Road, Southend, when police searched the property in January last year 2012. Large sums of money were also transferred from Mr Carrington's current account directly into Kersys' bank account throughout early 2011 before bank staff became suspicious of unusual activity in the pensioner's account. Investigators obtained Mr Carrington's death certificate in May 2011 and soon traced the payments back to Kersys. A total of £112,000 was drained from the account before suspicious bank staff stepped in. Shameless Kersys attempted to claim he had befriended the elderly pensioner shortly before his death and that Mr Carrington had allowed him to blow the charity cash. Kersiene claimed she had no idea her husband had received the money dishonestly. But the jury refused to believe either account and both were unanimously found guilty following the four-day trial. Kersys was found guilty of three counts of fraud by false representation while his wife, Inga Kersiene, 39, was found guilty of possession of criminal property. Today, the court heard how mother-of-three Mrs Kersiene is 12-weeks pregnant with the couple's fourth child. Mike Warren, mitigating for Mrs Kersiene, said: 'They have three children - 13, 11 and nine - and she has advised me she is now 12 weeks pregnant. 'She had been working as a carer before her arrest for these matters but she is now relying on job seekers allowance only. 'It would appear that there is about £12,000 negative equity on their home. 'She has made an approach, which I believe has been approved, for interest payments to be paid by the benefits agency.' John McNally, mitigating for Mr Kersys, said his client was 'truly ashamed' of his actions. He told the court: 'At 37 years old, he is truly ashamed of himself. 'He has had to cope with the shame of having his children visit him in prison. 'For a man who has come from Lithuania to make a something of his life, he has now fallen very far.'","William Carrington, 86, left money in his will to be given to charities .

Bringing back apprenticeships: Prime Minister David Cameron will announce that work-based training will form a crucial part of this month's Budget . David Cameron will today pledge to make it the ‘new norm’ for school leavers to take an apprenticeship or go to university. Government sources said that in the next stage of welfare reform, an ‘earn or learn’ scheme could be introduced - meaning school leavers will not be able to claim out of work benefits if they do not enter a job or take up an offer of work-based training. An expansion in work-based training will form a key part of this month’s Budget. The Prime Minster wants the country . to follow Germany’s lead where apprenticeships sits alongside higher . education as an entry point to high quality careers. Ministers . want to create higher-level apprenticeships with the same value as . degrees and postgraduate qualifications - allowing people to become . accountants, airline pilots or other lucrative professions without going . to university. Barclays will today announce a scheme . that will give businesses free support to take on an extra 10,000 . apprentices, in partnership with the National Apprenticeship Service and . charities Tomorrow’s People and The Prince’s Trust. During a visit to a training academy in . Buckinghamshire to mark the start of National Apprenticeship Week, Mr . Cameron will call on employers, schools and colleges, and his own . ministers to expand apprenticeship opportunities for young people. ‘Apprenticeships are at the heart of our mission to rebuild the economy, giving young people the chance to learn a trade, to build their careers, and create a truly world-class, high-skilled workforce that can compete and thrive in the fierce global race we are in,’ the Prime Minister will say. ‘There are record numbers of people taking up an apprenticeship, with a million starting one in the last few years. And as we take forward... our drive to reform and strengthen apprenticeships, raising standards and making them more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers - means that an apprenticeship is increasingly seen as a first choice career move.' Keen supporter: Mayor of London Boris Johnson joined chef Raymond Blanc to call for more apprenticeships in London's food and hospitality sector this month . Incentive to take apprentices: Business Secretary Vince Cable is proud of a new initiative to give a £1,500 incentive for those businesses taking on an apprentice . ‘But we need to challenge ourselves to go even further, that is why I want it to be the new norm for young people to either go to university or into an apprenticeship. 'We need to look at how we can expand apprenticeship opportunities so that they are available to all young people who are ready and eager to take them up, and aspire to get ahead in life.’ A report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research says that between now and 2021, 3.8 million people will complete apprenticeships - adding £3.4 billion to the UK economy in productivity gains. Every person that completes work-based training increases business productivity by £214 per week, leading to increased profits, lower prices, better products and higher wages, it says. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This research confirms the economic importance of apprenticeships and sends a clear message that they deliver for employers, individuals and the economy. ‘Since 2010 we have had over a million people start an apprenticeship in the UK. But I want to see more small and medium businesses reap the benefits of apprenticeships which is why we have introduced a £1,500 incentive for those who take on a young person. Charles Davis, of the Cebr, said: ‘The importance of apprenticeships to businesses and the wider UK recovery cannot be underestimated. 'Our research clearly demonstrates the significant contribution that apprenticeships can make to economic growth. 'Raising the skills of the UK’s . workforce translates into improved UK competitiveness in a challenging . post-financial crisis environment.

'But we often also find great young people who want to work in other industries, and we believe we can help them into work through our vast network of business customers. 'Our new package of free support is available to any businesses whether they bank with us or not because we are aiming to make a really big difference to young people’s careers, and to our economy.’","David Cameron says apprenticeships will create a 'world-class workforce'

An innocuous rugby tackle led to Kieran O'Connor suffering kidney injuries worse than a '70mph car crash victim' A rugby player has made a miraculous recovery after shattering his kidney in four places following an innocuous tackle. Kieran O'Connor, 22, had his kidney 'disintegrated' when a rival player accidentally kneed him in the back . as they both went for the ball in the last minute of a match earlier this month. He was left with injuries that doctors described as 'worse than a 70mph car crash victim.' Paramedics rushed to the playing ground of Old Northamptonians RFC after he was left paralysed on the ground as the side of his body swelled up. Kieran was taken to Northampton General Hospital where doctors feared for his life when he developed a huge blood clot. As they performed emergency surgery to remove the broken organ, he lost six pints of blood. And despite being told he would be in hospital for over a month - the burly full-back was back home in just six days. Today he described how he dived towards the ball in the dying seconds of the game while playing for Old Northamptonians against Loughborough RFC, which they went on to win 54-19. Kieran, a commercial finance analyst, from Northampton, said: 'It was the last play of the game, the ball was kicked over the top and as full back I had to go and smother it. 'I knew I wasn't going to get to the ball so I dived towards it and the opposition player came in from the side with his knees as every player does in that situation. 'It's a tackle I've made millions of times before, completely innocuous. I just realised I couldn't move and knew something was bad. 'When the paramedics arrived they gave me gas and air and pain killers but I just couldn't move. 'One of our coaches is ex-Navy and has seen these kinds of things before and he could see there was internal bleeding as my side was all puffy. 'When they got me to hospital and I had a CT scan it showed my kidney was in four pieces. 'I lost six pints of blood before and during surgery but they managed to patch me up. I'm never allowed to play rugby again on doctors orders as I only have one kidney left. Kieran (here on the left) suffered his horrific injuries when a rival player accidentally kneed him in the back as they both went for the ball in the last minute of a match . Emergency: Kieran lost six pints of blood before and during surgery.  He has since been told it is too risky to keep playing rugby, as he now only has one kidney . 'I've been lucky with injuries playing rugby for all my life with barely any injuries. Then one really innocuous challenge and my kidney disintegrates.' Mark Kefford, the first team coach at Old Northamptonians RFC, said: 'I've never seen or heard of an injury that bad on a rugby pitch. 'I went to the hospital with Kieran and the doctor said he'd seen people who'd been in 70mph car crashes with less damage than that.' His concerned father, Sean O'Connor, 52, described his son's escape as a 'miracle'. He added: 'He has made a lot of progress thanks to fantastic hospital staff. 'In terms of fitness, he's getting better all the time and should be absolutely fine. 'But he's only got one kidney left now and he can't risk damage to that one. I expect it will be non-contact sports for the rest of his life now - but it's a miracle he's still here.'","Kieran O'Connor, 22, was accidentally kneed in the back by a rival player .

A close friend of Max Mosley, a leading campaigner for draconian controls on the Press, is behind a new attempt to introduce a Leveson law by the back door. Lord Skidelsky, a keen supporter of Lord Justice Leveson’s plans for state-backed regulation of the Press in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, was condemned last night for hijacking a key Government Bill on the economy. In an attempt to force the Government’s hand, he has tabled a series of amendments to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, which aims to free businesses from red tape to boost the recovery. Friendship: Lord Skidelsky, right, was condemned last night for hijacking a key Government Bill on the economy. His friend Max Mosley is pictured left . But critics warned that his move could derail the Bill. Lord Skidelsky, a former member of the Labour Party who defected to the SDP and then the Conservatives before sitting as a crossbencher, is an Oxford contemporary and personal friend of Mr Mosley, the disgraced former motor racing boss who sued over sex revelations and has been intimately involved in drawing up proposals for Press regulation. The peer wrote a controversial biography of Mr Mosley’s father Oswald Mosley, the former Labour Cabinet minister who later formed the British Union of Fascists, in which he described him as a ‘hero’. In an interview in 2009, Lord Skidelsky said he still saw Mr Mosley, then clinging to his job as head of Formula 1 after tabloid revelations about his sexual antics. He told the Financial Times of his ‘calf-like’ love for Max’s mother and his fascination with Oswald, a ‘brilliant, charismatic man’. His 1975 biography of Oswald cost him his tenure at Johns Hopkins University in the US and at Oxford University and he said in 2009 that he now viewed his obsession with the fascist leader as a ‘false trail’. Max Mosley was one of the key witnesses at the Leveson inquiry and his evidence was influential in the drawing up of Lord Justice Leveson’s report. Inquiry: Max Mosley was one of the key witnesses at the Leveson inquiry and his evidence was influential in the drawing up of Lord Justice Leveson's report. Lord Justice Leveson is pictured . It was Mr Mosley who advocated a clear distinction between the bodies that write and enforce the rules on Press regulation. He gave evidence to the inquiry having successfully sued the News of the World for invasion of privacy in 2008 after it ran a sexual exposé on him, which wrongly suggested that consensual S&M scenes seen on video footage had a neo-Nazi connotation. Lord Skidelsky’s amendments to the Government’s red tape Bill would implement the key demands of pressure group Hacked Off, which is still campaigning for a Press law despite David Cameron’s rejection of the idea. They would require the top 20 publishers in Britain to be subject to a new Press watchdog tasked with ensuring ‘ethical, accurate and truthful’ reporting. If any of the top 20 fail to join it would immediately trigger legislation to force them to become members. It would also require newspapers to carry forced apologies and give the regulator power to intervene to ensure stories comply with equalities legislation. And in a move that would be welcomed by embarrassed politicians, the regulator would have to protect the ‘privacy and dignity of individuals’. Lord Skidelsky’s proposals have been drafted with the assistance of Hugh Tomlinson QC, chairman of Hacked Off. The move comes after Labour mounted a separate attempt to try to establish a Leveson law by the back door by adding amendments to a long-awaited Defamation Bill. Not happy: Labour mounted a separate attempt to try to establish a Leveson law by the back door by adding amendments to a long-awaited Defamation Bill. That was condemned by Stephen Fry, pictured . That move was condemned earlier this week by leading writers including Ian McEwan, Antonia Fraser, Salman Rushdie, David Hare, Stephen Fry, Michael Frayn, Ali Smith, Tom Stoppard, and Claire Tomalin, who said important reforms to libel law should not be jeopardised. Government sources say Mr Cameron will not allow the legislation, aimed at addressing London’s reputation as the libel capital of the world, to proceed while it includes provision for statutory regulation of the free Press. The Prime Minister proposes underpinning a new Press watchdog with a Royal Charter, along the lines of the one that backs the BBC, rather than legislation which could be amended by future governments. A Conservative source said: ‘We are in difficult economic times and the last thing we need is the Labour Party constantly playing politics with legislation of the Press and damaging important Government Bills. ‘They saw what happened to the Defamation Bill and they can be in no doubt as to our response to the Skidelsky amendment in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. We are very close to agreement on a Conservative Party Royal Charter deal and this is unnecessary game playing.’ Eminent QC Lord Lester, the architect of the Defamation Bill, said: ‘You don’t hold legislation hostage like this on something which has nothing to do with the Bill.’ Professor Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, said: ‘We now have to face the prospect that talks to improve the Royal Charter and remedy its many faults are likely to fail. ‘The Charter as published falls far short of a regulatory system that is sufficiently independent of the newspaper industry or the Government. ‘If the Government cannot abide by the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson, the victims of Press abuses for whom we speak believe that the will of Parliament should be heard. ‘Hacked Off agrees that it is prudent for the Lords to be ready with a plan for Press self-regulation which complies with the independent recommendations of the judge.’ Lord Skidelsky was not available for comment.","Lord Skidelsky has been condemned for .

Plans for secret courts were resoundingly rejected by Liberal Democrat activists yesterday. In a blow to leader Nick Clegg, they . warned the party had ‘lost its soul’ when MPs and peers backed a Commons . Bill  for closed legal proceedings last week. Two high-profile woman candidates quit . the party in disgust yesterday: Jo Shaw and Dinah Rose QC, who is a . human rights barrister. Principle: Human rights barrister Dinah Rose, left, and high flier Jo Shaw both resigned from the Liberal Democrats in disgust over the secret courts plan and accuse party leaders of supporting 'unfair bill' Activists applauded when Miss Shaw, . who is also a lawyer, announced her resignation on stage at the party . conference in Brighton. In an emotional speech, she said: . ‘It’s not me Nick, it’s you’, claiming that Mr Clegg had ‘abandoned . liberal values for the privileges of power’. She added: ‘The leadership of the . Liberal Democrats has chosen to ignore party members, ride roughshod . over party policy and support this unfair, unnecessary and unbalanced . Bill. ‘The leadership has chosen to protect . secrets and abuses of power over openness, accountability and freedom. I . cannot support such a leadership.’ Mr Clegg made no mention of the row in his keynote speech which brought the conference to a close at lunchtime . Outside the conference hall, Miss Shaw . told the Mail: ‘I love this party, I am dedicated to this party but I . cannot continue under this leader. This bill runs contrary to what we . are about; fair trials and the ability to hold power to account.’ A female activist accused Miss Shaw of . betraying her party, saying: ‘I have lost respect for you … resigning . like that in the open. There will pages of it in the papers tomorrow, . saying how rubbish we are.’ During an emergency debate yesterday, . former Cambridge Lib Dem MP, David Howarth, said it was wrong for the . Government to claim that secret courts would affect only ‘civil . proceedings’. He added: ‘The Bill does nothing to . help the secret services gain more information to foil terror plots. All . it does is give them an unfair advantage in cases where they are . accused of kidnap and torture.’ Emotions also ran high on the issue . during a question and answer session with Mr Clegg on Saturday. Three . out of ten questions asked concerned secret courts, as delegates became . increasingly frustrated with the party leader’s answers. One told him the legislation was ‘illiberal’ and warned that members could not support it. Mr Clegg said he understood the strong . feelings about the issue but it would be impossible to block it in the . face of support from the Tories and Labour. ‘Please don’t allege that this . Government, with Liberal Democrats in it, is doing something abhorrently . illiberal, which we are not,’ he insisted. The Government’s Justice and Security Bill passed its third reading, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs and a handful of Lib Dems. Ministers say civil claims against the . state involving terror suspects and armed forces should be held behind . closed doors as too often the Government pays out millions of pounds to . settle claims to prevent secret intelligence from being revealed. Former . Tory leadership contender David Davis said: ‘Gladstone must be spinning . in his grave. Let’s be clear – given the majority for secret courts in . the House of Commons, it is the Liberal Democrats who have delivered . them.’ Shami Chakrabarti, director of . Liberty, said: ‘Jo Shaw is a rising political star and a member of the . Lib Dem federal executive. Losing her should feel like losing your soul . and reflects a loss of human rights values at the top of the party.’ Miss Rose represented former . Guantánamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed in his case against the British . intelligence services. He won a massive payout.

NHS chief Sir David Nicholson is to be summoned for another bruising clash with MPs as it emerged that a Cabinet minister has joined calls for him to be sacked. Sir David, who is under pressure to resign in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, will be called before the Commons Public Accounts Committee to discuss a string of disastrous NHS IT projects. But a source on the committee told the Daily Mail that MPs ‘will want to ask him’ about his expenses, which totalled just under £50,000 last year. Scrutiny: Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive, will face questions about his £50,000 expenses when he goes before MPs to account for the health service's IT expenditure, according to a source . This was on top of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of ‘benefits in kind’. Until 2011, he was also given a taxpayer-funded sum of just under £60,000 to pay for a rented flat in the capital – an arrangement attacked by Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude as a ‘relic of the past’. Yesterday it emerged Mr Maude has argued for weeks that Sir David’s departure is necessary if accountability is to mean anything in the public sector. Ministers fear a critical focus on Sir David’s pay and perks could prove the final straw following weeks of controversy since an inquiry found up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the Mid Staffordshire trust. Sir David was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for Stafford Hospital for ten months at the height of the failings in care at the trust. And the Prime Minister is said to have privately told colleagues he will not tie himself closely to Sir David after being warned that damaging revelations are to come. A Cabinet source said: ‘Francis Maude has been one of the voices telling No10 that Nicholson should go, from the point of view of civil service accountability more than anything else.’ Giving evidence to Parliament, Sir David insisted his health authority had ‘no idea’ about the problems at Mid Staffs. But at a private meeting of Tory MPs this week, only one thought he should keep his job.Jeremy Hunt, who took over as Health Secretary in last year’s reshuffle, will have to implement complex structural reforms drawn up by his predecessor and Sir David. A Government source said that,  as a result, he was ‘in thrall’ to the NHS boss. It has also emerged  that Sir David could face a private prosecution for corporate manslaughter over the deaths at Mid Staffs. Retired investment banker Alan Edwards has applied to Camberwell Green magistrates in London for permission to prosecute Sir David for corporate manslaughter, misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.","Sir David Nicholson to face questions on £50,000 expenses .

There are three clinical types of ataxia: sensory (proprioceptive), vestibular, and cerebellar. All three types produce changes in limb coordination, but vestibular and cerebellar ataxia also produce changes in head and neck movement. Sensory (proprioceptive) ataxia occurs when the spinal cord is slowly compressed. A typical outward symptom of sensory ataxia is misplacing the feet, accompanied by a progressive weakness as the disease advances. Sensory ataxia can occur with spinal cord, brain stem (the lower part of the brain near the neck), and cerebral locations of lesions. The vestibulocochlear nerve carries information concerning balance from the inner ear to the brain. Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve can cause changes in head and neck position, as the affected animal may feel a false sense of movement, or may be having problems with hearing. Outward symptoms include leaning, tipping, falling, or even rolling over. Central vestibular signs usually have changing types of eye movements, sensory deficits, weakness in the legs (all or one sided), multiple cranial nerve signs, and drowsiness, stupor, or coma. Peripheral vestibular signs do not include changes in mental status, vertical eye movements, sensory deficits, or weakness in the legs. Cerebellar ataxia is reflected in uncoordinated motor activity of the limbs, head and neck, taking large steps, stepping oddly, head tremors, body tremors and swaying of the torso. There is an inadequacy in the performance of motor activity and in strength preservation. www.petmd.com .","Loca the pug has her own YouTube channel and Facebook page .

Sex, wellbeing and relationships have all improved for many women after they reached their half century, according to new research. Playtex quizzed 1,500 British women aged 20 to 65 and found those 50-plus were more  happy, vivacious and adventurous than ever before. All they wanna do is have some fun: Sheryl Crow, left, and Linda Barker prove you can look great and enjoy life in your fifties . Almost half, 49 per cent said they felt content with life since turning 50 and had better sex lives and relationships. The survey found that one in five women over 50s have sex at least once a week - the same amount as women in their 20s - with 27 per cent of the older women admitting that they enjoy sex now more than ever. When it comes to meeting men, 11 per cent of the 50-plus women use online dating sites compared to 15 per cent of 20-something women. For those in stable relationships, nearly half (47 per cent), of the 50-plus women said their relationships were far from stale as they enjoyed spending time with their partners more since turning 50. The envy of women half her age: Linda, 51, shows off her bikini body on Splash! Smashing the notion that older women can . only look forward to a life of sensible underwear and a pair of comfy . slippers, 50 per cent of the older women said they still donned sexy lingerie and loved to match their bra and briefs for a seductive look. And far from slowing down with age, the survey found that 50-plus women are more active than their younger counterparts with almost half (42 per cent) of respondents . starting Zumba in the past year. The adventurous nature of 50-plus women . doesn’t stop there, with almost a quarter (23 per cent) hoping to try a new sport . in 2013 compared to just 16 per cent of women in their 20s. 'As a woman over 50, it does become . tiresome when the world around you thinks that you immediately stop . feeling sexy, stop being adventurous and stop enjoying life' This was epitomised by Linda Barker, 51, who took up diving this year on the TV show Splash! and outshone the younger women with her diving skills as well as her stunning bikini body. Since then, she has been signed up to work with Playtex on their new campaign seeking to prove that modern 50-somethings are an 'ageless generation' of women. She said: 'As a woman over 50, it does become tiresome when the world around you thinks that you immediately stop feeling sexy, stop being adventurous and stop enjoying life. I feel more confident and excited about life than ever before and I'm so happy that the research by Playtex really helps to challenge those outdated notions of what being 50 feels like. 'We're not the same at 50 that our mothers were - we are now a truly Ageless Generation of women.' Linda's comment on her mother is backed up by the survey which found today's 50-plus women no longer have the same values as their parents. The majority, 93 per cent, said they have broken with the traditions and customs that their mothers had passed on to them and they feel more aligned with their younger daughters - with 64 per cent describing their grown-up offspring as their friends. Forget the control pants: Playtex's research found 50-plus women still have as much sex as women in their 20s and love wearing sexy underwear . With celebrities in their fifties like Linda, Carol Vorderman and Sheryl Crow proving you can still be sexy, successful and active as the decades pass,  85 percent of the women polled said they would like to see more 50-plus women like them in the media. A large proportion of the 50-plus women (84 per cent) also said they feel misunderstood by retailers. Marica Carleschi, marketing manager at Playtex said: 'It is fantastic to see so many women in their 50s enjoying life more than ever. The results prove that life gets more exciting and adventurous at 50 and that women should not be defined by age anymore.' Playtex are now looking for 'real' women to be the faces of their 'Ageless Generation' campaign. Nominations can be made at the Playtex Facebook page and three winners will be chosen.","Playtex quizzed 1,500 British women aged 20 to 65 and found those 50-plus were more happy, vivacious and adventurous than ever before .

The Australian radio host who was part of the notorious royal radio prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's London Hospital has been ordered not to send a condolence message to the family of the nurse who later committed suicide. Mel Greig was said today to be anxious to send a sorrowful message to the family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha but her employers at Southern Cross Austereo have told her to make contact with them. Miss Greig was seen in public for the first time this weekend when, after weeks in hiding, she flew back to her home town of Adelaide to celebrate her 31st birthday with 40 family members and friends in a private room in the city's Hackney Hotel. Mel Greig has been ordered not to send a condolence message to the family of the nurse who later committed suicide . Australian DJs Mel . Greig and Michael Christian were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the . Duchess of Cambridge . She was photographed arriving at the hotel with boyfriend Steven Pollock, but said she was sorry that she had nothing further to say about the incident that made headlines around the world. In the prank call, she and fellow radio host Mike Christian pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles when they phoned the Prince Edward VII hospital and were put through to the Duchess's ward. 'I'm just happy to be back in Adelaide to see my family and friends for my birthday,' said Miss Greig, declining to speak further about the hoax call which duped a nurse into revealing details of Kate Middleton's morning sickness. Three days later, nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who had put the call through to the private ward, committed suicide. Tragic: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate's ward, was found dead in nurses' housing three days after the call . A close friend told Adelaide's Sunday . Mail today that the once-bubbly presenter was still shattered following . the death of Miss Saldanha and was frustrated that she was unable to . seek 'proper closure'. 'It's been really hard for her to move on,' the friend told the paper. 'She hasn't been able to tell the . Saldanha family how sorry she is for their loss and I think that's made . it really hard for her.' The friend added: 'Mel wanted to send a condolence letter to the family since this happened but she hasn't been allowed to send it and it really upsets her.' Desperate to keep out of the limelight, Miss Greig attended her birthday at the hotel yesterday after it was booked under the name 'Lem's Birthday' – Lem being Mel spelled backwards. A family member who asked not to be named said that while Miss Greig would like to return to radio work, and felt ready for the task, nothing had been confirmed. 'She's still waiting for her work to offer a decent job for her to return to,' said the family member.' 'It's pretty stressful for her. Mel lost her dream job,' said the family member, referring to Miss Greig's former Sydney-based show, Hot30, which she co-hosted with Mr Christian. The Sunday Mail said it was being suggested that the radio network was considering offering her a breakfast slot on an Adelaide radio station.

Martin Tremblay, 48, swept out the leg of a youngster while the teams were going through the traditional hockey ritual of lining up to congratulate each other after the match. Two players, a ten-year-old and a 13-year-old, fell to the ice following Tremblay's moment of madness. The move was caught on video and has worked its way around the Internet. Scroll down for video .

Congratulations: He approaches the first opposition player and offers his hand, without showing any sign of what is to come . Moment of madness: Tremblay suddenly sticks out a leg and brings down one of the youngsters . Tremblay has been sentenced to 15 days in jail after admitting one count of assault in November last year. A spectator caught the assault on video and swiftly uploaded it onto YouTube, where it was viewed more than a million times. The incident unfolded in June last year . when youth teams from Richmond, British Columbia, and Vancouver were . playing at the University of British Columbia.

Furious National Lottery players yesterday threatened to mount a boycott when ticket prices double to £2 in September. A snap poll found that as many as eight out of ten could abandon the lottery. Others said they would buy premium bonds or play the Irish lottery instead. MPs and campaigners said the increase was a ‘tax on the poor’ and ‘sheer greed’ and research revealed pensioners and those on low incomes would be hit hardest. A snap poll found that as many as eight out of ten could abandon playing the lottery . Research suggests average spending on the draw is just under £6 and this would double to £12 for those who want to play the same multiple series of numbers. Many will be anxious not to drop a sequence they have been trying to win with for years. A study from 2009 found lower-income groups spend more than high earners by £5.92 a week to £5.33. Pensioners were also found to be more likely to play. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton in Essex, said: ‘With the price of everything going up, and given the profits they make, it would be nice if the people who run the National Lottery didn’t put up the price of a ticket. It’s not as if they are short of a few bob.’ On Twitter, the official  @TNLUK lottery account was bombarded with complaints. Customers called the increase a ‘rip-off’ and complained that organiser Camelot was forcing customers to ‘fund the company directors’ lavish lifestyles’ by doubling prices. Camelot’s chief executive, Dianne Thompson, earns around £1million a year, not including her bonus. On the National Lottery’s official Facebook page players queued up to say they would no longer buy tickets. One said Camelot should ‘hang their heads in shame’. Another said she was closing her online lottery account and buying premium bonds instead. Denis Vaughan, president of the Council for the Advancement of Arts Recreation & Education, which acts as a lottery watchdog, said: ‘This increase shows how far from its original purpose the lottery has come. ‘The rise is unjustified and I think it’s likely people will walk away from it as a result. Not enough of the money is going to the right good causes.’ Camelot's chief executive Dianne Thompson (left) earns around £1million a year not including her bonus and Douglas Carswell (right) Tory MP for Clacton in Essex who says the National Lottery 'is not short of a few bob' People have taken to Twitter to vent their anger at plans to increase the price of the National Lottery to £2 . A poll on the Guardian website asked: ‘If you bet on the National Lottery, would you carry on doing so at double the ticket price?’ Eighty per cent of respondents voted no while 20 per cent chose yes.Camelot, which is owned by a Canadian pension fund, is likely to see huge revenue rises as a result of the changes. And the Treasury, which received £423million in lottery duty in just six months last year, is also likely to earn more. As well as the price rise, average weekend jackpots will go up to £5million in a revamp of the main Lotto game. The prize for getting three numbers will go up from £10 to £25, and the prize for matching four will go from £60 to £100. A new raffle prize of £20,000 will go to at least 50 Lotto players every week. However, other prizes will fall. The decision was approved by the regulator, the National Lottery Commission. Culture Secretary Maria Miller was also aware of the decision. Camelot said research revealed the Lotto draw was ‘getting a bit tired and jaded’ and customers wanted ‘more prizes and more ways to win’. Around 60 per cent of the public play regularly.","Eight out of ten could abandon National Lottery, poll finds .

"By . Daniel Bates and James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 20:18 EST, 7 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:16 EST, 8 September 2012 . The head of U.S. special operations has concluded that the claims made by former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette about Osama bin Laden's last moments are incorrect and do not convey an accurate assessment of the al-Qaeda chiefs killing. The chief of U.S. special forces has re-examined the claims of Matt Bissonnette, who wrote 'No Easy Day' and recounts a different version of events of the death of Osama bin Laden . Admiral William McRaven took the personal step of contacting members of the Navy SEAL Team Six that stormed the Abbottabad, Pakistan compound of bin Laden, to rebut claims made by Bissonnette that contradicted the official account of the May 2011 raid. In his book on the raid, 'No Easy Day', Bissonnette said that bin Laden was on the floor having already been shot when he and other SEALs entered his room, having been fired upon by another SEAL when he craned his head into the hall as the team approached. Bissonnette's book claims that when he entered the room bin Laden's body was already lying at the foot of the bed, twitching and convulsing and that the SEALs, including Bissonnette shot him in the chest until he was motionless. Because this version of events differs from the account that the White House and other U.S. officials have given, Adm. McRaven, the head of U.S. Special Operations Command personally went back to the head of Team Six to examine the contradicting claims. Following this, senior Pentagon officials told CNN that the conclusions they reached were that Bissonnette was wrong in his version of events. They re-confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader was standing in his room when the SEALs entered and they shot him then, as he was able to access weapons that were already in the room. Despite the fact that bin Laden was unarmed, the SEALS had come under heavy fire as they made their way through the house to reach him and bin Laden showed no signs of surrendering. Even though the Pentagon's and Bissonnette's versions diverge at the point of encountering bin Laden, the officials who spoke with CNN said it was possible that the former SEAL simply never saw bin Laden standing because he was a few seconds behind the lead team members. It still has not been made clear if the initial shots fired by the leading SEAL member hit bin Laden when he looked out of his room. The officials told CNN that they believe the shots missed. However, whatever the truth of the bin Laden raid, Bissonnette's decision to publicly come forward and tell his story has reportedly led to him being ostracised by his former special forces comrades. Adm. William McRaven took the claims of Bissonnette, (seen in . this photo talking to TV show 60 Minutes) so seriously that he went straight to the lead SEAL of Team Six to lead another debriefing on the mission . Having broken ranks, Bissonnette will be struck from invitations to annual events for retired and active SEALs, who act as a secretive and closely knit band of brothers. 'The guys who run their mouths are typically not invited back to these things,' a retired senior Navy officer familiar with the SEAL culture told The Washington Times. 'These guys are not really welcomed in many places in the ‘spec’ war community. The entire SEAL community has made these guys unwelcomed at their gatherings.' Another anonymous officer who maintains contacts with serving SEALs said that 'No Easy Day' violated the basic SEAL creed. 'They’re not going to buy the book. Most of the guys are pissed off [by] the fact that he would disclose the operation.' said the insider. He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. However, it has also been claimed that Bissonnette could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades. A rival book alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote ‘No Easy Day’, had ‘bad blood’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit. ‘No Easy Op’ claims that the soldier was ‘ostracised’ when he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting. The Navy SEAL Team 6 member who used the pseudonym Mark Owen to write No Easy Day . Feeling scorned Bissonnette could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction. No Easy Day, which is in book stores, is the first account of the bin Laden operation from a member of the squad who was there. But it has proved controversial because Bissonnette, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen, did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it. It also disagrees with the official White House version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the Obama administration consternation. According to the New York Times, the book says that Bissonnette was ‘repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service’ with nothing but rejection. It claims he was ‘ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to Virginia from a training operation’, before eventually leaving. The book says: ‘In the infantry-bred world of Army Special Operations, no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics,’ No Easy Op has been written by sofrep.com, a web site for former Special Operations team members. Brandon Webb, a former SEAL sniper who founded the site, said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the bin Laden team, although none of them are identified. Talking to the New York Times, Mr Webb refused to say whether Bissonnette was involved in No Easy Op, even though he has spoken to him in the past.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil more help for homebuyers and extra investment in housebuilding . Families who want to upsize are to be offered government help to buying their second home with just a five per cent deposit. Ministers are planning to expand a scheme aimed at first-time buyers to help so-called ‘second-steppers’ in a new attempt to revive the stagnant housing market. The move is part of a major package of reforms expected to be unveiled in next week’s Budget designed to restore Britain’s tradition as a ‘property owning democracy’. A flagship element is expected to be extending the NewBuy scheme, which sees the government and banks underwrite mortgages, allowing them to purchase a property with only five per cent deposit. It means it could allow people to put as little equity as £11,000 into a £228,000 house. The scheme, which has so far helped 1,522 first-time buyers get their foot on the property ladder, will be offered to people looking to buy their second home, The Guardian reported. A survey by Llloyds TSB found almost two thirds of second-steppers had been unable to move for more than a year while one in five think it is harder to move up the property ladder than get on it in the first place. The average age of a first-time buyer who does not get help from familiy is now 33, but that rises to 41 for those buying their second home. Ministers believe the lack of help for second-steppers is blocking the lower end of the property market and stalling sales of starter homes. The government is expected to offer more backing for housebuilding, after figures from the Office for National Statistics showed a sharp drop in output from the construction industry . The NewBuy scheme, currently only available to new-build properties, is also expected to be extended to older homes. Buyers . who purchase a property can use the scheme to obtain a mortgage of up . to £500,000 from Barclays, Nationwide or NatWest. Developers and the . Government share some of the risk and guarantee to step in if the buyer . fails to repay their mortgage. Tens of thousands of new homes should be built to help revive the economy, business groups have warned. The CBI is calling for 50,000 affordable homes . to be built, incentives for refurbishing empty homes and the housing . guarantee scheme to be extended to all types of housing. It wants to shift £2.2billion from current spending to high-growth areas without adding to the deficit. This . would include £1.25billion on capital investment –including housing – . and £950m on high-growth business tax measures, such as a 2 per cent cap . on the planned increase in business rates and the removal of stamp duty . on equity finance for mid-sized companies. Separately . the British Chambers of Commerce is warning today that a point may have . to consider major cuts in business taxation and joins with the CBI in . calling for 100,000 additional new homes to be built by 2015. Chancellor George Osborne will unveil a . series of measures in his March 20 Budget aimed at helping tens of . thousands more families buy a home and to address a chronic housing . shortage by building more homes. Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams yesterday called on Mr Osborne to use ‘historically low rates’ for government borrowing to ‘prioritise capital investment, particularly in the housing market, to give a strong fillip to growth’. The Funding for Lending scheme, which aims to encourage banks to lend more money to both individuals and businesses, is to be ‘put on steroids’ in an attempt to get credit flowing from banks. It has so far helped push down the cost of a two-year fixed rate £100,000 mortgage with a 10 per cent deposit, which is now £1,000 cheaper on average than when the scheme was launched. Mortgage lending will rise this year by £10 billion for the first time since the financial crisis, according to industry predictions. Fresh support is likely to be targeted particularly at the under-30s after Mr Cameron said it was unacceptable that the average first-time buyer is now 33 years old. ‘We don’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and encouraging people to take on borrowing that they can’t afford,’ he said last week. ‘But it is important that people who work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home,’ he said. ‘It is a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that the average age for someone buying their first home today, without any help from their parents is 33 years old. And we are determined to tackle that.’ More first-time buyers will be allowed to buy new-build property with a mortgage of just 75 per cent of its value and a five per cent deposit. The taxpayer and the builder together provide an ‘equity loan’, effectively holding on to a stake in the home worth up to 20 per cent. When the property is sold, the builder and the state are repaid a percentage of the sale value to reflect their joint ownership. Ministers believe cash-strapped second-steppers are holding up the housing market, and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on to the property ladder . The Prime Minister used a major speech on the economy last week to signal that more help would be made available to help housebuyers. ‘We don’t want to go back to the days of 110 per cent mortgages and encouraging people to take on borrowing that they can’t afford,’ the Mr Cameron said. David Cameron last week warned that the average age of a first time-buyer is now 33 . ‘But it is important that people who . work hard and do the right thing are able to buy a home,’ he said. 'It is . a rebuke to those of us who believe in property owning democracy that . the average age for someone buying their first home today, without any . help from their parents is 33 years old. And we are determined to tackle . that.’ Boosting property ownership and encouraging construction of new developments is seek as a key way to use public investment to stimulate economic growth. The Chancellor is expected to set out plans for new 'garden towns' - areas of development on the edge of towns where planning rules are relaxed - and also make it easier for commercial premises to be transformed into new homes. A Government source said: ‘Housing will be key to this Budget – we want to give as much support as we can to the whole sector.’ Official figures show construction output in January fell 7.9 per cent on last year. Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘These are shocking figures, which expose how out of touch David Cameron was yesterday to claim his economic plan isn’t failing. ‘We need to kick-start our flatlining economy by investing in infrastructure projects and building thousands more affordable homes. 'And to get small projects moving too VAT on home repairs, maintenance and improvements should be cut to 5 per cent. These measures would boost growth, create jobs and in the long-term strengthen our economy and help get the deficit down.’","NewBuy scheme which means buyers only need a 5% deposit to be extended .

Families of the men had pleaded to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah for clemency but the executions were carried out as planned . A human rights group has revealed the haunting final words of a man begging for justice nine hours before he was executed by firing squad in Saudi Arabia. Seven men convicted of being part of a criminal gang which committed armed robbery were shot by firing squad in the southern city of Abha today after the king rejected their families' appeals for clemency. Amnesty International has released a harrowing final phone interview with one of the men who claimed they had all been tortured into confessions. 'I'm one of the seven prisoners to be executed. I have nine hours left until I die,' said the man, who has not been named. 'We found this out through friends and relatives who saw the market square being prepared for the execution. 'There are now seven spots in the square for seven people to be shot. It's going to be in public, in the market, in the city of Abha. 'We don't know what we are supposed to have done wrong. 'We were forced to make confessions. We were mistreated by the investigators - they took our clothes and it was winter. They tortured us by suspending us from chains on the wall. 'They also used psychological torture such as threatening they would bring in our mothers and torture them in front of us. 'I didn't kill anyone - we were tried for robbery and we were forced to confess. I hope the execution will be stopped. 'I wish for it to be stopped and for a fair trial and for a reinvestigation. The trial was totally unjust.' Human rights campaigners had called for the sentences to be quashed because the men were juveniles when they were arrested. One of the men told The Associated Press last month he was only 15 when he was arrested as part of a ring that stole jewelry in 2004 and 2005.

On March 4, Human Rights Watch appealed to King Abdullah to halt the executions and said there was 'strong evidence' that the trials of all seven men violated basic principles of rights to a fair trial. 'It will be outrageous if the Saudi authorities go ahead with these executions,' Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East director, had said. 'It is high time for the Saudis to stop executing child offenders and start observing their obligations under international human rights law.'

The dollar fell on Friday, as investors locked in recent gains after a reading on U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell. The currency had gained against world currencies for the past six weeks. But much of the economic news released during the day was positive. Government reports showed U.S. factory output increased, led by the auto industry, and inflation remained modest outside of a spike in gas prices. But preliminary data for March from The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment showed a surprising drop. Dip: The dollar fell on Friday, as investors locked in recent gains after a reading on U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell . 'This was the first negative surprise for the U.S. economy in more than a week, suggesting that some of the headwinds that the bears have been talking about are finally starting to materialize,' said Boris Schlossberg, managing director for foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note. While he pointed out that the survey is not always an accurate gauge of consumer behavior, he said it does seem to indicate slowing consumer demand. The euro was up to $1.3060, from $1.30 late Thursday. Even though the 27 European Union leaders meeting in Brussels failed to deliver any fundamental changes in economic strategy, talk there of the need to promote growth rather than just cut debt was seen as a positive sign. 'European leaders are beginning to realize that a policy focused solely on austerity is failing miserably both an economic prescription and as a political stance,' Schlossberg wrote. Happier times ahead? Much of the economic news released during the day was positive. Government reports showed U.S. factory output increased and inflation remained modest . The British pound slipped to $1.5078 late Friday, from $1.5081 the day before, reversing an earlier rally. Traders were responding to remarks from Bank of England Governor Mervyn King that signaled the central bank does not want to see further declines in the currency. The pound had been in retreat for several few weeks on expectations of another monetary stimulus from the central bank. 'While we don't think the pound will sustain these gains, we think that future declines could happen at a slower pace,' wrote Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com, especially if the government moves to address the weak British economy.

When it comes to pubs readers are told they are 'much more than plain bar' and to expect 'homely places full of historical character (and characters!)' One laughably obvious description says British Chinese takeaways are known as 'Chinese' and cover 'South East Asian cuisine'. The guide says: 'Be warned that . although this exotic cuisine is largely cherished by the British, the . takeaways produce food adapted to the British taste and so will not . necessarily be as authentic as dishes eaten in those particular . countries - slight more cooking oil and MSG food additive than perhaps . should be used!' It also points out that our favourite curries are 'more Bangladeshi than actually Indian.'

The guide explains Argos is: 'A . popular and useful warehouse shop in which you can browse a thick . catalogue of very wide ranging products.' A glossary of English terms also explains how 'flat' means 'apartment' while British public schools are actually private. Surprisingly . despite the unpopularity of President Barack Obama's healthcare bill, . the document praises the NHS saying it is 'generally considered to be of . an excellent standard' But . it does point out that there are 'long waiting lists' which mean some . people have private healthcare on top of NHS provision.

Stating the obvious: one section says British Chinese takeaways are known as 'Chinese' and cover 'South East Asian cuisine' Once American readers have swotted up on the British way of life and the peculiarities of the English language they are introduced to the ways of historic Cambridge. The guide warns of high property and rent prices in Cambridge and quite rightly says that parking spaces are rare. Employees who will be based in Cambridge are introduced to punting and are told about the historic colleges of the prestigious University.

Perhaps, says its curator, in rather too much risqué detail for some visitors. A sculpture showing the Greek god Pan in an erotic clinch with a female goat is accompanied by a discreet ‘parental guidance’ notice that it is ‘sexually explicit’. Risque: The statue of Pan And The Goat will go on display at the British Museum as part of its new exhibition of artefacts from the ruined cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum . The statue of Pan, himself half goat, would have been a cultured joke to the wealthy Romans who placed it in their garden. Recently, more prudish tastes have prevailed and the sculpture is normally housed in an ‘over-14s’ area at the Naples Museum. But it will be proudly displayed at a new show, Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Paul Roberts, senior curator, said: . ‘We have a small notice advising parents that there’s adult content, but . certainly not a curtain, which it has had elsewhere. ‘To a Roman it would have been humorous. I doubt there would have been a household without something sexual.’ Also on show is a bronze phallus wind . chime. A small notice on the wall of the gallery reads: ‘This section . of the exhibition contains sexually explicit material.’ British Museum: The museum said the erotic sculpture would have been amusing, rather than offensive, to Romans . Erotic art was commonplace in the ill-fated cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were buried within the space of a single day in AD 79 by a catastrophic volcanic eruption from Mount Vesuvius. Phalluses and representations of the Greek fertility god Priapus adorned paintings and mosaics, and were even carved into doorways and paving stones. The British Museum's exhibition also features an array of other, non-erotic artefacts, including wall paintings, wooden furniture and a garden bench from 1,700 years that were part of the daily lives of the cities' residents 1,700 years ago. The exhibition will open on March 28.","Sculpture of god Pan and a nanny goat features in new exhibit .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:14 EST, 14 March 2013 . An angry couple have torn down the rear wall of their beloved beach hut to protest against a council decision to increase the rent by 12 per cent . Barbara Grace, 62, and partner Alan Sarfas, 57, were outraged when they were told that the ground rent for their hut which they use all year round was set to go up to £787 from £702. But they found that they could get round the increase by reducing the overall size of their 10ft by 8ft 6ins hut overlooking the North Sea at Felixstowe, Suffolk. Instead of paying the extra cash, they used an electric saw powered by a generator to slice off 18 inches from the rear to reduce its overall floor area. Alan Sarfas and Barbara Grace have chopped off 18 inches from their beach hut in Felixstowe, Suffolk to avoid the price rise . The couple will now save £160 in rent each year - but lost a precious bit of space from their beloved hut, which they bought nine years ago . It means the hut is now in a lower price bracket as it takes up less space so they will only be charged £616 by Suffolk Coastal District Council. The couple, who are both former bank workers, were today putting up a new rear wall on the hut named Idle Hours which now measures 8ft 6ins square. Mother-of-two Mrs Grace said: 'I am having to get used to the hut being a little smaller it, but it is worth it as we will not have to pay the council so much. 'The rent for huts at Felixstowe has doubled since we bought ours nine-years-ago and it is far higher than other local towns. 'It started leaping up three years ago and the latest 12 per cent increase is obscene. 'The council is profiteering. It is sheer greed and they cannot justify the latest increase. 'We want to draw attention to how the council is making a fortune out of us and all the other beach hut owners. 'Nobody would have questioned an increase in line with inflation. Mr Sarfas said the rent for huts at Felixstowe has doubled since we bought ours nine-years-ago . The couple, who spent around £270 downsizing their place, use it daily between May and November . 'I know people will think that cutting up our hut is an extreme measure - but we do not see why we should pay so much. We have done it out of principle. 'We know of a lady aged 84 who has had a hut here for 40 years, but she is having to give it up because she cannot afford the latest increase.' The grandmother-of-six, who swims on the beach every day in the summer, said the work to cut up the hut had cost around £270 in materials. She said: 'We had to buy wood to make a new rear wall and a frame for it. 'Luckily Alan is quite handy at woodwork so he is doing the work himself with my help. 'We had to put in a false back wall first with wooden boards. Then we chopped the entire 18 inch section off the back.' The couple who live in Felixstowe are taking the opportunity to spend another £180 on refurbishing the hut with new kitchen units and a seat against one wall which will double as a bed. They are especially upset as beach hut owners in nearby Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, have their rent reduced by around half by Tendring District Council if they are local residents. Cutting corners: The couple say they also use the hut regularly throughout the winter . The hut, named Idle Hours, now measures 8ft 6ins square, after the pair decided to take a stand against the council . Mr Safras said: 'It should be the same system here - but everyone is charged the same for a hut regardless of where they live. 'The council works out the rent through a sliding scale depending on the floor area of each hut. 'It goes up around £10 for every tenth of a square metre. 'As far as I know they are the only council around here to do this. Others just have two prices - one for large huts and one for small. 'The cost of the chopping the end of the hut means we will not be saving money this year, but by next year we will not be paying so much.' The couple paid £2,000 for the hut nine-years-ago and use it daily between May and November when Mrs Grace goes swimming up to three times a day. They also use it regularly during the winter when they like to sit inside and tuck into cheese rolls and soup heated up on the gas stove. A new look: The pair say they will save money next year after they paid for it to be sliced this year . Mrs Grace added: 'We have had childrens' parties here. We even pop down on Christmas Day and New Year's Day for mince pies. 'Several other beach hut owners have seen what we have done and they are considering chopping the ends off their huts as well. 'But many of the hut owners are elderly and wouldn't know how to complain and also would be too scared to do so. 'It is making it very difficult for ordinary people to afford a hut.' A Suffolk Coastal District Council spokesman said it was up to each of the 1,000 beach hut owners in Felixstowe to decide the size of their huts. Geoff Holdcroft, the council's cabinet member for economic development and leisure, said he believed the rents were still 'value for money'. He said: 'We are in tough financial times and need to generate enough income to ensure that we can still provide our free services such as our public toilets and rubbish collection and street cleansing that visitors to our tourist attractions such as Felixstowe are receiving.' A Suffolk Coastal District Council spokesman said: 'The facts are that licences in Suffolk Coastal were comparatively very good value, that there is clear unmet demand for a licence with a five year waiting list, and that the Council has a duty to charge a fair rate for all its services so it can help fund its priority services used its residents. 'The financial realities facing the Council are that it has less money to spend than it did six years ago despite its population and demand for services having grown significantly. Since 2010, the amount of Government grant towards the cost of local services has also dropped by 30 per cent. 'It is up to each hut owner what size their beach hut is. 'Reducing the size of the hut will also mean that their business rates bill would also reduce, although thanks to the efforts of Suffolk Coastal, virtually all licence holders receive a 100 per cent rebate on their business rates bill so are currently saving between £150 and £300 a year.'","Couple sliced off the overall size of their 10ft by 8ft 6ins hut .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 08:51 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 13 March 2013 . A suspected Sudanese war criminal who claimed to have slaughtered so many people that he 'lost count' is living off British benefits. Unemployed Mohamed Salim boasts that he is unsupervised by the authorities and never visits police. The alleged killer now lives in a leafy street in Birmingham, a far cry from his former life in Sudan, where he claimed that he had been a member of the violent Janjaweed militia. The genocide has spread throughout Darfur, with innocent civilians being attacked as Janjaweeds destroy whole communities . Refugees from Darfur are persecuted by the Janjaweed, which Salim once claimed to be a part of . Salim, 27, arrived in the UK in 2006, and claimed in an anonymous interview with BBC's Newsnight programme that he, along with the brutal gang, were paid by the Sudanese government to pillage and kill innocent people. The Janjaweed militia ransacked entire villages during the genocide in Darfur, which began in 2003. In the interview, where he shielded most of his face, the asylum seeker claimed he was paid £50 a day to wipe out resistance - often slaying women, children and innocent people. It was this candid interview, where he said: 'Sometimes they said ""wipe out an entire village"". And we shoot to kill,' that he was brought to the attention to the UK Border Agency's war crime unit, the Daily Mirror reported. But he does not have to leave the country - as an immigration court in Birmingham has ruled that his life could be at risk if he returned to Sudan, and this would be a breach of his human rights. Women and children were among those killed, injured and raped by the brutal Janjaweed gang, which Salim claimed he had been a part of . The asylum seeker says that he much prefers life in England than Sudan, and likes to watch football in Birmingham bars . Now he lives in Birmingham, where he is an avid West Bromwich Albion supporter and goes to college to learn English for free, he told the newspaper. He likes to go to bars in Birmingham to watch football matches and says there are more opportunities in the UK. He said: 'My life here is normal. I much prefer it in England than in Sudan. 'I came here because I listened to friends who said it was good to live here and claim asylum here. I don’t pay to live in this house.' He then denied what he had said in the interview. He told the Daily Mirror that he did not participate in the horrific ethnic cleansing, claiming he wanted to escape Janjaweed and had never killed anybody. The UKBA maintains that he does report to them and is strictly monitored, contrary to his boasts. A UKBA spokesman said he has been reporting to them since he arrived and said: 'We cannot comment on the individual case as there is ongoing litigation.' In 2003, two Darfuri rebel movements- the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)- declared war against the Sudanese government, complaining about the marginalization of the area and the failure to protect sedentary people from attacks by nomads. The government of Sudan have been accused of retaliating by unleashing Arab militias known as Janjaweed, or 'devils on horseback' who attacked hundreds of villages. Over 400 villages were completely destroyed and millions of civilians were forced to flee their homes. In the ongoing genocide, African farmers and others are being systematically displaced and murdered by the Janjaweed. The genocide in Darfur has claimed 400,000 lives and displaced over 2,500,000 people. The United Human Rights Council estimates that more than 100 people continue to die each day; 5,000 die every month. The Sudanese government disputes these figures and deny any connection with the Janjaweed. Source: The United Human Rights Council .","Alleged killer who claimed to have belonged to brutal militia .

A woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by an Air Force combat pilot says she is 'absolutely stunned' after a top military commander reversed a conviction against her alleged assailant. Air Force Lt. Gen. Craig Franklin reversed a jury's sexual assault conviction against Lt. Col. James Wilkerson after reviewing the case over a three-week period and concluding 'that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.'  Wilkerson had been sentenced to one year in prison and he was dismissed from the service. 'I was absolutely stunned,' victim Kimberly Hanks told NBC's TODAY Show, describing the moment that she learned of the reversal. 'It looks to me like [Franklin] is protecting one of his own.'

Reversal: Lt Gen Craig Franklin (left) made the . decision to overturn the sexual assault conviction against Lt Col James . Wilkerson, right, a former inspector general . Describing the night of the alleged assault, Hanks told NBC's TODAY Show that she was sleeping in Wilkerson's guest bedroom after a night of socializing at his house with friends and she 'felt some discomfort.' 'The lights came on, which woke me up, and I opened my eyes and he ws in bed with me with his hands down my pants,' she said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is now reviewing the reversal, along with the Senate Armed Services Committee. Hagel said that under military law, neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to reverse Franklin's decision to overturn the November conviction against Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy. The Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday on sexual assaults in the military and the Wilkerson case is expected to be a major topic of discussion. Hanks (left) told NBC's TODAY Show that she was sleeping in Wilkerson's (right) guest bedroom after a night of socializing at his house with friends and she 'felt some discomfort . Second look: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says he will reexamine a case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault . There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the Air Force last year, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape. That is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. Many of those cases stem from a single base near San Antonio where dozens of young female recruits and airmen were victimized by their instructors. An inquiry into Lackland Air Force Base found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. Six instructors have been convicted in courts-martial on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Nine more instructors are awaiting courts-martial. Two more received nonjudicial punishments. Fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation. Boxer and Sen Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, wrote to Hagel last week asking him to look into the case. They called Franklin's decision to overturn the jury verdict 'a travesty of justice.' Franklin is commander of the 3rd Air Force at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Sen Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, . told Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Gen Mark Welsh, the Air . Force chief of staff, in a March 5 letter that Franklin's decision . 'shows ignorance, at best, and malfeasance, at worst.' Franklin's decision undermines . efforts by the Air Force and the other military branches 'to erase a . culture that has often turned a blind eye on sexual assault,' McCaskill . added. Shaheen and McCaskill are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Advocates: Sen Barbara Boxer, left, released the letter from Hagel on Monday, while Sen Claire McCaskill, right, has told Air Force officials that Franklin's decision 'shows ignorance, at best' The Air Force has been grappling for months with the fallout over a sex scandal at its training headquarters in Texas. Dozens of young female recruits and . airmen at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio were victimized by . their instructors who sexually harassed, improperly touched or raped . them. During January testimony before a . House committee, Welsh likened sexual assault in the Air Force's ranks . to a cancer and vowed to tackle the problem by screening personnel more . carefully and putting an end to bad behaviors like binge drinking that . can lead to misconduct. But Welsh also acknowledged that the . Air Force recorded a disturbing number of reports of sexual assault last . year even as it worked to curb misconduct. Wilkerson is a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy before he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a conviction that was later overturned . The preliminary figures for 2012 show . there were nearly 800 reports of cases, ranging from inappropriate . touching to rape, according to Welsh. Time for a change: Rep Jackie Speier is looking to propose legislation that would strip commanders of authority to block decisions made by courts-martial . That would be a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported. The 2012 figures are being audited and will be included in a report the Defense Department will submit to Congress next month. In his letter to Boxer, Hagel refers . to Franklin as the 'convening authority,' a term for a commander who is . responsible for establishing a court-martial. The Uniform Code of Military Justice . gives a convening authority the 'sole discretion' to reduce or set aside . guilty verdicts and sentences, or to reverse a jury's verdict. Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 . by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated . sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer . and a gentleman. Hagel said he has directed the . Pentagon's general counsel and the Air Force secretary to examine . Franklin's decision 'to determine how the factual basis for the action . can be made more transparent.' Hagel also said the Wilkerson case . raises the question of whether it is necessary or appropriate 'to place . the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to . review the findings and sentence of a court-martial,' particularly when . military law allows for a rigorous appeal process. He said he is ordering the Air Force . and other military services to examine that question and determine if . changes to military law are necessary.

Kurram, the only part of Pakistan's largely lawless border region that has a significant Shi'ite population, is wracked by sectarian violence between Sunni and Shi'ite tribes. Anti-Shi'ite ideology from the Taliban and al Qaeda has meant years of bloody fighting. Bibi is Shi'ite while Din was Sunni, Hussain added.

In such tribal justice, women often fare far worse than men. Hussain said that the jirga had also requested that another Pakistani soldier, Saif Ullah, be handed over for helping the couple meet and coordinate the planned elopement.

They want Tyrone Mosby, who is alleged to have fired the shot that struck the pretty teenager, to 'see what he's done', and will take her in to an Orlando courtroom in a wheelchair, according to the family's legal team. Tyrone Mosby, (left)  is alleged to have fired the shot that struck Danielle Sampson (right).

Her parents Alma and Justin also hope the unusual court appearance will serve as a poignant reminder to others of the innocent victims who suffer as a result of gun violence. Court officials have already agreed to the request for the comatose patient to be present. Danielle was leaving a church with her family in Pine Hills, Florida, last July when she was reportedly hit by a stray bullet in the head. Two men were involved in a gunfight, it is believed, when the bullet struck Danielle as she was driven home with her family. At the time, police said two shooters in two passing vehicles were firing at each other in the middle of the road, Daily News reports. Danielle’s father, who was driving, heard gunshots and tried to take a turn to get out of the way. But a bullet shattered the back windshield and the girl’s mother turned around to see her daughter slumped over in the backseat, News 13 reports. She has remained in coma since being shot and now receives round the clock care at a rehabilitation centre. Mosby was arrested a month after the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to two attempted murder charges. Mosby has an arrest record dating to September 2006, when he was 14, that includes several violent crime and drug charges, including possession of cocaine with intent to sell. Last year he was acquitted of attempted first-degree murder, armed robbery, aggravated battery and aggravated assault after being charged at age 17 as an adult. He was acquitted again in February of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery and aggravated assault. He pleaded no contest in 2010 to battery on a detention-facility staffer.  Mosby faces life in prison with no parole if found guilty. Jury selection began on Monday.

Throughout the Seventies, Agnetha was the singer we all wanted to be, the platinum-haired pop star with the plaintive edge to her voice, the arch-deployer of curling tongs and unabashed wearer of spray-on satin catsuits. Throughout that long, long decade that taste forgot, Agnetha never committed the sin of simplicity. White lace-up dresses, peek-a-boo all-in-ones, Grecian tunics, Spandex flamenco trousers, capes,  chokers and beany hats? She wore the lot. Sometimes, it seemed, all at once. Glittery headbands and jammy layers of lip gloss? Them, too. We all thought she was the last word in smoky, Swedish glam. And now the woman who once sang ‘I’m nothing special, in fact I’m a bit of a bore’ has cast off decades of self-imposed seclusion and stepped into the global spotlight once more. So here she goes again, my, my, how can we resist her? Well, can we? Remarkably, the 62-year-old, long thought of as the Greta Garbo of pop, has been tempted out of retirement on her estate on the Swedish island of Ekero. She made the decision after hearing a new set of songs written for her by Jorgen Elofsson, the Grammy-nominated producer who has previously worked with stars such as  Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Westlife. Whatever he did to Agnetha to winkle  her out of her shell, it worked. She has a new single out this week, When You Really Loved Someone. A new album, her first for nine years, will be released in May. Simply called A, it includes a duet with Gary Barlow. Heyday: Agnetha (left) and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (right) when they were performing with the legendary Abba . Can you see where this is going? Some would say straight down the middle of the road on the electro-pop highway to hell. The duet with Barlow is called I Should’ve Followed You Home, which sounds a bit creepy. Especially for a woman who famously had a stalker, a former boyfriend against whom she had to take out a restraining order. And although Gary and Agnetha recorded separately, Faltskog has said: ‘I think our voices work so well together.’ Of course, Agnetha is not the only Seventies star making a comeback. David Bowie has just released an album and a single. Fleetwood Mac are back on the road. Stars: Agnetha, along with fellow members Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs with Abba . Donny and Marie Osmond have just finished a UK concert tour, a musical event that prompted one reviewer to report that their show ‘was so spectacularly dreadful on so many fronts that it set a new benchmark in light entertainment atrocities’. A reminder, if any was needed, that a tiptoe down the path of return is fraught with peril. Sometimes we like our pop gods fossilised in the past, a lovely fly caught in the amber of our memories. Often we don’t want them to come back at all, ruining everything by reminding us all of how old we’ve become — and disappointing devotees by being not much more than diluted, lumbago-racked versions of their former glories. Collaboration: Agnetha's new album, her first for nine years, includes a duet with Gary Barlow . For fans will always compare the older celebrity with their younger selves — and few come off better in the evaluation. It is even worse for Agnetha, who wasn’t just a star, but a member of one of the most successful bands in pop history. Along with fellow members Bjorn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, Abba unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs that became hits all around the world. Famously, they were two married couples when they first topped the charts. After having two children, Agnetha and Bjorn split up in 1979, followed by Benny and Anni-Frid three years later. Yet the break-ups led only to more hits, with the poppier songs of the early years being replaced by more introspective numbers. Six years ago, Universal Records, estimated they had sold more than 370 million albums — quite staggering. New audiences and Mamma Mia! the musical, launched in 1999, have kept them in the public eye. So what is Agnetha’s new music like? The good news is that When You Really Loved Someone is going to be a big, big hit. There are, in the modern fashion, layers of electronic lushness over a moody, bittersweet ballad. It’s  got lots of those swooping, big chord changes favoured by X-Factor contestants. Agnetha’s voice is as lovely as ever, even if at first you would struggle to recognise it as hers. Then that wistful edge kicks in, for the tender ache in her voice remains intact; she still sounds hurt, as if somewhere along the line she was burned by love and the cinders are still hot to the touch. The accompanying video is shot in an empty theatre, where Agnetha is sitting in front of a dressing table mirror rimmed with lightbulbs. She looks sad. She looks like Lulu! She is looking at an old photograph, and singing to an actress playing a version of her younger self in flashbacks. What is she singing about? Married: Agnetha Faltskog and husband Bjorn Ulvaeus, one half of the pop group Abba . ‘Gee, I made some fashion shockers . ‘Wish I hadn’t worn those knickerbockers.’ No, I’m afraid I made that up. Agnetha is singing about love, she is sweating the big stuff. She is going on about soul searching, hearts broken, crying in the dark, time passing and that kind of baloney. What is going on in flashback? Boy is happy with girl, something goes wrong, boy leaves girl. Are the young couple in the video supposed to be Young Agnetha and Young Bjorn? I think that’s what we are meant to conclude. Young Agnetha puts on a beany hat and looks unhappy. 'There are periods in your life when you . have to take care of yourself, and things happen and you have to be . alone and have things quiet around you for a while' - Agnetha Faltskog . Real Agnetha wanders onto the stage in the empty theatre and carries on singing. And wow. She looks sensational. Nipped-in jacket, wafty chiffon blouse, black sequinned leggings, tight boots. No Spandex, thank goodness. A light touch with the lip gloss. No sign of a catsuit, praise the Lord. For looking back now at old Abba videos, we can see with hindsight that Agnetha was a blonde with  a bad haircut, a snub nose and terrible clothes sense, but she was so hot. In the old days, men  dissolved into puddles in her presence. Along with Anni-Frid, who had a darker beauty, they were the It-girls of the pop world. No one understood what these two ‘glamazon’ gorgeous gals were doing with those two hairy little midgets. And in the end, it was clearly something they wondered themselves. Style: Throughout the 70s, Agnetha never committed the sin of simplicity when it came to her dress-sense . When Abba ended, Agnetha had a solo career of sorts — a few little hits, nothing major. She married briefly for a second time, then retired to grow crisp breads or something on her island. Not much was heard of her. Until today. In an interview with Swedish Radio’s P4 Extra programme this week, . Agnetha explained that her newly-invigorated musical career was a long process. She never ‘closed any doors’, was impressed with Elofsson’s songs and felt she could not say no. A recluse? She says not. ‘There are periods in your life when you have to take care of yourself, and things happen and you have to be alone and have things quiet around you for a while,’ she explained. This situation was not helped by her fear of flying, which followed a traumatic experience during one of the Abba tours. Although she had therapy to deal with that, Agnetha has left the days of live performance behind her, which seems to rule out an Abba reunion any time soon. Agnetha also cheerfully admitted to taking two singing lessons to get her voice back in shape. She wrote one of the songs on the album herself. It is called I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed. What? Slippers? False teeth? Her old platform boots? A pair of axes? A bottle of vodka and a packet of crisps? Two mice in a cage?  Emergency pairs of big pants? The mind boggles. Miss Faltskog is giving nothing away, so fans will have to wait until May to find out. In the meantime, I really hope the new album does not disappoint. For I can still remember all the lyrics to the Abba hits, that sound as freshly minted today as they were when they were first recorded. It is a big legacy to live up to. I also remember saving and saving and saving the wages earned from my Saturday job in a hairdresser’s to buy a pair of pink pearlised leather boots just like hers. Please. It was the Seventies. Yet it would be awful if, at this stage of our lives — for both of our sakes — the new Lulu-alike Agnetha produced something that was just . . . ordinary.","Agnetha Faltskog has been tempted out of retirement .

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 19:52 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 15 March 2013 . Hailing a cab just got a little bit tougher. More people moved into New York City in 2012 than moved out, marking the first time that’s happened in more than 60 years. The city’s population is at an all-time high, with an estimated 8,336,697 residents living in its five boroughs, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Some 12,200 more people moved into the city than left it, with large immigrant populations adding to the city’s ever-changing dynamic. Another hundred people: New Yorkers walk through Manhattan's Financial District today; new statistics show more people moved into New York City than out of it last year for the first time in more than 60 years . City of strangers: People fill a sidewalk on Wall Street today; the city's population grew by about 12,000, according to Census data . All five of the city's boroughs gained residents, Bloomberg said, using the latest estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Speaking at a news conference Thursday, he added the moderate boom ‘reverses a trend that has been a fact of life for decades and that a number of pundits have talked about when they predicted the end of New York City.’ The urban flight started slowly in the years after World War II and reached its zenith in the 1970s, when the city’s poverty, crime, prostitution, and homelessness rates were at an all-time high. The data reveals that the Asian population in the city – which includes immigrants from China, India, and Bangladesh – has risen 30 percent in the last decade. The Hispanic population has grown around 8 percent, according to city planners. Borough by borough, Brooklyn has grown the most in the last decade, gaining more than 60,000 residents. This could be in part because those previously living in Manhattan were driven out by staggering price increases or the desire for more space. Some come to stare, some to stay: Morning commuters and tourists alike fill the Times Square subway platform today . Those who stay: Commuters pass through Grand Central Terminal . Previous population increases have been as a result of a surplus of births in the city. There were also more births than deaths in New York City in 2012, which could have helped the rising numbers of residents. The net influx was the first seen in the city since at least 1950, when the Census Bureau changed its methodology and made it possible to calculate the number of people moving into and out of New York, city officials said. 'This reverses a trend that has been a fact of . life for decades and that a number of pundits have talked about when . they predicted the end of New York City.' -Mayor Michael Bloomberg . The mayor hailed the city’s population increase to a number of factors, including the general climb in quality of living. Crime rates are down in post-Giuliani New York, there is a new booming tech sector, and life expectancy is up to 80.9 years for a baby born in the city. The national average is 78.7 years. According to the Associated Press, there were several population booms following World War II, but ‘white flight’ in the 1950s led to dramatic urban shifts. Families looking for space and privacy left the city for the surrounding suburbs of Westchester, Connecticut, and Long Island. Growth factor: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the population growth is attributed to a better quality of life . During the 1970s, the alarming trend was at an all-time high, with as much of 10 percent of the population leaving. The city became derelict and almost went broke; graffiti tags were omnipresent around the city, and large parts of the Bronx were literally on fire. 'We have many indicators of quality of life in the city - record low crime, record high tourism, record high life expectancy, record high graduation rates, record job growth and more - but there's no better indication of the strength of our city than a record high population and a net population influx,' Bloomberg said in a statement. ‘Generations change, and they change their views on where the good life is,’ he said.","Population up to 8.3million residents in five boroughs .

An elderly war hero was left sitting in a casualty department in his blood-soaked pyjamas for more than five hours while he waited to be seen by a doctor. Rod Gray, 94, had been taken to hospital by ambulance after he cut his head in a fall at his home. After having his wound treated with surgical ‘glue’, he was abandoned in a wheelchair in a waiting area, alone and desperate for the toilet. Two years ago the Care Quality Commission found the hospital was failing in the care of elderly patients, with a lack of dignity cited as a serious concern . Mr Gray, who served in the Suffolk Regiment in Burma during the Second World War, suffered head injuries and shock when he fell . When his family arrived at the Ipswich . Hospital, they were repeatedly told that he would be seen next, but . after five hours they took him home so they could clean him up . themselves. Mr Gray, who was awarded the Burma . Star for helping to defeat the Japanese in the Second World War, said he . felt ‘humiliated’ by the treatment he received. Last night, his stepson Carl Puiy, 55, said he was ‘absolutely fuming’ about the lack of care shown by the hospital last Friday. The retired Suffolk Police . superintendent said: ‘He was on his own with pyjamas and a dressing gown . on. It was not very dignified. There was blood all over him – they . hadn’t even cleaned him up.’ ‘We asked what was going on and were . told he needed to see a doctor. He was asking to go home because he . wanted to lie down – he was so uncomfortable and said he felt . humiliated.’ Rod Gray, 94, was left in blood soaked pyjamas for five hours by Ipswich Hospital . Mr Gray, a retired accountant with the . Eastern Electricity Board, was admitted to the hospital at around . 4.30pm. Mr Puiy and his sister arrived within the hour. Mr Puiy said: ‘At 8.20pm we were told . he was next to be seen.

A Frenchman who ripped a Muslim woman's veil off her eyes was given a five-month suspended prison sentence today. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was merely trying to 'enforce' his country's laws when he carried out the attack in the French city of Nantes. He approached the woman in a fairground in September last year and pulled away the veil that was covering the woman's eyes. Veil attack: The 30-year-old man pulled away the veil that was covering the woman's eyes at a French fairground last year (posed by model) A judgment against him released by the Nantes criminal court said: 'Ordinary citizens are not entitled to take the law into their own hands.' The man, who originally gave a false identity to police, said he was a firm believer in the 2010 law brought in by government of former President, Nicolas Sarkozy. But the judge said that he had acted like a 'vigilante' and carried out the attack solely because he was prejudiced against the women's faith. Mr Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of the French Republic, saying that they could be used by both shoplifters and terrorists to hide their own identities. The defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated assault and apologised for what he had done, according to his lawyer. He was also ordered to pay compensation to his victim, who also remains unnamed, in accordance with a court order. The incident in the Brittany city was one in a long line triggered by Mr Sarkozy's ban, which came into force in April 2011. Previous president: Nicolas Sarkozy brought in the veil ban after describing it as an affront to French principles . Last September, Louis-Marie Suisse, a Muslim teenager from Marseille received a two month prison sentence for biting a policewoman who arrested her for wearing a full-face veil. Under the law, women found guilty of wearing niqabs in public can be fined the equivalent of around 130 pounds, or be forced to go toe citizenship classes. Amnesty International is among human rights groups who have condemned the law, saying it breaches the right of freedom of expression.","Muslim woman had her veil ripped off at a fairground in Nantes .

The newly-announced Pope Francis is the first leader of the Catholic Church to hail from Latin America and his selection is being hailed as a triumph throughout the United States. President Barack Obama offered warm wishes to new Pope on Wednesday and said the choice of the Cardinal from Argentina to ascend to the papacy speaks to the vitality of increasingly important Latin America. Obama called the new pope 'a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us.' 'As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,' Obama said in a statement.

The United States has a significant Catholic population, with Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate reporting that there were 66.3million Catholics in the country in 2012. That figure, originally reported by the Church itself, means that the faithful make up 21 per cent of the country's growing population of 313million. In New York, Monsignor Robert Ritchie of St. Patrick’s Cathedral seemed hopeful in an address to congregants. ‘I know God has chosen a holy father who will do exactly as he was told to do -- feed his sheep,’ he said on Wednesday. The decision is a landmark one for the traditionally Catholic countries of South America.

A selfless father was killed by a road sign after he pushed his disabled son out of the way of an 'out of control car', a court heard. George Tyson, 61, had been taking a walk with his son Garry, 32, when his throat was cut open by a Give Way sign. Teenager Jamie Skelton, 18, is accused of losing control of his car on a street corner and sending the sign flying into the carpenter's neck. The driver, who was 17 at the time of the incident, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Skelton, an apprentice engineer, allegedly drove at 'excessive speed' and careered backwards at about 50mph on to the pavement near Mr Tyson's home in Ulverston, Cumbria, the Daily Mirror reported. Preston Crown Court heard Skelton's Vauxhall Corsa knocked the pole down, but he continued backwards over it and the sign was caught up in the car's wheels before it was flung out, slashing Mr Tyson's carotid artery. Just before he was hit, he had pushed his son Garry, who has cerebral palsy, out of the way of the car. Prosecuter Arthur Gibson said that this was caused because Skelton's car was 'out of control'. George Tyson died at the scene of the incident on the A5087 at Bardsea in January of last year, when he was out walking with his 32-year-old son . He said the sign was 'was flung out like a metal frisbee or boomerang,' the Westmorland Gazette reported. Mr Gibson accused Skelton, who denies the charge, of heading out to test the car's limits. He said: 'He was going to see what the car could do, perhaps to pretend he was a rally driver, driving at fast and excessive speeds, a pattern of driving that would lead to terrible and tragic consequences.' Mr Tyson died from his horrific injuries on the A5087 at Bardsea in January, last year. Skelton, of Barrow, Cumbria, pleaded not guilty to death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.

The U.S. Navy's hottest new ship and the centerpiece of its renewed focus on Asia isn't its largest vessel, or its most technologically advanced. But it has advantages that its bigger siblings lack. The 388-foot USS Freedom, which cost the government $670 million, is small enough to move among the many islands and shallow waters of Southeast Asia, a trait that allows the Navy to train alongside similar-sized vessels in the region's navies and build relationships with them. All this, the Navy believes, will help it make sure the region's critical waterways stay open to the trillions of dollars in oil and other trade that passes through each year. It's an objective so important the Navy is sending the Freedom to Singapore this month even as automatic federal spending cuts carve into its budget.

'We hold our commitment to them, to our area, our theater, so highly that this deployment has not been affected,' said Rear Adm. Hugh Wetherald, the U.S. Pacific Fleet deputy chief of staff for plans, policies and requirements. 'The Navy and the Pacific Fleet are still on watch,' he said. Freedom on Monday sailed to Pearl Harbor, into the prime mooring spot the Navy often reserves for ships it wants to show off. The blue and gray camouflage painted on its sides — designed to confuse hostile small boats and make it less visible from shore — stood out amid the plain gray hulls of the other surface vessels in port. Until now, most U.S. ships visiting Southeast Asia have been aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers and other large boats well equipped for jobs like firing cruise missiles or defending against fighter jets. But they dwarf smaller ships U.S. partner navies from other countries — such as Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand — use for missions like patrolling the seas, catching pirates and stopping human and drug trafficking. The larger vessels are also too big to pull into shallower ports, forcing them to sometimes anchor offshore while in the region. The Navy is sending the Freedom to Singapore this month even as automatic federal spending cuts carve into its budget . The Freedom is equipped with guns and a helicopter and is designed to defend against small boats and other threats. The Navy will later have the option of swapping out its surface warfare equipment with so-called modules for hunting submarines and finding and disabling mines. When he commanded ships moving through the region, Wetherald remembered, his counterparts from other countries would tell him that they'd like to work with smaller U.S. vessels. 'Their flag officers would say, 'Hey, I'm glad you're here, I love your big ship, but can you send us smaller ships? Can we exercise with smaller ships because your ship is very big,'' he recalled. The littoral combat ship weighs less than half as much as a typical U.S. destroyer and carries a crew of fewer than 100 sailors. It measures about the length of one football field — a scale that will allow the U.S. to join countries as a partner. Navy Chief Petty Officer Eleuterio Roman, left, and Lt. Steve Hartley, monitor screens on board the USS Freedom . 'It's a whole different world,' Wetherald said. The Navy plans to keep the Freedom in the region for eight months, though its San Diego-based crew will rotate out after four. Another crew will serve the rest of the deployment and take the ship back home to California. Wetherald said the Freedom will spend its deployment practicing basic naval skills in bilateral exercises with partner nations. Some drills will involve practicing responses to disasters and providing humanitarian assistance. In a few years, the Navy aims to have the ships participate in multilateral exercises.","The 388-foot USS Freedom weighs less than half as much as a typical U.S. destroyer and carries a crew of fewer than 100 sailors .

A mother had to give her two-year-old son the kiss of life when he stopped breathing after mistaking nicotine replacement mints for sweets after an ambulance failed to turn up. Kerry Brown, 27, feared she was going to lose her son, Max, when he collapsed at their home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. Max started vomiting violently after eating the mints containing the equivalent of up to 15 cigarettes-worth of nicotine. However, despite dialling 999, paramedics failed to turn up and after 20 minutes Ms Brown was forced to step in when her son turned blue. 'Disgusted': Kerry Brown said she was forced to take action to save her son Max after they were left waiting more than 20 minutes for an ambulance . She contacted paramedics again but claims she was told that the ambulance would be there in another half an hour. 'I had to blow in his mouth to save his life,' said Ms Brown, who added that she was 'totally disgusted' with the ambulance service as a result of the ordeal on Sunday. 'If my son had died, I don't know what I would have done.' The two-year-old had been watching television at his grandmother's house in Huntingdon when he swallowed the mints after finding them in her purse while his mother was out of the room. Horrified Ms Brown dialled 999 when she returned to find Max holding the packet of NiQuitin Minis. 'All of a sudden he just went really pale, he had no life in him,' she said. He was going blue so we phoned an ambulance straight away. 'My brother phoned the ambulance and they said it was on its way,' said Ms Brown, who has another son and two daughters. 'Then Max got a lot worse so we phoned 20 minutes later and they said it would be here in half an hour.' 'Pale': Ms Brown, seen left with Max, said her son had thought the nicotine  mints were sweets . Ms Brown's brother Lee McCool decided to rush his terrified sister and her son to Hinchingbrooke Hospital himself. 'We got him in the car and he was going in and out of consciousness,' said Ms Brown. 'Then he stopped breathing - I had to blow in his mouth to save his life.' An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said a rapid response vehicle was dispatched when Ms Brown dialled 999 and was on course to reach the scene within the 30 minute target time set for calls of that nature. He said Ms Brown's son was conscious and breathing at the time of the call, which was logged as a 'category green two', - referring to an incident that is serious but not life-threatening. When the family called a second time, the operator was informed they would be driving the toddler to hospital themselves, and the ambulance on its way to the house was called off. 'People must remember that 999 is designed to give life-threatened patients priority. This incident was correctly diagnosed through a thorough clinical call handling process as not life-threatening,' the ambulance service said. Max, who was given emergency treatment and kept in hospital overnight, is now recovering at home with his mother. But Ms Brown said: 'If something like this happened again I wouldn't phone an ambulance.'","Toddler turned blue after mistaking the NiQuitin mints for sweets .

Speaking out: An e-petition calling on the Prime Minister to block Romanian and Bulgarian workers from coming to the UK has gathered 100,000 signatures potentially prompting a debate in the House of Commons . A petition calling on David Cameron to block Romanian and Bulgarian workers from coming to Britain is being signed by 5,000 people a day. So far 100,000 have signed the Downing Street e-petition – and the scale of public feeling means the issue is likely to be raised in the House of Commons. Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, but the number of low-skilled workers who could get jobs in Britain was capped at 25,000. That limit expires at the end of this year. The campaigners want the barrier to remain active for another five years. Their open letter, which is available to read online, says: ‘In 2014, EU restrictions are set be removed, allowing nationals of Bulgaria and Romania free movement to the UK. The move is similar to the one that granted access to around 600,000 Polish immigrants to enter Britain over recent years. ‘Despite Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU in 2005, restrictions were put on the number who could come to Britain. However, those restrictions will be abolished in 2014. Once the restrictions are lifted all newcomers will be entitled to claim benefits, housing, child, jobseekers etc.’ Quoting estimates that there are currently 1.5million people seeking work across the two countries, the e-petition warns the move could put pressure on ‘housing, infrastructure, schools and healthcare’. Ministers have not calculated how many people they expect to arrive next year. But an influx of economic migrants could undermine the Prime Minister’s goal of cutting net migration – the difference between those arriving and leaving – to ‘tens of thousands’. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think-tank, said: ‘This is another indication of the strength of public concern about the risk of a significant inflow from Romania and Bulgaria.’ His researchers believe around 50,000 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals will come to Britain every year from January 2014. German problem: Earlier this month the left-wing mayor of Duisburg, in Germany, warned that Bulgarian and Romanian migrants had wreaked havoc on his town . At the moment they are only allowed to work here if they are self-employed or investors, or if they take short-term employment as fruit pickers. But after January, bosses will have to treat new arrivals from the countries exactly the same as British workers. Romanian politicians have rejected claims that the New Year will see a flood of arrivals. They point to the fact that many have already arrived including thousands of labourers who worked on the Olympic Park. However, both Romania and Bulgaria are relatively poor countries, with a minimum wage of around £1 an hour compared to £6.19 here. Systematic pressure: The e-petition warns the move to lift restrictions could put pressure on 'housing, infrastructure, schools and healthcare' And the UK offers full benefits when immigrants find work, including housing and child benefit and child tax credit. Earlier this month the left-wing mayor of Duisburg, in Germany, offered Britain a cautionary tale. Soeren Link warned that Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants had wreaked havoc on his town, sending crime rates soaring. He said: ‘It is costing us millions and will cost us more. We didn’t ask for this problem and we can’t handle it alone.’ Under current rules, any Downing Street e-petition that attracts 100,000 signatures has to be passed to the Commons Backbench Business Committee and considered for a Parliamentary debate.","100,000 signed a Downing Street e-petition so could be raised in Commons .

Police are looking for a man who deliberately attached a 'suspicious looking device' to a barrier outside a building on Wall Street this morning. Parts of the Financial District in Lower Manhattan had to be sealed off after a call was made to police about a suspicious object being found. A two block radius around 40 Wall Street was shut down just after 10 a.m. Deserted: Although no buildings were evacuated, the placing of a 'suspicious looking object' lead to several streets being sealed off while the NYPD bomb squad investigated . The NYPD Bomb Squad responded to the call but it turned out to be a false alarm. Sources say the object appeared to be a small flash hard drive with a circuit board and wires wrapped in putty, fixed to a barrier. Hoax device: The NYPD have confirmed the object was made of clay with a flash drive attached to it and wires sticking out . Paul Browne from the NYPD said there was no doubt the item was left to cause alarm: 'The way it was done, where it was placed . and its components were done in a way to give the impression of some . sort of explosive device. They probably intended to cause some kind of disruption but no evacuations were required and the street reopened about an hour later.' Lower Manhattan: Wall Street is the home to the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest - the area has some of Manhattan's tallest buildings and narrowest streets in the city . Sealed off: An area of two blocks around 40 Wall Street was sealed off at 10am on Friday morning. The disruption only lasted for one hour before the street was reopened once again . The barrier was in front of the Trump Building which is one of the tallest office buildings in Lower Manhattan. The Bomb Squad 'deemed the package to be safe and not any hazard to community', giving the all-clear. Investigators are reviewing security camera footage to see if they can find the man who left the object.","Device was a flash drive stuck in clay with wires sticking out .

Proudly brandishing an axe in front of his bare chest, a balaclava-clad robber strikes a sickening pose before attacking a teenager with a similar weapon in the street. Lewis Patterson, 22, armed himself with a double-edged axe while high on drugs, and along with two accomplices, threatened a 17-year-old boy who just happened to pass by them. Hull Crown Court heard the gang, made of Patterson, Louis Coult and Christopher Matthews, struck him in the face and put . the axe to his neck. One of the thugs swung the axe, only narrowly . missing the boy's head. Sinister: Balaclava-clad armed robber Lewis Patterson poses for the camera with an axe in front of his bare chest before attacking a teenager in the street and forcing to take out £250 from a cash machine . Behind bars: Patterson (left), Christopher Matthews (centre) and Louis Coult (right) were jailed for a total of 15 years after pleading guilty to attacking the 17-year-old who just happened to pass them in the street . It became embedded in a fence and Coult pulled it free, held it to their victim's face and demanded he empty his pockets. The boy handed over his wallet, which contained £10, before he was frogmarched to a cashpoint and withdrew £250. Despite being arrested and charged with robbery, one of the men, Patterson, 22, went on to assault another victim after being released on bail. He was then bailed a second time and went on the run. Now Patterson and the other two offenders have been jailed for a total of 15 years. Yesterday, the court heard that . Patterson, along with Matthews, 30, and Coult, 23, took M-Cat on . September 20 and hid in an alleyway. High: Patterson and Matthews (pictured arriving at court) took the party drug M-Cat before the attack . Lager louts: Patterson (left) with Coult, who held the axe to the victim's face during the robbery . Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'The victim said he considered trying to run but had nowhere to go and was frightened of what they would do to him if he failed to get away.' It took the police two weeks to catch all of the gang. Jailing each of the offenders for five years, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'This was absolutely disgraceful behaviour. 'You all disguised your faces. You picked on a 17-year-old. 'He was struck and then threatened with this double-bladed axe. He must have been terrified. 'There are aggravating features here. There was more than one offender, the degree of detention of your victim, he was taken off, you wore disguises and your victim was vulnerable.' All three pleaded guilty to robbery. Scene: The victim was frogmarched to this cash point in Bransholme, Hull, and forced to withdrew £250 . Coult's solicitor Paul Norton said: 'It was the first time he had taken M-Cat. The effects of that drug are now becoming all too apparent. 'He has never committed offences of this seriousness before. 'He is remorseful and appreciates what a terrifying ordeal it must have been.' Addressing Patterson in particular, the judge said: 'You committed a nasty assault occasioning actual bodily harm when you still had this robbery hanging over your head. 'You went out and committed this other offence in drunken night-time violence.' Patterson's barrister Richard Thompson said his client was remorseful and was only on the run for a short period of time. He said: 'There was no gratuitous violence used towards the complainant. 'He was simply the victim of a theft of money stolen by people under the influence of drugs.' Judge Mettyear hit out at the police, CPS and magistrates for allowing all three men to be bailed for such a serious offence when they first appeared at court. After their release, Patterson punched a man in Hull city centre, on January 29. His victim had to be taken to hospital by ambulance and received three butterfly stitches to his eyebrow, suffered three cuts to his cheekbone and had swelling and bruising to his body. In 2011, Patterson was sent to a young offenders' institute after pleading guilty to burglary - when he was shot by the homeowner with his air rifle.","Lewis Patterson and two accomplices attacked 17-year-old in the street .

The architect of Google’s Android’s operating system, Andy Rubin, is stepping down unexpectedly after a seven-year stint in the job. The surprise change was announced by Google on Wednesday and could raise new questions about Android’s direction as Google competes with Apple, Microsoft, and other tech companies rushing to gain ground in the lucrative mobile computing market. In his place, Google has appointed Sundar Pichai, the executive overseeing its Chrome web browser and applications like Google Drive and Gmail, to take over Rubin's spot. Stepping down: Google announced Wednesday that the architect of its Android OS, Andy Rubin, is leaving after seven years . Those in the tech industry and beyond have speculated that the move is significant in part because it could mean Chrome’s operating system could replace the Android OS. In a blog post, Larry Page, Google's chief executive and co-founder, credited Rubin, 50, for evangelizing Android several years ago and building it into a free, open-source platform that runs on nearly three-quarters of the world's smartphones and is used by the world's largest handset manufacturers, from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to HTC Corp. 'Having exceeded even the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android — and with a really strong leadership team in place — Andy's decided it's time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google,' Page wrote. 'Andy, more moonshots please! The merger of the Chrome and Android divisions helps resolve a longstanding tension in the Mountain View, California-based company's corporate strategy, and reflects a convergence of mobile and desktop software. The tech giant’s stocks fell by $2.30 on Wednesday, closing at $825.31. When Google poured resources into launching the Chrome web browser five years ago, the company laid out a vision of the Internet and an ecosystem of Google apps based on the Web. Moving up: Sundar Pichai, the senior vice president of Chrome, will take Rubin's place . But the Android operating system, acquired by Google in 2005, has also been a runaway success, enabling third-party handset makers like Samsung to overtake Apple Inc while also spawning a massive economy of third-party apps that are only loosely affiliated with Google. Under Pichai's direction, Google has released several netbook computers using the Chrome operating system. Last month, when Pichai unveiled the Chromebook Pixel, the first Chrome-based laptop with a touch-screen interface, analysts noted that Chrome and Android appeared to be on converging paths. 'You had this Chrome OS and this Android Group that were building in many overlapping products,' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner. Praise: Larry Page, Google's chief executive and co-founder, credited Rubin for evangelizing Android several years ago and building it into a free, open-source platform . Gartenberg argued that despite Android's overwhelming popularity, it is Chrome that remains at the core of Google's strategy. 'For Google, it's not about the platform, but the ecosystem,' Gartenberg said. 'They're more concerned long-term about Google Docs, Google Voice, Google Books, and less about helping Samsung sell more phones.' Chrome, Gartenberg added, 'is the purest expression of Google's philosophy.' Page was quiet on Rubin's future role. Some analysts speculated that Rubin, an executive with a knack for developing products, could take on one of the company's many budding projects such as its Glass eyewear or the self-driving car. 'If he really has the magic touch perhaps he can create something else within Google,' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, who added that it was better for Google to have a more 'cohesive' mobile brand. Still, it remains unclear how Pichai would seek to merge Chrome and Android, if at all. Microsoft Corp, for example, recently introduced its Windows 8 operating system that was designed for both touch-screen desktop devices and Windows smartphones like the Nokia Lumia, while its Surface tablet further blurred the distinctions between form factors. In his blog post, Page said Pichai would 'double down' on Android. 'Sundar has a talent for creating products that are technically excellent yet easy to use — and he loves a big bet,' Page wrote. 'So while Andy's a really hard act to follow, I know Sundar will do a tremendous job doubling down on Android as we work to push the ecosystem forward.' Android is now installed on roughly two-thirds of the world's smartphones, supplanting Apple Inc at the pinnacle of the fast-moving mobile arena. Uncertainty: Some have questioned the future of the Android OS . Android tablets are also expected to overtake Apple's iPad in terms of shipments in 2013, IT research house IDC predicted on Tuesday. But Android's explosive growth - and the companies it has boosted - have also concerned Google's leadership. Rubin himself has warned other Google executives that Samsung could use its heft to renegotiate its ad revenue-sharing deals with Google, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. The re-shuffle reinforces Pichai, a senior vice president, as one of the leading voices within Google.Trained as an engineer in India before moving to the United States, Pichai holds degrees from Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. He joined Google in 2004. In 2008, Pichai aggressively pushed Google's Chrome browser, when Microsoft Corp's Explorer lorded over the market. Chrome now commands a roughly 35 percent market share according to Web traffic analyzers StatCounter. He is also credited with the development of some of the company's most successful cloud-based apps, such as Calendar and Gmail, and has also steered Google Drive. 'Today we're living in a new computing environment,' Page wrote. 'People are really excited about technology and spending a lot of money on devices.'","Rubin, 50, had been in the post for seven years .

Katrina Taylor was almost decapitated by a piece of metal from a central reservation when she crashed her car . A mother-of-four narrowly cheated death after she was almost decapitated by a piece of metal when she crashed into a dual carriageway barrier. Katrina Taylor, 34, lost control of her Porsche after hitting standing water at 50mph on the A14 in Northamptonshire and smashed into the central reservation. The chunk of metal shattered her face, knocking out several teeth and breaking her palate into two pieces. Another cable broke her nose in several places, broke both cheekbones and damaged her left eye socket - causing her to lose sight in that eye. It took two hours for Mrs Taylor to . be cut free from her convertible Boxster following the collision last . April. She was then taken to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where she . was put into an induced coma for three days. Doctors . fitted titanium plates into her jaw and skull while her family was told . there was a chance she would be brain damaged when she was woken up . again. However, ten . days after the accident Mrs Taylor discharged herself from hospital and . a year later she has made an incredible recovery. Mrs Taylor crashed her car on a dual carriageway in Northamptonshire after driving over some standing water . It took two hours for firefighters to cut a semi-conscious Miss Taylor free from the wreckage of the crash . Mrs Taylor, who lives with her four young sons in Desborough, Northamptonshire, spoke of the moment she 'waited to die.' She said: 'The only bits I don't remember are the actual impact. I remember the car spinning out and I just let go of the wheel and said goodbye to the children in my head. 'There was no point in fighting it, I thought ""see you later, I'm a goner"". I was waiting to die. The next thing I remember is the paramedic cutting my clothes off and someone holding my head. 'I was put in the ambulance but then they knocked me out because I was choking on my teeth. 'The . firefighters said by rights I should have lost my head and one of the . officers at the scene said he thought I was going to die. I've had a . miracle escape. But I had to discharge myself from hospital after 10 . days. 'I have four sons, . Alfie, nine, Arthur, six, Arnold, three, and Albert, two, and even . though I was still recovering I had to look after them. 'The doctors had told my mum and my sister to expect that I would be brain-damaged because of the impact. Nursery owner Mrs Taylor has made a remarkable recovery since the accident in April last year . Pictured with one of her sons, Miss Taylor's family was warned that she may be brain damaged as a result of the damage, but 10 days later she discharged herself from hospital . 'I had quite a large wound on my head and because there was front and back impact, they believed I would have brain damage. 'I have done my best to stay in touch with everyone who helped me, all of them have been truly brilliant.' Facial surgeon Peter Stockton said the seriousness of Katrina's injuries were at the 'upper end' of the spectrum he had seen. Since then she has gone through three operations to slowly rebuild her face, including a procedure to remove all of her teeth and replace them with a full set of dentures. She will require more surgery as the head trauma she sustained has also affected her hearing.","Katrina Taylor hit central reservation at 50mph after hitting standing water .

An ex-wife has described the terrifying moment she watched the door handle to her bungalow going down 'very slowly' before her ex husband burst in and tried to kill her. Debbie Walerysiak was sitting in the kitchen of her home in Woodplumpton, near Preston, when ex-husband Paul Walerysiak launched his vicious attack. He has now been jailed for 18 years for the attack which happened in September last year, 10 years after they split up. She said she was sitting at the kitchen table in her bungalow when Walerysiak arrived at her home. 'I turned to my right where the back . door is and I thought I could see the handle going down very slowly,' she said. Paul Walerysiak (left) tried to kill his ex-wife Debbie (right) in a frenzied knife attack 10 years after they split up . 'I kept my eye on the handle and . started to get out of the chair, walking towards the door. I started . panicking a little. I'm talking seconds. 'I moved over to the door. I could see . the handle going down further. I did realise there was a person through . the glass. Within seconds I realised it was my ex-husband. 'He burst in and he was swearing at . me. I didn't know if there was anything in his hand. It was very . frenzied, very quick. I didn't know what was happening. I moved around . the kitchen table. I ended up on the floor. He was hurting me. 'I just thought he was punching me - I . didn't know what was going on. I felt like I was being pummelled. He . never let up from the minute he came through the door. It was . relentless. I knew by all this bleeding I could feel that I could end up . getting killed.' When the attack finally came to an end, Mrs Walerysiak went round the house locking all the doors and windows as she waited for the emergency services to arrive. Preston Crown Court heard that the couple married in 1985 but split up 'out of the blue' in 2002 when he sold his business to buy the bungalow and renovate it. She said that there had been no previous history of domestic violence and Mrs Walerysiak described her ex-husband as 'laid-back, jovial and placid' throughout their marriage. Mrs Walerysiak was sat in the kitchen of her home in Woodplumpton, Preston, when she was attacked by her ex-husband . Walerysiak denied being the attacker but was convicted after a trial. He said on the night of the attack he walked to a friend's house only to later find his car had been stolen. But a set of car keys for his BMW were found at the back door of his ex-wife's house. Defending him, Philip Parry said: 'It is not in his nature to resort to threats or aggressive behaviour.

'Looking at his behaviour over the last 10 years in which he has been separated, and 18 years before that were married, there is nothing to suggest that he is a dangerous person or a danger to the public.' Judge Stuart Baker told Walerysiak: 'Clearly this was premeditated attack. 'First you armed yourself with a knife to take as a weapon, you drove for about three miles and you were careful to leave your car about half a mile away and no doubt you would have returned to it if you had not lost your keys in the back garden. 'Your victim was vulnerable the attack came as a total surprise and shock to her because it took place in her home, there was no refuge to seek and nowhere for her to go or to ask for help. 'Your former wife may have taken any opportunity to vilify you after what happened but in fact she did quite the reverse. She told police you were not a man of violence and in your marriage to her she remembers you as being laid-back, jovial and placid. 'If an artery had been severed in this attack her injuries would have likely to have been far worse. Inevitably she will have some scarring and she will inevitably remember this for a very long time into the future.' After the case Detective Constable James Ullystone of Lancashire Police said: 'This was an unprovoked frenzied attack and has been a horrific ordeal for Debbie.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was seen yesterday wearing glasses as he was announced to the tens of thousands of Catholics who flocked to Vatican City. But this morning, the Argentine was pictured smiling from the steps of the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome minus his spectacles. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis, pictured without his glasses, on the steps of the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome on Thursday morning - a day after he was appointed . Pope Francis, wearing his spectacles, waved to the crowd when he was chosen as the 266th pontiff . The new Pope has a reputation for being serious and there has previously been an email campaign  when he was the provincial of the order in Argentina that asserted 'he never smiled'. However, as Pope Francis entered the St Mary Major basilica this morning he smiled and waved warmly to the crowds. In the coming days Pope Francis will be decked out in the regulation outfit of every pontiff. The 76-year-old's current papal outfit is an off-the-peg dress and cassock chosen from one of three vestments laid out yesterday. The Gammarelli tailors, who have dressed seven of the holy pontiff over two centuries, had prepared three sets of outfits, in small, medium and large, ready for a new pope of any size.

A made-to-measure outfit will now be made for Francis I and takes up to three days. The new Pope's outfit will consist of a . skirt of ivory wool, a white cassock with sleeves and 33 . buttons that symbolise Christ's age. He will also wear the white skullcap, a pair of red . leather shoes and a 'mozzetta', which is worn over the shoulders. Six pairs of the red shoes - the . colour to represent the blood of martyrs - famously worn by retired Pope . Benedict XVI were also crafted in advance. The costs of the papal clothes is not made public. Gammarell, founded in 1798 Via Santa Chiara, a stone's . throw from the Pantheon, in Rome, Italy, are known as the 'santari' or . ecclesiastical tailors and work exclusively for the Pope and thousands of priests. The Pope acknowledges the crowds to people who have come to see him before getting into a waiting car . Pope Francis pictured leaving the Basilica will lead his inaugural mass on Tuesday the Vatican said . Filippo Gammarelli said: 'The model . has remained the same as that mandated by Pius IX, more than one hundred . and fifty years ago, and since then all we pack for the Popes responds . to these canons, albeit with some license imposed by the various . flavours of the Popes. 'To Pope Luciani - John Paul I - for . example, we had to replace the white dress immediately after his . elections, because it was wet with tears of his emotion. 'Blessed Pope John Paul II, instead, . was used to ask for light clothing and without sleeves, because he was a . strong, warm, and ""sports"" man. 'It would be disrespectful to reveal . the detail of the costs. Ours is a very specialised craft work, but I . can assure you that the prices are not excessive as it was led to . believe. 'We like to think that we sew the fabric and make the dress, God instead makes the Pope.' Francis I also has his own Papal ring - the Ring of the Fisherman - that is worn on the third finger of his right hand. The ring is cast in gold for each Pope and bears the image of St Peter in a boat. Six pairs of the red Papal shoes , famously worn by Pope Benedict XVI, pictured, were laid out for the new pope . Pope Francis will have his own gold Ring of the Fisherman made. Pictured are the hands of Pope Benedict XVI with his papal ring that is worn on the third finger of the right hand and features an image of St Peter . Pope Benedict in a red 'saturno' - named for its likeness to the rings of Saturn - which is worn by the Catholic clergy . Pope Francis will now ditch his Cardinal's robes for the red and white uniform of the pontiff. The official papal wardrobe consists of various mozzettas (short capes), rochets, which are worn over the cassock, and stoles in red and white and some trimmed with ermine and gold embroidery. They are worn with the white cassock and the white zucchetto or skullcap and red or white shoes. The colours symbolise the innocence and sacrifice of Christ. Tradition dictates that the stole and shoes should always match the colour of the mozzetta but individual Popes can go against the grain. Pope Benedict chose to wear the red shoes in public, even if he was not wearing the red stole. He also reintroduced the red wide-brimmed straw hat to the Papal wardrobe, according to Catholic News. According to the website, protocol dictates in which combination the clothes are worn depending on who the Pope is meeting. When the Pope meets a Catholic head of state he wears the rochet, mozzetta and a stole, but no stole if the head of state if not Catholic.","Pope Francis I was pictured without his glasses at his first mass as pontiff .

Two garage bosses have had to pull the plug on their transistor radio after they were hit with two bills for licence fees. Jeff Parkins and Mick Collinson have refused to pay an extra £43.20 a year to listen to their radio at their two-man workshop after they had already paid £139. The duo have argued that as nobody apart from themselves enter the garage Dickinsons, in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, they should not have to pay the extra fees. Jeff Parkins says he and his workmate now have to work in silence after they were handed the 'scandalous' double bill . Jeff (pictured) and friend Mick's Scarborough garage have been ordered to pay two bills for playing their radio . The two friends have had a radio in the workshop since 1981, but when they were called this year by PPL - who represent performers - and the person heard their radio, they were told this year they would have to pay a fee. Jeff and Mick were ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the PPL and the Performing Rights Society. The Society acts for the writers and composers and the PPL represent the interests of the performers. The men paid a £139 to PPL for the year but were then asked to pay £3.60 a month by the Performing Rights Society. They refused to pay for the second licence - which all businesses are obliged to - and have switched off their radio. Mick Collinson, 56, said: 'It's an absolute scandal. 'So we just put the radio in the boot of the car and took it home. 'It's a very private workshop with two people in it. It is not as if we had a room full of people watching TV and listening to music. Jeff and Mick were ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the PPL and the Performing Rights Society . 'It was just the two of us listening to Radio Two. 'Even if it is only another £40 it's a joke. They can say what they like but it is not as if we have a waiting room or anything else for the public . 'If a two man workshop is a public space what's a car then? Or a 12 seater people carrier? 'It has really got our backs up  and that's why we've taken the radio out - not so much the money.' Jeff Parkins, 59, said: 'It's a fiddle. We have paid one lot and now we've had to stop listening to the radio anyway because we don't want to pay the other lot. 'So now we have to work in silence all day. We have had a radio since 1981. We are two self employed people. We don't have a reception area or anything. 'Where we are we are not going get many of the public down here and most of the time the doors are down anyway.' Mick added: 'Apparently we're broadcasting but I don't see how. Jeff couldn't hear it most of the time because he was working under a car. 'He could only listen when he came up to have a cup of tea. 'No one else is allowed in the workshop area anyway. If they came into the office to pay their bill they might be able to hear it - but only just.' The tiny garage objected to the extra payment, and have now packed up their radio and now work without music . Scarborough MP Robert Goodwill said: 'These musical licensing agencies are particularly aggressive towards some small businesses. 'If they were driving around in a car instead of working on them they could listen to it for free.' PPL Press Officer Clare Goldie said: 'When recorded music is played in the workplace, two licences are usually required. 'This is because copyright protects musical compositions and lyrics separately from the recordings of them. 'PPL licenses the use of the recordings, the fees from which go to many thousands of record companies and performers. 'PRS for Music licenses the use of the compositions and lyrics, the fees from which go to many thousands of composers and publishers. 'These two organisations exist to ensure that those who invest their time, money and talent to create the music people love, are fairly rewarded for the use of their work. 'Research has shown that music within the workplace can have significant business benefits, including improving staff morale and reducing employee sick days. 'Despite being separate organisations, PPL and PRS for Music work closely together and already operate a number of joint licensing solutions to further simplify licensing for businesses.' 'A PRS for Music licence pays royalties to those that have written, composed and published the music and a PPL licence pays royalties to the artists that have recorded the music and the record labels that own the recording. 'For a workplace with only 2 employees the licence cost from PRS for Music would be £3.60 per month.'","Ordered to pay two separate licensing agencies - the PPL and the PRS .

Promises: David Cameron suggested he would never cut the NHS budget while he is prime minister . David Cameron yesterday suggested he would never cut the NHS budget while he is prime minister. He made the claim as he came under pressure from all sides to lift the protection from spending cuts currently given to health, schools and foreign aid. In an unlikely alliance, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable and leading Tory Right-winger Liam Fox joined forces to insist the Government’s budget ‘ring-fences’ were unsustainable. A think-tank report today warns that health alone will account for 22.5 per cent of the total increase in spending between 2011-12 and 2014-15. But the Prime Minister insisted he would not countenance cutting health spending. And despite a growing Cabinet revolt, Downing Street said the special protections for schools and foreign aid would also be extended in the next spending review, to cover Government expenditure for 2015-16. ‘When you look particularly at the NHS, you know that we have got an ageing population. There is massive pressure on the NHS, more expensive treatments and drugs are coming through, and I just don’t believe it is practical or right to cut the NHS,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘There are many good suggestions coming from many quarters. As prime minister I am never short of advice. But there’s one piece of advice I won’t take and that’s the piece of advice that says you ought to cut the National Health Service budget. ‘We made a very clear promise before the last election that yes, we were going to have to take difficult decisions, yes we were going to have to make some very difficult and painful cuts, but we wouldn’t cut the NHS budget. I think it’s really important for people to know that.’ He added: ‘I don’t deny for one moment we’ve had to take difficult decisions; we are in a tough economic environment. I want people to know as we go through that tough economic environment the NHS is going to be there for them. In an unlikely alliance, Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable and leading Tory Right-winger Liam Fox joined forces to insist the Government’s budget ‘ring-fences’ were unsustainable . ‘The NHS is not going to be cut by this government.’ But Dr Fox, the former defence secretary who is tipped for a return to the Cabinet, suggested there should be a public spending freeze of between three and five years, and challenged Mr Cameron’s decision to protect certain budgets. ‘We must also ask whether ring-fencing departmental budgets makes sense in a period of prolonged austerity,’ he said. He also backed Mr Cable’s call for pensioner benefits, such as the winter fuel allowance, free bus pass and TV licence, to be reviewed. On ring-fencing the Business Secretary yesterday warned: ‘It means that all future pressures then come on things like the Army, the police, local government, skills and universities. So you get a very unbalanced approach to public spending.’ A report from the centre-Right think-tank Reform says today that the ring-fences on key areas of spending mean Chancellor George Osborne was operating ‘with one hand tied behind his back’. It said the Prime Minister could not reasonably continue to rule out reducing spending on the NHS, pensioner benefits and schools. James Zuccollo, senior economist at Reform, said: ‘The UK’s problems with overspending will not be addressed without a new approach. 'The problems facing the public finances are structural and they require structural solutions.’","Vince Cable and Liam Fox joined forces to insist budget 'ring-fences' were unsustainable .

Solicitors and insurers were at loggerheads today over who is to blame for the growing £2billion a year ‘whiplash epidemic’ that is driving up the cost of cover for millions of motorists and adding £90 to the average policy. The insurers pinned the blame on drivers exploiting whiplash as ‘the fraud of choice’ or using lawyers to pursue dubious claims to win massive pay-outs. But lawyers hit back saying it was the insurers themselves who had a vested interest and that their plans would simply boost their own profits while limiting the rights of innocent motorists suffering genuine whiplash injuries. The Association of British Insurers has said 'whiplash claims cost £2 billion a year, adding an extra £90 a year to the average motor insurance premium' (file picture) The ‘spotlight’ should now be turned on insurers to ensure that insurers pass on savings to customers, said the solicitors. The row broke out as the Association of British Insurers (ABI) published its own ideas to ministers to ‘curb the UK’s whiplash epidemic’ in response to a Government consultation on the issue. The ABI said anyone claiming whiplash injury should be required to undergo examination by an independently accredited medical expert with no links to the claimant’s solicitors: ‘Any claimant whose whiplash claim is in part exaggerated or made up should automatically have their entire claim dismissed.’ It noted: ‘Whiplash claims cost £2 billion a year, adding an extra £90 a year to the average motor insurance premium’. But the Motor Accident Solicitors Society (MASS) retorted by saying the ABI’s proposals ‘would restrict access to justice’. The solicitors fear there is a ‘severe risk’ that impending reforms aimed at bringing down costs in the motor accident claims system ‘will distort the balance of rights between claimants and defendants’. The ABI said anyone claiming whiplash injury should be required to undergo examination by an independently accredited medical expert (file picture) It adds: 'The ABI’s proposals would further restrict access to the independent legal advice that accident victims need while at the same time generating greater profit for insurers.’ The lawyers also took offence at any suggestion that lawyers were in anyway colluding with ‘exaggerated claims.’ MASS Chairman Craig Budsworth said: 'The ABI’s sweeping statements about dismissing claims where there is any suspected exaggeration is disingenuous and frankly unhelpful. It demonstrates that insurers know very little about how lawyers work with their clients to put forward an honest case or the nature of living with a whiplash injury.’ He said: 'The whole industry wants to see insurance premiums come down. The spotlight must now turn to the insurance industry, to ensure that they fulfil their promise to pass on the savings they are going to make to their customers.’ But James Dalton, the ABI’s Assistant Director of Motor and Liability insisted: 'We believe our proposals offer the best cure for the UK’s whiplash epidemic. Insurers want to make it simpler and quicker for genuine whiplash claimants to get fair compensation. But whiplash is notoriously difficult to diagnose, which means that for too many people it has become the fraud of choice.’ He added: 'Our proposals will ensure better medical assessment of whiplash claims, offer a quick, simple way of paying genuine claims, provide certainty for claimants and compensators and deter fraud that ends up being paid for through higher motor insurance premiums.'","Insurers claim drivers exploit whiplash as 'fraud of choice'

Millions of families will be no better off in 2015 than they were in 2000 due to a devastating attack on household finances, according to Britain’s leading think tank. The average worker will have suffered the worst squeeze on incomes in memory by the time of the next General Election, warns the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Its bleak assessment comes less than a week before the Budget and piles pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to take radical action to jump-start the economy. Strain: There has been no real growth in income since 2000, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, putting pressure on ordinary hard-working families . There are record numbers in work in Britain, with nearly 30million in employment even despite the mounting risk of a triple-dip recession. But workers’ real pay – what they earn after inflation – is plummeting as families around the country are hammered by paltry pay rises, soaring household bills and inflation, tax hikes and benefit cuts. Speaking to the Daily Mail, IFS director Paul Johnson said the 15-year assault on living standards was unheard of. ‘It is unprecedented that people are getting worse off year on year,’ he said. ‘And we reckon that by 2015 the average person will be no better off than they were at the turn of the century. Fifteen years without real income growth is unprecedented, at least in living memory.’ Average incomes continued to rise, albeit slowly, even after the start of the credit crunch in 2008. Anger: Off-duty police officers take part in a protest against wage caps, pension reforms and other austerity measures . But real pay fell by 3.7 per cent in the 2010-11 tax year – the biggest drop since 1981, according to the IFS. Spending power fell again last year and is set to fall this year and next with living standards only expected to start rising again in 2014-15. It means that once the higher cost of living has been taken into account, the average worker in Britain will have no more to spend in 2015 than they did at the turn of the century – signalling a decade-and-a-half of pain for millions of households. Mr Johnson said not all of the squeeze was down to the Government as it tries to balance the books. Squeeze: The IFS says 15 years without real income growth is 'unprecedented' ‘The really key thing about what has been happening over three years is that real earnings have been falling,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘This squeezed middle is squeezed because their earnings are falling – not because of higher taxes or lower benefits.’ Inflation has been above the 2 per cent target since late 2009 and the Bank of England does not expect it to return to that level until 2016. There is also pressure from the increase in VAT to 20 per cent, the loss or cut in child benefit for more than one million families and changes to tax credits. Of those changes, Mr Johnson said: ‘Families with children have been hit significantly harder than families without children.’","Tax and bill rises and benefit cuts hitting ordinary Britons hard .

A Mother who posed as her 11-year-old daughter to trap an internet predator told last night of her shock after hearing he had walked free from court. Matthew Jenart, 28, dodged jail after he admitted targeting the girl on Facebook and sending her messages asking for ‘naked fun’. Yesterday the unemployed loner said he had ‘expected’ to go to jail for his actions, which can carry a maximum sentence of 14 years. Online predator: Matthew Jenart pretended to be a 15-year-old on his Facebook profile, left, when he was in fact 28, as seen outside court, right . In a series of shocking messages, he . posed as a local 15-year-old boy and asked for ‘naughty fun’, adding, . ‘try it you will like it’. But despite knowing his intended . target was only 11, Jenart was allowed to walk free after Teesside Crown . Court Recorder Robert Adams said he could not be sure of his . intentions. Jenart is now back at his home, which is within driving distance of his . victim – and yesterday his Facebook page was still active. The Mail has campaigned for ministers to create more stringent legislation to protect youngsters online. The shocked mother's youngster told her about the messages (posed by model) Last night, the girl’s mother hit out at the judge’s decision to spare . Jenart from jail and said the exchange had left her feeling ‘physically . sick’. She said: ‘It’s very disappointing that he didn’t go to prison. I was . hoping he would be behind bars where he can’t be a danger to any other . young girls. ‘I’m surprised the judge said he wasn’t sure of his intentions. I was . the one on the receiving end of his messages and they seemed pretty . clear to me. ‘I had everything there in black and white, all the evidence the police . needed and I hoped that would result in him going to prison. ‘What more do they need? Do they need a child to be molested or murdered before they take action?’ The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, managed to trap Jenart . when he contacted her daughter on  Facebook in December. The court heard how she had only allowed her daughter to use the social . networking site on the condition she give her mother access to all her . messages and ‘friend’ requests. Posing as her daughter, the woman made it clear that she was just 11 – but Jenart still bombarded her with perverted messages. The girl’s mother was so sickened by the conversation that she called . police, who were then able to track Jenart down from his online profile. After his arrest, the former hotel worker of Thornaby, Teesside, claimed . he would not have taken matters further and it had just been a joke. Teesside Crown Court heard how the unemployed hotel worker claimed he was 15-years-old when he was online . When officers accessed his account, it was revealed he had also contacted other young girls online. Mr Recorder Adams, a former serviceman who became a lawyer in 1993, called the behaviour ‘bizarre’ and ‘disgusting’. However, he said: ‘In this case, it is not clear precisely what you were attempting to incite her to do.’ He sentenced Jenart to a three-year community order after he admitted attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. Jenart was also put on the sex offenders’ register for five years, . ordered to undergo a treatment programme and will be banned from working . with children. Speaking to the Mail after the case, Jenart said: ‘I am . sorry for what I did. I know I did wrong. I was expecting to go to jail, . I’m glad that didn’t happen.’ The case has alarming parallels with that . of Ashleigh Hall from nearby Darlington, Co Durham, who was 17 when she . was abducted and killed by online predator Peter Chapman. The girl’s mother said it was that case that made her take the perverted . messages so seriously – as she knew he had contacted other girls in the . area. Facebook only allows children over the age of 13 to have an account, but . many youngsters get around the rules by lying about their date of . birth. Last night the mother of the 11-year-old added: ‘Cases like these show . why parents have to be so careful. In our family we insist on complete . trust and honesty, which means there are no secrets. ‘I’m so glad that I was cautious, it’s terrifying to think what might have happened if I had not. ‘When my daughter asked to join Facebook I had some reservations about . it, but like many parents in that situation I didn’t want her to feel . excluded from her friends who were on it. More should be done by the . Government to protect youngsters online, as it’s really hard for parents . to monitor them. ‘The Daily Mail’s campaign is a great idea, I give it 110 per cent of my support.’","Matthew Jenart, 28, pestered an 11-year-old girl for 'naughty' and 'naked fun'

A rescue fund for Britain’s high streets championed by retail guru Mary Portas has gone almost completely unspent, it emerged today. Councils have spent just seven per cent of more than £7million assigned to turn around struggling town centres. Town halls were today accused of ‘fiddling while Rome burns’ at a time when one in seven shops is standing empty. Retail guru Mary Portas was tasked by the government to help revive town centres but little of the funding given to the councils has been spent . The High Street Innovation Fund was set up in response to Portas’ review of what could be done to boost struggling shopping areas. In all 100 councils were given a share of £10million. But a survey of 72 councils reveals 47 have not spent any money at all. Of the £7.2million shared between them, they have spent just £519,363. Ms Portas once said the money should not be ‘spent by the usual suspects sitting round a table planning Christmas decorations’. But it emerged today that the public money has been spent hiring reindeers and a Father Christmas. Kingston upon Hull spent £5,563 on a nativity street theatre, while the Vale of White Horse splashed out £1,000 on reindeer and £485 on a children’s farm for a Christmas Extravaganza, The Independent reported. Sensibe spending? One council spent £1,000 of its funding to bring in reindeer while another hired someone wearing a Eppa Pig costume . Retailer Paul Turner-Mitchell, who uncovered the data through Freedom of Information requests, said: ‘It’s hard to see how council spending from this fund is encouraging innovation. Councils are continuing to throw taxpayers’ money at the same stale ideas they’ve been peddling for years. ‘They really are just fiddling while Rome burns and the fact that it’s being done under the banner of “innovation” adds insult to injury.’ Wyre Forest District Council spent £12,000 on bringing 10 empty shops back into use. But a different council spent £10,900 on Christmas lights, while another authority spent £10,038 on a train station ramp. Meanwhile, Swale Borough Council in Kent spent £164.60 on a snow machine. One in seven shops is empty, according to the Local Data Company, up from fewer than one in 30 in 2008 . Mr Turner-Mitchell told the BBC: ‘It's hardly what Mary Portas would call game-changing stuff. It's very worrying seeing an innovation fund being used for tired, unoriginal ideas.’ The latest revelations come after criticism levelled at 12 so-called Portas Pilots, set up as trailblazers for the Portas reforms. Traders in the seaside resort of Margate in Kent, which won a £100,000 government grant, claimed the town's high street is now in a worse state than when she arrived to help, as the Government-appointed 'retail tzar', six months ago. And last month it emerged Dartford Council spent £1,160 hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, £317.46 on items from Waitrose, £5,983 on newspaper surveys and £1,317 on surveys. The council said the Peppa Pig outfit was a proven way to attract crowds. High hopes: Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Mary Portas as his high street tsar in May 2011 . The Department for Communities and Local Government insisted the government was working to turn around town centres. A spokesman said: 'We are absolutely committed to reviving the nation's high streets which . is why we gave the 100 councils with the highest numbers of empty . properties a share of £10million to attract new businesses into their . areas. 'We've also extended small business rate relief to help small shops and . small firms and have simplified planning restrictions to allow new . businesses to set up on high streets. 'We would rather councils spend this money strategically and wisely, to . ensure long term success for our High Streets, than rush to spend it and . waste taxpayers' money in the process.'","TV retail guru was hired by the government to draw up a battle plan to save town centres .

A suspect accused of fatally shooting four people and injuring two more in upstate New York on Wednesday was killed after a 19-hour standoff with law enforcement. Officers stormed the abandoned bar in downtown Herkimer where the suspect, 64-year-old Kurt Myers, was holed up after Myers opened fire on a canine unit, killing an FBI dog, around 8 a.m. on Thursday. 'This morning, law enforcement officials entered the building and, after being fired upon, shot and killed the suspect, Kurt Myers,' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Thursday. 'There were no injuries to local law enforcement officials, though an FBI police dog was fatally shot.' Myers' killing rampage had started early Wednesday after he allegedly ignited a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk, which is about 80 miles northeast of Albany. Myers then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, who were identified as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer. The shop's owner, John Seymour, and another customer, Dan Haslauer, were listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital. Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said the gunman then drove to . Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Thomas . Stefka, an employee, and Michael Renshaw, a customer who was a 23-year . veteran of the state Department of Corrections.

Police stormed the building and killed him early Thursday . John Seymour, the barber shop owner, told his sister, Mary Hornett, that the attack came out of nowhere. ‘He just said that the guys were in the . barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, ""Hi John, do you remember . me?"" and my brother said, ""Yes, Kurt, how are you?"" and then he just . started shooting,’ Hornett said. This is the FBI dog, named Ape, that was shot and killed by gunman Kurt Meyers . Hornett said her brother, who was . hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in . the left hand and right hip. ‘My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,’ she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a . couple of years. Cuomo called the shooting spree ‘truly an inexplicable situation.’ ‘There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,’ he said. D'Amico said police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest. Police positioned in front of a block . of small businesses topped with apartments in the village of Herkimer . were still looking for Myers Wednesday afternoon. A local businessman, jeweler Fred . Weisser, said police had evacuated people while Myers was . believed to be in a building next door. ‘They're sending in a robot to check . the place out,’ he said by telephone. ‘I guess we're stuck.

I heard about . five gunshots. I keep hearing them trying to talk him out, but I don't . think he's coming out.’ The rear of the small building at 32 South Washington St.  in Mohawk where . Myers lived was burned out, and police continued to guard the building, . where they found guns and ammunition. It was unclear if they were in . his apartment. Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, and left every morning in his red Jeep. Traci Randall said the only time she . remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her . son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep. ‘He was a great guy, a really nice person.

Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and . had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until . police released his mug shot on Wednesday.

Dangerous: Ibrahim Magag, who is thought to have attended terrorist training camps in Somalia, ripped off his electronic tag and fled . The county’s most dangerous terror suspects could be free to walk the streets ‘unconstrained’ next year when powers used to control them expire, a watchdog has warned. The group of Al Qaeda fanatics includes two alleged members of a gang which plotted to kill thousands by downing Transatlantic airliners and one linked to the failed July 21 bombings. Currently their activities are limited by powerful court orders forcing them to wear electronic tags, obey curfews and report to the police – and restricting their contact with other dangerous individuals. But as a result of a watering down of the legal regime, made at the insistence of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the orders must come to an end after two years. It will mean up to ten potentially dangerous individuals becoming free from all controls early next year. Previously, terror suspects were held under control orders which could be renewed annually, with some suspects in effect kept on them indefinitely. But the Liberal Democrats insisted the regime should be weakened because of civil liberties concerns. Following lengthy negotiations within the Coalition, the new regime, labelled Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures came into force in early 2012. Labelled control orders ‘Light’ they were in some critical aspects weaker than the orders they replaced. As well as being time limited, they could not be used to remove individuals from their homes and send them to different parts of the country. In a report published today, a Home Office watchdog, David Anderson QC said: ‘Some subjects who have been judged by the Home Secretary and by the courts to be potentially dangerous will then, absent prosecution or new evidence of terrorism-related activity, be free and unconstrained.’ Mr Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, suggested the men were likely to remain under close surveillance by MI5. The agency was handed additional funds to help it counter the terror threat after the new regime was brought in. Battle over terrorism laws: Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, right, challenged the strength of court orders leaving Home Secretary Theresa May, left, in a difficult position when they expire next year . His report said: ‘Depending on the risk they are assessed to pose, they could of course remain thereafter the subject of covert surveillance, at least if they chose to remain in the United Kingdom.’ But he pointed out that without the controls, ‘this is expensive and there are many competing priorities for the limited surveillance resource’. The new orders can be extended only if the police or Security Services find new evidence suggesting the men are involved in terrorist activity. Mr Anderson acknowledged the men are aware that if they keep their noses clean they will be ‘free of all constraints after two years’. Mr Anderson said the two-year limit was the 'boldest' change from control orders made by the Government and it was 'tempting, in the most serious cases, to wish for longer'. In December, Ibrahim Magag, who is thought to have attended terrorist training camps in Somalia, ripped off his electronic tag and fled. Of those remaining on the orders, one was a former train driver considered to be a UK extremist seeking to obtain terrorist training in Pakistan. Another attended a terrorist training camp in Cumbria in 2004 in the company of four of the five attempted suicide bombers involved in failed attacks on London in July 2005. Mr Anderson said allegations against some of the men were at the ‘highest end of seriousness, even by the standards of international terrorism’. A Home Office spokesman said:  'Tpims provide effective powers for dealing with terrorists whom we cannot yet prosecute or deport. As part of the transition from control orders to Tpims substantial extra resources were provided to the police and security services to increase the opportunities to prosecute for terrorist-related activity.’","Terrorism suspects used to held under renewable control orders .

The Twittersphere were up in arms regarding the latest launch with one user tweeting: 'The ePad Femme - because women can't work out tablets and are only interested in yoga, babies, cooking and shopping.' Sharlene McGee added: 'The ""first tablet for women"" is as awful as it sounds'. Speaking about the colour choice, Ali Saif Eddin, an electronics salesman, told Gulf News: 'It comes in pink because it’s for women. 'It’s quite fast selling because it’s unique.

A man is arrested at the protest against the shooting of Kimani Gray on Wednesday evening . Police say they came across a group of young men on Saturday evening and saw Gray acting suspiciously, walking away from his friends when he saw the officers approach. Officers say the 16-year old began to adjust his waistband and then turned around and pointed a .357 caliber gun at them. When the two plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire. The teen was rushed to a local hospital but he later died. However, witnesses to the shooting say that the NYPD's account is wrong. Gray’s older sister, Mahnefah Gray, 19, told the New York Times that one of the witnesses of the shooting told her that her brother was only fixing his belt. She added that her brother had too much ‘common sense’ to point a loaded gun at an officer, and doubted that he was even carrying a gun at all. A woman who lives across the street from the scene of the shooting told the Times that Gray was calling out: ‘Please don’t let me die!’ and said the officers yelled back: ‘Stay down, or we’ll shoot you again.’ About 100 people attended the vigil, many of them holding lit candles and some of them shouting before a group broke away and confronted police .

One of Gray's friends, Devonte Brown told the New York Post: 'As the cops opened fire, he was screaming, ‘Stop! I’m not running!’ His friends have not explained exactly what caused the police officers to shoot.

Nurses who can’t speak English are being allowed to work on wards without undergoing proper tests, MPs warn today. They accuse the nursing watchdog of endangering patients by failing to enforce adequate language checks and have asked for ‘urgent’ action on the problem. There is widespread concern that many foreign nurses have a poor grasp of English and some patients report having to communicate by sign language. There are concerns that nurses who cannot speak English are a danger to patients (file photo) Under EU rules the Nursing and Midwifery Council is forbidden from testing European nurses before allowing them on the register. However, the watchdog can instruct hospitals and care homes to carry out their own checks on skills and language before employing nurses. But MPs from the Health Select Committee warn that the NMC is not doing enough to enforce these tests. In a report today, they accuse the watchdog of failing to put in place ‘sufficient safeguards to protect the interests of patients’. The flaws of not checking doctors for their skills or language ability was exposed by the case of incompetent GP Daniel Ubani who killed pensioner David Gray in 2008 . One of Britain’s top doctors, Lord Winston, has expressed particular concern over nurses coming in from Eastern Europe. The peer, a world-renowned fertility specialist, said they had been trained in a ‘completely different way’ to British nurses and were not used to speaking to doctors or their own patients. His views were backed up by Lord Kakkar, a surgeon, who said the situation was ‘intolerable’. Some patients claim they have mistakenly been given food by nurses who do not understand ‘nil by mouth’ while others have resorted to using sign language. Rules from Brussels state that neither the NMC, nor the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, can test foreign workers before allowing them to register. But the flaw was tragically exposed in 2008 when pensioner David Gray was killed by an incompetent German GP, Daniel Ubani. The doctor had been allowed to cover an out-of-hours shift in Cambridgeshire without facing any checks on his medical skills or English language. The GMC has taken steps to get round the EU rules by ensuring checks are carried out by hospitals and primary care organisations. The watchdog has told all NHS trusts to appoint a senior medic tasked with checking foreign doctors’ competence and language. MPs today urged the nursing watchdog to take similar measures to reduce ‘risk to patients’. Every year around 3,000 nurses from the EU register with the NMC. It is not known how many are made to take tests before they are employed. But last year an investigation by the Mail found that nine in ten hospitals did not bother carrying out checks on nurses’ language or competence. Many assumed they had already sat tests for the NMC – not realising these are banned by the EU. Nurses coming to work in England from elsewhere in the world have to undergo rigorous English exams.","Still being allowed to work on wards without undergoing proper tests .

A Colorado judge has ruled that theater shooting suspect James Holmes can be given ‘truth serum’ for his medical examinations if he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity. Judge William Blair Sylvester issued an order Monday issued the court order Monday. If Holmes offers a not guilty plea, he could be required to submit to the 'narcoanalytic interview' as part of an evaluation to determine if he was legally insane at the time of the July 20 shootings. Subject: Suspect James Holmes could be required to submit to a 'narcoanalytic interview' as part of an evaluation to determine if he was legally insane at the time of the July 20 shootings . The prospect of such interviews that may ensue under such a plea alarmed defense attorneys, who filed documents opposing the technique. Suspect: Holmes is accused of killing 12 people at an Aurora movie theater on July 20 . A narcoanalylitic interview is a decades-old process in which patients are given drugs to lower their inhibition. Academic studies have shown that the technique has involved the use of sodium amytal and pentothal, sometimes called truth serum. Holmes, 25, is scheduled to enter a plea Tuesday to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises' in the Denver suburb of Aurora. If Holmes pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be examined by doctors at the state mental hospital. In an advisory that Holmes would have . to sign if he enters an insanity plea, Sylvester didn't specify what . type of drugs would be used but said the examination could include . 'medically appropriate' ones. Sylvester said Holmes also could be given a polygraph examination as part of the evaluation. After reading a draft of the advisory, Holmes' lawyers objected, saying a . narcoanalytic interview and a polygraph would violate their client's . rights. In the final version of the advisory, . Sylvester said he had incorporated some suggestions from the defense . and the prosecution, but he did not address the defense objections to a . narcoanalytic interview and polygraph. Karen Steinhauser, a former . prosecutor who is a law professor at the University of Denver and a . defense attorney, said she could not find any case law about use of the . narcoanalytic interview. 'It comes up so rarely,' she said, adding she knows nothing about it. She noted the technique is clearly allowed by Colorado law. That hospitalization, defense lawyers noted, was separate from an earlier incident where Holmes was treated at a hospital for injuries 'that resulted from potential self-inflicted head injuries in his cell.' The motion said the sheriff's office refused to give the video to prosecutors or defense attorneys at the direction of Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson. Robinson told Reuters on Friday night that he had released a 'relevant video to both sides,' but citing a gag order imposed by the judge in the case, declined to comment on its contents. Robinson said his office had been 'straightforward and cooperative' in the case, and that he would not release the hospital video because it was taken outside his jurisdiction. In the dock: Colorado shooter James . Holmes appears confused while making his first court appearance at the . Arapahoe County on July 23 . Memorial: Tributes are left for victims near the scene of the tragedy in Colorado that claimed 12 lives . 'I told them (attorneys) that I didn't . have the authority to give them that video because it was taken in . Denver and they'd have to go through them,' he said. In rejecting the defense motion to declare Colorado's insanity defense law unconstitutional, Sylvester said defense lawyers had raised the issue prematurely since Holmes had yet to enter a plea, and prosecutors had not indicated whether they would seek the death penalty. Lawyers for Holmes last week challenged the constitutionality of a Colorado statute that requires a defendant who raises an insanity defense to submit to examinations by court-appointed psychiatrists. Defense lawyers argued that the law, which would compel Holmes to provide potentially damaging information that could be used against him at trial, or at sentencing should he be convicted, violated his Fifth Amendment guarantee of protection against self-incrimination.

A number of ‘very high profile’ figures are to be arrested over new child sex abuse allegations, a top prosecutor has revealed. Detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal and other historic sex allegations are preparing a dramatic new wave of celebrity arrests. In an extraordinary public statement, Nazir Afzal of the Crown Prosecution Service said child sex abuse inquiries are a ‘growing industry’ and more arrests are planned for the next few weeks. Paedophile Gary Glitter and PR guru Max Clifford have both been arrested and bailed as part of Operation Yewtree . Mr Afzal, who has specialised in . prosecuting child grooming cases, said those due to be detained were not . directly linked to Savile – regarded as Britain’s most prolific . predatory paedophile. Instead, he said, they were among the ‘others’ identified by detectives as having committed similar alleged offences. ‘This is a growing industry,’ said Mr . Afzal. ‘There are more arrests scheduled over the next few weeks. Some . are very high-profile figures.’ He added: ‘They are people whose names . have come forward because of the high profile of child abuse in recent . months. There are people you will be interested in.’ Mr Afzal’s comments came as he took . part in a London seminar on tackling child abuse, organised by the . Policy Exchange think tank. Historic claims: The Jimmy Savile scandal has prompted a wave of fresh accusations against several celebrities . His comments are likely to prompt a backlash . from showbusiness personalities who claim they are the victim of a . post-Savile ‘celebrity witch-hunt’. As chief crown prosecutor for the . North-West, Mr Afzal is overseeing the prosecution of former It’s A . Knockout presenter Stuart Hall over historic child sex allegations. Mr . Hall, 83, has described the claims as ‘pernicious, callous, cruel and . above all spurious’. Mr Afzal is also overseeing the . prosecution of Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell, 48, who is . charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent . assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges. Privately, a number . of senior police and legal figures were stunned that Mr Afzal, tipped . by some as a potential future Director of Public Prosecutions, had . chosen to hype up the impending arrests of yet more celebrities for . alleged child sex abuse. New claims: Dave Lee Travis outside his home in Bedfordshire yesterday . Dave Lee Travis yesterday insisted his ‘conscience is clear’ as he faced a fresh wave of sex assault claims. The former Radio 1 DJ, who was first arrested in November, was re-arrested and questioned about new evidence by Operation Yewtree detectives after answering bail on Monday. It is understood officers quizzed him about 11 ‘incidents’ after further women came forward. Travis, 67, who was bailed until April, said his reputation has been ‘tarnished and dragged through the mud’ despite nothing having been proved against him. Outside his £1million Bedfordshire mansion he said: ‘The last four months have been extraordinary. Allegations which I strongly deny have been put to me by the police and to which I have given full and complete answers. 'I have fully co-operated and my conscience is clear. They are carrying out a wide-ranging investigation concerning allegations made against many people over many decades. ‘I’m simply one of those people. I ask you to take into account that I was not and have not been charged with anything by the police.’ The original claims against Travis involved two adult women who claimed he molested them in the 1970s and 80s. One was former Sky presenter Vivien Creegor, 55, who said he groped her while she was reading the news on Radio 4. The Magic AM presenter, who was taken off air after his first arrest, said his wife had been ‘extremely distressed’ at the way he has been treated. He added that he has had ‘amazing support’ from many people. But child protection campaigners . believe his comments reflect mounting concern that police failed to . protect young girls from Savile and other predatory celebrities . suspected of decades of offending. Earlier this week HM Inspectorate of . Constabulary warned in a highly critical report that officers had . repeatedly failed to respond to evidence of Savile’s criminal activities . over nearly 50 years. Detective Chief Superintendent Keith . Niven, the head of Scotland Yard’s child abuse command, told the Policy . Exchange meeting, however, that more offenders would now be brought to . justice and said cases being reported to the Met had ‘rocketed up the . scale’ since the Savile scandal broke. Meanwhile, 11 more alleged offenders . have been arrested or questioned under Operation Yewtree, set up by the . Met to investigate crimes by Savile and his accomplices, plus other . historic sex abuse crimes. Those arrested include PR consultant Max . Clifford, comedian Freddie Starr and DJ Dave Lee Travis, who all deny . any wrongdoing. Last night a Crown Prosecution Service . spokesman, asked about Mr Afzal’s comments, said: ‘This is an . operational matter for the police.’ Scotland Yard indicated its officers . were not intending to make any new celebrity arrests, prompting . speculation that Mr Afzal was referring to planned arrests in the .

Three in ten victims of card fraud have to wait for refunds amid claims that banks are dragging out the process. The law states that those who lose money through card theft or cloning are entitled to an immediate refund. However, a study by consumer champions at Which? found a number of banks are guilty of delays, leaving victims out of pocket and at risk of penalty charges. Long wait: Three in ten credit card fraud victims are having to wait for a refund because banks are dragging out the process, according to a study by Which? In some cases, victims have had to borrow from friends and family to pay for food, travel and other essentials. The ploy appears to be part of a trend among the finance giants to try and shift the blame and cost of card fraud on to customers. Some have slipped in changes to their smallprint rules that would allow them to deny refunds to some victims of card fraud. A survey of more than 4,000 Which? members found 29 per cent of those suffering credit and debit card fraud had to wait weeks or even months to get their cash back. It said that Barclays and Barclaycard customers were least likely to be reimbursed immediately, with 39 per cent experiencing delays. Even the best performer, First Direct, delayed refunds to 17 per cent of customers. Banks generally paid up in the end with 98 per cent of victims eventually getting their money back. Which? said this indicated that too many banks are being unfairly suspicious of their customers when it comes to card fraud. Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our research shows that banks are too often failing to refund customers immediately when they have been victims of fraud. New terms: Some banks, such as HSBC and Santander have changed the small print on credit card deals which means that customers must check no one is looking when they enter their pin at cash machines or in shops . ‘With £340million lost to card fraud a year, there are large sums at stake that can leave people seriously out of pocket and unable to pay essential bills. ‘Banks are required by law to give victims of fraud an immediate refund, unless they have evidence that person is acting fraudulently or with gross negligence. ‘They should do everything they can to help people who find themselves in this situation through no fault of their own, as part of the wider big change that’s urgently needed to make banks work for customers not bankers.’ Legal protection: Those who lose funds through card cloning or fraud are entitled to an immediate refund by law (file picture) Santander made changes to its smallprint rules at the beginning of January that will allow it to shift the cost and responsibility of card fraud to customers in some circumstances. HSBC did something similar last year. Santander’s changes mean that customers must have a unique four-digit PIN that is only used alongside its credit and debit cards. Customers have been told they must have a PIN that cannot be easily guessed, such as 1234, 9999 or a year of birth. They must also make sure criminals are not looking over their shoulders when they use PINs at checkouts or cash machines. Any breach of these rules could, in theory, allow the bank to deny a refund. Santander said it was simply trying to help customers protect themselves against fraud and insisted that innocent victims would get a full refund. Barclays insisted the Which? figures are simply wrong and that its greatest priority is to settle fraud cases quickly. ‘In the majority of cases across Barclays and Barclaycard, nine in 10 cases are settled within three days with a selected few going on for further investigation,’ it said. The UK Cards Association said: ‘Customers who become the victims of fraud get a high level of protection from their card companies and can expect to receive a full refund on any losses. 'This entitlement is enshrined by regulation, with the timing of refunds agreed between the industry and the FSA. ‘In some instances where the fraud is complex, the case takes more time to investigate. Notwithstanding this, the picture painted by the findings suggests we have further to go, working with our members, to ensure that customers move through that process quickly.’","A study by Which? found 30 per cent of victims are kept waiting by banks .

A new feature on the Netflix home page has given the video streaming site the authority to name and shame the internet service providers with the worst service. The company launched its own speed index earlier this week, which is sure to make the decision of which internet provider to subscribe to much easier. Featured on the Netflix website, the index is displayed in a ranking system as well as a graph that showcases each ISP's performance, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Data: Featured on the Netflix website, the speed index is displayed in a ranking system as well as a graph that showcases each internet service provider's performance, measured in megabits per second (Mbps) Google Fiber is the fastest ISP by a longshot, with an average speed of 3.35 Mbps. At the bottom of the list is Clearwire, with a meager 1.25 Mbps. A pull-down menu also enables anyone to see the results by country. In the UK, Virgin is the top ISP and EverythingEverywhere is the slowest. The only provider that comes close to Google Fiber's speed is Sweden's Ownit, which processes at 2.99 Mbps. The speed index debuted as Netflix jumped into the social networking arena in America. Another new feature, unveiled on Wednesday, allows users to automatically see what their Facebook friends have been watching, as long as they are willing to open a peephole into their own viewing habits. Living social: Another new feature allows Netflix users to see what their Facebook friends have been watching, as long as they are willing to open a peephole into their own viewing habits . The feature was previously available outside of the U.S. The expansion exposes the feature to a much wider audience because Netflix has 27 million Internet video subscribers in the U.S. versus 6 million customers in more than 50 other countries and territories. Netflix isn't creating an outlet for the 8.2 million subscribers to its steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail rental service to share what they're checking out on discs. Netflix withheld the sharing tool in the U.S. to avoid breaking a 1988 law that banned the disclosure of video rental records without a customer's written consent. Money maker: Netflix investors apparently believe the new features will increase the site's popularity and, by extension, its profits . After several years of lobbying, the . Lost Gatos, California, company persuaded Congress to revise the law so . that subscribers could choose to activate a video-sharing feature. President Obama signed the amended law in January, clearing the way for Netflix to offer U.S. subscribers another way to find movies and TV shows that may appeal to their tastes. In the process, Netflix hopes to deepen subscriber loyalty and generate positive buzz about the $8-per-month service as the company strives to reach its goal of reaching 90 million customers. 'This has been a missing link for us,' said Tom Willerer, Netflix's vice president of product innovation. 'Being able to see more recommendations from your friends can be a very powerful thing.' Investors apparently believe the new features will increase Netflix's popularity and, by extension, its profits. Netflix shares stock surged by $10.25, or 5.6 per cent, to close at $192.36. The sharing tool could backfire if it raises privacy concerns as subscribers discover how much their Facebook friends are finding out about their viewing preferences. Netflix is trying to make sure that happens by corralling the sharing within individual subscriber accounts when the feature is first turned on.

MSNBC host Ed Schultz has announced he is leaving his weeknight 8pm slot to move to weekends from next month. The talkshow host revealed the move to a 5-7pm weekend slot at the end of his show last night, just after his exclusive interview with Scott Prouty, who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's '47 per cent' video during the election campaign. Schultz, who will present his final 8pm show tonight, told viewers that he had 'a big personal and professional announcement' to make and that the decision to change slots was his. Past and future: Ed Schultz (left) told viewers he 'raised his hand' for the weekend move and now his coveted 8pm time slot is being taken by fellow MSNBC host Chris Hayes (right) But the move comes only months after the New York Times reported that network bosses were planning to replace him with Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein. At the time, Schultz described the report as 'media garbage' and he ended up being correct. On Thursday it was revealed that Schultz will be replaced by Chris Hayes, a 34-year-old presenter who has had his own show on the cable channel's weekend morning schedule since September 2011 called 'Up with Chris Hayes'. Haeys confirmed the report by tweeting: . Last night, Schultz, who has presented the Ed Show in various slots since 2009, told viewers: 'I want you to know that I raised my hand for this assignment for a number of personal and professional reasons.

'I want to get out and tell their stories all over the country. 'This show has been a voice for the voiceless. That really was my mission when I came here and it remains.' The host said he planned to stay with MSNBC for a long time and vowed to carry on with his radio show 'until the good lord takes me'. Schultz has presented The Ed Show on the network since 2009 . As Schultz handed over to 9pm host Rachel Maddow, she told him: 'Knowing that you're going to be putting the flag on the weekends in the way that you are makes me really happy for NBC that we've got you for the long haul.' The move comes just months after Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein was tipped to be taking over the 8pm slot, which Schultz dismissed at the time as 'media garbage' MSNBC president Phil Griffin said he was 'thrilled for Ed and happy to be expanding our weekend programming.' 'It’s an exciting time for MSNBC, and I’m looking forward to having Ed’s powerful voice on our network for a long time.'

A family has released video footage that shows a grandfather who was allegedly left to die in the back of a police van, while police officers waited nine minutes to revive him. Lenny McCourt lost consciousness in the cramped cage after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly at his home in Seaham, County Durham on 11 September 2010. The 44-year-old had been pepper sprayed twice during his arrest and was taken to Peterlee police station. Scroll down for video . Anger: The family of Lenny McCourt have released CCTV footage of his death after claiming police officers took too long to resuscitate him . Lenny MCourt's family called him a 'gentle giant, who loved all of his family' Relatives of Mr McCourt have made the 'heartbreaking decision' to release the CCTV footage after the Durham Police officers involved did not face action, despite failing to administer immediate CPR. Mr McCourt's sister-in-law Tracey McCourt, 47, said: 'Lenny could be here today if one of the police officers had done their job and tried to help him. 'It's clear from the CCTV that it took them more than five minutes to take his cuffs off and nearly ten minutes before they try and give him CPR. 'They are trained in first aid but if they aren't going to use it, or even try and get help, what is the point? 'They have a duty to protect the public and they just stood there with their hands on their hips while Lenny lay dying.' Collapse: Mr McCourt is in a bad way soon after exiting the police van . Mr McCourt lost consciousness in the cramped cage after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly at his home . Last November, an inquest at Crook Coroner's Court ruled that Mr McCourt died of heart disease precipitated by the stress of the events of the day and excess alcohol. Coroner Andrew Tweddle ruled his death was by misadventure. The death of Mr McCourt, grandfather to Reece, eight, and father to Toni, 27, and Launzie, 21, came as a huge shock to the family. Tracey, who is married to Lenny's brother Gene, 49, said: 'We were all devastated, we still are. 'He was a gentle giant, who loved all of his family. He had five brothers who he adored. He didn't deserve to die alone in a police van.' The family has released the footage as their own way of gaining justice after they felt let down by the police. Incapacitated: The 44-year-old had been pepper sprayed twice during his arrest . 'People need to see this to show what is really happening when people are in custody,' Tracey, a factory worker, said. 'The way you see the custody sergeant who can't get to the phone quickly enough to phone for an ambulance explains that he wasn't alive. 'Lenny was pronounced dead at 5.42pm but the first family member didn't find out about it until 11.50pm - that's appalling. A Durham police spokesman said the inquest found no officer had acted unlawfully . 'It's disgusting how we have been treated, the whole process is a disgrace. 'I'm a rational person but when you see the people who are there to protect us failing to do that, I struggle to accept it. ""The more people that know about this, the better. 'It's a very tough video to watch, but the police are in a position of power and they need to be brought to account.' The Independent Police Complaints Commission detailed a catalogue of failures by police, including officers waiting about nine minutes before trying to resuscitate Mr McCourt. One officer was given a final written warning and another quit the force over the incident . PC Richard Clark, of Durham Police, was given a final written warning after a disciplinary panel found his actions on the day Mr McCourt died constituted gross misconduct. Special Constable Jeanette Horlock, resigned from the force. A Durham police spokesman said the inquest found no officer had acted unlawfully. The force's head of professional standards, Superintendent Darren Ellis said: 'Since this tragic event we have reviewed our policies and procedures regarding the safe transportation of people taken into custody.

A major victory was scored over the wind farm lobby yesterday when plans to build giant turbines near one of the nation’s finest Elizabethan gardens were halted. A High Court judge ruled that preserving historic settings was of greater importance than meeting renewable energy targets. Mrs Justice Lang said the bid to build four 430ft high turbines at Barnwell Manor on farmland owned by the Queen’s cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, was legally flawed. The future: The National Trust criticised plans to build a wind farm next to Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire . Protests: Peter Stephens, chairman of Stop Barnwell Wind Farm Committee - which opposed the development - at Lyveden New Bield . The structures would have . overshadowed Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire, which has one of . England’s oldest garden landscapes and features an unfinished . 17th-century Tudor garden lodge. The battle to save it was led by the . National Trust and English Heritage, who hailed the ruling as a . significant victory. Conservationists had warned approval would . undermine the protection of other important sites. Peter Nixon, National Trust director . of conservation, said: ‘It is a huge judgement in favour of conserving . our historic landscapes.’ The charity is opposing or monitoring . around 25 applications for wind farms amid concern over their impact on . the countryside or heritage sites. Mr Nixon said yesterday’s ruling . would strengthen its hand in future battles. ‘It sends an important signal that . areas of outstanding beauty or national significance need protecting and . are unsuitable for these developments,’ he said. ‘Although it is not a . legal precedent, this can only help.’ Change of direction: The application asked for permission to erect four turbines just a kilometre away from the building which would have been visible from every part of the site (file photo) English Heritage chief executive . Simon Thurley said: ‘We are very pleased. The effect of the turbines on . one of the most important,  beautiful and unspoilt Elizabethan . landscapes in England would be appalling.’ This week, Trust chairman Sir Simon . Jenkins said communities were complaining almost daily of a wind farm or . housing  proposal in a sensitive landscape. Mrs Justice Lang ruled that a . planning inspector had failed to ‘accord special weight’ or importance . to ‘the desirability of preserving the setting’. She said the case must . now be reconsidered. The Barnwell Manor wind farm was . rejected by the district council in 2010 after strong local opposition. But after the developers appealed, public inquiry inspector Paul .

Allegations: Dr Humayun Iqbal is accused of molesting two junior colleagues at a hospital in Newcastle . A senior doctor groped a trainee surgeon before telling her, ‘well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it?’, a medical tribunal has heard. Dr Humayun Iqbal, 40, had been conducting a private anatomy lesson when he allegedly forced himself upon the woman and tried to steal a kiss before putting his hand down her blouse. When his junior colleague protested and told him to get off, Iqbal is said to have replied: ‘I have to practise for my wife’, later adding:  ‘At the end of your rotation you will be begging for it.’ The woman, known as Dr B, was one of two junior female colleagues molested by Iqbal while he was working as a registrar, a General Medical Council hearing has been told. The fitness to practise panel heard that Iqbal ‘manipulated’ his victims and behaved inappropriately towards them under the charade of teaching. Peter Atherton, counsel for the GMC, said: ‘In each of these cases Dr Iqbal manipulated his victims by the offer of teaching and learning assistance to them. ‘Common to both is the emotional and mental turmoil that they both then experienced. ‘In particular their great concern was how they were going to deal with this unexpected, totally inappropriate behaviour at the start of their careers. ‘Of course they were both anxious to make a good impression on their seniors and equally they were most concerned for their personal reputation.’ The alleged incident involving Dr B occurred in December 2009 after Iqbal invited her for ‘further teaching’ in an empty coffee room. Peter Atherton, GMC counsel . Iqbal asked the woman an anatomy question and when she answered correctly he hugged her before tightening his embrace and then forcibly kissing her, it was alleged. Mr Atherton said: ‘Her reaction  was to object and rebuke him for  what happened but he started to  say totally inappropriate things such as ‘‘I have to practise for my wife’’  and ‘‘well that’s what juniors are for isn’t it?’’ ‘He also invited her to attend a course with him in Canada. When she made it clear his advances  were not welcome he said ‘‘at the end of your rotation you will be  begging for it’’.’ Later, after she moved hospitals, Iqbal allegedly sent the junior surgeon an offensive text which prompted her to make a formal complaint against him. The text said: ‘A good boss is like a bra – always supportive and never lets you down, a bad boss is like Pampers – always stuck to your a***.’ The second alleged victim, known as Miss A, was a nurse practitioner who had just started training at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne. Iqbal was said to have lured her to a lecture theatre in November 2009 under the pretext of ‘demonstrating relevant anatomy’ before fondling  her breast. The woman was left feeling ‘like a rabbit caught in the headlights’ as a result of Iqbal’s unwanted sexual advances and made an entry in her diary saying: ‘Awful day. Iqbal.’ She told the hearing: ‘He was drawing pictures of lungs and different incisions, he touched me on the back first, below my right shoulder blade and moved his hand right around towards the front. ‘He moved his hand from the back to the front, my right breast. I was just a bit shocked. I don’t know, he could have drawn it on the diagram. I just moved away and I sat back. ‘My heart was racing. I felt like a lump of jelly. I knew I had gone bright red, blushing, and he asked me if I had allergies – he touched my left cheek and I said ‘‘no’’.’ Following the incident the woman lost weight, suffered sleepless nights and struggled to do her work, it was claimed. 'Totally inappropriate': The General Medical Council was told at a hearing in Manchester that Iqbal had 'manipulated' his alleged victims by offering to teach them . She added: ‘I just felt very uncomfortable because he touched me. I had . just started working there and I didn’t want to cause any trouble. I . just wanted to get on with him.’ Miss A reported the incident after she attended an interview with a . consultant the following February and confessed her spell at the . hospital had been ‘unhappy’ because of Iqbal. A nursing colleague of Miss A told the hearing in Manchester: ‘She said . she had had a terrible experience after a day in theatre with Dr Iqbal. She said he had behaved inappropriately with her and she was frightened. It had had quite an impact on her. ‘She demonstrated on me what he had done and I felt uncomfortable, she . was touching me in that area so I felt embarrassed, it wasn’t a . lingering it was a hand sweep. ‘She lost a lot of weight and she said she wasn’t sleeping and she was struggling in her work.’ In a subsequent hospital trust disciplinary proceeding relating to both . women, Iqbal claimed Dr B had made ‘profoundly racist’ comments towards . him. He claimed he had only taken her to the coffee room to tackle her . over a complaint made about her work. His allegations are firmly denied . by Dr B. Iqbal, from Ponteland, Newcastle, denies misconduct. The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Dr Humayun Iqbal accused of molesting two junior colleagues .

Children are always complaining their parents don't understand them - and it seems they're right. The explosion in 'text speak' means many are now effectively using a different language. Almost nine in ten parents and teachers say the abbreviated words and acronyms developed for speed when writing text messages have thrown up a language barrier between the generations. And three-quarters said they frequently had to ask children to translate the contents of a text or email. More than two-thirds of teachers also said the terms were now 'routinely' cropping up in essays and other work. Adults reported messages from young children are becoming incomprehensible to them. Examples include a text message a mother received from her eight-year-old child who wrote: 'Mum can M8 cotch at yard?' This translates as: 'Mum, can my friend sleep over at our house this evening?' Other popular words include rfd, meaning after, kwl, or cool, and churoo, or true. Education experts yesterday warned schools' 'toleration' of the terms was 'eroding language'. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Children use text speak all the time. It's incomprehensible to a lot of people but you're never going to get rid of it. It's a social phenomenon. 'The problem is schools go out of their way to accommodate it when they should be promoting the full versions of words. 'A lot of teachers say language evolves so you have to accept it. Fortunately, [Education Secretary] Michael Gove is introducing tests which are much more formal and based on English grammar.' Tradition: Michael Gove plans to encourage the use of a more formal type of English grammar in schools . Almost a quarter of primary school children now go to school with a mobile, according to the survey of 500 parents and teachers for Del Monte. This rises to 93 per cent of secondary school pupils, helping to embed text speak in common culture. After - Rfd                    Oh my god - OMG . Tonight - 2nite             Laugh out loud - LOL . Great - Gr8                   Party - PRT . Before - B4                  Wait - W8 . Tomorrow - 2moro      Wicked - WKD . Cool - kwl                     Hang out - cotch . Mate - M8                     Home - yard . Pizza - peetsa              About - abwt . True - churoo              Because - bcuz . That - dat                     Busy - bzy . Computer - compy     These - deez . face to face - f2f         Hate - H8 . The difficulty adults have with the abbreviations was illustrated last year when it emerged text messages sent by David Cameron to former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks were mistakenly signed off 'LOL'. The Leveson inquiry heard the Prime Minister thought it meant 'lots of love', when in fact it means 'laugh out loud'. A recent Ofcom report on children's media habits revealed texting is most prolific among 12-15-year-olds, who send an average of 193 every week. This was double the amount on the previous year and more than four times the UK average.Even eight to 11-year-olds were sending 41 texts each week. Another survey of British adults found three-quarters believed words such as 'quashed', 'raconteur' and 'diabolical' have become outdated because of texting. Frans Van Melis(CORR), vice president of Del Monte - which is sponsoring the Mencap School Spellathon, an online spelling bee - said the latest survey suggested text speak was eroding academic standards. 'The difficulty is that a lot of text speak is creeping into work that kids are doing in the classroom,' he added. 'Spelling has become much more fluid than it used to be which, on one level, is good - but, on another, doesn't help with academic attainment.'","Parents frequently have to ask their children to translate text messages .

Councils that dish out spot fines for feeding the ducks or putting up lost cat posters were accused last night of using the public as a ‘cash cow’. Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles launched a ferocious attack on town halls for milking residents after a report revealed a five-fold increase in town halls’ use of penalty notices in a decade. Nearly 1,400 fines are handed out every week for petty ‘offences’ such as handing out leaflets without a licence, dropping a cigarette butt in your own garden and overfilling rubbish bins, the study found. Milking the public: Eric Pickles has slated local authorities for their abuse of spot fines . Residents have been fined up to £85 for feeding the ducks, putting up a ‘lost cat’ poster and walking a dog in a banned zone. The report, published by the Manifesto Club think-tank, found that fines shot up when councils introduced targets or outsourced fine collection to a private sector company. Tory Mr Pickles said such practices were ‘unacceptable’ and would ‘undermine justice’. His comments signal that ministers are considering reining in such powers, which have been extended dramatically in the past decade. On the up: Police issued 226,000 spot fines last year . ‘This timely report highlights concerns over the proliferation of fixed penalty notices introduced by the last Labour government,’ he said. ‘Local councils should not be using residents as cash cows and persecuting people for petty or insignificant breaches of municipal rules. It is clearly unacceptable for external contractors to be paid based on the volume of penalties or the revenue raised – this both undermines the quality of justice and erodes public confidence.’ In 2001, around 13,926 spot fines were imposed by councils, mostly for litter and dog fouling. By last year, that had increased more than five-fold to 72,136, including 278 fines for unauthorised leafleting and 2,734 bin fines. The number of litter penalties increased to 63,883. The report includes a string of cases in which members of the public claim they have been trapped by officials hiding in bushes or otherwise out of view waiting for them to commit an ‘offence’. The report also says that police handed out 226,000 penalty notices for disorder last year. Their number has fallen from their peak in the mid-2000s but they are still used for minor offences and, worryingly, for more serious offences such as theft and criminal damage. The use of spot fines by police and town halls combined has increased 16-fold in the past decade. Abuse: The number of spot fines issued have increased five-fold in a decade . When police figures are included, the number of spot fines has risen 16-fold in a decade. Council cases include: . A mother fined £75 for feeding ducks. The official who levied the fine said Vanessa Kelly’s one-year-old son Harry escaped a fine only because he was ‘too young to prosecute’. Mrs Kelly, 26, was fined for being outside ‘designated feeding areas for birds’ in Smethwick Hall Park, West Midlands. A woman fined by Westminster Council for putting ‘commercial waste’ in her domestic rubbish because she had included a single work bank statement. Officials had searched through residents’ bins. A couple threatened with a spot fine for ‘anti-social behaviour’ after they put up posters appealing for the return of their lost cat. Stephen and Heather Cope were told to remove the notices from lamp-posts in Whitstable, Kent. A woman handed an £80 litter fine after her toddler grandchild dropped some crisps on the pavement. Barbara Jubb picked up the packet of Quavers in Crawley, West Sussex, but two crisps remained on the ground. Tory MP Dominic Raab, who wrote an introduction to the Manifesto Club report, said the growth of council spot fines was a ‘troubling development’. He said: ‘We should be concerned by the arbitrary abuse of decent people in their daily lives by jobsworth officials or their private sector agents.’ Josie Appleton, the report’s author, said: ‘Too often, public authorities’ answer to every problem is simply to dole out fines. This is lazy at best and profiteering at worst. On-the-spot fines have their place for procedural violations such as parking, but this unprecedented expansion to criminal justice and the public services is a recipe for injustice and corruption.’ The report found 15 councils have outsourced fine collection to a private company, Xfor, which receives around £45 of every £75 fine. To October 2012 it had issued 43,498 fines and was paid £1.6million. The report warns about the lack of a formal appeal system, meaning people must to go to court to challenge a fine, and accuses councils of targeting the normally law-abiding. Richard Monkhouse, deputy chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, criticised the ‘inappropriate’ use of penalty notices for serious offences which should be dealt with in court. ‘This report highlights that a similar problem seems to exist where relatively trivial offences are concerned,’ he said. ‘Justice should be seen to be delivered fairly, openly and transparently, no matter what the offence.’","Eric Pickles slated councils for using the public as a 'cash cow'

'It’s wonderful to have a coin that may ultimately prove he came to Kenya,' he added. 'This finding is significant. 'We know .

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to explore the region of current-day Kenya, Vasco da Gama having visited Mombasa in 1498. The coast of East Africa was a valuable foothold in the eastern trade routes, and Mombasa was a key port for ivory.

A bagpiper nearly died after becoming infected with a fungal pneumonia that colonised inside his beloved instrument. John Shone spent four weeks in hospital fighting the infection after he breathed in germs from his bagpipe that he hadn't cleaned in 18 months. Medics provided antibiotics but were unable to diagnose the 77-year-old's health problems. It wasn't until they pressed Mr Shone on his hobbies that they were able to identify germs in the musical instrument as the cause. Deadly: John Shone, 78, of Wiltshire, England, contracted a life-threatening fungal infection after the germs grew inside his beloved bagpipe . The College of Piping - based in Glasgow - has now warned pipers to be aware of the dangers of not cleaning their bagpipes properly. Mr Shone - a former committee member of the Piobaireachd Society in the Highlands - was preparing to play at a special event in September when he fell ill during a fishing trip. He was forced to return to his home south of the border in Wiltshire where his GP prescribed antibiotics. The retired food company manager was then admitted to Salisbury Hospital but sent home two days later - only to be re-admitted after a week when his condition worsened. He said: 'I was extremely tired and slowly fading away and my consultant told me it was life-threatening. 'I became very much weaker and it was obvious to my consultant and my son that they were dealing with a life-or-death situation.' Mr Shone's son was asked to bring his father's bagpipes into the hospital for tests where pathologists discovered a heavy growth of fungal cultures. They included the Rhodotorula and Fusarium species, which can cause infections that kill half of the people stricken by them. Traditional bagpipes are made of hide and need regular 'seasoning' to seal pores in the skin that acts as a natural cleanser. Bags made from man-made materials are supposed to have reduced the need for such frequent upkeep - synthetic bags usually come with a zipper on the side to allow access for cleaning. Lucky to be alive: Mr Shone was admitted to Salisbury Hospital with fungal pneumonia and finally released after four weeks of treatment . The piper said he was preparing for an important performance and didn't want to tamper with his pipes as they were 'going well' and so he had neglected to clean them for a year and a half. He also said he had just recovered from a previous illness that may have weakened his immune system before the spores entered his lungs. Despite his month-long hospital stay, Mr Shone has taken up the pipes again but admitted he makes sure he cleans his instrument regularly. He added: 'I am now back playing but it is taking some time to develop the stamina of old.' Robert Wallace, principal of the Glasgow-based College of Piping, said he had never heard of bagpipes causing such a serious illness before. He said: 'It's very important that all pipers make sure they sterilise their pipe bag regularly. With the advent of synthetic bags, this maintenance is even more essential.' According to the National Piping Centre, there are at least 7,000 bagpipers in Scotland alone, with thousands more around the world. Different types of bagpipes are found in many cultures, and some form of the instrument is believed to have been played in the Middle East as long ago as 1000 BC.","John Shone, 77, breathed in the deadly germs while playing his bagpipes .

A Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act if they win they next general election, the Home Secretary has said. Speaking in front of Tory activists, Theresa May said the party could go even further by pulling out of European obligations on rights altogether. She said the party must 'consider very carefully our relationship' with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), suggesting it was restricting Britain's ability to act in the national interest. She pointed to the case of radical preacher Abu Qatada, who was today ordered to remain in custody following his arrest for allegedly breaching his bail conditions, accusing Strasbourg of constantly moving the goalposts on his deportation. Ms May, who is being touted as a possible future Tory leader, told the Victory 2015 conference staged by website conservativehome, that Britain must stop human rights laws interfering with its ability to protect the nation. The confirmation comes after speculation last week that the Cabinet minister wanted to pull the UK out of the ECHR. Ms May said today: 'We need to stop human rights legislation interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration. 'That's why, as our last manifesto promised, the next Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act, and it's why we should also consider very carefully our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights and the convention it enforces. 'When Strasbourg constantly moves the goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like Abu Qatada, we have to ask ourselves to what end are we signatories to the convention? 'Are we really limiting human rights abuses in other countries? I'm sceptical. But are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest? Are we conceding that our own Supreme Court is not supreme? 'I believe we are. So by 2015 we'll need a plan for dealing with the European Court of Human Rights. And yes, I want to be clear that all options - including leaving the convention altogether - should be on the table.' Mrs May said the case of hate preacher Abu Qatada, who was denied bail at his latest hearing today, highlighted the need for Britain to change its human rights laws . Ms May also told Tory grassroots at the London conference that she expects the Conservative's public sector reform agenda to 'become even more radical' and could include allowing companies to make a profit delivering frontline services. The wide-ranging speech, which also touched on industrial revival and banking, is likely to be viewed as a marker of intent by the Home Secretary about possible future leadership ambitions. More private companies and charities should be brought in to run public services to improve quality and end the 'monopoly' of the state, which is too often a 'poor provider', Ms May said. She added: 'In future, I expect our reform agenda to become even more radical. Yes, the state should make sure that public services are available to all and free at the point of use. 'Yes, the state should regulate those services to make sure they're provided everywhere and offer high standards. But too often the state is a poor provider of services, and its monopoly over the delivery of those services must end. 'A future Conservative government should therefore go further in increasing the number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services. And if allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, then that is something we should consider with an open mind.'","Home Secretary was speaking at a Tory conference today .

A man who stamped, kicked and punched an elderly businessman to death in what a judge said was 'a truly awful offence' has been told he will serve a minimum of 26-and-a-half years in prison. Imran Khan, 30, attacked and robbed Panache Lingerie founder Anthony Power in a Sheffield park before making off with the keys to his luxury Bentley. Mr Power, 78, was left severely brain damaged in the ferocious attack and died later in hospital. Khan was found guilty of murdering Mr Power today following a three day trial and little more than an hour of jury deliberations at Sheffield Crown Court. Attacked: Anthony Power, 78, died from the injuries he sustained at the hands of Imran Khan, 30. Khan was found guilty of murder and will serve a minimum of 26-and-a-half years in prison for the 'truly awful' crime . Judge Alan Goldsack QC jailed Khan, of Darnall in Sheffield, for life and told he must serve at lest 26-and-a-half years before he is considered for release. Judge Goldsack told him: 'It was a truly awful offence.' The court heard how grandfather Mr Power had gone into High Hazels Park, in the Darnall area of Sheffield, on October 8 last year to look for his brother, who has dementia. Mr Power's son said: 'The horrific way our dad died will not define his life - 78 years of living life to the full will define him.' He was found by police with serious head injuries and with his personal property and even his false teeth strewn around the park. Khan had been drinking large quantities of vodka and brandy in the park with a friend. He was later spotted by Mr Power’s niece sitting in the businessman’s Bentley, which was parked nearby, and ran off when she challenged him. Mr Power was taken to hospital but never recovered and his ventilator was turned off more than two weeks after he was brought in. The jury heard how Khan’s clothes were found to be covered in Mr Power’s blood. Today, Judge Goldsack told Khan: 'You clearly made a decision to rob Mr Power.' 'Mr Power was not going to let go of his property without a struggle. 'The extent and ferocity of your attack upon him grew as you were clearly determined to take his property.' The judge added: 'He suffered massive brain damage. If he had survived he would probably have been totally incapacitated.' Khan, who also admitted attacking two other people on that night and damaging the home of an ex-girlfriend, showed no emotion as he left the dock, watched by many members of Mr Power’s family. Judge Goldsack paid tribute to the businessman, noting how he had risen from a 'poor but happy' childhood in Ireland to be a successful businessman. The judge said Mr Power had been married for 52 years, had four children and a number of grandchildren and lived for his family. 'He provided employment for many people and clearly ran his business very much along the lines of a further extended family,' the judge said. Vicious attack: Mr Power was set upon in Hazels Park in Sheffield and was found covered in blood with multiple fractures to his face and 'catastrophic' damage to his brain . 'Many people outside the family have felt this loss personally.' 'They all have the sympathy of the court.' Outside court, Mr Power’s son, Danny, said: 'The horrific way our dad died will not define his life - 78 years of living life to the full will define him. 'The countless fun and inspirational memories he has left us with will define him. 'His generosity, integrity and hard work will define him. 'He was much more than a man who just drove a nice car. 'He was fearless and worked harder than any man we’ve known. Robbed: The 78-year-old had gone to the park to look for his brother who suffers from dementia when Imran Khan attacked him for the keys to his Bentley . He added: 'He went from sharing a room with 11 siblings in Ireland to sharing a caravan with my mum in Sheffield to creating one of the leading lingerie firms in this country. 'Within all that work, he was there for us as our fun-loving dad and we will work hard to make him proud.' Detective Inspector Martin Tate, the Senior Investigating Officer in the case, said: 'This was a tragic and unnecessary loss of life. 'I’m pleased with today’s verdict and that Imran Khan has been held to account for his actions. 'My thoughts remain with Anthony Power’s family, who can hopefully take some comfort now that justice has been done.'","Anthony Power was found seriously injured in a park in Sheffield .

Branding agency BBH-Labs gave a mobile a 4G MiFi device to each participant and paid them $50 a day to walk around the SXSW music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, with t-shirts saying 'I'm a 4G hotspot'. It was suggested users paid $2 for every 15 minutes and the homeless could keep all the donations. The controversial stunt was piloted at SXSW with homeless people paid to walk around wearing t-shirts like this . Clarence was one of the homeless people paid $20 a day plus any donations he was given to offer people a wifi service . The daring ploy, named Homeless Hotspots, was condemned by some as 'dystopian', 'shameful' and 'patronizing' last year - but yesterday it was claimed all the homeless people have since used the money they earned to find a house. The participants had MiFi devices similar to this strapped to them which would provide wifi internet access to people on the move at the SXSW festival . According to Front Steps, the Austin homeless shelter that helped BBH Labs run the project, 11 of the 13 participants in the event used the money, sometimes more than $600, to put security deposits down on apartments in Austin. All of them now have housing, Jennifer Denton of Front Steps said. She told ABC News that although there had been controversy during the 2012 festival, the outcome was worth it. 'There was a lot of discussion at the outset, when the program began, about whether it was taking advantage of the individuals. But the individuals participating were really grateful for the opportunity to be productive and earn a wage, and it had this sustainable result,' Denton said. The homeless people stood beside conference goers to provide internet via the MiFi devices which connect to the internet via the 4G phone network and offer web access via a wifi network. The idea was spotted by a New York Times reporter, and swiftly caused outcry. Technology magazine Wired described the stunt as 'dystopian'. Tim Carmody wrote that homeless were turned into 'not just walking, talking hotspots, but walking, talking billboards for a program that doesn't care anything at all about them or their future.' British brand strategist Luke Scheybeler lambasted the idea as 'shameful, hideous, patronising and dehumanising'. Dusty White told ABC News at the time: 'I've swallowed my pride, at first I was a bit embarrassed about it.
