"Marijuana lovers in Oregon had a cause for celebration last Tuesday, as election night saw the drug's legalization with the passing  of Measure 91. One woman was so happy, that she licked a reporter covering a pro-pot party in Portland. KOIN news journalist Tim Becker was reporting live from a party at Holocene nightclub in southeast Portland when a young blonde woman appeared behind him and licked his ear. The hilarious clip has now gone viral online, and MailOnline has identified the bold reveler as an employee at a local dispensary. Scroll down for video . Cannabis celebrations: KOIN news journalist Tim Becker was reporting outside a pro-pot party last week, when a woman appeared behind him and licked his ear . Broadcast interrupted: Becker was reporting about the celebrations after Oregon passed a measure, legalizing marijuana in the state . Challenge accepted! The woman, who asked MailOnline not to be identified, said she licked the reporter's ear on the dare from a friend . The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, says she was standing outside the event space with friends when the reporter started talking to the camera. One of her friends dared her to go up and lick his face, and at first she refused. But the woman agreed after her friend 'double-dog dared her' and the rest is internet history. While the reporter seemed to think the joke was funny, she says his cameraman didn't see the humor and called her immature. The passing of Measure 91 legalizes marijuana in the state of Oregon, but the new law will not be effective until next July. Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize the drug, and Alaska passed a similar  measure for legalization last week. Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana possession in 1973.","On Tuesday, Oregon became one of four states to legalize marijuana .

"A veteran Russian cosmonaut and two International Space Station crewmates, one from the United States and one from Germany, returned safely to Earth this morning at 3:58am GMT (10:58pm EST). The parachute landing of their Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan ended five and a half months in orbit aboard the International Space Station. Maxim Suraev of the Russian space agency, who was commander of the station during the mission, climbed into the Soyuz craft with Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman and German flight engineer Alexander Gerst from the European Space Agency and departed the orbital outpost last night. Scroll down for video of landing . The International Space Station (ISS) crew of Alexander Gerst of Germany (left), Maxim Surayev of Russia (middle) and Reid Wiseman of the US rest after landing in a remote area near the town of Arkalyk in northern Kazakhstan . About three and a half hours after leaving the ISS last night, the capsule descended through cold, windy and overcast skies to touch down on the frozen steppes northeast of Arkalyk. Early-morning temperatures in Kazakhstan registered just -5C (23F), mission commentator Rob Navias said on a live Nasa television broadcast of the landing. Recovery teams were standing by to help Suraev, Wiseman and Gerst out of their capsule, the same spacecraft they rode to reach the station on 28 May this year. The crew's last few weeks in orbit were among the busiest of their mission, with the departure of a Dragon cargo capsule sent to the station by private launch company SpaceX and the arrival of a Russian freighter. The Russian cargo ship docked with the station less than a day after an unmanned Orbital Sciences Corp. rocket carrying another supply capsule bound for the space station exploded seconds after liftoff from Virginia. ISS crew member Reid Wiseman of the US rests after landing in a remote area near the town of Arkalyk in northern Kazakhstan . A search and rescue team approaches the Soyuz TMA-13M capsule with the ISS crew in this image . The three had spent five and a half months in orbit on the ISS before their return journey back to Earth . Prolonged time in zero gravity means the astronauts' bones and muscles are weak on their return to Earth, so they often need to be carried by ground personnel when they first land . 'It's been an honor and a privilege to spend 165 days up here. With that said, I'm looking forward to heading home,' Wiseman said during a change-of-command ceremony carried live from the space station on Nasa television. Two other Russian cosmonauts and the newly named station commander, Nasa astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, remained aboard the orbital outpost, a £62 billion ($100 billion) research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418km) above Earth. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,600 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. They will be joined on 23 November by Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, Nasa astronaut Terry Virts and Italy's Samantha Cristoforetti, who will fly aboard another Soyuz capsule launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The space station, which has been permanently staffed since 2 November 2000, is owned and run by a partnership of 15 nations. 'They say this is the most complex machine that humanity has ever built,' Gerst said on Saturday. 'Even after half a year on board, it is impossible for me to fathom how complex it is to actually operate this machine.' During their time aboard the station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, advanced manufacturing, and studies of bone and muscle physiology. They set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in July. A key research focus during their mission, Expedition 41, was human health management for long duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station beginning in 2015. The crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo vehicles docked to the station, bringing tons of supplies in July and October. The fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle, dubbed the Georges Lemaitre after the Belgian physicist who is considered the father of the big-bang theory, launched to the station in July. Wiseman and Gerst ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions. Wiseman completed a second spacewalk with fellow Nasa astronaut Barry Wilmore. Suraev also conducted one spacewalk during Expedition 41. In addition to being a scientific research platform, the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology. The first 3-D printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during Expedition 41. It will be the first step toward establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing. A new Earth monitoring instrument called RapidScat also was installed and activated on the station during the crew’s time in orbit. RapidScat will measure Earth's ocean surface wind speed and direction, essential measurements used in weather prediction. Having completed his second space station mission, Suraev now has spent 334 days in space. Wiseman and Gerst have spent 165 days in space with the end of their first flights. Expedition 42 now is operating aboard the station with Barry Wilmore of Nasa in command. Wilmore and his crewmates, Flight Engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of Roscosmos, will tend to the station as a three-person crew until the arrival in two weeks of three new crew members: Terry Virts of Nasa, Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa.

"Chinese authorities blocked CNN's broadcast in the country after a reporter was 'kicked, pushed and punched' while trying to cover the trial of a human rights activist in Beijing - and the police abuse was caught on camera by his news crew. David McKenzie was covering the trial of Xu Zhiyong, a former law lecturer, who was arrested in July for organizing protests against official corruption. While walking up to the court where Zhiyong was scheduled to appear, police physically barred McKenzie and his crew from getting close and the situation 'violently escalated'. Scroll down for video . No reporters allowed: CNN reporter David McKenzie was trying to cover the trial of human rights activist Xu Zhiyong when he was physically barred from getting near the court by Chinese police . Evidence: McKenzie remained calm as police manhandled him, and his crew continued to capture everything on tape . Unheard: McKenzie continued to tell the police men that he had a right to report in a public space and not to manhandle him but they did not listen . Removed: They eventually shoved him into a police van where he and his crew were transported several blocks away from the courthouse . All the while, his camera crew continued to film and captured police abusing McKenzie. 'They're physically manhandling us, they're physically manhandling me,' McKenzie said as he remained calm and continued to report. 'This is a public space, I'm allowed to report. I'm allowed to report,' he continued to say. The video shows police shoving McKenzie into a police van before he and his crew are taken to a location several blocks away from the court house. Broken: Once dropped off by police, McKenzie shows the damage they did to their camera's view finder. Luckily the tape remained in tact . During the chaos, police ripped off the viewfinder from the CNN crew's camera but the film remained in tact. A policeman told the crew that they were just following orders and a government spokesman said they would be investigating the incident. After being dropped off McKenzie said that the incident 'really shows how much China wants to manage the message.' In a live interview later on, McKenzie told CNN anchor Suzanne Malveaux that reporters have to be extra careful when working in China. On trial: McKenzie was trying to cover the trial of human rights activist Xu Zhiyong . 'This is a one party state that controls the media entirely on the local level. There's really no such thing as an independent Chinese media within the country. So foreign reports play this role that is trying to get the word out when, say, others can not.' He went on to say that following the incident, CNN's signals within the country were blocked by authorities so Chinese nationals couldn't watch their broadcast. 'Often it's not so much reporting to the rest of the world that's an issue. It's they don't want us reporting to China and Chinese nationals,' he said. Zhiyong was arrested last summer in Beijing for organizing a series of protests in the city about political corruption. He pointed to instances like President Xi Jiping's brother-in-law setting up companies in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands as one example. While not illegal, these cases show how the wealthy in China are benefiting from political connections.","Reporter David McKenzie was covering the trial of human rights activist Xu Zhiyong in Beijing .

"The National Health Service is rehiring more than 50 staff a month who have been given redundancy pay-outs, it can be revealed. In just eight months the number of managers  who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300. The revelation will reignite the row over the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt argues the NHS reforms have saved £1.5billion a year, despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service . Under NHS rules staff must only wait four weeks after taking redundancy before they can move to a new job. Last month the Treasury announced it would claw back payments under future redundancy programmes, but staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post. It has previously been claimed that more than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 are now back working in the health service. More than 21,000 staff were made redundant under the coalition's controversial health reforms, which saw Primary Care Trusts axed and replaced with GP-led commission groups. Each time an update has been published about the numbers returning to the NHS, the government has insisted it is getting a grip on the programme. However, ministers have admitted the numbers have risen again, including 2,502 in permanent roles and 1,870 on fixed-term contracts. Labour frontbencher Lucy Powell, who obtained the figures, said: 'This revolving door is further evidence of the chaos and waste David Cameron's NHS reorganisation has created. 'The health service is on its knees under the Tories. Only Labour will save our NHS.' The taxpayer has paid more than £2million buying smartphones and iPads for bureaucrats in new NHS quangos. Thousands of iPhones and tablet computers have been bought for staff at NHS England and Public Health England, set up under the coalition's reforms to save money for the health service. Data released by health minister Dan Poulter shows that NHS England and Public Health England, both formed last year, were the biggest spenders on iPads and iPhones. NHS England bought 115 iPads and 400 iPhones in the year before it was officially launched in April 2013, and since then has bought another 150 iPads and 1,900 ipads. The quango's total bill comes to £1.2million. Public Health England, also formed last year, has spent a total of £530,000 on 2,036 iPhones and £113,743 on 65 iPads. In response to a parliamentary question, health minister Dan Poulter said: 'The number of National Health Service staff estimated to have been made redundant since May 2010 and subsequently, up until July 2014, re-employed by an NHS organisation on a permanent basis is 2,502 and a fixed term contract basis is 1,870.' Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'This scandalous waste of money cannot be justified when cancer patients are waiting longer for treatment. 'Nurses denied a modest pay rise will find it galling to see David Cameron's been handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired. 'On his watch, we have seen pay-offs for managers and pay cuts for nurses. 'Cameron's top-down re-organisation has wasted £3 billion and left the NHS in a weak financial position. Nurses are paying the price for his mismanagement of the NHS.' The figure has risen by 422 to 4,372 since an update for November 2013. The total cost to the NHS of 'revolving door' payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £48,000, it could mean more than £200million has been squandered on pay-offs for returning staff since 2010. The Department of Health says its 'bureaucracy-busting reforms'  are saving £1.5billion a year, with 13,500 more frontline staff and 7,000 fewer managers in the NHS since May 2010. A Tory source said the 'big redundancy bills are down to Labour rules and Labour contracts - negotiated with Labour's union friends'. Under new rules announced by the Treasury last month, the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay-off. It is expected the measure - which is included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament - will mainly affect NHS and local government administrators. The Treasury said that of the 19,000 NHS administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013, almost 20 per cent rejoined the NHS while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year. Almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures, including the Civil Service, local government and the NHS. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'It's only fair that highly-paid executives who receive a redundancy pay-out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer. 'Reforming the public sector so it works for Britain has been a key part of this government's drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society.' Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust . Among the staff paid off on huge sums before returning  were a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts. Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March 2013. Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished. By June last year both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director. Today it emerged the couple earned a total of £120,000 while in the temporary management posts at hospitals in Leeds, West Yorks. Dia Chakravarty, political director at the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another outrageous example of the 'revolving door' culture in the NHS, which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay-offs and then again in the form of new salaries. 'This is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply cannot afford in the public sector, particularly at a time when hard-pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet.'","EXCLUSIVE From November to July 422 people given payouts were rehired .

"Before President Obama got off the plane in Beijing on Monday, Chinese military officials directed an honor guard to fall in line - literally. Two men were photographed holding a string in front of the guardsmen, to see if they were standing together in a perfectly straight line. Obama traveled to China in order to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. With his influence at home quickly fading, President Barack Obama is looking east to China, the opening stop of a three-country tour that will test his ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office. This isn't the first time string tests have been employed before welcoming ceremonies: Reuters has snapped guards being subject to the tests  multiple times, including before the arrivals of Truong Tan Sang - the president of Vietnam - in June 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta - the president of Kenya - in August 2013, and Angela Merkel - the Chancellor of Germany - in August 2014. Get in line: Members of a Chinese guard of honor prepare for the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Beijing on Monday . Ceremony: The honor guard was at the airport before the president's arrival . All together now: The guardsmen were seen in perfectly straight lines on Monday . Greetings: The Chinese guardsmen form perfect lines waiting for Obama to step off the plane . Once treated like a global superstar, Obama arrived Monday in Beijing under far different circumstances, with his most powerful days behind him. At home, Republicans are still rejoicing at having pummeled Obama's political party in the midterm elections, relegating Democrats to the minority in both chambers of Congress. His counterparts in Asia surely have noticed. Upon his arrival in the Chinese capital, Obama stepped off Air Force One and onto a red carpet, where the honor guard lined his path to a waiting limousine. First up was a sit-down with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, where Obama lived as a child. Widodo, who was sworn in last month amid high hopes for progressive leadership, said his election showed Islam and democracy can go together, and pledged to keep fighting extremism in his country. Obama was effusive, calling his election an 'affirmation of the full transition Indonesia has made to a thriving democracy and a model for the kind of tolerance and pluralism that we want to see all around the world.' Obama suggested Widodo might even visit Washington next year. Reviving a phrase from his youth, Obama thanked the assembled reporters in Bahasa Indonesia, the country's official language. Arriving in style: Obama stepped off Air Force One and onto a red carpet, where the honor guard lined his path to a waiting limousine . Lame duck? China is the opening stop of Obama's three-country tour that will test the president's ability to play a commanding role on the world stage during his final two years in office . Later Monday, Obama was to give a speech Monday about U.S. ties to Asia at a high-level Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, then join key Asian leaders for dinner and fireworks at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. During his three days in China, Obama will also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The leaders of the world's two largest economies will address reporters before the state visit draws to a close Wednesday and Obama flies to Myanmar. The trip marks one of Obama's final opportunities to deliver on his goal to amplify U.S. influence in Asia. In China, Myanmar and Australia, leaders will be rendering judgment on whether Obama's lofty ambitions in Asia-Pacific have been sidetracked by festering crises in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. 'This is going to be a tough trip for the president,' said Ernest Bower, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said Asian leaders were viewing Obama's trip with a key question in mind: Who is Barack Obama after the midterm elections? 'They'll be trying to discern whether he has the commitment and political capital to follow through,' Bower said. Even before the election, Obama's commitment to the region and his ability to boost U.S. clout there was in doubt in many capitals. U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea have pressed for a greater American presence, partly to counter China's growing influence. Yet Obama's mission against the Islamic State group and his government's Ebola response have diverted U.S. military and financial resources elsewhere. 'The president remains deeply committed to his Asia rebalancing strategy, and its implementation will remain a top priority throughout the second term,' said Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice. Not the first time: Guards were subject to a string test before Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya arrived in August 2013 . Prepared: The guards also fell under a string test in July before Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, arrived in Beijing . U.S. presidents often immerse themselves in foreign affairs during their last years in office, when the focus on the next presidential race saps the energy from their own domestic efforts. In the wake of last week's elections, White House officials spoke optimistically about Obama's prospects for clinching trade deals in Asia and elsewhere now that Republicans are set to control Congress. Under Obama, U.S. trade negotiators for years have been pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major trade pact being negotiated with 11 nations. The talks have repeatedly blown past their deadlines, and other nations have been wary about Obama's ability to push an eventual deal through Congress, where Democrats have been sensitive to the concerns of labor unions. But with Republicans in charge, Obama's prospects may have improved, so the argument goes. Republicans tend to support trade deals as a way to boost the U.S. economy, and GOP leaders have spoken positively about giving Obama so-called ""fast track"" approval that would subject the final deal to an up-or-down vote, preventing last-minute amendments that could sink the whole deal. China's not part of the talks, and is pursuing its own free trade deals in the region. What's more, Chinese leaders have viewed Obama's focus on Asia with suspicion, fearing an attempt to contain China's growth and influence in the region. In a sign of the political climate facing Obama in China, state-run media have been mocking him in the days before his visit. 'Obama always utters ""Yes, we can,"" which led to the high expectations people had for him,' read an editorial in the English-language Global Times. 'But he has done an insipid job, offering nearly nothing to his supporters. U.S. society has grown tired of his banality.' Another reminder of the tensions in the region came hours before Obama left on Saturday when North Korea released two American detainees after Obama's spy chief made a secret mission to Pyongyang to secure their release. In his meetings with Xi, Obama also plans to address human rights issues, officials said, including the treatment of journalists as well as pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that erupted in September to the dismay of Chinese officials. Climate change - a key concern in smog-filled Beijing - and China's aggressive behavior toward its neighbors are also on Obama's agenda.","Members of a Chinese honor guard were subject to a string test on Monday, to see if they were standing together in a perfectly straight line .

"Sharina Star tells how to spot a fake psychic . People spend their whole lives looking for answers and guidance but with endless supposed psychics available on the market there is too much potential for soul searchers to be ripped off. So Daily Mail Australia asks celebrity psychic, Sharina Star, how to spot the difference between a genuine and fake psychic. Star, 56, has been open to the spiritual world since she survived a near-death experience at just 10- years-old after being abducted, beaten and then left to die in Gymea in southern NSW. 'I know it sounds stupid - it was nothing much but I just  heard this voice say 'You're going to be OK' - it was nothing more than that but no one believed me - they just thought I was hallucinating - and then the next minute I heard the police sirens,' she said. 'I think that had something to do with it - but everyone has an awakening experience.' Star believes that anyone who is open to the possibility can become a psychic - however, that's not to say that there aren't frauds out there trying to make a quick buck anyway they can. Star offers some handy tips on how to carefully choose a psychic that genuinely wants to help you rather than trying to dig deep into your pockets. The first rule of thumb is to make sure the psychic is a reputable source: . Star says to do your homework on the person you are going to see or take recommendations through word of mouth. 'Beware of someone who is actually out there that you've never heard of and they make all of these ridiculous claims,' Star advises. 'If you have had good reports on a person that is better -  the biggest claim to fame is not necessarily the better one than the little lady down the street because a lot of the time they don't deliver.' Scroll down for video . Star says to do your homework on the person you are going to see or take recommendations through word of mouth . If you are told you have a spell or a curse cast on you - ignore it: . 'I think the worst thing is the spells. I've got so many people say they have got these evil curses and they are convinced they have these curses on them.' 'I've tried to tell them everyone goes through bad luck and you've just to work through your bad luck to get your good luck.' 'Be positive with what you are a dealt but it takes a lot to change that around.' Don't be fooled into thinking you have a curse or a spell - it's all nonsense according to Star . Avoid psychics when you are feeling vulnerable: . 'Be careful when are you are in time of grief because you can really get ripped off.' 'A good psychic would send someone to a counsellor - but say you've got someone who wants to speak to a dead person everyday - there are people trying to milk them for money all of the time.' Frauds will prey on those who are feeling at their most vulnerable, Star warns. 'If you see them once and you feel good that's OK, but if they keep wanting to see you and keep taking your money that's a bad sign.' Hotlines can also be a trap for those who feel that they have nowhere else to turn. 'People just keep ringing the 1800 numbers - they get on the line because they just split up with their boyfriend - they will end up spending a lot of money.' Don't believe everything you are told: . Star met a 40-year-old woman who was told when she was just 14-years-old that she would never have children. 'Nobody should says things like that - if you're wrong that plants a seed,' Star says. 'I looked at her palm and told her it looked like she would have two children then I went and had my baby - it does make you psychic having your own baby - any woman will tell you that.' 'Then I went back to the job a few months later and the woman was pregnant. I don't know if she ended up having two but it gives me a lot of joy to see that.' Sharina Star is one of Australia's most popular psychics with a host of celebrity clients and currently hosts a weekly show, Psychic Encounters, on Radio 2UE Sydney and contributes regularly to publications around Australia. Sharina's Fortune Reading Cards are also available now for $24.99 through Rockpool Publishing .","Australian psychic Sharina Star reveals how to spot a fake psychic .

"The first wife of a high-powered Manhattan lawyer has filed a lawsuit against his second wife accusing her of duping the terminally ill man into marrying her and changing his will as he lay dying from cancer. Debra Karlstein, the former spouse of Herman 'Hank' Goldsmith, a partner at the renowned white-shoe law firm Proskauer Rose LLP, claims that her successor, Deborah Lee-Goldsmith, has cheated her three children out of a $1.5million inheritance. According to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court, Hank Goldsmith was a 'man with many demons,' including addiction to cocaine, pills, alcohol, pornography, strippers and prostitutes, as well as nicotine patches and 'sugary treats.' Love triangle: Debra Karlstein (left) has filed a lawsuit accusing her late husband's second wife, Deborah Lee (far right), of making Hank Goldsmith (pictured right) change his will while on his deathbed . But in an interview with The New York Post, Ms Karlstein, a prominent lawyer in her own right, said that her ex-husband was a good father to their three sons. The couple split up in 2010 after a rocky marriage, during which the highly respected lawyer allegedly frittered away hundreds of thousands of dollars on drugs, strip clubs and pornography. A year after the Goldsmiths' divorce was finalized, Hank Goldsmith met and began dating Deborah Lee, a native of Zimbabwe. In September 2012, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and only a month later Goldsmith tied the knot with Lee. In January 2013, the terminally ill man was hospitalized after contracting pneumonia, and according to his first wife, that is when Deborah Lee jumped into action, inviting a team of lawyers from Proskauer to the emergency room to change his will in a manner that benefited her at the expense of his children. Mr Goldsmith passed away in June 2013 after a year-long battle with cancer. 'Party animal': Karlstein says in her lawsuit that her lawyer husband, pictured here with his mother, was addicted to cocaine, alcohol, porn, strippers and prostitutes . Lovebirds: Goldsmith married Lee, a native of Zimbabwe, a month after he was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer . On her part, Deborah Lee-Goldsmith has sued Debra Karlstein for $155,000, which is the amount Karlstein owed her ex-husband to buy him out of their $2.3million apartment on West 72nd Street. Under Mr Goldsmith’s revised will, his 10-year-old twins and 14-year-old son have been provided with a $3.75million life insurance policy. Hank Goldsmith graduated from Georgetown University law school in 1987 and went on to a successful career as a top litigator. He joined Proskauer two years out of law school, and in 2007 he made partner, handling intellectual property, real estate and appeals cases. Karlstein (left) claims that as her ex-husband was being treated for pneumonia in a hospital, Lee (far right) brought in a team of lawyers to change his estate plan in her favor . Litigator: Goldsmith, pictured here on a trip to Turks & Caicos, was a partner at the renowned Manhattan law firm Proskauer Rose LLP . Adding insult to injury: After her husband's death, Mrs Lee sued Debra Karlstein for $155,000 - the balance she owed for the couple's West 72nd Street apartment . He gained notoriety in the early 2000s by representing the recording industry in a copyright case against Napster. In his free time, the $775,000-a-year lawyer sang and played bass guitar in several cover bands, performing songs by Tom Petty, The Cars and The Beatles. The resume of Hank Goldsmith’s first wife is equally impressive. Debra Karlstein, a graduate of University of Pennsylvania, obtained her law degree from the prestigious New York University Law School. After working as a litigator for nearly two decades, she was hired in 2012 as managing director of compliance at the BNY Mellon investment bank. Creative: In his downtime, Goldsmith played bass guitar and sang in several cover bands . A Proskauer spokeswoman released a statement to MailOnline Monday addressing Debra Karlstein's lawsuit. 'Hank Goldsmith was a‎ brilliant trial and appellate lawyer, representing clients with distinction in many important and precedent-setting cases. 'He loved the practice of law, the Firm, his clients and his family, and the feeling was mutual. We are saddened by this unwarranted attempt to tarnish Hank’s reputation.'","Debra Karlstein, head of compliance at BNY Mellon, sued her ex-husband's second wife, Deborah Lee .

"A devout Christian couple has been fined $13,000 for refusing to host a lesbian wedding at the farm where they live and work. Cynthia and Robert Gifford have been battling Melisa and Jennifer McCarthy ever since the women contacted them in 2012 asking to get married at Liberty Ridge Farm in Schaghticoke, New York. In August, an administrative-law judge ruled that the Giffords had violated state law by discriminating against the couple and ordered them to pay the fines. New York law exempts some religious-oriented institutions from having to accommodate same-sex weddings, but a business that serves the public is in violation of the state's human rights law if it discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. Scroll down for video . Fined: Cynthia and Robert Gifford, pictured, have been fined $13,000 for refusing to hold a gay wedding at their upstate New York farm, even though religious institutions in the state can legally refuse to hold them . It means that the penalties against the business owners come even though clergymen and women in New York are allowed to opt out of marrying same sex couples, the New York Post reported. 'We respect and care for everyone!' Cynthia Gifford, 54, told the Post. 'We had an openly gay man working for us this past season. We've had a woman who's transitioning to be a man. We don't discriminate against anyone.' Still, when Melisa McCarthy - then Melisa Erwin - contacted Mrs Gifford in 2012 and asked to have their summer 2013 wedding at the farm, she said no. 'When we asked why it was just, ""That's what my husband and I decided. We've been married a long time and it's great you're getting married and all, but you can't do it here"",' McCarthy told WNYT at the time. Video courtesy Minnesota Family Council . Hurt: Jennie and Melissa McCarthy recorded the conversation in which the Giffords turned down their wedding party and filed a formal complaint with the state. Earlier this summer, they received compensation . Speaking out: The couple, who married at a different venue in 2013, were devastated, their lawyer said . Gifford was unaware that Jennifer McCarthy had recorded the conversation and the same-sex couple, now both 31, filed a formal complaint with the state Division of Human Rights. After the case became public, the farm suffered a backlash and they have been forced to lose some employees due to financial hardship, the Post reported. Angry messages posted on the venue's Facebook page at the time suggested the McCarthys were not the only gay couple to have been denied access. 'Apparently if you are a same sex couple, you are not welcome as this place discriminates,' wrote one user, Denine Dorniak. 'Gay dollars are just as green as straight dollars.' The Giffords were eventually ordered to pay $10,000 to the state and $1,500 to each of the brides for their mental anguish. Turned away: The couple have been hosting events at Liberty Ridge Farm, pictured, for 15 years . The couple eventually got married at another venue and live in upstate New York. 'They were devastated when they heard that Liberty Ridge Farm would not take their business because of who they are,' said their lawyer, Mariko Hirose, of the New York Civil Liberties Union. The Giffords live at the farm with their 17-year-old daughter and 21-year-old son and have hosted an annual fall event there - including a maize maze and pumpkin patches - for 15 years. 'We've gone from tolerance to compulsion,' the Giffords' lawyer, James Trainor, told the Post. 'State government should not be forcing people to violate their own religious beliefs, nor should they be forced to make a choice between making a living and violating their own faith.' Trainor has now filed an appeal with the state Appellate Division on behalf of the Giffords.","Cynthia and Robert Gifford told Melisa and Jennifer McCarthy in 2012 that they could not get married at their farm in Schaghticoke, New York .

"Sephora has been accused of racism after a number of Asian shoppers found their accounts blocked during a recent online sale. The retailer's Facebook page was flooded with more than 100 complaints from users with mostly Chinese surnames on Friday, demanding that Sephora unlock their accounts so that they could shop the store's VIB Rouge promotion, which offers a 20 per cent discount to customers who spend more than $350 a year. Sephora was quick to issue an apology via its website, blaming a high level of bulk purchases from ‘automated accounts’. The firm believed that these accounts were bulk-buying with the intention of reselling merchandise – a practice it hopes to prevent. Controversy: Sephora has been accused of blocking customers with Asian names from its website. Here, a shopper is seen browsing items at the retailer's Grand Central location in New York City . The statement read: 'What caused the disruption yesterday was a high level of bulk buys and automated accounts for reselling purposes from North America and multiple countries outside the US.’ The company made no reference to the accusations of ethnic profiling but explained that ‘we have identified certain entities who take advantage of promotional opportunities to purchase products in large volume on our website and re-sell them through other channels. ‘After careful consideration, we have deactivated these accounts in order to optimize product availability for the majority of our clients, as well as ensure that consumers are not subject to increased prices or products that are not being handled or stored properly.’ In complaints posted on Facebook and Reddit, users noted that those registered under Asian email addresses, such as qq.com and 126.com, were among those blocked – though customers with Asian-sounding names registered under a U.S. or Canadian address were also affected. Reddit user huaer, who first posted about the controversy on the site's MakeupAddiction forum Friday, expressed disappointment with the store's response. 'I do not agree with the way Sephora has handled the situation, and believe that they have disappointed many of us in these past few days,' she wrote. Angry customers continued to post grievances on the company's Facebook page over the weekend. Chenyi Ebe Zhu, a California resident who hails from Zhuhai, in China's Guangdong province, wrote: 'Thank you Sephora. Thank you for blocking my account, which makes me decide NOT to shop at Sephora any more. Why should I still give my money to such a racist company?' As of Monday afternoon, the final day of the VIB Rouge sale, the problem seemed to persist. Shuo Wang, of Waterloo, Ontario, wrote on Facebook: 'My online account is locked without any reason! I am really disappointed at it!' Nanjing University student Zoey Shen added: 'I want to unlock my account because I am not a reseller. I just want to buy something for myself.'","Angry customers posted complaints on Sephora's Facebook page and on Reddit, demanding that the store unlock their accounts .

"A Kentucky museum devoted to Corvettes is ready to put a car-swallowing sinkhole in its rear view mirror. Workers arrived Monday at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green to start plugging the hole that consumed eight prized sports cars in February. The sight of crumpled cars toppled like toys in the gaping pit turned into an Internet sensation. Scroll down for video . Going, going, gone: Workers arrived Monday at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to start plugging the sinkhole that opened in February, swallowing eight prized motors . It also became a popular attraction. People gawking at the hole revved up attendance and revenue at the museum, an hour north of Nashville, Tennessee. The museum cashed in by selling sinkhole-themed T-shirts, videos, postcards, and jars filled with sinkhole dirt and tiny pieces of car parts. Rescue operation: The hole opened up when the museum was closed, and no one was injured . Attraction: The damaged Corvettes were pulled from the hole to great fanfare. The hole opened up when the museum was closed, and no one was injured. Security camera footage showing the floor's collapse has been viewed nearly 8.4 million times on YouTube, the museum said. The damaged Corvettes were pulled from the hole to great fanfare. Filling in the hole will cost $3.2 million and take about eight months to complete, museum Executive Director Wendell Strode said. Insurance will cover all but about $150,000 of the repairs, he said. The museum will remain open during construction, but the Skydome area where the sinkhole opened will be sealed off from visitors, who will be able to watch the repairs through a Plexiglas wall. Museum officials said they had no second thoughts about plugging up a money maker. The option of keeping part of the 60-foot-long, 45-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep sinkhole open lost favor due to the costs of safety features and maintenance, officials said. 'We're definitely going to miss the attraction and the interest that it brought,' said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. 'But we're hoping that people will enjoy and appreciate what we come up with to represent what happened.' The museum plans to memorialize the sinkhole in exhibits. Since the hole opened, attendance shot up 71per cent, through October compared with a year ago, Frassinelli said. Unique: The option of keeping part of the 60-foot-long, 45-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep sinkhole open lost favor due to the costs of safety features and maintenance, officials said . During that time, nearly 225,000 people ventured off the nearby interstate to visit, beating the museum's yearlong attendance record of 201,000 in 1999, she said. This year's attendance also was spiked by the museum's 20th anniversary celebration. David King made the trip from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to get a firsthand look at the sinkhole before construction started to fill it in. The retired electrician had always wanted to visit a place dedicated to his favorite vehicle. 'This was two in one for me,' he said last week. 'I got my bang for my buck here, seeing the hole and seeing the 'Vettes.'

Crumpled: Officials decided to restore three of the damaged cars - The other five were too badly beaten up . The hole will be filled completely with rock, then workers will drill into it to install steel casings, museum officials said. Crews will pour grout into the casings, creating a steel and concrete pillar to provide additional support under the floor. Officials decided to restore three of the damaged cars.

"A nightclub criticised by health officials for selling alcohol for just 10p has responded by putting its prices up to 25p a drink because management want to 'defend people's right to party'. Bosses at Mamas Paradise in Pontardawe near Swansea, which has previously sold drinks for a penny and says is 'the best night out in Wales', maintains they are responsible despite being criticised over their latest knock down drink deals. Pictures documenting an evening at the South Wales club show people collapsed inside or being helped home after drinking cheap lager, cider, spirits and alcopops. As they queued dozens of drinkers were even given free shots on their way into the club. Just last month a new report revealed how excessive alcohol caused 29 deaths every week in Wales, which equates to around 1 in 20 of all deaths. Under fire: Bosses of the Mamas Paradise club have responded to criticism to its 10p drink policy by raising it to 25p . Going home: Friends hug as they head off after a night of 10p drinks at the South Wales club at the centre of a cheap booze row . Battle: Welsh health chiefs were forced to intervene because of the 10p drinks offer over Halloween, so management have responded by raising their prices by 15p to 25p . Defence: Management defended the club's 'all inclusive' drinks policy claiming it is the same as going on an all-inclusive holiday . Welsh health chiefs were forced to intervene because of the 10p drinks offer over Halloween, so management have responded by raising their prices by 15p to 25p. A spokesman for the club said: 'Unfortunately due to the publicity we had on Halloween we can no longer do the 10p per drink. 'We are keeping the price as low as possible to try and defend your right to party. We are still the cheapest night out you will get.' The club has been caught up in a long standing battle with the licensing officers at Neath Port Talbot over their quest to provide outrageously cheap booze. They had been charging £12 for entry before selling their drinks for 10p during their 10pm to 1am happy hour, which they say is the same as going on an all-inclusive holiday. Club bosses have even managed to find a loophole after being told to raise the price of shots of liquor and spirits to 25p. They have stopped charging customers for a 'mixer' so customers will only have to pay an extra 5p. And they have even dropped the the price of their potent Jagerbombs from £2 to £1.50. Young love: A couple kiss on the dance floor having enjoyed cheap lager, cider, alcopops at spirits at Mamas' Halloween party . Late night: A reveller kneels on the club's carpet with an empty glass nearby but the club's bosses say  the nights are not irresponsible . Ride: A young woman hangs on to a pumpkin ride after paying  £12 for entry and then  drinks for 10p during their 10pm to 1am happy hour . Health concerns: Campaigners warned today that many of us forget that alcohol is a 'Class A carcinogen' Health bosses say deals like this 'put unnecessary pressure on our services but it is not good for anyone's health to drink to excess, and you are also putting yourself at risk of injury' The club has been criticised by the local hospital who said they were 'dismayed' by the drinks deals. Paul Roberts, the chief executive of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'It is irresponsible to sell alcohol so cheaply. 'I call on licensees and the bodies which licence pubs and clubs to consider carefully the effects of encouraging people to drink in excess. 'Not only does it put unnecessary pressure on our services but it is not good for anyone's health to drink to excess, and you are also putting yourself at risk of injury.' Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, described the 15p price rise as as 'pathetic' and 'nonsensical'. He told MailOnline: 'It really is insulting to anyone who has issues with alcohol. People keep forgetting that alcohol is a Class A carcinogen. 'What would the local council do if shops suddenly slashed the price of cigarettes? 'Despite having being spoken to, this club is still continuing to encourage irresponsible drinking. 'It's had one warning shot - surely this is enough to revoke the licence. It's really a health and safety issue.' Emily Robinson, director of campaigns at Alcohol Concern, said: 'Selling drinks at 25p is not only highly irresponsible, but it encourages people to drink excessively. 'We would expect the local licensing authority to look into this to see if there’s a breach of licensing obligations. 'Bars need to act responsibly in the way they sell and promote booze because alcohol misuse ends up costing us all. 'If the government implemented a minimum unit price that would help tackle the cost of alcohol misuse on society and stop things like this from happening. Neath Port Talbot Council's licensing manager Neil Chapple said there are Government guidelines on the minimum price of alcohol. He added: 'The licence holder of Mamas Paradise has been spoken to by officers from the licensing authority, who have reminded him of his duty to comply with the conditions imposed on the licence and to ensure that the licensing objectives are not undermined.' The co-owner of Mama's Paradise, businessman Alistair Parker, defended the club's 'all inclusive' drinks policy. He said: 'It's not a case of paying the £12 entrance fee then standing by the bar and downing as much as you can. 'Customers are only allowed two drinks at a time and have to leave the bar to give others the chance of getting served. 'We're properly licensed and have staff at the club who watch if customers are drunk then advise them they have had enough, it's a controlled environment. 'It's similar to all inclusive holidays where drinks are actually free... you don't see people calling for them to be banned. 'The real problem we have is that someone who has reached 18 can go to a superstore, buy several bottles of vodka and down them all if they want to. 'At least in a club situation like ours there are staff looking after people. I was on holiday at the weekend but was told by my staff there were no problems on the Halloween night. 'We have been doing this for two years and people enjoy it. You have to compete with superstores.'","Mamas Paradise in Pontardawe near Swansea says it is responsible despite selling lager, cider and alcopops for 10p .

"Paediatric consultant Myles Bradbury used tiny video cameras hidden in pens to film himself abusing young cancer patients . A paedophile doctor used tiny video cameras hidden in pens to film himself abusing young cancer patients, it has emerged. And the 18 boys as young as eight molested by paediatric consultant Myles Bradbury are probably only a fraction of his victims – as a series of official blunders gave him time to destroy his sick library of films. The doctor was left free for 16 months to wage his campaign of abuse by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). CEOP had been handed a list of 2,235 suspected British paedophiles in July 2012 by Canadian police – but did nothing for months. Bradbury, 41, admitted in September to abusing 18 boys. He bought a DVD in 2005 from Azov Films in Canada. The company advertised on its website ‘just legal’ and ‘naturist’ films. Many were clearly illegal – and were bought by paedophiles worldwide. It was finally closed down in a Toronto police raid in the summer of 2012 and the concerned officers soon dispatched the names of customers globally. The company was closed down in 2012 and the names of customers passed to police forces worldwide. But it was only when CEOP was absorbed by the National Crime Agency last November that Bradbury’s name was passed to Suffolk police. The force only raided the house he shared with his then pregnant wife, in Herringswell, three weeks later. They discovered Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge had suspended him two weeks earlier after a child’s parents complained about an ‘intimate examination’. His wife admitted he had thrown his laptop away at the same time. Police traced Bradbury’s rubbish and unearthed the laptop but the memory inside had been removed, and with it potential evidence of countless more victims. Sick: The cap of the spy pen used by Bradbury . However a disc containing 16,000 images of abuse and two specially adapted spy pens were found in a garden annexe. Each had a small camera above the clip. Footage was downloaded by plugging into a computer. An inquiry has since been mounted into CEOP and police failures. One patient examined – and possibly filmed by Bradbury – yesterday told the BBC: ‘He would ask to get me in the room on my own, and say I’m old enough to go in a room on my own. ‘And then he’d want to check me. Instead of checking just my joints, he’d want to check my whole body. ‘He’d make me strip down. He focused on my private parts.’ Speaking of the possibility that there were many more victims of Bradbury, Det Sgt John Ling of Suffolk police yesterday told the BBC: ‘Unfortunately the hard drive had been removed from the laptop. ‘I don’t know how many examinations he’s done, so I don’t know how many possible cases there are of live abuse by him. ‘So how many movies of examinations were on that hard drive we’ll never know.’ In Canada, Det Sgt Kim Gross, who leads the Toronto child exploitation team, spoke of her dismay at how CEOP in London had ‘dropped the ball’. Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, suspended Bradbury after a complaint about an 'intimate examination' Det Sgt Gross said: ‘If I had failed that badly I would walk away from the work and have someone replace me.’ She added that all officers investigating potential paedophiles should follow a simple checklist. She said: ‘Number one - we will look to see if they have access to children. ‘Then their occupation. Do they have access to other children? Are they parents? Are they involved in organisations that service children?’ A Suffolk police spokesman said: ‘Before a search warrant could be applied for, an intelligence picture of each individual had to be built to ensure… any action was proportionate and thorough.’","Paedophile doctor Myles Bradbury used a spy pen while examining children .

"New York City lawmakers are weighing in on the debate whether to make it easier for transgender people to change the sex on their birth certificates. The City Council's Health Committee has scheduled a hearing Monday on a plan supported by transgender rights advocates. It would eliminate a requirement for people to have gender-reassignment surgery in order to change the documents. Welcome changes: Naz Seenauth, 20, a transgender man born and raised in New York City, failed to get his birth certificate reissued last year . Instead, a health professional would be able to affirm that the change would more accurately reflect the person's gender. Vermont, Washington D.C., California, Oregon, Rhode Island and New York state have removed surgery requirements. New York City issues its own birth certificates. The city Board of Health voted last month to solicit public comment on the proposed change. Naz Seenauth, 20, a transgender man born and raised in New York City, failed to get his birth certificate reissued last year. He told Reuters that 'it was kind of weird, because New York City is such a liberal place.' The easy-going student, interested in information technology and counseling work, says he finds it deeply frustrating that he cannot change the sex on his birth certificate and it leads to 'uncomfortable moments.' When applying for jobs, he has to spend an awkward minute or two before handing over his identify documents to explain himself, hoping to preempt an interviewer's confusion. He is studying for a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and wants to apply to graduate schools, but worries whether admissions officers will look kindly upon a birth certificate that contradicts who he says he is. In the same vein, thousands of transgender people across America have been forced into embarrassing encounters with bureaucrats, officials, landlords and others because of discrepancies with their documentation, according to transgender-rights advocacy groups. Last month, New York City officials announced that they would try to change the law to let people such as Seenauth alter the sex on their birth certificate. If successful, the city would join a growing movement that views gender as a complex, mainly mental phenomenon in which a person's external anatomy is no longer the overriding factor. In theory, most parts of the country, except Tennessee, Ohio and Idaho, already allow transgender people to amend their birth certificates, according to Lambda Legal, an advocacy group. In practice, most jurisdictions, including New York City, ask for proof from a doctor that they have had surgery to alter the appearance of their genitals. This excludes the majority of transgender men and women. In a 2008 survey of more than 7,000 transgender people, only 20per cent of trans women said they had had surgery to remove their penis and testes, and only two percent of trans men said they had had male genitals surgically created. Some say they cannot afford the complex surgery. Many others, including Seenauth, do not need or want it, finding hormone therapy sufficient. Besides the usual risks of major surgery, it leaves the person infertile, and some find the results less than satisfactory. Even some people who have had surgery find the requirements intrusive, arguing that few non-transgender people would tolerate civic officials questioning them about their genitalia. Corey Johnson, the City Council member leading the effort to loosen the city's 43-year-old rules, calls the surgery requirements outdated. 'I look at this as a matter of human rights,' he said in a telephone interview. 'Transgender people deserve to have vital documents, especially birth certificates, that accurately reflect their identity.' He expects the council to pass his bill before the year is out. He is working in tandem with the city's health commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett, who has proposed amending the city's health code to match Johnson's bill. Under the new proposals, a transgender person need only submit an affidavit from a doctor, nurse, counselor or other licensed health worker testifying that the applicant is indeed of the gender they claim. In 2006, the Board of Health unexpectedly scrapped a similar proposal after a last-minute volley of concerns that hospitals, jails and schools would not know where to put transgender people. Johnson thinks those concerns have faded. The only feedback he has seen are notes of gratitude from transgender New Yorkers. Some said they have been waiting for this change for decades. 'I do think public sentiment has changed for the better in these intervening eight years,' he said. In that time, California, the District of Columbia, Oregon, Vermont and Washington have all dropped the surgery requirement. New York state followed suit earlier this year, although this did not affect New York City's independent records system. In 2010, the federal government began allowing transgender people to amend their passports regardless of anatomy. Last year, the American Psychiatric Association said it no longer considered being transgender a disorder. For Seenauth, who plans to address public hearings on the proposals later this month, a change in the city's law would help ease the long, laborious process of transitioning. In the last couple of years, he has legally changed his name from Nazifa to Naz.  He had his driver's license amended, and the Social Security Administration updated his records without fuss. And the registrar's office at John Jay College obliged Seenauth's request to update their records. Each step in gaining official recognition of his identity leads to the next one, he says, but there are others besides the city's vital records office that still doubt him. His parents, with whom he lives, 'tolerate' his transition, he said, but still call him Nazifa and refer to him using female pronouns. In recent weeks, a man at his local mosque has started to protest Seenauth's entering the men's section to pray. Seenauth is considering asking the imam to intervene. If New York City were willing to recognize him as a man, he said, it might mean that his parents, his imam and others may come to see him that way, too.","Corey Johnson, the City Council member leading the effort to loosen the city's 43-year-old rules, calls the surgery requirements outdated .

"Ambushed: David Cameron in white tie last night . David Cameron and Theresa May narrowly avoided humiliation over the European Arrest Warrant last night amid scenes of chaos, confusion and recrimination in the Commons. Speaker John Bercow prompted uproar as he attacked the Government for denying MPs a specific vote on the controversial measure – with Eurosceptic Tories accusing their leadership of ‘tyranny’, ‘deception’ and ‘chicanery’. In extraordinary remarks for a Speaker, Mr Bercow accused ministers of breaking their promises for a full debate and vote on the warrant in a ‘sorry saga’ that would leave the public ‘contemptuous’. Mr Cameron came within nine votes of losing the support of the Commons after Labour mounted an ambush to try to halt proceedings. But after the attempt was narrowly outvoted, the Government went on to win a separate, key vote on a package of EU crime and justice measures by a large margin, by 464 to 38. Despite trying to derail proceedings, Labour backed the Government when it came to the substance of the issue – ensuring a large majority. However, the earlier manoeuvre meant the Prime Minister was forced to rush back from his annual speech at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London – dressed in the traditional white tie worn at the occasion – to take part in the vote. The victory came at a high price, with Eurosceptic Tories bitterly accusing ministers and the Whips’ Office, in charge of party discipline, of ‘disgraceful’ tactics. Ministers, meanwhile, were furious with Mr Bercow for triggering what they saw as an contrived furore. One senior Conservative said: ‘Bercow has completely lost the plot.’ Mr Cameron had promised to give MPs a vote on the warrant before a crucial by-election in Rochester and Strood. But, fearing a damaging rebellion, Michael Gove’s whips’ office yesterday put forward a motion which excluded the warrant – which is by far the most controversial of the 35 EU measures the Government wants to opt back into. Instead, 11 more obscure powers were included on the Commons order paper. But fury erupted when Mr Bercow declared at the start of the debate that, in fact, no vote on the arrest warrant was taking place – denying MPs a say. In a vicious attack, the Speaker told MPs: ‘This has been a rather sorry saga and the House should not be put in this position. Home Secretary Theresa May warned rebel colleagues not to oppose British membership of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) which allows police to extradite suspects quickly between EU states . ‘I think most of us think a commitment made is a commitment that should be honoured and we should try to operate according to sensible standards rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice. ‘It may be the sort of thing that some people think is very clever but people outside of the House expect straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous, and I use the word advisedly, contemptuous of what is not straight dealing.’ Arch-Eurosceptic Tory Sir Bill Cash said the vote was a ‘travesty of our parliamentary proceedings’. ‘It is tainted with chicanery, it is not the way this Parliament should be treated,’ he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Tory rightwinger, said the ‘outrageous abuse of parliamentary procedures’ meant the Government was taking ‘the way of tyranny’. Backbench Tory Sir Richard Shepherd accused the Government of ‘sly’ behaviour, while former shadow home secretary David Davis said it had been the most disorderly debate he had seen in 20 years. Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘Despite being promised this vote, the Commons has been denied the chance to give overwhelming backing to this crucial crime-fighting measure. ‘Theresa May was very foolish not to listen to the strong support across the House both for the European Arrest Warrant and for the opportunity of a comprehensive vote. Speaker John Bercow prompted uproar as he attacked the Government for denying MPs a specific vote on the controversial measure . ‘She has handled this dreadfully. It’s a complete mess.’ The wounds suffered by the Tories last night will be seen by many as self-inflicted, since the European Arrest Warrant is backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats and would have passed with ease – even with a sizeable Tory rebellion. At one stage, it was anticipated as many as 100 MPs might vote against. Even after yesterday’s farcical scenes, only 38 objected to the package. The dispute comes after Mrs May decided two years ago to opt out of all 133 EU police and criminal justice measures. Ministers then had until December 1 this year to decide which they wanted to opt back into. Following Coalition negotiations, it was decided to re-join 35 – including the European Arrest Warrant. The EAW has been in force in Britain since 2004 but, had ministers opted not to re-join, it was due to lapse in less than three weeks. It was created to ensure a warrant issued by a judge in one EU country could be enforced in another and is designed to speed up extradition proceedings. But critics say it has been used to pursue Britons for relatively minor offences and object to the whole concept of a European-wide system of justice.","Prime Minister is just nine votes from defeat in crucial debate .

"Charges: Fount Duston has been charged by Ardmore, Oklahoma police with the rape and kidnapping of a seven-year-old girl . A 34-year-old man has been charged with the abduction and rape of a seven-year-old girl after she was dramatically found in his Oklahoma trailer on Sunday - a little over 24 hours after she was abducted in broad-daylight outside her home. Fount Duston, who in a series of disturbing YouTube videos describes himself as a DJ and trucker, was taken into custody at 9.40pm after a statewide amber alert led to an anonymous tip. Police in Ardmore said there was a brief struggle at Duston's door when he answered with a shotgun, but authorities were able to force their way inside and rescue the little girl. Duton was booked into Carter County Jail on first-degree rape and kidnapping charges and the girl was taken to an undisclosed medical facility. Her name and her family's identity are no longer being published following her rescue because she was the victim of a sexual assault. The girl's mother is at her daughter's bedside and has been with her during the interview process with the police. 'At least God brought my baby home. She's coming home,' said the girl's father to News9. 'We've had a lot of people and family out looking for my daughter and thank God they found her and she's OK.' Scroll down for video . Rescue: Fount Duston answered the door to his trailer armed with a shotgun - but was overpowered by authorities who rescued the seven-year-old girl from inside . Arrest: Duston was taken into custody by Ardmore police and is now awaiting arraignment in an Oklahoma court . Bizarre: Duston has posted unusual content to his Facebook profile - including anti-police material and a link to a four-year-old girl's GoFundMe page . Witnesses to the abduction said they saw Duston drive up outside the seven-year-old's front-yeard where she was playing, force her into his car and just drove off. 'It just shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened at all,' said the father to News9. 'Children should not have to go through that.' Immediately an amber alert was issued statwide for the girl and within 24 hours she was found. 'Obviously, as police officers, when we have these types of calls, they're our worst nightmare too. We want to find them as quick as we can. We understand what the statistics say about abductions,' said Capt. Eric Hamblin with Ardmore Police Department to News9. Abduction: The little girl was taken from near to this intersection where she was playing out front with her friends . The little girl's father agreed. 'We're lucky that she was found in the situation she was found in and that she's still alive,' the father said. After his arrest, disturbing YouTube footage and social media postings from Duston were discovered. Originally from Marietta, Oklahoma, Duston appears in a series of YouTube videos on his own channel in which he identifies himself as a Mobile DJ with a love of House Music. 'Hello everybody and welcome to our YouTube. My name is Fount Duston. I’m a DJ. I live in Marietta, OK,' said Duston. Weird: In one of his YouTube videos Fount Duston plays with a monkey puppet and talks to it in the manner of a children's television host . Channel: Fount Duston's YouTube videos are a series of DJ mixes and him giving his opinions on various matterrs . Over the course of the videos, Duston discusses his skills as a DJ, plays with a monkey puppet, films himself ordering donuts and has a very lewd conversation with another friend. On his Facebook, Duston has posted at least one anti-law enforcement video and disturbingly linked to the GoFundMe page for a little girl in need of cancer treatment. The girl on Duston's Facebook is not the same girl that he kidnapped. Shockingly, a search online and through court records reveals no prior criminal convictions for Duston in Oklahoma and Ardmore police have said that they don't think he has a criminal record. 'We know she's probably been traumatized and we just want complete healing,” said Gaylon Taylor, a relative of the victim to News9.","Fount Duston arrested at his home in Marietta, Oklahoma, on Sunday night .

"A renowned journalism professor has been accused of framing an innocent man for murder so he could advance his campaign to abolish the death penalty in Illinois. Alstory Simon, 64, confessed to a double murder in 1999, mainly because of an investigation from a team of students at Northwestern University, led by Professor David Protess. It helped free death row inmate Anthony Porter just days before his execution, a case that was cited when the state announced a moratorium on capital punishment in 2003 and its abolition in 2011. Simon was released from the Jacksonville Correction Center last week after the Cook County State's Attorney's Office re-examined his conviction. Now, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claims the team of journalists and their professor, as part of Northwestern University's Innocence Project, framed his client so Porter could become a 'poster boy' in the bid to end executions in the state. Free: Alstory Simon confessed to a double murder in 1999, mainly because of an investigation from a team of students at Northwestern University. He was released from Jacksonville Correctional Facility last week . Allegations: Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claims the team, led by Professor David Protess (pictured) framed his client so death row inmate Anthony Porter could become a 'poster boy' for the bid to end executions in the state . Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of the investigator, Paul Ciolino in conjunction with Protess could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness at the time. However it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out. Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry. 'I'm not angry at the system. I'm angry at the people who did what they did to me,' he said, crying as he told reporters that his mother had died while he was behind bars. Simon was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15. 'Poster boy': Porter (pictured right after his release with Protess) was sentenced to death after initially being convicted in the shooting of two people in Chicago . But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals. Alvarez said he was tricked by a private investigator who stormed into his home and showed him a videotape of a man who said he had seen Simon pull the trigger. The man turned out to be an actor. 'In the best interest of justice, we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction,' Alvarez said. The Porter case helped lead former Gov. George Ryan to declare a moratorium on executions in 2003, and he cleared death row by commuting the death sentences of more than 150 inmates to life in prison. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011. Alvarez did not say whether she believed Simon is, in fact, innocent, but she said there were so many problems with the case. Methods: Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of Protess (pictured hugging Porter) could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice . Frustration: Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry at 'the people who did this to me' One of them was what she called a coerced confession and the deaths of a number of key figures, making it impossible to determine exactly what happened on the morning of Aug. 15, 1982, when two people were shot to death as they sat in a park on Chicago's South Side. She also said there remains powerful evidence that Porter was the gunman, including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements. 'As I stand here today, I can't definitely tell you it was Porter who did this or Simon who did this,' she said. Protess, who retired from Northwestern in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods, has not responded to phone calls for comment, but has previously defended his methods and results. Ciolino, who like Protess has denied acting improperly, released a statement that emphasized that Simon confessed multiple times, including to a TV reporter and his own lawyer. 'You explain that,' Ciolino said. Nonetheless, he added, no one should be in prison if the state did not meet its burden of proof. Advancing claims: Porter spent 16 years on death row prior to his release. Illinois put a moratorium in place on executions in 2003 and the death penalty was abolished in 2011 .","Alstory Simon, 64, confessed to a double murder in Chicago in 1999 .

"A man accused of driving a his wife's Corvette into a Philadelphia river has claimed he was off his medication when he carried out the act. John Kramer, 50, has since been arrested after turning himself in to the police and was released on bail on Thursday morning. Mr Kramer is apparently in the middle of a  messy divorce. He now faces charges of violating a protection from abuse order, harassment and recklessly endangering another person. He says he never meant for anyone to see him sink the car and only did it because he wasn't on his medication for bipolar disorder. Scroll down for video... Arrested: John Kramer, who drove his Corvette into the river in a domestic dispute, turned himself in to Northeast Detectives on November 12 . Meds: He says he only did it because he wasn't on his medication for bipolar disorder . Revenge: The 1990 red vehicle is pulled from the river and sparked a manhunt by police in case there were any victims . Police operation: Mr Kramer, 50, took the Corvette from his spouse's home and traveled to the bank of the river, which is situated near the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge . Recovery: With the engine still running, he then climbed out of the car, before allowing it to roll into the river on Monday afternoon. Above, divers attached a tow line to the Corvette to aid in its recovery . 'I didn't even realize I was doing anything wrong,' said Kramer, who wore a Lito Sheppard Eagles jersey and a backward baseball cap on his way into the police district. 'I wasn't on my medication at the time. My system was not balanced. I didn't feel balanced.'he told the Daily News. Mr Kramer was arraigned early Thursday and his bail was set at $15,000 on two counts of reckless endangerment and one count each of harassment and violating a court order, according to court records. Kramer, a retired karate instructor who still sometimes teaches neighborhood kids in his back yard for free, said he hopes that a judge will understand how his life's troubles landed him in police trouble. 'This stuff is not my fault,' he said. 'Life is too hard for me anymore. Nothing ever comes easy for me.' He added: 'My wife will make me out to be a horrible, horrible person. But I am not. I am very nice. I am very good.' 'I guess he was angry with [his wife] and drove her vehicle into the river,' Police Inspector Scott Small said . Back on  dry land: As the spurned husband fled the scene, he allegedly told a shocked witness not to call 911 because the incident was a 'family matter. Above, police and divers  remove the tow line from the car . Police say a witness told them a man drove to the Delaware River on Monday, got out of the 1990 red vehicle and let the car run into the water on the banks of the Delaware River near the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. They say he took the car from his wife's house. Marine units found the car in 30 feet of water and made sure no one was inside. The car later was lifted from the water. 'I guess he was angry with [his wife] and drove her vehicle into the Delaware River,' Police Inspector Scott Small said. Scene: The incident occurred at Delaware River at State Road and Magee Road (seen from an aerial view) Darkness: After arriving at the scene, police launched a search for a possible victim, during which they dispatched marine units who felt around inside the vehicle in the darkness to make sure it was unoccupied . Aftermath: Following their confirmation that the Corvette was empty, the divers attached a tow line to the car, before a crane pulled it from the river less than two hours later. Above the car is pictured, center, on  land . Following their confirmation that the Corvette was empty, the divers attached a tow line to the wrecked car, before a crane successfully pulled it from the river less than two hours later. As the spurned husband fled the scene, he allegedly told a shocked witness not to call 911 because the incident was a 'family matter'. However, police  were alerted to the crash minutes later and arrived at the river to find the vehicle completely submerged. They then launched a search for a possible victim, during which they dispatched marine units who felt around inside the vehicle in the darkness to make sure it was unoccupied. Insp Small said it was 'extremely dangerous' for divers to have to go underwater in dark conditions, especially in that area, where the river bottom is littered with car parts, rebar and trash. 'They were saying it was zero visibility — they were blindly feeling around,' he added. One other charge is likely, Insp Small said: illegal dumping.","John Kramer, 50, turned himself in to police yesterday to face charges that he'd violated a restraining order .

"A drunk stag party guest has accused Spearmint Rhino of 'exploiting' him out of £7,500 in one night. The Northern Irish man maxed out three credit cards and spent a third of his salary at the seaside strip club in Bournemouth, Dorset - including two £1,176 sums two minutes apart. He said staff got him alone in a booth and plied him with alcohol, causing apparent memory loss. He then spent vast amounts on 'Rhino chips', which buy private lap dances. 'Exploited': A drunk stag party guest has accused Spearmint Rhino of taking £7,500 from three credit cards. The anonymous man has fought his case for more than a year after the incident at this Bournemouth branch . In a complaint letter to Bournemouth Council, the man said he had been given so much alcohol that he lost all awareness of his actions. He woke up the next morning to find credit card receipts that revealed £7,500 had been taken in 13 separate payments at the club. They also included £2,304 taken in three separate transactions eight minutes apart and £2,928 in three transactions six minutes apart. The man, who asked to be kept anonymous, has spent a year battling to get the money back without success. He said he the club had never given him a satisfactory explanation for the pattern of spending. 'I fully acknowledge that I was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several credit cards,' he wrote. The man wrote: 'I acknowledge I was foolish to enter the club drunk and in possession of several cards' 'But I have been in similar situations before and never experienced anything remotely approaching this or involving such a life-changing sum of money. 'Someone being foolish does not excuse in any way the actions of the club and its employees and the way they grossly exploited a person in a vulnerable position.' The man wrote his letter to Bournemouth Council's licensing committee after it announced it was launching an investigation into the club. The Spearmint Rhino branch is alleged to have breached its strict licence conditions - including the customary strip club 'no touching' policy. Undercover checks allegedly found dancers straddling customers, placing both their feet on seats, simulating a sexual act, intentionally touching another dancer and intentionally touching a customer. It is understood the man previously made a complaint to Bournemouth council's Trading Standards department and no action was taken. But the complainant is being backed by Bournemouth councillor David Smith, who said it was not the only one he had received. 'I was shocked and concerned to hear of the experience this man had in Spearmint Rhino,' he said. 'I understand that when he entered the club he was separated from the rest of his group and ended up in a booth. 'He signed off chips on his credit card and he maxed out two or three cards and signed away £7,500. 'He has spent the last year trying to get the money back. 'People visiting these venues need to have confidence that they are run properly. Due to my concerns I have objected to the renewal of the licence and I hope the council's licensing board share my concerns.' A spokesman for Spearmint Rhino said: 'The allegation goes back to the summer of 2013. 'The matter is now being raised as an objection to the renewal of the SEV licence which has already been renewed once since that date. 'The allegation is denied and it is not intended to engage in a trial through the media. Spearmint Rhino investigate any complaints made and work with the authorities and banks in all enquiries they carry out. 'The authorities and the bank found such an allegation was not made out. 'If this is the same incident, and Spearmint Rhino are not aware of any similar incident then this was dealt with around a year ago.'","Unnamed Northern Irish man was on a seaside stag do in Bournemouth .

"A four-year-old boy who has been kept in a sterile 'bubble”' is going to spend Christmas day with the family he hasn’t seen for four months. Samuel Freeman has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs. He has spent the past few months with his mother Sadie as doctors at the Great North Children’s Hospital, in Newcastle, prepared him for a bone marrow transplant. Samuel, from Long Clawson, Leicestershire, has not been able to see his father, Adrian, or older brother, Benjamin, six. Battle: Samuel Freeman (with his mother Sadie) has a rare condition which means he has no immunity to any germs. He has spent the last four months in a sterile 'bubble' while doctors prepare his body for a bone marrow transplant to give him a new, healthy immune system . But, if they can stay 'germ free', the four will be able to spend Christmas together. Mrs Freeman, 34, said: 'Samuel has been quite poorly ever since he was about eight weeks old, but we are very hopeful the bone marrow transplant he has just had will be successful in giving him a new fully-fighting immune system.' She and Samuel were allowed home to Leicestershire on December 6, but are living next door to the family home to make sure that her husband or other son have not picked up any germs before they have Christmas together. Samuel has spent much of his life in and out of hospital as doctors tried to diagnose what was wrong with him. Mrs Freeman said: 'Samuel has a long medical history and had to cope with all sorts from lung disease to stomach and bowel issues. 'At one point, his hands, knees and ankles swelled up and it turned out he had severe juvenile arthritis, which was down to his faulty immune system.' Doctors hope the bone marrow transplant will give Samuel a new fully-fighting immune system . At the beginning of last year, Samuel was referred to the Bubble Unit, in Newcastle - one of two centres in the country specialising in children with deficient immune systems. His mother said: 'Doctors decided the best thing would be for Samuel to have a bone marrow transplant. 'It was a very difficult decision as there was no guarantee it would be a success. We were very lucky to find a perfect match through the Anthony Nolan charity. 'But before the transplant, Samuel had to have very strong chemotherapy to kill off his own immune system, ready to receive a new healthy system. 'I stayed with him in the bubble, which is a completely sterile hospital room. 'Everything has to be disinfected and you have to scrub up theatre-style before you go in the room. We kept in touch as a family through Skype but it is not the same as cuddles.' Samuel can now go outside providing he wears a mask. His mother added: 'He is quite a cheeky chap but he is wary of adults and hasn’t had much interaction with other children. 'It has also been very hard on Benjamin since Samuel was born. We have either been away in hospital or so busy nursing Samuel at home, and then I ""disappeared"" in August to go to Newcastle. 'There is still a way to go and it would just be nice to have a family Christmas Day.' Mrs Freeman is now determined to raise money and awareness for the Bubble Foundation. She said: 'It is desperate for funds and I want to do everything I can to support this incredible charity because we owe them so much. It does such vital work.'

"An off-the-cuff comment by the attorney general to cut off a news conference about the apparent killing of 43 missing college students has been taken up by protesters as a rallying cry against Mexico's corruption and drug trade-fueled violence. During Friday's live-televised session, Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam announced that two suspects had led authorities to trash bags believed to contain the incinerated remains of the slain students, who haven't been seen since being led away by police in the southwestern town of Iguala on September 26. After an hour of speaking, Murillo Karam abruptly signaled for an end to questions by turning away from reporters and saying, 'Ya me canse' — a phrase meaning 'Enough, I'm tired.' Under fire: Attorney General Jesus Murillo (third left, smoking a cigarette) is seen leaving the prison after speaking with three gang members accused of disposing of the students' bodies . Anger: The disappearance of 43 students in Iguala has sparked fevered protests across the country (pictured is a march in Mexico city) as locals demand answers as to what happened to them . Within hours, the phrase became a hashtag linking messages on Twitter and other social networks. It continued to trend globally Saturday and began to emerge in graffiti, in political cartoons and in video messages posted to YouTube. Many turned the phrase on the attorney general: 'Enough, I'm tired of Murillo Karam,' says one. Another asks: 'If you're tired, why don't you resign?' Other people used it to vent their frustrations with messages such as 'Enough, I'm tired of living in a narco state' or 'Enough, I'm tired of corrupt politicians.' Mexicans have reacted with outrage to the disappearance of the students from a rural teachers college in Guerrero state and a government response that has failed to fully explain what happened. Candlelit vigil: It is claimed police arrested the students after they went to Iguala to raise money and comandeered passenger buses for their use . Accused: Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, left, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda right, were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday and are believed to have masterminded the massacre . On Saturday, protesters burned several cars and trucks outside the governor's offices in Chilpancingo, the Guerrero capital where demonstrations over the students' disappearance have escalated into violence several times. Investigators say Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, ordered police to confront the students, who had gone to Iguala to raise money and had commandeered passenger buses for their use. The couple reportedly feared the students would disrupt an event being led by the wife. Iguala police fired on the students in two incidents, killing six people. Officers then allegedly turned over 43 arrested students to a local drug gang. Murillo Karam said members of the gang confessed to killing the students before burning their bodies and tossing the ashes and bone fragments into a river. At least 74 people have been arrested, including Abarca and his wife, who were found Tuesday hiding in a dilapidated home in a rough section of Mexico City. Investigators say Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, ordered police to confront the students, fearing they would disrupt an event she had organised . Allegations: Investigators say Mayor Abarca and wife Maria ordered police to confront the students. Iguala police fired on them, killing six, before allegedly turning them over to a local drug gang who 'killed them, burned their bodies at a rubbish dump (pictured) and tossed the ashes and bone fragments into a river' Families of the missing students insisted they will continue to believe their sons are alive until authorities prove the recovered remains are theirs. Murillo Karam said the bone fragments would be sent to a lab in Austria for testing. Manuel Martinez, a spokesman for the families, said the 'YaMeCanse' rallying cry was proof that their demand for answers is gaining strength. 'The people are angered and I hope that they continue support us,' he said Saturday.

Protests: On Saturday, protesters burned several cars and trucks outside the governor's offices in Chilpancingo, the Guerrero capital where demonstrations over the students' disappearance have escalated into violence several times . Headway: Attorney General  Karam announced that two suspects had led authorities to trash bags believed to contain the incinerated remains of the slain students . Filmmaker Natalia Beristain was among hundreds of people posting YouTube videos tagged #YaMeCanse. 'Senor Murillo Karam, I, too, am tired,' she said. 'I'm tired of vanished Mexicans, of the killing of women, of the dead, of the decapitated, of the bodies hanging from bridges, of broken families, of mothers without children, of children without fathers.' 'I am tired of the political class that has kidnapped my country, and of the class that corrupts, that lies, that kills,' she added.

"It is a classic David and Goliath fight. Food giant Unilever has launched a lawsuit against San Francisco firm Hampton Creek, claiming it is misleading consumers by selling its plant based product, called Just Mayo, as mayonnaise. Hampton Creek boss Josh Tetrick told MailOnline the action is 'bullying', and believes it could help the firm by drawing publicity to its product. Hampton Creek sells a range of its egless product, called Just Mayo, in supermarkets across the Us, and is carried by Costco and Whole Foods among others. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, analyzed thousands of plants to a mix that can replicate mayonnaise. Its best-known product, Just Mayo, is a mayonnaise that uses a type of Canadian yellow pea as a substitute for eggs. the firm also makes a range of flavoured mayonnaise products, and cookie dough, and its products are available  at Costco, Dollar Tree, Walmart and Whole Foods. 'This is just bullying, but it could be a very positive thing for us,' he said. 'This is just antiquated horse and buggy mindsets, this just isn't applicable -it's silly. The complaint accuses Hampton creek of false advertising. 'This is a civil action for false advertising and unfair competition under federal and state law,' the suit, filed in New Jersey, says. 'Hampton Creek sells a sandwich spread named Just Mayo in direct competition with Unilever's Best Foods and Hellmann's brands of mayonnaise. 'Despite its name, Just Mayo does not contain just mayonnaise. 'In fact, it is not mayonnaise at all. 'Rather, it is a plant-based vegan alternative to real mayonnaise.' A Unilever Spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are a strong supporter of innovation both within and outside our company. 'Our concern here is not about innovation, it is about misleading labelling as it is simply not accurate to label the Hampton Creek product as 'Mayo' or to reinforce the link with images of ingredients, in this case eggs, that are not even used. 'Contrastingly, our Hellman's brand is made from real eggs that are cage free and deliver great taste from natural sources. 'We simply wish to defend both consumers from being misled and also our brand.' Fans of Hampton Creek have flocked to an online petition created by chef and travel presenter Andrew Zimmermn, which has attracted over 10,000 signatures. 'When a 60 billion dollar company flexes its muscles to prevent a good-for-the-world startup company from succeeding, there are only two words for that: corporate bullying,' he said. Tetrick's idea was to find a mix of easy-to-grow plants that, when mixed together in the right way, replicate the taste, nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg. Hampton Creek CEO Josh Tetrick, seen here with Martha Stewart, said the lawsuit was 'bullying' This, he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients. According to the filing, Just Mayo has already harmed sales of 'real' mayonnaise. 'Hampton Creek's literally-false name and its unsubstantiated superiority claims have already caused consumer deception and serious, irreparable harm to Unilever and to the product category the industry has taken great care to define in a way consistent.' Tetrick says he hopes the issue will draw people to the debate over sustainability, and comes as Unilever embarks on a US ad campaign to brand itself as a sustainable firm. 'I'd be surprised if the CEO knows about it - and that he won't contact someone when he hears,' said Tetrick. 'From a legal perspective, this is why we use mayo - we got lots of legal advice so we feel we are on the right side of this.' 'Just like Uber and airbnb, we are dealing with these issues. We think how we feed people is even more important. 'This whole system needs to be reinvented.'","Hampton Creek sold in supermarkets across the US .

"British embassies are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds to woo foreign visitors at lavish parties around the world. Spending on entertainment and hospitality by British diplomats seems to have increased - with almost £350,000 spent by just five embassies in the last two years. The spending appears to resemble the parties popularised in the Ferrero Rocher adverts, where overseas guests at posh soirees are presented with the expensive chocolates and utter the infamous line 'Ambassador, you are really spoiling us.' British embassies have spent £350,000 on entertaining guests abroad, resembling the lavish parties made famous by the Ferrero Rocher advert, where a guest utters the line 'Ambassador, you are really spoiling us' And it would appear that British diplomats really are spoiling their guests. At just five British diplomatic bases  Brazil, Mexico, Bangladesh, Turkey and Holland £210,000 was spent on entertaining in 2013. This is an increase on £137,000 spent the year before. The figures were revealed by the Labour party which has called for the foreign office to justify how public money is being spent, the Sun reported. Thomas Matussek, former German ambassador, pictured at a party next to the chocolates in 2004 . Susan Elan Jones said: 'Ministers must justify every penny when families struggle to make ends meet.' Earlier this year an analysis of spending by embassies found that £16,000 was spent on cigars, while almost £3,000 went on buying flowers. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said that the money had been spent on events such as the Diamond Jubilee and London 2012 Olympic events. They also said some of the money had been spent on celebrations to mark the Queen's birthday as well as specialist trade events for business figures. The Foreign Office said this type of spending on hospitality and entertainment is justified as it will 'help secure investment and promote British business.' She said: 'This is entirely appropriate and provides good value for money for the taxpayer.'","Five embassies spent almost £350,000 entertaining guests at posh soirees .

"The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola said she will demand £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur. Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract the disease while she was caring for a missionary. But she said the worst part of her ordeal was leaning her mixed breed dog had been put down, claiming 'he was not given a chance'. Scroll down for video . Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract Ebola . Lawyers for Mrs Romero say the decision to put the animal down last month as she battled the killer disease was 'improvised and taken against medical advice'. Health chiefs in Madrid obtained a court order to sacrifice Excalibur despite an online petition to save it signed by more than 300,000 people. Riot police clashed with protestors outside her home near Madrid so they could take the animal away to incinerate it. As well as demanding compensation for her dog through the courts, the nurse is also planning to sue Madrid health chief Javier Rodriguez for defamation. Spanish nurse is demanding  £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur . Thousands of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against officials' decision to put the animal down without testing to see whether it was infected first . While Teresa was battling to save her life he accused her of hiding information from the doctors who treated her before she was admitted to hospital. He also claimed she could have contracted the Ebola virus by not following protocol. Amid controversy over the training given to health professionals treating the two Spanish missionaries with the disease he claimed on TV: 'You don't need a Masters degree to explain to someone how to put on or take off a suit.' He went on to apologise after Teresa and her husband demanded his resignation. Speaking about her recovery, Mrs Romero said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.' Mrs Romero caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with Ebola while he treated patients in Sierra Leone. Ms Romero's husband Javier  has also questioned the decision to put the animal down saying he was not to blame 'for anything' Another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, had died in Madrid in August after being flown back from missionary work in Liberia. She was quarantined along with 14 other people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared. However the decision by Spanish authorities to put down her dog, Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected caused widespread protests. At a news conference, her husband Javier questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'. He also described the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision. In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released. Thousands of angry protesters marched in the streets of Madrid calling on the government's health minister Ana Mato to resign after the pet's death on October 8. Ms Romero was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. One was the experimental anti-viral medicine favipiravir, according to the respected national newspaper El Mundo.","Teresa Romero, 44, was put in isolation for a month after contracting Ebola .

"At the age of 23, the last thing one would expect to take home from a casual sexual relationship is a chronic and incurable disease. But that was the reality for Abby Landy from Sydney, Australia, now 26. In a new documentary, Transmission: The journey from AIDS to HIV, she shares her story while working to break down stigma and misconceptions about the disease. While in the early stages of a relationship, the man Ms Landy was seeing 'became quite sexually aggressive, and I became unwell', she revealed to Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Abby Landy, 26, contracted HIV when she was just 23 after it was passed onto her by a man she was seeing . Despite his persistence to see her again and stay in touch, the woman was adamant she did not wish to see him again after their last encounter. 'When I made it clear that that's not what I wanted he sent me a message saying well ""I hope you remember me forever"",' Ms Landy said. Initially she visited the doctor with a terrible case of cold sores, as well as other symptoms which were making her very unwell. 'I was mortified I had cold sores ... Which seems a bit ridiculous in hindsight', she said. After carrying out some of her research and finding no cause for her mystery illness, Ms Landy returned to her doctor and requested a test for HIV. 'I went and requested the test from my GP, but she sort of insisted it wasn't necessarily,' revealed Ms Landy. But Ms Landy pushed for the test after the concerning message from the man she was seeing, and a few days later the results came back positive. The Sydney woman features in an upcoming documentary called Transmission: The Journey From AIDS to HIV . Ms Landy spoke of her struggle dealing with the diagnosis and how the disease now affects her life . 'The first thing I said to my doctor was ""I know I don't want to live like this""', Ms Landy admitted. 'I knew so little about what it means to have HIV. I was like well now I'm poisoned and life's over. 'I was ashamed and felt bad for my family,' she added. The next few months for Ms Landy were consumed by finding out as much as she could about the virus and a real turning point came when she connected with other women living with HIV at an event. HIV infection rates in Australia are at a 20-year high, with many people contracting the disease in the last five years. 'For a start I realised of all the people to be living with HIV I was one of the luckiest. 'I'm young and educated and have good access to healthcare,' Ms Landy said. The 26-year-old opened up about how lucky she considers herself to be compared to others with HIV . Ms Landy (second from left) is pictured here with Sonny Williams, former CEO of Positive Life ( far left), co-founder of The Institute of Many Nic Holas (second from right) and Jane Costello, President of Positive Life (far right) Aside from the two pills of medication she needs to take daily, the woman revealed that the virus has no other affect on her physical health. But it has changed her life in many other ways. 'I'm quite involved in advocacy work within the HIV sector - it's changed my life in that way I'm far more passionate in breaking down the stigma.' Ms Landy also revealed that she thinks young people are much too complacent about contracting sexually transmitted infections, and is working to break down the idea that only certain types of people can be infected with HIV. 'Until I got that diagnosis it wasn't something I ever really thought about ... I imagine other young people are much like that, It's not something that we think affects us', she said. 'There's complacency because I think a lot of things (other STIs) are fixed with antibiotics.' 'It really is very easy to believe ""oh HIV, that doesn't affect me"".' Transmission: The journey from AIDS to HIV will be aired in Sydney on Wednesday November 19. The film documents how attitudes towards those with AIDS has changed over the past 30 years, and breaks down common misconceptions such as the idea that the virus only affects gay men. Ms Landy said she never thought she was at risk of contracting HIV, until she was diagnosed .","Abby Landy was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 23 .

"A man who hit international headlines last year after being arrested for hacking an Australian government website has defended his conviction. Matthew Flannery, is currently serving a home detention of 15 months after he was convicted of five hacking charges after an obscene photo was uploaded to the Narrabri Shire Council website. At the time of his arrest in April last year Flannery was described as the leader of Lulzsec by the Australian Federal Police. Scroll down for video . Matthew Flannery, 25, was described in an AFP press release as leader of hacking group LulzSec . Flannery claims he sent the message as a joke to a friend, he is serving 15 months' home detention . In a new interview with ABC programme 7.30 Flannery, from Point Clare on the NSW Central Coast, claims that the 'AFP's claims are based on a single joke Facebook message'. Lulzsec, abbreviated from Lulz Security, is an international hacking group which has claimed responsibility for several high profile hackings including taking down the CIA website. Flannery told the show: 'I went to a computer in the library because, you know, they'd taken mine, and I started Googling [sic] and to my shock and horror I found that not only was I being reported by Australian news agencies, but also internationally,' reports ABC. The programme's investigation looked into the court documents and say they found just one reference to LulzSec. Flannery says that one reference was a joke in a Facebook message to one of his friends. He added: 'I would like to know if that is solely what they are basing their claims off of and, if so, then why did the AFP - in a press release in front of the world - state that I had made claims in online chat communities that were frequented by LulzSec members that I was the leader of LulzSec?' The 7.30 investigation says it found a teenage accomplice of Flannery actually carried out the hacking, this person was raided by police but never charged. Commander Glen McEwen, the AFP's national manager of cyber crime, also appeared on the show and said he couldn't be 100 per cent sure Flannery was not a member of LulzSec. Commander Glen McEwen, the AFP's national manager of cyber crime, said the police would not apologise for arresting Flannery . Commander McEwen said: 'As you'd appreciate, the virtual world and the anonymity as such, people come together for certain reasons and move away.

"A sharp pain surging across her chest, an ache creeping up her neck, causing a debilitating migraine. Kerisha Mark, from Beaumont, Texas, feared they were the symptoms of a heart attack or brain tumour. But the then 39-year-old was not at risk of either life-threatening conditions. Instead doctors told her the pain was the result of her breasts and a rare condition, gigantomastia. Ms Mark had always had an exceptionally large chest. Scroll down for video . Kerisha Mark's chest ballooned to a staggering 36NNN, left. She was diagnosed with a hormonal condition called gigantomastia, which is thought to be caused by a heightened sensitivity to female hormones. She is pictured after a dramatic reduction operation, right . But by her late 30s, her bust had grown to a staggering 36NNN. The rapid growth was the result of the hormonal condition. Gigantomastia is diagnosed when breast weight exceeds three per cent of a person's body weight. The enlargement can cause muscle pain, and over-stretching of the skin envelope, which can lead to ulceration. The condition usually affects one breast more than the other, causing asymmetry. It is thought the underlying cause of the condition is a heightened sensitivity to female hormones prolactin, oestrogen and progesterone. For Ms Mark the condition resulted in pulled chest muscles, severe back pain and emotional distress, the Washington Post reported. 'I could not run or jump or work out at all,' she said. 'I was very limited in a lot of things I could do.' She estimated her breasts weighed around 15lbs each, and said she had been forced to use duct tape to hold them in place. The 40-year-old, pictured before, left, and after surgery, right, decided to have reduction surgery to mark her milestone birthday earlier this year . Having considered surgery as an option for years, Ms Mark made the decision to mark her 40th birthday by having treatment. Gigantomastia is diagnosed when breast weight exceeds three per cent of a person's body weight. The enlargement can cause muscle pain, and over-stretching of the skin, which can lead to ulceration. The condition usually affects one breast more than the other, causing asymmetry. It is thought the underlying cause of the condition is a heightened sensitivity to female hormones prolactin, oestrogen and progesterone. Eyewitness News cameras followed Ms Mark into the operating theatre. 'I was like, happy birthday to me!' she said. She recalled how her large breasts have hampered daily life ever since she was young. 'My first time at boot camp, I did a jumping jack and my bra snapped,' she told the cameras. She added: 'I started to have really bad headaches. Women and men want to touch them to see if they are real. It's real intimidating.' Dr Franklin Rose, a plastic surgeon based in Houston, performed the operation. He told The Post he could not remember seeing a patient with larger breasts in his 35-year career. He said: 'The breasts really hung down to her hips and were essentially like carrying around three basketballs at all times because they were so large. 'When we went into the exam room - I don't know if I would use this word 'shocking', but it was certainly startling to see breasts of that magnitude.' Plastic surgeons removed 15lbs of breast tissue, leaving her with 'nice full' DD cups, pictured . Dr Franklin Rose from Houston, Texas, said in his 35-year career he has not seen a patient with a larger bust . Dr Rose said he recruited a colleague to help with the four-hour operation, where he removed 15lbs of breast tissue. They were able to leave Ms Mark with a 'nice full' DD cup bust. He said if her condition had been left untreated it could have developed into degenerative kyphosis, a condition causing a person's spine to curve forward, forming a hump or hunchback. Ms Mark said more than a month after the surgery, which took place in October, she is planning to start exercising again, and is excited at the prospect of a new wardrobe. 'The first time my best friend saw me, she cried,' Mark said. 'When I stood up for the first time I felt so light.' And when the operation was complete, she said she was overcome by emotions she hadn't expected. 'After I got home I did cry. It was like I mourned the death of them, it was like a divorce.' But today the 40-year-old is looking forward to a pain-free future. 'My first thing on the agenda is to purchase a beautiful bra and second is to buy a strapless dress,' she added. Ms Mark said the operation has changed her life, allowing her to start exercising again and treat herself to a new wardrobe. She said: 'When I stood up for the first time I felt so light' The consequences of having large breasts can be devastating, ranging from crippling back pain, neck and arm pain to headaches, friction rash and a curvature of the spine. Embarrassment can deter women from exercising, leaving them prone to health problems linked to obesity, including diabetes and heart disease. A study published in the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in 2012 found that a woman with very large breasts can lose five years off her expected lifespan if she does not have a reduction. Professor Laurence Kirwan is a plastic surgeon who performed a breast reduction on TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson after her breast size soared from a D-cup to an L-cup after having four children. Far from being merely cosmetic, Professor Kirwan said a large breast can weigh as much as 3.3lb and removing as little as half a pound can dramatically relieve the symptoms. But he points out that the issue is often not taken seriously, particularly as large breasts are seen as desirable. ‘It’s wrong for NHS trusts and insurance companies to dismiss this as vanity,’ he says. ‘Many of the women who come to me desperate for breast reductions have poor posture and are in a great deal of pain due to the drag on their shoulders and neck.’ Images by Debbie Porter Photography.","Kerisha Mark, from Texas, suffered a condition known as gigantomastia .

But the brand is hoping to make a big comeback with its latest offerings . The brand's first port of call? A tongue-in-cheek Christmas campaign - with gifts starting from a more purse-friendly £80. There's phone covers at £80, tasselled keyrings at £90, and totes at £495 - a far cry from the eye-watering £2,500 Cara Delevingne bag unveiled earlier this year. Clearly trying to keep up with younger audiences, Mulberry has unveiled the new Blossom Collection - a range of electric brights totes and rain boots, which they say are perfect for countryside walks and stomping through city puddles. The Christmas advert, which shows a family trying to outdo each other with presents and the grandmother winning the seal of approval by gifting her granddaughter with a new Mulberry bag, shows the brand's more modern new direction. The brand is also catering to furry friends this Christmas and has collaborated with luxury dog and cat outfitters Mungo & Maud for a capsule collection of collars (£80) and leads (£110). Thrifty: Clearly trying to keep up with younger audiences, Mulberry has unveiled the new Blossom Collection - a range of electric brights totes priced at £495 . Catering to a wide audience: The brand is also catering to furry friends this Christmas and has collaborated with luxury dog and cat outfitters Mungo & Maud for a capsule collection of collars (£80) and leads (£110) Perhaps in an attempt to give Burberry a run for its money, Mulberry has also introduced a complimentary monogramming service over the festive period. There are monogramming bars in the Mulberry store on New Bond Street and in the brand’s Harrods space. As well as standard letter and number symbols, there's also a set of exclusive Christmas symbols including a Christmas tree, present with bow, holly sprig and snowflake. So will the brand's efforts pay off? Maria Malone, Fashion Business expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Mulberry has failed to replicate the stratospheric sales of the Alexa bag with sales peaking in 2011. 'The recent launch of the Blossom range combines stand out colours and more affordable pieces. Increasing volume sales could be the answer, attracting customers wanting to buy into the brand but who find the more classic handbag price tags prohibitive. It's a dog's life: The collars and leads come in bright colours just like the new bags and purses . 'The contemporary designs of the Cara Delevingne range may hit the spot with younger customers new to the brand; but may, in contrast, turn off existing older customers who do not buy into the more obvious celebrity endorsement.' Founded in 1971 in Somerset by Roger Saul and his mother, Joan, Mulberry started out making belts, leather goods and scotchgrain holdalls,'Clipper bags'. Talented Brit Emma Hill took over the design helm in 2007 and was credited with creating the 'Alexa' satchel, inspired by Miss Chung, which still accounts for 27 per cent of sales, and propelled the company into the fastest-growing luxury brand of 2011. Bruno Guillon, former managing director of Hermes, was brought in with a remit to raise quality and, more importantly, prices. But it didn't quite go to plan. Personal stamp: Mulberry has also introduced a complimentary monogramming service over the festive period . After less than three months, Emma Hill announced she was leaving and prices sky-rocketed. A Bayswater, which in 2009 cost £495, is now £895, while a black ostrich Willow tote costs £5,500. Tammy Smulders, Managing Partner of SCB Partners & LuxHub at Havas Media, thinks Mulberry may have hit the spot with the new range. She said: 'As we come out of the recession, luxury brands are starting to pick sides - either increasing their prices aligned with ultra-luxe, or decreasing their prices to become more affordable luxury. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to play the middle ground. 'Mulberry is clearly playing the affordable luxury game, appealing to a wide range of luxury brand aspirants by offering giftable products that appeal and are affordable to a wide range of people. 'By offering fun coloured products, personalisation, and personal shoppers, they are really pulling out the stops to ensure that their product appeals to a broad range of people. Ultimately this is likely to be a great strategy to drive sales for the holiday season.'

"A teaching assistant groomed a schoolboy with sweets and cuddles then had sex with him in her Mini, a court has heard. Helen Turnbull sent the 16-year-old a photo of herself in her underwear and they swapped suggestive messages via Facebook and her phone, Teesside Crown Court was told. The mother-of-two has admitted she kissed the pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons but denies having sex with him or performing a sex act on him, or having oral sex with him. Helen Turnbull, pictured right at an earlier court appearance, said that her contact with the 16-year-old boy went no further than kissing. The 35-year-old, left, allegedly paid the boy special attention at school . The 35-year-old from Haswell, County Durham, has pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, but denies three other counts, saying their contact went no further than kissing. Sarah Mallett, prosecuting, told the jury: 'It is not suggested that [the boy] did not consent to what happened. 'These offences arose because of the need to protect children while they are at school from exploitative relationships with adult teachers who have trusted access to them, that can allow them to groom people in their care, so they then willingly engage in sexual activity.' The prosecution alleged Turnbull, known at the school as Miss Robson, paid the boy a lot of attention and gave him sweets and cuddles. 'This, the prosecution say, was the first stage of the grooming process,' she said. After a school prom she returned home drunk and changed her Facebook profile picture to one taken that night of her with the teenager, the court heard. The prosecution alleged Turnbull, pictured covering her face as she left court today, paid the boy a lot of attention and gave him sweets and cuddles . Soon after her husband Ben accused her of having an affair and their marriage broke down, the jury was told. The literacy assistant messaged the schoolboy on Facebook and they agreed to get together away from school. They had a secret meeting and they cuddled, then kissed, Miss Mallett said, and before they parted she warned him not to tell anyone. They met again more than a week later and this time had sex in her car, the prosecution alleged. They had to stop because another car pulled up nearby. Miss Mallett said they met and there was sexual activity twice more in the coming month. 'Helen Turnbull also sent pictures including one in her underwear,' the jury heard. The boy then began to cool on the relationship and felt pressured, Miss Mallett said. If he did not reply to texts she would send hostile ones, the prosecution alleged. The boy had been warned by her to delete messages between them, the court heard. 'She knew she was married and going through a divorce and was worried she might lose custody of the children,' Miss Mallett said. 'Helen Turnbull needed the relationship to remain secret.' Miss Mallett claimed Turnbull lied when her headteacher asked about what had been going on, telling him it was 'sorted'. The teenager's father found out and spotted Turnbull sitting in her car in his street, despite the boy never telling her his address, the court heard. Miss Mallett said: '(The father) was angry, got out of the car and called her a paedophile. 'She said ""It's not like that"", but he was, perhaps understandably, too angry to listen.' The pupil finally contacted police to report Turnbull’s behaviour when he was 17-years-old, with the help of his father. When Turnbull was arrested, she admitted she had hugged the boy and given him sweets in front of others. When her marriage got into trouble, she said she had sent him more than one friend request on Facebook. The attention made her feel better at the time, but she told police she now realised it had been 'stupid'. In a second police interview, she admitted sending messages of 'sexual banter' to the boy but they were merely intended 'titillate,' she said. The court heard messages police recovered included them discussing staying in a hotel and how nice it would be for them to share a bed. In one message, the boy told her: 'I will turn up but I am not some easy 16-year-old lay. No way will you get my kit off without some graft.' The trial continues.

"An amateur metal detectorist has unearthed one of the largest hoards of Roman coins ever found in Britain. Laurence Egerton, 51, made the discovery as he explored land near Seaton, in East Devon - and he was so concerned someone would steal it, he camped out for three nights while archaeologists excavated the site. Dubbed Seaton Down Hoard, the collection of 22,000 copper-alloy coins is thought to have been buried by a private individual or soldier for safe keeping, but was never recovered. Scroll down for video . The trove of 22,000 Roman coins (pictured) was found by Laurence Egerton in East Devon. Dubbed Seaton Down Hoard, it was declared treasure at a Devon Coroner’s Inquest earlier this month. This means it is eligible for acquisition by a museum, once it has been valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee . In addition to being one of the largest hoards - behind the Frome Hoard of 52,503 found in 2010, and a hoard of 22,703 found in Nether Compton in Dorset in 1989 - Mr Egerton's discovery is also one of the best preserved 4th century collections to be dug up. Earlier this month, Mr Egerton's hoard was declared treasure at a Devon Coroner’s Inquest. This means it is eligible for acquisition by a museum, once it has been valued by the Treasure Valuation Committee - a group of independent experts who advise the Secretary of State. According to Devon County Archaeologist, Bill Horner, the Roman copper-alloy coins date back to between AD 260 and AD 348 and bear the images of Emperor Constantine, his family, co-Emperors and immediate predecessors and successors. Mr Horner said it was a critical time in European and world history, Britain’s fortunes were fluctuating. ‘There was economic prosperity while Britain avoided the invasions and civil wars that ravaged the continent,' said Mr Horner. ‘Romanised farms, or Villas including several in East Devon, were at their richest. 'But the province was ultimately drawn into Imperial power struggles that, along with increasing attacks from Germanic, Irish and Caledonian tribes, resulted in the rapid decline and end of Roman rule. ‘Coastal areas such as East Devon were on the front-line, and this may be the context for the coin hoard. ‘There were no high street banks, so a good, deep hole in the ground was as secure a place as any to hide your savings in times of trouble, or if you were going away on a long journey. ‘But whoever made this particular deposit never came back to retrieve it.’ By comparison, the Frome Hoard was valued at £320,000 - so, in theory, the collection could cost in the region of £100,000. However, the Frome Hoard contained a mixture of silver and copper, so was considered more valuable. At the time the hoard was buried, it would have amounted to four gold coins, or solidi, which would have provided the ration of two soldiers for one year, or a worker’s pay for two years. Professor Neville Morley from Bristol University told MailOnline: Our knowledge of ancient prices is very patchy indeed, and the purchasing power of money varied enormously over time and space. 'The amount of money in this hoard would at some points have been the equivalent to a soldier's total salary for two years; at other dates it would have bought the services of a skilled craftsmen for perhaps 80 days; it could buy maybe 1,000 or so pints of Gallic beer (or double quantities of Egyptian beer, which wasn't so good) or enough grain to feed someone for two years or so. 'If you try to turn any of those into modern figures, then, it's clearly not the sort of fortune that would allow you to retire comfortably or buy a nice country estate; on the other hand, in a world where most people were living close to subsistence level and would have few if any savings, it's pretty impressive that someone had amassed enough money to live on for a year or so.' The Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) in Exeter, which already houses a large collection of local Romano-British objects, has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase the coins. Mr Egerton originally made the discovery in November 2013, while operating under licence on private land near the previously excavated site of a Roman villa at Honeyditches in East Devon. The coins were buried in a pit, and may have once been held in a bag, which did not survive. The hoard was excavated by a team of archaeologists, and were cleaned so they could be identified by experts at the British Museum. According to Devon County Archaeologist, Bill Horner, the Roman copper-alloy coins (pictured) date back to between AD 260 and AD 348 and bear the images of Emperor Constantine, his family, co-Emperors and immediate predecessors and successors . It was also reported to landowner Clinton Devon Estates, in accordance with the Treasure Act 1996. Mr Egerton said: 'It’s by far the biggest find I’ve ever had. It really doesn’t get any better than this. ‘Between finding the hoard and the archaeologists excavating the site, I slept in my car alongside it for three nights to guard it. ‘On this occasion, the ground where I was working was quite flinty and I found what I thought were two Roman coins which is actually quite unusual in Devon. ‘As I began working in a grid formation in the surrounding area I had a  signal on the metal detector which means that there is probably iron involved. ‘Most detectors are set up to ignore iron but I decided to dig the earth at that spot and immediately reached some iron ingots which were laid directly on top of the coins. Semi-retired builder Mr Egerton, 51, (pictured) originally made the discovery in November 2013. Between finding the hoard and archaeologists excavating the site, Mr Egerton slept in his car on site to guard it . In addition to being one of the largest hoards in Britain - behind the Frome Hoard of 52,503 found in 2010, and a hoard of 22,703 found in Nether Compton in Dorset in 1989 - Mr Egerton's discovery is also one of the best preserved 4th century collections (pictured) ‘The next shovel was full of coins - they just spilled out over the field.' According to Devon County Archaeologist Bill Horner, the Roman copper-alloy coins date back to between AD 260 and AD 348 and bear the images of Emperor Constantine, his family, co-Emperors and immediate predecessors and successors. Mr Horner said: ‘Our archaeologists and the team at the British Museum have reported that the majority of the coins are so well preserved that they were able to date them very accurately. ‘This is very unusual for Devon because the county as a whole has slightly acidic soil which leads to metals corroding. The discovery was made while Mr Egerton was operating under licence on private land near the previously excavated site of a Roman villa at Honeyditches in East Devon (marked). It was reported to landowner Clinton Devon Estates, in accordance with the Treasure Act 1996 . Exeter’s Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM) has said it would love to keep the hoard (pictured being uncovered) in Devon so that it can be seen by the public for the first time in over 1,500 years. The museum hopes to be able to raise the necessary funds and is organising a fundraising campaign .

"Britney Spears' new beau Charles Ebersol is not only Dad approved, he was Dad selected. The pop star's 'dadager' and conservator Jamie Spears knows that reality TV producer Charles Ebersol is no gold digger. 'Charlie had to pass the dad test for sure,' a long-time business friend of Jamie's  tells MailOnline exclusively. 'And Charlie had to pass legal muster, too, with that mob of lawyers that run her world.' Lest we forget, Britney's finances, and her personal life, are still in the hands of conservator lawyers, who can pretty much say 'yay' or 'nay' to anyone if they want. Lucky for Britney, 32, her family's matchmaking track record isn't too shabby. Scroll down for video . Heart! Could this be true love? Brit posted a selfie with her new squeeze Dick Ebersol captioning the picture with a heart . Sexy: Britney models her intimates lingerie collection, The Intimate Britney Spears on Sunday . All business: Dadager Jamie Spears has a hand in all things Britney. He introduced her to now ex boyfriend David Locado and kicked him to the curb when he cheated on his daughter . Britney's big brother Bryan introduced his sister to Jason Trawick in late 2007 at a sushi restaurant at the top of Beverly Glen, California. That that affair lasted more than two years. Dad Jamie found David Locado when they met in Britney's Westwood lawyers' offices. That relationship played out for 18 months, after they first kissed on Valentine's Day 2013. Both men were rumored to have cheated on the pop diva. 'When Jamie found out David was cheating on his daughter, the guy was kicked to the curb so fast, it would make your head spin. Jamie doesn't give second chances.' Enter the handsome Charlie Ebersol, 31, son of former NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol. And not a moment too soon. 'Britney functions best with a man in her life, and Jamie knows that. He's is good at selecting just the right candidates. They last a while. That's all anyone can ask, really. Britney has a complicated life.' 'It took less than a month for Jamie to find Charlie. He eyeballed him from a distance at first. But after a few meetings together, Jamie knew he'd found a good guy.' All dad had to do from there was get them together in a subtle way. 'Jamie had to do this stuff slowly and cautiously, so Britney wouldn't rebel. He had to make it seem like it was her idea to date Charlie, and not the other way around or it wouldn't work.' No slouch: Charles hangs out with other A-listers, including Ryan Gosling and Ashton Kutcher . The star's new man has previously been linked to tennis player Maria Sharapova and Sophia Bush (above) In early September, after accepting a business 'pitch' meeting with Ebersol, who co-founded the reality TV production house 'The Company,' it became clear to Mr. Spears that the young entrepreneur should be high up on the short list. 'Charlie is very much like Britney. They make a good couple. He was born privileged. He gets the game. He gets her lifestyle. He gets her. They're both about the same height, if that matters. And they are both a little out of touch with the cost of bread. 'They've been rich from a very young age. They live that world.' Charlie is the son of TV executive Dick Ebersol and Kate & Allie star Susan St. James. 'They were raised the same, in the Industry,' revealed the insider. 'Big emphasis on family and giving back to charities, that sort of stuff. That's what Jamie loves about him. 'Charlie's an okay guy. He isn't out to screw anybody. He saved his dad from a burning plane wreck, for chrissakes. What more could you want?' On November 28, 2004, a private plane crashed carrying Dick Ebersol, Charlie and brother Teddy, 14, who died in the accident. Initially, Jamie met Ebersol from across a conference table. The TV show producer was pitching Team Spears an idea for a reality show starring Britney. 'The concept sounded good to Jamie, and I guess it seems that as the meetings advanced, Britney was brought in to meet Charlie. 'Lo and behold there was chemistry there. This was a couple of months ago now. So Jamie sat on that idea of a reality show.' 'You have to remember, Britney gets pitched these things 50 times a day. But Jamie liked the idea of her going out into the world and doing good. She's really so naturally generous. To a fault, really. And so is Charlie.' New love: Britney Spears, pictured at a Britney Day celebration ceremony in Las Vegas on Wednesday, has confirmed she is dating writer and producer Charlie Ebersol . Big smiles: Britney was also seen yesterday out in Vegas carrying her brother Bryan's daughter . Niece to see you! The singer was wearing a pair of sheepskin boots and a novelty Mickey Mouse hat . Sources suggest the Britney's reality show would peg her as a philanthropist, rather than a chart topper. Each episode would follow Britney finding new ways to give money or services to people or give back to a community. 'Jamie likes the idea. And so does Britney. It puts her out of her comfort zone of playing mom and rock star and into the role of giving to those in need.' And with each subsequent meeting, one thing led to another. Pretty soon, Charlie and Britney were moving from the board room into the dining room. 'There were a few 'dinner' meetings. They were getting to know each other.' Meanwhile, Jamie maintained a strict leash on his ward. Britney can date, surely. But Edan Yemini, Britney's bodyguard of more than six years, always must be waiting nearby. Whether at the restaurant's bar observing, or in an SUV idling out front, Britney's guards are charged with never leaving her alone. And despite Britney's public acknowledgment of their union on Wednesday at a Las Vegas press conference, there was still no official word on the reality show. Last Wednesday was dubbed 'Britney Day' in Las Vegas, when the Toxic singer accepted the 'Key to the Las Vegas Strip.' the divorced mother-of-two seized the opportunity to tell Extra that she and Ebersol were an official couple. 'Yes, there is a special someone' she told the news outlet. Britney continues her concert residency at Planet Hollywood with newly-added show dates for 'Britney Spears: Piece of Me' through 2016. 'Charlie's seen her show like six times. It takes 20 minutes by private plane from Van Nuys, so there won't be any long-distance relationship issues, like there were with Jason.' (Jason traveled with his clients Taylor Swift, Hilary Duff and Paris Hilton which ticked off Brit to no end) And as a possible jump start to her philanthropic TV persona, Britney announced that every ticket purchased for her show, one dollar will go toward the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation. Parental units: Charles is the son of TV executive Dick Ebersol and actress Susan St James . Tell-all: Britney Spears with former Jersey Shore DJ Pauly D on Extra - she told him she had a new love . However, the singer and mother of Jayden and Sean has remained optimistic about finding Mr Right. 'I'd like to have more kids, settle down ... have kids – maybe twins – and get married,' she said last year. 'That would be nice.' Hear that, Charlie?","When Jamie Spears first met Charlie Ebersol, he had an inkling he was the right guy for his daughter .

"The beauty of a small stream cutting through the vast Glencoe mountains in Scotland has won top prize in the Landscape Photographer of the Year awards. The moody shot, taken by Mark Littlejohn, from Penrith, Cumbria, beat thousands of images showing the beauty of the UK's landscapes to be awarded the £10,000 prize. Judges claimed the dramatic picture of Scotland captured 'a fleeting moment of beauty' in the Highlands. Take A View of A Beginning and an End: Mark Littlejohn's dramatic Glencoe stream was the Overall Winner in this year's Landscape Photographer of the Year Awards . A second image of a sunset over the heather-strewn Yorkshire Moors was also recognised as the image most likely to encourage people to visit Britain. The photos that took top position in the variety of different categories depicted some of the UK's most iconic countryside as well as the hidden beauty in the country's cityscapes. A misty early morning in the Peak District, London Bridge from above and a striking tower at Sheffield University also took top honours. Take A View of Heather in Bloom: The beauty of the North York Moors, captured by John Robinson, from Peterlee, Co Durham, was honoured as the photo most likely to encourage people to visit Britain . Take A View of Sunrise: The dramatic Winnats Pass, Derbyshire, won the Visit Britian 'You're invited' Award for the best image from an overseas entrant category and wa taken by German Sven Mueller . Mr Littlejohn said he had got up at 1.30am to drive to Glencoe for his winning shot, but the rain had been torrential at dawn. As he wandered about waiting for gaps in the weather he saw the stream form high up on Gearr Aonach. 'It tumbled steeply down the slopes before vanishing again near the base of the mountain. With more squalls coming through I decided to take this image as the light became slightly more diffuse. It had to be a quick handheld shot due to the sideways rain.' He added that he struggled to take in the news he had won the competition. 'I suppose all I can say is that I just felt pure joy. I haven't stopped smiling since.' Take A View of Bright Eyes: The Classic View category was won by this image taken by Dave Fieldhouse of Hope Valley from the Great Ridge, Derbyshire . Take A View of Fred 'n' Sue: The Living the View category was won by Jo Teasdale who snapped a wintery shot of Brighton, East Sussex . Charlie Waite, landscape photographer and founder of the Take a view Landscape Photographer of the Year Awards, said: 'Mark discovered and isolated a fleeting moment of beauty within a vast and slightly threatening arena. 'The composition compels us to visually explore the image and its delicacy and understatement are enormously satisfying.' Sam Rielly, 17, from London, won the the Young Photographer of the Year award for a black and white image of his mother walking through the landscape of Anglesey, Wales. Dorset beauty: Jake Pike's dramatic sky over Durdle Door won the Youth Classic view category . Take A View of London Bridge Station: Stephen Bright snapped this picture of the busy London railway station from the viewing platform at the capital's iconic Shard . Take A View of University of Sheffield: The Arts Tower won the Urban View category in this year's Landscape Photographer of the Year Awards and was taken by Daniel Cook . Of his picture, he said: 'This image was taken on a particularly wet and windy day on Parys Mountain, the site of a former copper mine. The subject of the image is my mother, who was unaware that I was taking the picture.' The awards are being held in association with VisitBritain, and a category for overseas entrants was won by Sven Mueller from Germany for his dramatic shot of the Peak District. The Network Rail Lines in the Landscape award went to Stephen Bright, from Hook, Hampshire, for his shot of London Bridge train station from the viewing platform at the top of the Shard. The winning entries will be exhibited on the recently-built mezzanine level at Britain's busiest station, London Waterloo, from December 1 and in the Landscape Photographer of the Year awards book.","Landscape Photographer of the Year awards gave top honours to a dramatic picture of a Glencoe stream .

"A shortage of donor sperm has meant that Australia's supply has been severely depleted, resulting in moves for it to be provided from overseas instead. Fertility clinics across the country are struggling to recruit enough local men as the demand now from single women and same-sex couples is too much. The number of people accessing donor insemination has also more than tripled in the past four years. Another major effect is that donating sperm anonymously has been banned state-wide, and this has put many men off from donating sperm in recent years. Culturally Australians lag behind most other countries when it comes to donating tissues or organs anyway. So there was never that many available sperm donors to begin with. A big increase in demand for donor sperm has seen fertility clinics looking further afield . 'There is a serious shortage in donor sperm,' Associate Professor Peter Illingworth, medical director at IVF Australia, said. 'The demand is such from the likes of single women and same-sex couples that overseas donations is definitely one way of meeting this shortfall. 'So long as the same practices that are required in Australia are followed overseas it will work. But other countries need to comply fully with all the ethical and legal standards set out in Australia.' It is essential that full identification of each sperm donors is provided. In the past anonymity had persuaded men to donate sperm, but this is now a thing of the past. Associate Professor Peter Illingworth advocates the full identification of each sperm donor . 'It is very important that the donors are willing to leave their identity for the children when they get older. As a consequence of that we don't have as many donors as we need,' Prof Illingworth said. 'The actual legislation varies a little bit from one state to another. 'But it is the case that in every state in Australia, donors do need to leave their identity, and nowhere in Australia is there totally anonymous sperm donations any more.' If the same practices that are required in Australia are followed overseas there should be no issues . Prof Illingworth said there were still many men who want to give their sperm so others can have a family, and to leave a bit of themselves behind on the planet, but nowhere near as many as before. 'There's a general acceptance that the old days of using anonymous sperm donors was not a good thing, and that there are a number of young adults who have been quite severely traumatised by the fact they can't track down where they have come from,' Prof Illingworth explained. What also affects the number of sperm donors productivity is that from state to state it varies as to how many families a donor can create. In New South Wales you are only allowed to use a donor to create five families, while in Queensland and Victoria it's 10 families. Because of the increased demand from couples, clinics now are looking at a range of options . However, Dr Chris Copeland, the scientific director of the Canberra Fertility Centre, believed that the main difference was that the likes of the United States and other countries were more prepared to donate their tissues in the first place. 'The anonymity factor has hurt us to an extent, but the number of sperm donors was never great to start with,' Dr Copeland said. 'Australians are notoriously poor tissue donors. We are one of the worst blood donor groups in the world for example. If you look at a propensity to donate Australia is right down at the bottom of the list. 'It's a cultural thing. People in the US and Europe are more likely to donate their blood or their organs. It's hardly surprising therefore that they're more willing to donate their sperm. 'We just have to try and encourage people here to be more generous.' In their annual report the Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority said the number of donors whose sperm was available on July 1 dropped by 23 per cent compared to the previous year. Increased communication internationally means the best sperm donors can be found . 'The number of men signing up to become sperm donors has dwindled from 64 to 61, because the demand has been so great. The number the number of women using donor insemination increased from 92 in 2009-10 to 311 this year,' explained VARTA chief executive, Louise Johnson. 'Some clinics in Victoria have been investigating importing donor sperm. The important thing is that regardless of where the donors come from they still need to be identifiable, altruistic, and their details need to be accessible to the who are children born who will want to know this information. 'All the requirements under Victorian legislation need to be meet concerning overseas donors.' VARTA chief executive, Louise Johnson, believes all appropriate criteria must be met by overseas donors . Johnson said that because of the increased demand clinics are looking at a range of options. 'Victorian clinics are still looking to expand their recruitment methods locally but checking overseas options as well. But they must be aware of the implications of donating and meet our criteria,' she said. Sourcing the appropriate sperm donors overseas is getting easier though. 'With increased communication internationally it's less of a hurdle to find the right sperm donor overseas. People are using Skype to discuss possible donation. Counsellors here use Skype as a method of communicating with donors as well,' Johnson said. The rise in same-sex couples wanting a child has forced some to look abroad for sperm donors . The Age reported that Melbourne IVF is currently recruiting donors through a sperm bank in Virginia in the United States in the hope that Australian patients will have access to imported donor sperm by mid-2015. 'The issue in Victoria has been the legislation, which allows identification as a right to the offspring when they turn 18, so what we've discussed with a group in America is for them to recruit sperm donors who are happy to meet those requirements,' medical director Dr Lyndon Hale said. Culturally Australians are adverse to donating blood or organs. The same goes for sperm . Melbourne IVF saw the biggest decline in donor sperm supply last year. The number of new donors recruited increased from 42 to 44 in 12 months, but available donor sperm plummeted from 104 to eight over the same period.","Importing donor sperm from overseas is only way to bridge the shortfall .
Banning sperm donated anonymously has also made a huge difference .
Donating tissues or organs has always been culturally frowned upon .
Other countries must comply with ethical and legal standards in Australia ."
"A couple have been sentenced to six months in jail for having sex outdoors at a Florida retirement community. Charm Gilbert, 40, and James Adams, 47, were found guilty last week of indecent exposure and disorderly conduct in connection.

Adams told the deputy he was having sexual intercourse with Gilbert, 40, at the time due to them not having any other place to go, according to the arrest, reports The Smoking Gun. They had sex at The Villages – a 50,0000-strong community for the over 55’s in Florida’s Sunter County (pictured) Adams and Gilbert were taken to Sumter County Jail, reports Click Orlando. The pair have been in custody since their arrest and pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor counts. In addition to the jail time, they have each been ordered to pay more than $1000 in fines and court fees. The Villages bills itself as 'Florida's Friendliest Retirement Hometown' and has three town squares offer shopping, dining, and theater along with free nightly entertainment that finishes at 9 p.m. It is not the first time The Village has hit the headlines for this - in June a 68-year-old woman who was arrested for having sex in public there was sentenced to six months in prison. Margaret 'Peggy' Klemm had sex with 49-year-old David Bobilya at the pavilion at Lake Sumter Landing Market Square at around 10:30pm on June 2.

The duo 'had sex' at Lake Sumter Landing--one of The Villages's three squares (pictured) The pair were arrested for public indecency just days after Klemm was given probation in court for drunk driving in a golf court in the retirement village. The Smoking Gun reports that when investigators arrived at the scene, a popular spot for nightly entertainment, Klemm had her shirt pulled down and wasn't wearing any pants. Bobilya's pants and underwear were pulled down all the way to his ankles. Police say that Klemm and Bobilya both seemed to be intoxicated but that they followed police officers' orders and put their clothing back on. Klemm pleaded guilty in a plea deal. Her attorney said her sentence could have been up to one year in jail. As she was sentenced, a tearful Klemm mouthed 'I love you' to her husband of 50 years Frank Klemm. 'She is a super woman as far as I'm concerned,' Frank Klemm told Click Orlando following the hearing. 'And she deserves a second chance. That's all I have to say.'","Spotted by a passerby in Lady Lake, Lake County, Florida .

"Pizza Hut is letting customers play mad scientist, giving them the freedom to make pies with honey Sriracha sauce or add curry flavor to the crusts. The atypical flavors and new ingredients are part of a menu overhaul set to be announced Monday and hit stores November 19. Executives are hoping the revamp - which includes an updated logo and more relaxed uniforms for workers - will be the trick that finally jumpstarts sales. New additions: Above, the Cherry Pepper Bombshell pizza by Pizza Hut which consists of 'premium crushed tomato sauce topped with premium salami, Peruvian cherry peppers and fresh spinach' Pizza Hut, which is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc. and based in Plano, Texas, has reported sales declines for eight straight quarters at established locations, even as rivals Domino's and Papa John's have enjoyed gains. To regain its footing, Pizza Hut is turning to a growing trend in the industry: giving people greater flexibility to tailor orders exactly to their tastes. The popularity of places like Chipotle that let people select toppings has prompted a variety of chains to play up their own customization options. Even McDonald's, which grew to popularity in part because of its consistency, is testing a format in California that lets people build their own burgers by picking the bun, patty and toppings they want. Pizza Hut is still keeping its most popular pies on the menu, such as the Meat Lover's and Veggie Lover's, while adding 11 new specialty pies and a section of 'Skinny' pies that are lower in calories. But for people who like to design their own pies, it's giving them yet more ways to do so at no extra cost. For the base sauce, people will be able pick from six options, including marinara, garlic parmesan and honey Sriracha. They can also add swirl of flavor to their pies, picking from four 'drizzles' including balsamic and buffalo. Choice: The chain is also adding more toppings, including banana peppers, cherry peppers and spinach . Build your own: For the base sauce, people will be able pick from six options, including marinara and buffalo . And they'll be able to brush pie crusts with one of ten flavors, including salted pretzel and fiery red pepper. Two of the crust flavors will be updated regularly, with Ginger Boom Boom and Curried Away being the first limited-time offerings. Carrie Walsh, Pizza Hut's chief marketing officer, said she expects the majority of customers to take advantage of the new options, even if it's just requesting a parmesan crust on a Meat Lover's pie. The chain is also adding more toppings, including banana peppers, cherry peppers and spinach. New look: The chain's famous red roof logo will be also tweaked so that it's white against a swirling red circle . Standard toppings are also being renamed to make them more appealing; black olives, for instance, will be called 'Mediterranean black olives' and red onions will be renamed 'fresh red onions,' although the ingredients are the same. The chain's famous red roof logo will be also tweaked so that it's white against a swirling red circle. And worker uniforms will switch to jeans and T-shirt, rather than a polo shirt with black pants. 'It's a signal to America there's a big change at Pizza Hut,' Walsh said.","Pizza Hut customers can now customize their base sauce, add a 'swirl of drizzle' and pick a pie crust flavor .

"Scientists have found the single chemical component in blood that creates the metallic scent that Count Dracula found so irresistible in films. Christopher Lee is pictured playing the role of Count . In Bram Stoker’s vampire novel, sharp-toothed Count Dracula can hardly contain himself when his guest, Jonathan Harker, cuts himself shaving. Now scientists have found the single chemical component in blood that creates the metallic scent that the fictional count found so irresistible. They said that the undead aristocrat was reacting to an organic ‘aldehyde’ compound called trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal. To pinpoint the compound, scientists from Linkoping University in Sweden conducted an experiment using zoo animals. They impregnated lumps of wood with the lab-made chemical and found that it triggered a strong response from carnivores such as African and Asian wild dogs, South American bush dogs, and Siberian tigers. On its own, the compound produced the same reactions - sniffing, licking, biting, pawing and toying - as horse blood. The carnivores ignored logs coated with fruit essence and a near-odourless solvent. Tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound, while South American bush dogs lost interest more quickly than other species. ‘For predators, food scents are particularly attractive, and much of this has to do with blood,’ said lead scientist Professor Matthias Laska, of the university. Scientists from Linkoping University in Sweden said that the undead aristocrat was reacting to an organic ‘aldehyde’ compound found in blood ( Microscopic image pictured) called trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal . ‘We wanted to find out which chemical components create the scent of blood.’ Prior to the research, little information existed on the substances that give blood its smell. The team used sophisticated chemical analysis techniques that identified 30 candidate compounds. It took the sensitive noses of human scent experts to single out the elusive aldehyde, which they recognised as emitting the distinctive metallic odour typically associated with blood. The animals tests, which were conducted at Kolmarden Wildlife Park in Sweden, proved it was this that attracted meat-eating predators, but the scientists are not sure how the scent evolved. Professor Laksa said: ‘How this has developed through evolution is an interesting question. Perhaps there is a common denominator for all mammalian blood.’ The research is published in the online journal Plos One. They found that the compund produced the same reactions - sniffing, licking, biting, pawing and toying - as horse blood in a variety of carnivores. Siberian tigers reacted most strongly to the blood compound . The novel may be based upon Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia (pictured) also known as Vlad the Impaler . Dracula is an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so he can find new blood and spread the undead curse, as well as the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and women led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing. While it is a work of fiction, the novel contains historical references. It may be based upon Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia who is also known as Vlad the Impaler. The aristocrat, who reigned from 1456 to 1462 is said to have killed up to 100,000 people by impaling them. The name Dracula comes from a Chivalric order called the Order of the Dragon to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks. Vlad the Impaler wore the emblem of the order and the name Dracula means 'Son of Dracul' It's said that Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history, but experts dispute how much he knew about Vlad. It's also been suggested that the author was influenced by the history of Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who tortured and killed between 36 and 700 young women. It was later commonly believed that she committed these crimes to bathe in their blood, believing that this preserved her youth.","In the novel, the Count was reacting to the scent of an organic ‘aldehyde’ compound called trans-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal found in blood .

"Look into my eyes: Princess is the only dog in the world who can hypnotise people, her owner claims . Move over Derren Brown. There's a four-pawed hypnotist in town who claims to be able to put people under her spell instantly. The feat is even more remarkable given that the hypnotist is in fact a dog named Princess – supposedly the only canine in the world who can put humans into a trance-like state. The four-year-old German Spitz has been performing on stage for the past two years alongside her owner Krystyna Lennon, who is qualified in hypnosis. Ms Lennon says her pet is able to send people to sleep – a skill she claims is linked to the believed primal ability that dogs are able to hypnotise their prey. 'It is definitely not something that just any dog can do, it is a very specific skill. 'They either have it or they don't,' said Ms Lennon. 'It's about their natural ability, it's all down to the dog. They need to be very well trained and well behaved. 'A lot of people are very sceptical about the show and don't think that a dog would be able to do it - but once they see it, they are gobsmacked. 'Some people even think she is a puppet and not even a real dog. The Leeds-based mother of three said Princess can hypnotises anyone, but some people react better than others. 'Being hypnotised is like being drunk,' she said. 'It brings out your inhibitions, and your memory from when you were under does come back but it's usually a bit faded or you need to be prompted.' Scroll down for video . Spellbound: The impressive four-year-old German Spitz has been performing on stage for the past two years alongside her owner Krystyna Lennon (right), who is qualified in hypnosis . Teamwork: Ms Lennon says her pet is able to send people to sleep – an ability she claims is linked to the supposed primal ability that dogs are able to hypnotise their prey . Dog psychologist Stan Rawlinson told MailOnline, that while dogs can induce a deep state of relaxation in humans, they certainly can't hypnotise people. 'It is the person that is working with the dog that is doing the hypnotising through her actions and tone of voice,' said Mr Rawlinson, who describes himself as 'the original dog listener'. Ms Lennon is the niece of Hugh Lennon, who originally founded the first Hypnodog show with his pet Oscar in 1989. The 40-year-old stepped in after her uncle, 65, was forced to retire from performing due to ill health and even gave up her job to commit to the show full time. Pawful behaviour: Dog psychologist Stan Rawlinson told MailOnline, that while dogs can induce a deep state of relaxation in humans, they certainly can't hypnotise people. Pictured is Princess' stage show, with volunteers allegedly acting under the effects of hypnosis . Hypnodog: 'A lot of people are very sceptical about the show and don't think that a dog would be able to do it - but once they see it, they are gobsmacked,' said Ms Lennon . Professional hypnotist Hugh Lennon - who also happens to be Krystyna Lennon's uncle - discovered Oscar, a 10-month-old black Labrador Retriever puppy, on a farm in Yorkshire. He claims: 'one night I brought him on stage with me. He started staring at this girl and she fell into hypnosis, without me doing a thing'. According to Mr Lennon, dogs and other carnivores have a natural ability to hypnotise prey. Ms Lennon stepped n after her uncle, 65, was forced to retire from performing due to ill health and even gave up her job to commit to the show full time. Princess is also related to Oscar, the original Hypnodog, and Ms Lennon claims she has the same hypnotic abilities. 'I helped out Hugh with the lighting and music for the show when I was younger, so I had seen the act hundreds of times before I took over,' said Ms Lennon. 'Princess is related to Oscar, the original Hypnodog, but we never intended to use her for the show. 'We noticed that she started to display some of the same attributes that Oscar had - she was very calm and would sit very still and stare. 'So when I took over from my Uncle Hugh I decided to use Princess - and because she is my own dog she reacts so much better to me. 'Princess is a complete diva, she absolutely loves being the centre of attention on stage and being fussed over and watched by so many people.' Ms Lennon and Princess are currently touring the UK and performing their show at university fresher's events.

"Evelyn Davey was forced to wait on the wet pavement with passers-by for two hours when she fell in the street . A great-grandmother was left in agony on a rain-soaked pavement after suffering a fall because emergency services were too busy to come to her aid. Despite being called only moments after Evelyn Davey slipped and broke her arm, paramedics failed to get to the pensioner for two hours. The 89-year-old’s anguished cries were heard by members of the public who wrapped her in blankets while holding umbrellas over her. But the crowd of helpers was unable to administer any first aid to Mrs Davey due to the amount of pain she was in so they were forced to wait for an ambulance. When North East Ambulance Service finally arrived at the scene in Ormesby, North Yorkshire, her legs had gone numb. The service blamed the delay on ‘high demand’ but the passers-by who came to Mrs Davey’s help said they were shocked at her treatment. ‘As time went on she was getting colder and colder and we were getting more worried,’ said Barbara Leyshon, secretary of a social club near where Mrs Davey fell. ‘I can’t believe how long she had to stay like that.’ CCTV of the incident shows the frail pensioner sitting on the sodden pavement as passers-by rush to her aid. Frightened that moving her would cause further injury, Mrs Davey was given blankets to keep herself warm as she waited for help. Mrs Davey's son-in-law, Ray Porter, was horrified when he and his wife arrived at hospital an hour after learning the pensioner had fallen to find that she still hadn't been collected. 'We went straight to the hospital but when we arrived at 1.45pm, they knew nothing about it and did not know where Evelyn was. 'We just assumed that she would have been taken there by that time. The pensioner crashed onto the curb, hurting her left arm. After the fall, she was in too much pain to move . 'After a while we got sick of waiting so I rang the club and they told me that she was still outside so we drove there and saw two ambulances outside.' 'We can’t believe it and will definitely be putting in a letter of complaint.' A spokesman for North East Ambulance Service, who last week came under fire when a 15-year-old boy waited two hours for paramedics after breaking his leg, blamed the long delay on high demand. Evelyn Davey, 89, was walking along the damp pavement when she lost her footing and fell onto her side . Passers-by and club members rushed out to wait with Mrs Davey who was not collected for two hours . 'We were called a 12.38pm to reports of a woman who had suffered as fall, sustaining a non-life threatening injury to her shoulder. 'At the time we were handling a high volume of emergencies. 'A crew became available to attend at 2.40pm and the patient was taken to James Cook University Hospital.' Mrs Davey is still recovering in hospital.","Evelyn Davey fell outside a social club on a wet day in Ormesby, Yorkshire .

"Chic in a double-breasted black coat, Sophie Wessex cut a solemn figure as she watched the Remembrance Sunday ceremony unfold  from her vantage point on a Whitehall balcony. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess wore a £1,625 Alexander McQueen coat with a delicate, jewelled poppy and a feathered cocktail hat, leaving the two looking strikingly similar - and not for the first time. Now on the cusp of 50, Sophie Wessex is more polished  than ever before and boasts a wardrobe that rivals the Duchess of Cambridge's own, complete with many of the younger royal's favourite labels. Scroll down for video . Polished: The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex both opted for £1,625 Alexander McQueen coats yesterday . Snap! The Duchess of Cambridge in floor-length pink in 2007 (left) and the Countess of Wessex in a similar gown in 2012 . Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie loves a bit of Alexander McQueen and is no stranger to the work of Emilia Wickstead. Indeed, the latter has become something of a staple for the Countess of Wessex, who regularly wears Wickstead ensembles for big events. But Kate isn't the only royal to share an overlapping sense of style with the Countess. The Duchess of Cornwall's favourite designer, Bruce Oldfield, is another Sophie staple, while another name popular with both is Catherine Walker. Nevertheless, it is the Duchess of Cambridge who has the most in common with Sophie, with show-stopping gowns, neatly tailored suits in flattering royal blue and cream, fitted blazers and chic cocktail hats by up-and-coming milliner Jane Taylor loved by both. And while the Duchess of Cambridge has a stylist in the shape of former PA Natasha Archer, 27, Sophie's new look is all her own work - although she does nod to Kate's look on occasion. Fussy: The Countess of Wessex was once a fan of unflattering fussy hats and boxy skirt suits in old-fashioned pastel hues . All change: Prior to her 1999 wedding and in the early noughties, Sophie's look was dominated by boxy suits and sequins . Improvements: Along with a sleeker approach to fashion, the Countess has also grown out the matronly bob she once sported . Sartorial evolution: Early photos, such as this 1993 snap (left), show her in boxy jackets, which she wore well into her 30s and 40s (right) Either way, she's looking good and it hasn't gone unnoticed. 'The Countess of Wessex used to dress like the archetypal Sloane Ranger at a wedding circa 1985,' says stylist Stephanie Hirschmiller. 'Typical, in fact, of someone who found their style in their twenties and has never deviated since. However, in the last year she’s undergone a make-over of the best kind and has not only come out looking way more sophisticated, but 10 years younger too.' Like the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex comes from relatively humble stock and is the daughter of retired car tyre salesman, Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones, and his wife Mary. Born and raised in the idyllic Kent village of Brenchley, the Countess' childhood was a happy one that saw her attend a series of private schools before completing a secretarial course at West Kent College in Tonbridge. Unhappy with secretarial work, Sophie then embarked on a career in public relations, spending four years at Capital Radio before launching her own firm, RJH Public Relations, in 1996 and continued to work there after meeting and then marrying Prince Edward in 1999. Favourite: Both the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie Wessex are fans of Emilia Wickstead and even opt for similar designs . Good look: The Duchess of Cambridge in a conservative navy blue suit in 2011. Right: Sophie opts for an edgier version a year later . Striking: Both royals are partial to a coat dress, both Alexander McQueen in this case, teamed with nude shoes and cocktail hats . Palace sources say Sophie has long been a favourite of the Queen, who supported her through her annus horribilis in 2002 when the Countess, who was still recovering from an ectopic pregnancy, was caught up in a newspaper sting orchestrated by the News of the World's notorious 'fake sheikh', Mazhar Mahmood. Despite the release of a statement in which Buckingham Palace described the article as 'selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue', the Countess gave up her PR work to become a full time royal at the end of that year. Since then, she has gone on to become a mother to Lady Louise, 11, and James, Viscount Severn, six, and has made a name for championing disability and children's charities. She is also a trusted senior member of the Royal Family and regularly steps in for the Queen abroad, as she will do when she attends the funeral of Michael Sata, the late president of Zambia, in Lusaka this week. But it is her increasingly chic style that is the most obvious sign of her growing confidence, with Daily Mail fashion editor Eliza Scarborough among those left impressed by her transformation. 'The Countess of Wessex has a sophisticated and sleek look thanks to favourite designers such as Bruce Oldfield,' explains Scarborough. 'She tends to make a statement with her hats instead and loves one of Kate’s preferred milliners, Jane Taylor.' Stylish: The Duchess of Cambridge and the Countess of Wessex are both fans of a flattering fit and flare silhouette . 'Very few members of the royal family can be passed off as truly fashionable,' adds fashion expert and blogger, Simon Glazin, another fan of the Countess of Wessex' new look. 'I think we can probably count on one hand the icons: the late Princesses Diana and Margaret and now, to some, the Duchess of Cambridge. We forget Sophie but now more than ever she is getting it right every time we see her. 'Unlike the Duchess, Sophie seems to wear something new for each royal engagement. When her children were younger, she did the whole practical mum look, all flat shoes and loose dresses, but the last couple of years have seen Sophie amp up her style. 'She loves well fitting dresses that show off her shape, usually opting for block colours and sometimes with features that accentuate her waist in particular. And what she does best are jackets, whether cropped, peplum, belted or structural. I love that she chose McQueen for Remembrance Sunday, along with The Duchess. Both look super chic. I'd love to see Sophie in some prints and maybe some more of the younger British designers, but right now she can't do a thing wrong.' 'Comparisons with the Duchess of Cambridge are inevitable,' concludes Hirschmiller, 'but whether Sophie is sharing her PA-cum-stylist Natasha Archer or not, this is classic contemporary dressing Noughties style – it won’t rock your world but it’s eminently well put-together and faultlessly stylish.' Similar style: Cream coats teamed with black court shoes, tights and scarves are loved by both royal women .

"Donald Trump has been found personally liable for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license. New York state Supreme Court Justice Cynthia S. Kern said he was notified by the state in 2005 that his Trump Entrepreneur Initiative - known as Trump University until 2010 - was in violation of state education law. 'It is undisputed that Mr. Trump never complied with the licensing requirements,' Kern wrote in a decision made public on Wednesday. Donald Trump, pictured opening Trump University in 2005, has been found personally liable for operating a for-profit investment school without the required license . Damages will be determined later. Jeffrey Goldman, an attorney for Trump, said the ruling was mistaken, but ultimately little if any damages would be awarded. The decision came in an ongoing lawsuit filed last year by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that accuses Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people who paid between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn Trump's real estate investment techniques. A trial still must be held to determine whether Trump and the school defrauded students. The judge did toss out some claims and ruled that some evidence was beyond the statute of limitations. Damien LaVera, a spokesman for Schneiderman, called the decision 'an important victory' and said the office looks forward to proving the rest of the case at trial. Goldman said 'the heart of the attorney general's case has been eviscerated.' He said the judge ruled that the statute of limitations restricts claims to only the last six months the school was in existence. The university ceased operation in late 2010, Goldman said. The lawsuit, brought by the New York attorney general,  sparked a bitter reaction from Trump, who called Schneiderman a publicity seeking 'lightweight,' attacked his 'gross incompetence' and filed ethics complaints against him.

"Britons will be quizzed as new suspects over missing Madeleine McCann's disappearance, it was claimed today. The British nationals are among a group of seven people due to be questioned as arguidos - a Portuguese legal term roughly translating as 'formal suspect' - leading Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias reported. Four more will be interviewed as witnesses towards the end of the month at a police station in Faro. Britons will be quizzed as new suspects over missing Madeleine McCann's disappearance, it was claimed today. The British nationals are among a group of seven people due to be questioned as arguidos - a Portuguese legal term roughly translating as 'formal suspect' The seven suspects know the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine, then aged three, vanished from on May 3 2007, know each other and made phone calls the night she disappeared, Jornal de Noticias said. Some are also said to have criminal records and others are ex-workers of the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine, three at the time, was staying with her parents. It is not known how many of the group of seven, which also includes Portuguese nationals, are British. Neither was it clear last night if they continue to live in Praia da Luz or have now moved away from the town. Parents: Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have continued to fight to find their daughter after she disappeared seven years ago . Missing: Earlier this month a new picture of three-year-old Madeleine dressed as a pumpkin was released by a campaign group with the blessing of her parents. She vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings in Praia Da Luz more than seven years ago . The fact they are set to be questioned as arguidos show the Operation Grange officers probing Madeleine's disappearance are still focusing on the theory she was killed during a bungled break-in. Three of the four suspects questioned at the start of July were quizzed because British police suspected they were involved in a burglary at apartment 5A where Madeleine was sleeping with her twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now nine. At least one of the 11 people set to be quizzed later this month is thought to be a woman. British police are now in the process of formally asking for permission to sit in on the interviews, which will be led by Portuguese officers who will ask questions on their behalf.

A small team of three officers including DCI Andy Redwood met Policia Judiciaria bosses in Faro for an update meeting before travelling to the university city of Coimbra a five hour drive north to visit a lab where many of the DNA samples collected after Madeleine's disappearance are held. British police told bosses at Portugal's Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences they wanted to retest some of the samples to try to crack the mystery of Madeleine's disappearance. They are yet to send a sixth international letter of request which mother-of-four Mrs Sequeira will have to authorise before Met Police forensics experts are allowed access to the lab or given permission to take samples to Britain to analyse them. The forensic material includes hairs and pieces of the curtains that hung in apartment 5A. It emerged late last month nearly 100 strands of hair tested during the original Madeleine McCann investigation were never DNA-matched. The Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz where Madeleine McCann was staying when she disappeared in May 2007 . The Operation Grange inquiry is running in parallel with a new Portuguese probe, reopened in May more than five years after being shelved. Scotland Yard detectives dug up waste ground and inspected sewers in Praia da Luz in June in a grim search for her body. One of the suspects questioned in July was a former Ocean Club worker and another a 51-year-old schizophrenic drug addict. They both denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance. Portuguese police believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer living in Portugal. However they have still not formally ruled out the involvement of junkie burglar Euclides Monteiro, whose widow they questioned last year, despite the fact DNA tests have put him in the clear. Last month it emerged the cost of the British police search for Madeleine will soon top £10million  double the original amount estimated by the Home Office when the force was called in by David Cameron in 2011. The Home Office has defending the rising cost of the probe, insisting: 'The Government believes it is right that it does all it can to support the search for Madeleine McCann.'","The Britons are among seven people due to be questioned as 'arguidos'

"James Cunneely, 37, had an affair with his 15-year-old student but says he was abused by his teacher . A French teacher who had a sexual relationship with his 15-year-old student has claimed he also had an all-consuming two year affair with his female teacher when he was just 15. James Cunneely, 37, a former teacher at Kittatinny Regional High School in New Jersey, was sentenced to three years in state prison for having sexual relations with a 15-year-old female student. Cunneely, a father-of-three, was arrested in 2007 after a five-month relationship with the girl. He admitted having 15 to 20 sexual relations with the girl - at motels, in his car, and even when her mother was at her home. The former Kittatinny Teacher of the Year, said the pair became close after she got upset in his classroom following a problem with her father. And he has now told NJ.com, that when he was 15 his own French teacher allegedly began to abuse him. Cunneely said he is speaking out because she has never been held to account for her alleged actions and because she has continued to work with children. 'I took responsibility for what I did,' he said. 'I betrayed many people. I hurt many people. The same is true for her. I want her to be held responsible.' Carol D'Annunzio, a 42-year-old woman, had consoled him after the death of his best friend's mother in 1991 and gave him her phone number, according to Cunneely. Explain the start of their alleged relationship he said: 'I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel special in a way.' 'I'm a 15-year-old boy, and she's taking this interest in my life. How could I not make that phone call?' He said the talks, which lasted hours, were innocent until D'Annunzio, now 62, told him she loved him, which he felt compelled to say back to her. Later that week Cunneely claimed he was walking with D'Annunzio at Lenape Valley when she turned, stopped him and kissed him for the first time. He says she invited him to her apartment in Jefferson, saying she had a Christmas present - it was then their relationship turned sexual and over the next two years, they would have sex hundreds of times, including at school. He said during a student exchange program in Paris he slept in the same bed as D'Annunzio after she told her friend who they stayed with that he was her nephew - all the other students stayed with host families. He says his parents were unaware and even thought D'Annunzio was a stable presence in his life. When he was released, Cunneely (pictured) went to confront D'Annunzio - she is now a substitute teacher in Florida where she lives with her husband . But he says the affair and the secrets began to take a toll and he lost interest in life and sometimes didn't even wash. He says he tried to break up with D'Annunzio, but she became hysterical and threatened to tell his parents. They finally split up and he remained in her class during which time she treated him like all the other students. Cunneely went on to marry his wife and has two daughters, who are 16 and 12 and a 14-year-old son, but says he was unhappy. 'Everyone thought, ""Hey, Jim Cunneely. He's a nice guy, well-adjusted, wife and kids and teacher of the year and a good coach,'' he said. 'But inside was this incredible gut-wrenching turmoil. When I was 15, I felt smothered because I was living for someone else, and when I was 30, I felt smothered because I was living out someone else's life.' He then became involved with his victim and even attended therapy sessions with her. When his victim told her mother he did panic, but the situation was resolved when he told her he loved her daughter and that he would not hurt her. He insists he did not ask his victim to keep their affair a secret as that is what he struggled with as a teenager during his alleged ordeal  - he says it was his determination to not kept their relationship a secret that led the girl to confide in a friend, who told a teacher, who contacted authorities. The mother declined to comment, reports NJ.com. Cunneely was arrested and sent to jail despite a letter written by the girl as well as plea that she made in a victim impact statement asking that he not be incarcerated. The victim suffered bullying at school and was forced to move away. Cunneely's family suffered - without his income or health benefits, his wife and children lost their home to foreclosure - he has now split up with his wife. When he was released, Cunneely went to confront D'Annunzio - she is now a substitute teacher in Florida where she lives with her husband. He said he demanded an explanation and an apology, but received neither - that was when he told her was writing a book about their affair and its impact on his life. After inquiries by NJ Advance Media, the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office has opened a criminal investigation into D'Annunzio, authorities confirmed and have been interviewing potential witnesses. First Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller, who is overseeing the probe, said the statute of limitations would not bar the prosecution of D'Annunzio if investigators find corroborating evidence. When the newspaper contacted D'Annunzio she did not respond.","Jim Cunneely, 37, is a former teacher in Sussex County, New Jersey .

"A war veteran faces a £70 fine if he leaves his car outside his home after he persuaded council officials to turn the space into a disabled bay, only to have his blue badge taken away months later. Don Jones, 89, asked Swansea Council to mark up the parking space outside his front door as a designated disabled spot so that he could park there after undergoing a number of knee operations and struggling with arthritis. But the decorated war veteran has since been reassessed and no longer fits the council criteria to classify him as disabled. This means he no longer has a blue badge and cannot park in the space outside his house without being fined £70. Don Jones, 89, has been told he is no longer frail enough to park in a bay the council designated as disabled outside his home in Swansea. He had his blue badge taken away meaning he will be fined £70 for parking there . The pensioner, who was awarded the Atlantic Star, said: 'I wont be able to park outside my own home without getting a ticket.' Mr Jones experienced the Blitz during World War Two devastate his home town of Swansea in south Wales and joined the Royal Navy. He served for two-and-a-half years on board the HMS Barclay Castle and was rewarded for his bravery on the Atlantic convoys. Mr Jones has had a blue badge for the last eight years. He asked Swansea Council to turn the parking space outside his house into a disabled pay to stop other drivers leaving their cars there. But just months later he was told he had to reapply for his pass and needed to go for an interview with council chiefs. Mr Jones - who had to use a wheelchair to attend the interview - was told he no longer meets the criteria for a blue badge. Mr Jones, a decorated war veteran, was reassessed months after he persuaded the council to mark the bay . Council chiefs told him he was not disabled enough for the pass. He only scored 13 on their rating system and the cut off point is 15. He added: 'I'm very annoyed. To think that it has come to this after all I went through in the war. 'They go through the trouble of giving me a disabled parking place outside my home and then in a matter of months they take my badge away.' Mr Jones now struggles with severe arthritis and ill health. His granddaughter Amy Taylor has written to the council to complain. She said: 'My grandfather has severe arthritis in his feet, a colostomy, a urostomy and has had two knee replacements over the last year and he turns 90 this coming January. The pensioner was awarded the Atlantic Star after serving in the Navy during World War Two . 'When he came in for his interview with my mother and sister, he had to pushed there in a wheelchair as the distance from the car to your offices was too great.' She added: 'He is not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes and genuinely has disabilities that cannot be denied. 'To say that he is worried about this is an absolute understatement. 'He is a Navy veteran who does everything in his life by the book and this may seem like a small issue but this is his life and the thought of not being mobile any more is utterly devastating to him.' A spokesman for the council said that they are reviewing Mr Jones's application. He said: 'Mr Jones' original application was turned down based on the information he provided. 'However, we have since been provided with additional information from his granddaughter which wasn't included in his application. 'Because of this we are visiting Mr Jones at his home to go through his application and hopefully resolve the matter.'","Decorated war veteran has had blue badge parking permit for last 8 years .

"A young ballerina has given an insight into her punishing daily routine, after creating a video diary. Australian performer Benedicte Bemet is a member of the Australian Ballet Company. The 20-year-old dancer is a coryphée - ranking above a member of the corps de ballet and below a soloist. The video begins showing Benedicte travelling to rehearsals at 9am. An hour later she begins a Pilates session, which she explains helps her get in the right frame of mind for an evening’s performance. At 12.30pm she begins a one-to-one training session with one of the Austalian Ballet’s teachers. Two hours later she is given a massage session before taking lunch at 3.30pm. During her afternoon break, Benedicte explains that she does sewing in order to help herself relax before she goes on stage at 8pm. At 6.30pm, Benedict begins to get ready for the evening show, putting on make-up and changing into her costume. Benedicte is shown travelling to rehearsal at 9am at the Australian Ballet Company . At 7.55pm she is ready to go on stage for her 90-minute performance. Shortly after, she heads backstage for an ice bath to help her body recover from the rigours of the performance before she finally heads home around 10pm. Benedicte was born in Mackay in 1994, and started ballet at the age of three. She grew up on the Gold Coast and began her training at the Ransley's Ballet Centre. When she was ten her family relocated to Hong Kong, where she continued her ballet training at the Jean M. Wong School of Ballet. Benedicte begins her day with a Pilates session, which she explains helps her get in the right frame of mind for an evening’s performance . She left her family in Hong Kong to move to Melbourne a and was accepted into the Australian Ballet School when she was 14. A year later she was given an award for excellence and was sent to New York and Canada to represent the school in the exchange program. Benedicte toured with The Dancer's Company in both 2010 and 2011, and was offered a contract with the company two years ago. 'It was really difficult to leave my family but it’s all paid off now,' she says. 'My parents have never been anything but completely supportive my entire life. I owe everything to them.' At 12.30pm she begins a one-to-one training session with one of the Austalian Ballet’s teachers . Benedicte heads backstage for an ice bath to help her body recover from the rigours of an stage performance . Benedicte finally finishes her performance at 9.30pm before taking off her make-up and heading home . After working her way through the ranks of The Australian Ballet Company, she was later promoted to coryphée and was awarded the People’s Choice Award in the 2013 Telstra Ballet Dancer Awards. Since joining the Australian Ballet Company at the age of 14, Benedict says that she has worn out 123 pairs of point shoes and the 20-year-old admits the hours can be hard. She said: ‘You put your body through a lot of stress but it’s worth it, I love dancing and there are so many parts I’d love to dance one day. I want to be Juliet in Romeo and Juliet and Odette in Swan Lake. Like anything you are passionate about, it can make you so happy and of course there are days when it can make you quite upset if you are disappointed in yourself. ‘But you put your point shoes on and you get up and what’s most important is still coming.’","Australian dancer Benedicte Bemet performs with Australian Ballet Company .

"A city worker who bit off a broker's nose after a row about a spilt drink has been jailed for almost two years. Johnathan Ball, 26, sank his teeth into Christopher Woolcott’s face at the Babble City cocktail bar in the City of London, the Old Bailey heard. He bit through cartilage and flesh, tearing off the front part of Mr Woolcott's nose and leaving him bleeding and needing skin grafts to repair the damage. The attack has been described as one of 'real savagery.' Johnathan Ball, 26, has been jailed for almost two years after he bit off part of a man's nose after rowing about a spilt drink in a London cocktail bar. The Old Bailey heard he had previously bitten two police officers as well . The incident took place at Babble City cocktail bar in London last February when both men were with friends . CCTV footage recorded on February 24 last year showed both Ball and Mr Woolcott were enjoying themselves with their own group of friends on the dance floor of the city club. But a scuffle broke out after a drink was spilt and Ball grabbed hold of his victim’s head, got him on the floor and sank his teeth into the front part of his nose. Judge Charles Wide QC said the crime was ‘vicious and serious’ and told Ball: ‘You must have had part of his nose in your mouth after you bit him.’ Ball was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm after a retrial. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and an additional four weeks in jail after an earlier suspended sentence was activated. In August 2006, Ball was convicted of assaulting two police officers, after biting both of them. He also has a conviction for battery on another officer and numerous other drug-related offences, the court heard. Mark Gadsden said the fight appeared to start after a drink was spilt and the situation then 'deteriorated rapidly.' He described the incident as an act of 'real savagery.' Johnathan Ball (left) was jailed by Judge Charles Wide (right) who said the crime was vicious and serious . The pair had to be pulled apart by security guards. Ajay Malik, a security guard, was one of the workers who separated the men. ‘I picked the other guy up and supported him and saw he was bleeding from the face,’ he said. ‘He was bleeding quite badly from the nose. ‘I took him downstairs for medical assistance.’ Mr Malik said when he went back upstairs to look for Ball he found him ‘hiding’ in a booth with his friends. ‘I found the guy, he was sweating and had marks on his face so I felt it was the right man,’ he added. ‘I asked him quite politely to come out because I wanted to speak to him but he wouldn’t. ‘I asked him once or twice but he wouldn’t come out.' Mr Malik said Ball also asked him if the police were coming. Ball initially told police that the attack was carried out by somebody else but later accepted he was responsible for the injury and claims he acted in self defence. He told the court he bit off the man’s nose to defend himself when the trader tried to gouge his eye out. ‘I was like a sheep surrounded by wolves,’ sobbed Ball, who is 6ft 2 and weighs over 17 stone.","Johnathan Ball, 26, and Christopher Woolcott started fighting in a London cocktail bar after getting into a row over a drink that had been spilt .

"Physicists have spent nearly 80 years searching - and failing - to find evidence that dark matter is made of tiny exotic particles. Now scientists in Ohio are suggesting that the mysterious fabric of the universe consists of something far more ordinary. They argue that dark matter could be made up of objects with a mass anywhere from a tennis ball to a dwarf planet, with a density equal to that of a neutron star. Scientists in Ohio are suggesting that the mysterious fabric of the universe consists of ordinary particles that fit with the Standard Model of physics. Pictured is a computer simulation of dark matter density in the universe . Dark matter, the substance crucial to explaining how the universe is expanding, has only ever been 'seen' through the gravitational effects it has on planets. Physicists believe that it makes up 27 per cent of the universe and normal matter makes up around five per cent. The prevailing theory is that dark matter is made up of a hypothetical substance known as a weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). But scientists at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland say dark matter may be made of 'macros' - or macroscopic objects. The existence of dark matter has been theorised owing to its observed gravitational effect on stars and galaxies (Andromeda shown) Physics professor Glenn Starkman and David Jacobs suggest the scientific community currently has blinkers on as existing theories limit where to look. As well as being much larger, macros they suggest, could be made out of particles in the Standard Model of particle physics instead of requiring new type of physics to explain their existence. The Standard Model explains how the basic building blocks of matter interact, governed by four fundamental forces; the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational force. 'We've been looking for Wimps for a long time and haven't seen them,' Professor Starkman said. 'We expected to make Wimps in the Large Hadron Collider, and we haven't.' The prevailing theory is that dark matter is made up of a hypothetical substance known as a weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). Scientists suggests these particles, like many others could come in matter and antimatter versions. If they approached each other closely  they would destroy each other, sending out a burst of gamma rays that could be detected from Earth. These gamma rays have been spotted by the Fermi telescope, but scientists have so far failed to provide direct evidence that these wimps do in fact exist. Wimps remain possible candidates for dark matter, but there's reason to search elsewhere, the theorists argue. 'The community had kind of turned away from the idea that dark matter could be made of normal-ish stuff in the late '80s,' Professor Starkman said. 'We ask, was that completely correct and how do we know dark matter isn't more ordinary stuff- stuff that could be made from quarks and electrons?' After eliminating most ordinary matter, including failed Jupiters, white dwarfs, neutron stars, stellar black holes and neutrinos with a lot of mass as possible candidates, physicists turned their focus on the exotics. Matter that was somewhere in between ordinary and exotic - relatives of neutron stars or large nuclei - was left on the table, Professor Starkman said. 'We say relatives because they probably have a considerable admixture of strange quarks, which are made in accelerators and ordinarily have extremely short lives,' he said. Pictured is a simulation of how scientists believe galaxies and dark matter formed in the early universe. The prevailing theory is that dark matter is made up of a hypothetical substance known as a weakly interacting massive particles (wimps) Most of the matter we see around us is made from protons and neutrons, which are composed of quarks. Although strange quarks are highly unstable, Professor Starkman points out that neutrons are also highly unstable. But in helium, bound with stable protons, neutrons remain stable. According to the latest theory, dark matter particles cannot be smaller than 55 grams or they would have been detected in Skylab scans. It can also not be above a million billion billion grams as they would bend starlight, something not detected again. Within the allowed range, the scientists say the reasons they have not been seen so far is because if heavy they would hit the Earth once in a billion years only and if small, they do not leave a record. 'That opens the possibility that stable strange nuclear matter was made in the early universe and dark matter is nothing more than chunks of strange nuclear matter or other bound states of quarks, or of baryons, which are themselves made of quarks,' he said. The scientists calculated macros may be assembled from ordinary and strange quarks or baryons before they decay. This would happen at a temperature above 3.5 trillion degrees Celsius as in the centre of a massive supernova, they say. According to their theory, dark matter particles cannot be smaller than 55 grams or they would have been detected in Skylab scans. It can also not be above a million billion billion grams as they would bend starlight, something not detected again.

"The 'kill mission' against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani is supposedly killed in a drone attack. In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson is very much alive, pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans. I wonder if al-Baghdadi was doing the same. It would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus, he's risen from beyond the grave before. Even now, the Pentagon is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive 'caliph'. Scroll down for videos . Parallels? The 'kill mission' against Islamic State boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (left) carries chilling echoes of TV show Homeland where the chief terror suspect Haissam Haqqani (right)  is supposedly killed in a drone attack . A scene from Channel 4 series Homeland after Haqqani was targeted by missile strikes on a farmhouse . This afternoon, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior announced: 'The leader of the ISIS group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdad has been transported to Syria after he was injured in an air strike that resulted in 40 casualties among ISIS militants. 'The air strike targeted a meeting held between the ISIS leader and his key aides in an area near al-Kanadi school in al-Sa'ada district.' 'The leader of the group, known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been injured while his key aide Abu Huzayefa al-Adnani was reportedly killed. Senior leaders and experts in explosive devices were also killed in the attack including Omar al-Absi and Ahmed Salem al-Salmani, known as Abu Omar, the leader of Ashbal al-Jannah within the ISIS group.' But will his injuries make any difference to the terror group? Normally so effusive on social media, ISIS are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend, though it has started arresting former members of the Iraqi army lest they are providing the US with actionable intelligence. It was telling too, that reports of his demise originally leaked out apparently from Isis sources. ISIS is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed. In the Channel 4 series, the Taliban mastermind battling CIA station chief Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is very much alive, pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the Americans . Baghdadi has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity, especially since his Al Qaeda mentor, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. bombing raid in 2006. Except for his brief appearance in Mosul in July to proclaim himself Caliph (an office that fuses political and religious leadership), Baghdadi has kept a low profile, so that the fate of ISIS does not appear to hinge on his personal survival. It also offers the perfect cover should Baghdadi wish to disappear for a while, Homeland-style. For Baghdadi has been careful to organize ISIS in such a way that power is highly decentralised, with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations. ISIS has been careful to include many Sunni tribal figures in administration, precisely to pre-empt any U.S. attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them, a strategy the Americans pursued against Al Qaeda in Iraq (ISIS's forerunner) in 2007-08 with some success. Targeted: Baghdadi was reportedly wounded on Friday night when American warplanes hit a ten-car ISIS convoy like this one southwest of Mosul, which functions as ISIS's capital in northern Iraq (file picture) ISIS's military command includes at least two Sunni Muslim Iraqi army generals on the run since the Saddam era, who clearly have considerable tactical ability. ISIS has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres. They also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing, and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their Iraqi or Kurdish opponents. So far, the U.S. response has been to remove the unpopular Shia prime minister of Iraq, to reduce the alienation of the country's Sunni and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the Iraqi national army, which, poorly led, effectively fled from this ferocious opponent. The only effective obstacles to ISIS taking over the country have been Shia militias in Baghdad and further south, and the Kurdish peshmerga in the north. Although the U.S. has added a further 1,500 military advisers, bringing their total strength to over 3000, they have to be careful since the same Shia militias are restive about a renewed U.S. 'occupation' of Iraq. American airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm. Taken out: According to Iraqi sources, parallel attacks on Qaim in Anbar province (above) killed one of the terror group's top strategists in a predominantly Sunni region where ISIS has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world's attention was distracted by its relentless siege of Kobane in northern Syria . So far there have been an average of five strikes a day, compared with 50 in Libya in 2011, 85 in Afghanistan, and 800 a day in Iraq itself during the 2003 US-led invasion. So far, only 800 of the 3, 200 sorties over Iraq and Syria have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles. Until these raids at the weekend, there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground, while Pentagon lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties. The long distance planes have to fly from bases in Qatar or the UAE, or from carriers in the Persian Gulf, also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity. So while it would be a significant blow to ISIS to lose its self-styled Caliph, he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities. Prisoner: al-Baghdadi, shown before his rise to power, was held as a prisoner by the U.S. during the occupation of Iraq . Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi is the relatively discreet leader of the Islamic State extremist group. He used to play for his mosque's soccer team and has a PhD in Islamic history. But after spending four years in a US camp during the Iraq occupation, he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world. The government placed a $10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous. This warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of US nationals James Foley and Steven Sotloff as well as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning. He maintained a low profile for months as ISIS, the group's original name, rose to global infamy and Al Qaeda denounced them as 'too extreme'. But he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech, filmed and posted on YouTube, in the first week of July this year. Born Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri al-Samarri in 1971 near Samarra, Iraq, he came from a Sufi family - a tolerant form of Islam. In the 1990s, he completed a PhD in Baghdad and played soccer with friends. But he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to Anbar province where he joined Sunni groups protesting the US occupation. American forces detained Baghdadi at Camp Bucca in 2005 shortly after the Iraq invasion. He was released when the camp closed in 2009. He was thought to be 'bad but not the worst' sources told The Daily Beast. But he then joined the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria, and rose up the ranks rapidly. After allegedly killing the leader, Abu Omar Baghdadi, he took hold of the terror group.","Islamic State chief believed to have been hit in U.S. strike on convoy in Iraq .

"A terrorist attack on an all-boys school in northen Nigeria killed 48 students and teachers and injured 79 after a suicide bomber detonated during morning assembly. The perpetrator was dressed in a school uniform, and entered the schoolyard in Potiskum, Yobe state, on Monday morning before carrying out the attack among the students. Local police believe Boko Haram is responsible for the attack on the secondary school, which follows a 'western curriculum'. Bomb: At least 48 teenagers died, and 79 were injured, after a suicide bomber dressed in school uniform detonated during morning assembly at a secondary school in Yobe state in northern Nigeria . The massacre came just a day after the release of a new Boko Haram video in which the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, again rejected Nigerian government claims of a ceasefire and peace talks. Students at the Government Comprehensive Senior Science Secondary School in Potiskum were waiting to hear the principal's daily address when the explosion happened, just before 8am. 'There was an explosion detonated by a suicide bomber,' national police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said, adding that Boko Haram was believed responsible. 'So far, the number of the dead is 48, while 79 are injured. I counted the bodies, mostly students and a few teachers,' a . nurse at Potiskum General Hospital said. 'A teacher who survived the blast with minor injury said the . bomber dressed like a student and was also on the assembly . ground with the students,' she said, asking to remain anonymous. Survivors: Students from the Government Comprehensive Senior Science Secondary School are being treated at the General hospital in Potiskum . Aftermath: A teacher from the school who survived the suicide attack said the death toll is likely to rise . Adamu Alkassim said the scene was a mass of abandoned footwear, blood and flesh, as the victims were taken to the Potiskum General Hospital, just 330ft away. Mariam Ibrahim, a teacher at the Government Comprehensive Senior Science Secondary School said the bomb went . off as she was arriving and students were at morning assembly. Potiskum resident Aliyu Abubakar said he heard the explosion . when he was dropping off his two sons at a nearby Islamic . college. 'One of my sons fell down, I came out dragged him in . and we drove off back home,' he said. A second teacher, asking to remain anonymous, said, 'There . are some (others) that are critically injured and I am sure the . death toll will rise.' One rescue worker involved in evacuating the students from the school said the wounded had 'various degrees of injuries'. The victims are thought to be in their teens. Boko Haram, which wants to create a hardline Islamic state in northern Nigeria, has previously carried out deadly attacks on schools teaching a so-called Western curriculum since 2009. In February, gunmen killed at least 40 students after throwing explosives into the dormitory of a government boarding school in Buni Yadi, also in Yobe state. In July last year 42 students were killed when Boko Haram stormed dormitories in a gun and bomb attack on a government boarding school in the village of Mamudo, near Potiskum. The massacre came just a day after the release of a new Boko Haram video in which the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, pictured, again rejected Nigerian government claims of a ceasefire and peace talks . The blast took place at Government Comprehensive Senior Science Secondary School in Potiskum, Yobe . Boko Haram's most high-profile attack on a school came in April, when fighters kidnapped 276 girls from the town of Chibok in Borno state, also in northeast Nigeria. More than six months later, 219 of the girls are still being held. Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state, has been repeatedly targeted by deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram. Last Monday, at least 15 people were killed in a suicide bombing on a Shia religious ceremony in the city. On Wednesday, 16 men arrested by the military on suspicion of links to Boko Haram were found dead with bullet wounds just hours later. Yobe is one of three northeastern states that has been under a state of emergency since May last year to try to quell the bloody insurgency. But violence has continued unabated and Boko Haram has seized at least two dozen towns and villages in recent months, raising doubts about the government's ability to control the region.","Suicide bomb at all-boys school in northern Nigeria kills 48 .

"The Vintage Sports-Car Club love their vehicles so much they couldn't bear to keep their old beauties cooped up in a garage. And far from taking their stunning pre-World War Two gems out for a gentle chug-along, they test them to the limits on the gravel of one of Britain's steepest roads. One hundred vintage vehicle enthusiasts gather each November for their Lakeland Trial in the Lakes District to test their motors on the 2,126ft Fleetwith Pike, with the latest event taking place on November 8. An 1928 Austin 7 Chummy (left) gets ready to set off on the gravel slope of 2,126ft Fleetwith Pike . This 1930 Austin 7 Gordon England Cup struggles up the top section during the Lakeland Trial . One of seven annual trials - untimed climbing contests - for the club, the pinnacle of this event is the stage in which they take on the ‘Drumhouse’ section at Honister Slate Mine, as seen in this video with footage from 2011 and 2013. Austin 7s are the most common entrants in the trial, considered relatively cheap for the category and easier to maintain than more complex models. Other makes still famous today, some more than others, include Riley, Bentley, Frazer Nash, Ford, Vauxhall, Bugatti and MG . This video features a fantastic red 1921 Fiat 501S Biposto, a 1924 Vauxhall 30-98 OE Velox, a 1933 Frazer Nash Colmore and a 1925 Bentley 3/4½ Litre. The Austin 7 is the most popular car for the trials, held around Britain by the Vintage Sports-Car Club . While there are typically a dozen sections in a trial, this 'Drumhouse' section is easily to most anticipated . Each car has at least one passenger, who is known as a bouncer - they literally bounce up and down in the car to assist with the climb. A successful ascent is considered a mighty achievement for some of the less agile machines. The Lakeland Trial has taken place every year since 1968 with cars ranging from 1918 to 1939 models (official known as vintage) up to the Post Vintage Thoroughbred category for cars from 1931 to 1941. The oldest vehicle in recent years was a 1903. From Bentley to Rolls Royce, Aston Martin to Bugatti, the classic cars trundled across rocky passes against a backdrop of spectacular scenery in the Lake District. The club's website describes the quirky event as the 'ultimate test of our Pre-war machinery'.","The Vintage Sports-Car Club have held the Lakeland Trial since 1968 .

"Francois Hollande's approval rating has fallen below 20 per cent for the first time since he was elected in 2012, a new poll has revealed. The French President's rating has dropped three points to just 19 per cent - a new low in his popularity, according to the TNS Sofres opinion poll for Le Figaro Magazine. Meanwhile, a staggering 78 per cent of French voters have said they do not trust him.

Meanwhile, a staggering 78 per cent of voters have said they do not trust the French President . Love life: It comes a month after the Socialist, 59, was revealed to be having an affair with actress Julie Gayet (right) - a revelation that caused his former partner and first lady, Valerie Trierweiler (left), to end up in hospital . The figures reflect Hollande's global reputation as a 'joke' - with many voters feeling he is more interested in his high-profile love life than solving his country's economic problems. Last month, the 59-year-old Socialist was revealed to be having an affair with actress Julie Gayet - who is almost 20 years his junior - after pictures emerged of the couple leaving a Paris love nest by moped. The revelation made headlines around the world - while Hollande's former partner and first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, ended up in hospital for eight days. Meanwhile, France's unemployment rate has soared to 11.1 per cent - the highest this century, along with a 14 per cent poverty rate. Meeting: During a visit to Britain last week, Hollande refused to answer a question about his reputation as a 'joke'.

His immediate predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, boasted a 37 per cent approval rating at this time, while Jacques Chirac had a 35 per cent rating. More approval: Hollande's immediate predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy (left) had a 37 per cent approval rating when he was 21 months into his period in office, while Jacques Chirac (right) had a 35 per cent rating . Hollande's embarrassing rating comes as he prepares for his first state visit to the USA next week. The unmarried politician is set to travel to America as a 'bachelor president' - despite his affair with Ms Gayet continuing. He has now formally split up with Ms Trierweiler, meaning she is no longer the first lady of France. Aides considered that Ms Gayet's presence at the White House would just further the president's unpopularity.

"A Boston Marathon bombing survivor who has been battling to save her leg for more than 18 months had it amputated on Monday. Rebekah DiMartino, 27, threw a 'last supper' celebration for her left leg on Sunday before the limb was removed below the knee at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital near Houston, Texas. 'The doctor just came out and said everything went well with surgery,' her husband Pete wrote on Facebook on Monday afternoon. 'Rebekah did splendidly. She will be in hospital a couple days.' Before the surgery, Rebekah had remained upbeat. Scroll down for video . Still smiling: Rebekah DiMartino, pictured with her husband Pete (right) and other family members before her surgery on Monday, has had her left leg amputated after more than 18 months of trying to save it . 'The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,' DiMartino told NBC before the operation. 'If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here.' DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring  270. All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. She has since undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection. Although she has been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right . Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page on Sunday . 'There is so much I could say about what I am feeling at this exact moment,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'Am I scared? Yes. Am I sad that all our efforts for the last 18 months have failed? Absolutely. But beyond the fear and sadness there is something that surpasses it all....relief. 'I am relieved to know that this is a step forward, when I have been in limbo for so long. I am relieved that my family will no longer have to live in anticipation and worry, of what the future will hold for me. 'I am relieved that I will FINALLY be able to start the process of a FULL recovery. And I am even more relieved that I will finally just get to be Rebekah again.' She continued: 'Monday is the day that my new life begins. And I am SO excited to see what it holds.' Staying strong: The couple are pictured together before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in May. She has spent much time in a wheelchair or on bedrest . Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, is excited to have a 'part robot mom' She said her seven-year-old son has long been upset about her potentially losing her leg, but last week, after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed. 'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted ""that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!""' she wrote on her Facebook page. Her doctors say they are hopeful that she could be taking her first steps in three months. 'I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,' Dr. Bill McGarvey said. 'If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful.' Rebekah is now hoping to compete in next year's Boston Marathon and to complete a triathlon, she told NBC. By her side: Rebekah is pictured with Pete, whom she married in April this year - a year after the bombings . 'I've never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons,' she said. 'I still have a lot of living left to do.' She is also now starting to do motivational speaking and has moved to Richmond, Texas with her son and new husband. She has been sharing updates on her support page, Rebekah Gregory's New Day New Hope. 'Thank you to everyone who has continued to support me on this crazy journey,' she wrote on Facebook. 'Monday and every day I will continue to be...BOSTON STRONG.'","Rebekah DiMartino, a married mother, has undergone 17 operations since the April 2013 blast and continues to be in excruciating pain .

"Leaning over police crime scene tape, I’m peering into what was once a kennel. There is no roof, and the floor is covered with blackened material. The acrid smell is horrendous. Among the rubble are dog collars, a tennis ball and several chew toys. When the Manchester Dogs’ Home was set on fire on September 11, killing 60 dogs in the adoption unit, my feeling was that there really is no hope for mankind. On my visit to what is left of the home I meet Sandy, a staffie who was one of only two dogs pulled alive from the burned-down wing. She had come to the home five months before as a stray. Scroll down for video . Rescued: Liz with staffie Sandy, one of only two dogs from a unit within the Manchester Dogs Home to have survived the blaze . Though only about five or six years old, she has obviously already had several litters, perhaps bred for dog-fighting. She was in the adoption unit as she was deemed ready to be rehomed. Once pulled from the fire, Sandy was rushed to the home’s sister site in Cheshire and placed in intensive care. She remains on medication for the effects of smoke inhalation and has nightmares. Anna Stansfield, manager of the site, says: ‘I hear her crying and groaning in her sleep, and she paddles with her paws. She has been very depressed.’ The other survivor, two-year-old Badger, has already been rehomed. A lovely dark lurcher with white paws, he was adopted by a local family, the Corfields, who got a bit carried away and took two other dogs home too. Badger’s only legacy from the fire is a cough and an abscess, and a propensity to sleep a lot. Fourteen-year-old Maddie Corfield took Badger to school to help raise awareness for the home, and to show classmates how a rescue dog can be more rewarding than purchasing a pedigree. Donations from the public have now reached £1.4 million, which means the damaged wing can be demolished this week, and a bigger, better kennel built to rescue many more dogs. But much more needs to be done in an area where hundreds of dogs wander the streets, and the local rescue centres are full to brimming. Stepping into the fray are a task force of eight women who, in their own words ‘like to make things happen’. Destroyed: The adoption unit after the fire at the home. Donations from the public towards the home have now topped £1.4million . They are Michala Hulme, 32, a historian; Sue Wright, 46, a barrister and wife of former England footballer Mark Wright; Victoria Atkin, 32, a manager at Balfour Beatty; businesswoman Diana Bowden, 41; Lesley Grimes, 50, a company director; Louise Lessells, 58 a charity executive; Helen Pritchard, 35, a social media agency owner; and Alice Gibson, a 27-year-old PR professional. Michala tells me: ‘I rescued a German pointer from the home eight years ago, and sadly he died recently. I went back to the home to sponsor a kennel five days before the fire. I’d never met the other women before, but we got together in the days after the fire.’ We are at historic Tatton Park in Cheshire, where the task force is orchestrating a calendar shoot with rescue dogs past and present. The star of the show, as Miss January, is undoubtedly Sandy, but owners who have had many years of love and companionship from former Manchester Dogs’ Home inmates have been keen to step up to the mark and allow their dogs to take part. They include comedian John Bishop, who has a rescued English bull terrier, Billy, . John says: ‘Billy came to us in October 2007 and is the third dog we have had from the dogs’ home. I would never go to a breeder, there are so many lovely dogs looking for homes.’ It’s hoped the calendar, which we preview here, will raise thousands more to help with the rebuild. Calendar photographer Colin Boulter is donating his time. He says: ‘I grew up in a council house round the back of the dogs’ home, and always went to sleep to the sound of barking. ‘The local area, Harpurhey, gets a negative press, but the fact locals turned up, spontaneously, to help when the fire broke out says it all.’ Meeting the task force women and kennel workers has gone a long way towards restoring my faith in human nature, especially when the home’s manager Steve Mapley tells me: ‘People are still bringing along dog beds they whipped from under their own pets. Some still feel warm!’ The calendar is available from November 17 at dogshome.net, £7.99. The cutest pin-ups ever? The calendar of hope that rose out of the smoke . THIS is Ralph, the calendar cover star. He was rescued from a block near the adoption wing and adopted the weekend after the fire. Here we showcase his calendar co-stars… . SANDY: Rescued from the blazing block. Recovering but needs a home . DOBBY: Two-year-old adopted as a puppy by local family. Has a sock fetish . MOLLY: Adopted seven years ago, now a sniffer dog for the prison service . BUDDY: Was rehomed three times, before settling with current companion . BRUNO: Adopted in July. Puts himself to bed every night at 9pm . SAFFIE: Ten-year-old rehomed in 2010. Missing one leg, and snores . BALOO: Left tied to a gate two days after the fire. Now rehomed .

"Many of us use Facebook to plan parties and invite guests these days and most us of click to say we're attending without giving it much thought. But what if complete strangers, who had also clicked to attend the same event, could then see your profile and personal information without you having a clue? Winkli is a new app, hoping to launch in July, which essentially allows people to obtain information about someone before meeting them. The Winkli website allows you to sign up to be notified when the app- which will allow you to check out people attending the same events as you beforehand-launches . Described as ‘your clever . companion for future plans’ Winkli will allow you to ‘check out girls . and guys’ who have replied as 'attending' to any event invitation on . Facebook which you plan to go to as well, Buzzfeed reports. Essentially a dating app, one of the key pieces of information Winkli sends you about guests at any upcoming events is their relationship status, alongside mutual friends, interests and anything left ‘public’ on that person’s Facebook profile. Users will be able to filter results to show them, for example, anyone who is also attending Glastonbury who is single, in their 30s and likes the same films and TV programmes. The idea is that you can scout out potential romantic targets before ever meeting them, and even prepare conversations based on their likes or hobbies. While this might seem like a clever, time-saving device for the savvy single in the digital age, there are worries about privacy.

"Former newspaper editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson will face trial in September next year over alleged illegal payments to public officials, they were told today. Brooks, 44, ex-editor of The Sun and the now defunct News of the World, and David Cameron’s former spin doctor Coulson, another former News of the World editor, appeared at the Old Bailey. Appearing alongside them were The Sun’s former chief reporter John Kay, 69, ex News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 55, and Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan Barber, 39, also facing charges linked to Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden investigation. In court: Brooks, 44, ex-editor of The Sun and News of the World, and David Cameron’s former spin doctor . Coulson, appeared at the Old . Bailey today and will  face trial in September next year . Trial: Coulson will stand trial alongside former newspaper editor Rebekah Brooks, pictured leaving the Old Bailey last year . The five defendants sat at the back of the court for the 10-minute hearing. The judge, Mr Justice Fulford, said they did not have to go into the dock. Operation Elveden was set up by the Met Police in the wake of the phone hacking scandal to investigate claims of unlawful payments by journalists to police officers and other public officials. During the brief hearing it was said that a plea and case management hearing is due to take place on March 8th at the Old Bailey. The court heard it has yet to be decided who will face trial on September 10th, but it could include defendants facing allegations of phone hacking and bribery of public officials. Brooks, Coulson, Goodman and Kay are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. These relate to payments allegedly made to gain confidential information about the royal family between 2002 to 2003 and January 2005 to June 2005. Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan Barber, who is alleged to have been paid £100,000 between 2004 and 2012, is charged with wilful misconduct.

Those charged with phone hacking are Brooks, Coulson and four former News of the World journalists - news editor Greg Miskiw, former head of news Ian Edmondson, ex-reporter James Weatherup and former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck. Coulson, who was NotW editor from 2003 to 2007, and Brooks, who edited the paper from 2000 to 2003 before moving to edit The Sun and then becoming chief executive officer of the two papers’ parent group News International, are accused along with the other journalists of conspiracy to unlawfully intercept communications. In a separate case Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, along with her husband, Charlie, plus five others are accused of perverting the course of justice. The charges relate to an alleged attempt to hide evidence from police investigating phone hacking claims, and illegal payments to public officials by the News of the World and The Sun. Mrs Brooks’s chauffeur Paul Edwards, former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, head of security at News International Mark Hanna, and security staff Daryl Jorsling and Lee Sandell also face the charges. The Met have arrested 52 people as part of Operation Elveden, including 21 journalists at The Sun. All five who appeared in court today are on unconditional bail.

"The Government's attempt to slash net migration has suffered a serious setback today after official figures revealed the first increase in more than a year because too few people left Britain. Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron want to reduce the difference between those leaving and entering the UK from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before 2015. But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed a net flow of 176,000 migrants came to the UK in the year to December 2012, up from 153,000 in the year to September 2012, ending five consecutive quarters of decline. Picture of Britain: Net migration is up after more people entered Britain than left, official figures revealed . The ONS also revealed the number of children born in the UK to Romanian mothers has reached a record high as the country became one of the top 10 places of origin for foreign-born mothers for the first time. The figures come amid growing concern that Britain will face a new wave of eastern European immigration when access restrictions to the UK labour market for Romania and Bulgaria are lifted on January 1 next year. Chris Bryant MP, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said: 'The Prime Minister promised 'no ifs and no buts' to get net migration down to the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament. 'But these figures show an increase in immigration over the last three months, with more EU migrants arriving.' Allowed to visit: This graph shows the number of visas issued to people from the main world regions . The increase was driven by a drop in the number of migrants leaving Britain, which fell from 351,000 to 321,000, while the number of immigrants arriving in the country also fell from 566,000 to 497,000. There has been a 'statistically significant' decrease in the net migration of citizens from outside the European Union (EU) to 157,000 in the year ending December 2012 from 204,000 the previous year, the ONS said. Disappointment: A Tory pledge to reduce migration has faltered because figures show the over number has risen slightly as fewer British and EU citizens emigrated from the country . This was driven by a drop in immigration of non-EU citizens, particularly in the number of citizens of New Commonwealth countries, which includes African countries such as Botswana, Kenya and Malawi and Indian subcontinent countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The drop in New Commonwealth citizens immigrating to the UK - from 151,000 in the year ending December 2011 to 97,000 in the year ending December 2012 - is as a result of fewer people arriving to study in the UK from those countries. Sarah Mulley, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said: 'Today's statistics suggest the Government is running out of options to meet its target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015. 'Recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students, which has come at a high economic cost, but this trend now appears to be levelling off. 'The Government cannot further reduce student numbers without imposing even more significant costs on the education sector and the UK economy.' Dr Scott Blinder, acting director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: 'This is a mixed outcome for the Government in its plans to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands'. 'On the one hand net migration is still down on 2011, but the recent increase shows that this downward trend is not reliably consistent and still depends partly on emigration of British citizens.' A total of 58,000 immigrants arrived from countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania, down from 77,000 the previous year. The number of immigrants arriving for study in the UK is now similar to the estimated number of people arriving to the UK for work, the ONS said. Around 180,000 immigrants arrived in the UK for formal study in the year to December 2012, compared to 232,000 the previous year. Why they came: The majority of people coming into Britain were here for work or to study, statistics show . Elsewhere, the ONS revealed, in 2012, one in eight or 12.4% of the resident population of the UK were born abroad, compared to one in 11 or 8.9% in 2004. And in the same period, one in 13 or 7.8% of the resident population of the UK had non-British nationality, compared to one in 20 or 5% in 2004. India was the most common non-UK country of birth in 2012, with 729,000 residents of the UK born in India, while . Polish was the most common non-British nationality in 2012, with 700,000 residents of the UK having Polish nationality. And in another pack of data, the ONS revealed a quarter of births - 25.9% - in 2012 were to mothers born outside the UK which was a slight increase from 25.5% in 2011. Poland remains the most common country of birth for non-UK born mothers in 2012, while Romania moved into the top 10 most common countries of birth for non-UK born mothers in 2012, replacing China. Pakistan remains the most common country of birth for non-UK born fathers in 2012. Immigration minister Mark Harper said: 'Immigration from outside the EU is now at its lowest level for 14 years. 'At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for our world-class universities, and an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled workers. 'We are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands .","Net migration is the difference between numbers entering and leaving Britain .

"A young mother told she would die within 12 months from brain cancer has walked down the aisle after beating the disease with a controversial cure. Laura Hymas, 27, was told on Christmas Eve three years ago that she had an incurable brain tumour. But the mother-of-one refused to give in and with the help of partner Ben, raised £75,000 to fund gene therapy treatment in Texas which is not available in the UK. Success: Laura Hymas (with husband Ben and son Jacob) was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour three years ago. She underwent controversial treatment in Texas and has been told she is free of the disease . The treatment replaces faulty cancer genes with new ones but lacks clinical efficacy and has been condemned by conventional medicine, with critics arguing the therapy is unproven. It is offered at the Burzynski Clinic, which is best known for the known for the controversy surrounding its 'antineoplaston therapy', a chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons, devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski in the 1970s. However, a year after her treatment Miss Hymas says was told her tumour has completely gone and she is cancer-free. And last month she fulfilled her dream of marrying Ben with their four-year-old son Jacob as a page boy. Last month she fulfilled her dream of marrying Ben with their four-year-old son Jacob as a page boy. She said: 'It was the happiest day of my life and I continue to be thankful for every day' Miss Hymas, from Rochester, Kent, said: 'I feel so lucky to have been able to get married. 'It was the happiest day of my life and it was amazing to have everyone around me on the special day who have loved and guided me throughout my journey. 'These past three years have been an incredibly difficult journey for me and I continue to be thankful every day.' Mrs Hymas underwent treatment at the controversial Burzynski Clinic. Treatment is with chemotherapy using compounds it calls antineoplastons, devised by the clinic's founder Stanislaw Burzynski (pictured) Her husband Ben, 33, a property landlord, said: 'It was perfect. We never gave up the hope that it would happen, even though the odds were definitely against us according to the doctors here. 'Laura looked absolutely beautiful. It was a really nice day to draw a line in the sand behind all the bad things that have happened. 'We have started afresh with a real positive memory. It was a very emotional day. 'In some ways what happened to Laura was a gift. It has just made our lives richer. We just appreciate things a lot more.' Laura started to lose feeling in her right arm in 2010 and an MRI scan revealed she had a rare form of brain cancer called Glioblastoma Multiforme. She suffered multiple seizures every day and was unable to pick up her baby son as she became partially paralysed. Her plight attracted huge support after comedian Rufus Hound backed her campaign to fund treatment in the U.S. He posted a video to his 230,000 Twitter followers calling on people to donate just £2 and within 24 hours, the ‘Hope for Laura; website had raised over £10,000.

"A pair of gutsy acrobats have crossed Zimbabwe's awe-inspiring Victoria Falls on a tightrope. Lukas Irmler from Germany and Reinhard Kleindl from Austria completed the 328ft crossing on a slack line, after negotiating with officials for several months to get permission. They both made the crossing without falling off, ultimately not using the safety cords attached to the line.

'You need to have a clear visual view of the environment, you need to be focused on the anchor point to the very end you want to walk to and not get distracted by a lot of water crashing by the side, which is very hard mentally.' Mr Kleindl added: 'Optically it's very difficult because the spray comes from the sides and it's like waves, they try to drag you, so it's really difficult for the optics and obviously everything is very heavy because it's soaked with water.' While it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, it is classified as the largest, based on its width of 5,604ft and height of 354ft.

Footage of the astonishing feat ran on a 10-second delay on the Discovery Channel so producers could cut away if he fell to his death. He had neither a net nor a harness as he completed the challenge - and had said his only back-up plan was to attempt to kneel and cling to the wire with his feet. Brave: Wallenda successfully walked over the Chicago River between two skyscrapers - the rope had an incline of eight stories . Blinded: Wallenda had set up a speaker making 'ping' noises at his destination so he knew where he was aiming while blindfolded . He finished the first portion of the stunt in six minutes, 52 seconds, and made the second, blindfolded walk in just one minute, 17 seconds. The first wire was suspended more than 500ft above the Chicago River at a 19-degree incline. The wire was supposed to be suspended at 15 degrees, but a last minute change made for an even steeper challenge. He broke two Guinness world records in the process - for the highest inclined tightrope walk, and the highest blindfolded walk.","Lukas Irmler  and Reinhard Kleindl braved 328ft crossing on slack line .

"Losing 22-0 would normally be seen as a disaster – but when it is a non-League side facing Russia's Under-19 national side then it is important to take the positives. On an afternoon when Chelsea were beating Arsenal at Stamford Bridge and Manchester United returned to winning ways against Everton, Cheadle Town were trending higher on Twitter thanks to their thrashing. Cheadle, currently seventh in the North West Counties League first division, found themselves on the end of the heaviest defeat in the club’s history when they faced the Russia U19s. VIDEO Scroll down to watch one of Russia U19's 22 goals scored against Cheadle Town! Cheadle Town could do little to prevent Russia's Under-19 national side storming to an incredible 22-0 win . Cheadle Town have decided to make the most of the 22-0 defeat by celebrating their Twitter followers doubling . Twitter saw 8,800 retweets for the full-time score . It is not the first time Cheadle have faced high-profile opposition as they were on the end of a 5-0 score line against Dinamo Bucharest in pre-season. On Sunday, it took Russia's youngsters just four minutes to go 1-0 up. By half time it was 9-0 and Cheadle had no substitutes available. In between, though, they were rather excited when the home side edged forward as Cheadle wrote on Twitter: 'WE'VE GOT A CORNER!!' But the main positives to be taken from the defeat is that the club’s Twitter account saw its followers double. Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Cheadle Town’s website and social media manager Karl Florczak said: ‘We played Dinamo Bucharest in a pre-season summer friendly, and there was a contact who got back in touch with us and said the Russia U19 side were knocking around in the North West and would we like to play them. ‘If you are a football club at level 10 of the pyramid and someone approaches you and asks if you would like to have a go at the Russia U19s then you are not going to turn them down. ‘To the best of my knowledge it is the heaviest defeat in the club’s history. But in the club’s defence we have three squads, the 1st XI, the reserves and also the U21s. All three squads had matches this weekend and what we put out was a bit of a scratch squad. ‘To be fair, the Russia U19s were technically superb and even if we had put out our strongest XI then we would still have been on the end of a very severe beating.’ Cheadle return to league action on Wednesday when they face Widnes, and Florczak thinks one or two of the players may need an arm around the shoulder as they try and forget about this scoreline.

He added: ‘Time will tell how the players will take it. They were frustrated halfway through the game, but there were a few smiles at the end, but I think we need to have a word with them before Wednesday night and remind them that it was the Russia U19 national side. ‘Today was a one-touch football master class. It was superb to watch for the neutral to watch, but it was not great for me as I was tweeting every goal as they went in. ‘On Wednesday we have another first team game against Widnes and if I were a betting man then I would say that we will win that game 1-0!’ But for Florczak, who tweeted all the goals as they went in, he saw the club trend on Twitter as the game and the scoreline became the talk of social media on Sunday afternoon. He added: ‘Before the game we had the region of 1,500 twitter followers, now we are knocking on the door of 3,000 now. When I posted the full time score of 22-0 it was retweeted 5,000 times.’ While Cheadle face Widnes on Wendesday, the Russia U19s will face the Faroe Islands U19s on Thursday.

"A stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers for the first time. The extremely rare phenomenon caused by stellar debris being consumed by the hole has never been observed before. Known as 'relativistic jets', they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length. Stunning: This illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star. Such an event took place four billion light years from Earth . Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical (white, purple) and X-ray telescopes (yellow and red) showing the bursts . Most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core, with masses of millions or even billions of suns. Scientists were first alerted to the . phenomenon in March after Nasa's Swift telescope detected several bursts . of X-rays from a quiet patch of sky. Teams from both Pennsylvania State University and  the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in . Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9billion light years away. As a star falls toward a black hole, it is ripped apart by intense . tides. The gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around . the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of . degrees. The innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole, . where rapid motion and magnetism create dual, oppositely directed 'funnels' through which some particles may escape. Jets driving matter . at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the . black hole's spin axis. In the case of Swift J1644+57, one of these jets . happened to point straight at Earth. Dr David Burrows, from Pennsylvania State University which controls Swift, said chemical analysis of the bright flash's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns. Writing in Nature, they concluded that the Swift satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light. Dr Burrows said: 'Incredibly, this source is still producing X-rays and may remain bright . enough for the Swift satellite to observe into next year. It behaves . unlike anything we've seen before.' The swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy. The black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star. The absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black holes.Super-massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses. By comparison, the sun is just one solar mass and the Earth is 1/332,950th of a solar mass.","Astronomers watch as Nasa telescope captures rare event .

"A Northern California white supremacist convicted of killing a child molester has been sentenced to 26 years to life in prison, while his wife - convicted of being an accessory - will be released from jail in about two months, The Sacramento Bee reported Saturday. Charles Francis Gaskins, 48, was sentenced Friday after pleading no contest in March for the killing of Neil Hayes in 2009. A probation report said Gaskins was a member of a supremacist group that required its members to attack anyone with a history of child molestation. Sentenced: Charles Francis Gaskins, a white supremacist, has been sentenced to 26 years to life in prison for the murder of a child molester with the help of his wife, Sandra Sheaves, right . Gaskins and his wife - Sandra Sheaves - was living in a home she owned in Carmichael, a community outside of Sacramento, when they allowed the 66-year-old Hayes to move in. Gaskins had met Hayes while they were both serving time in prison, The Bee said. When Sheaves discovered on the Megan's Law website that Hayes was a registered sex offender, she told Gaskins. Gaskins and Sheaves confronted Hayes in the garage of the home, with Gaskins killing him by repeatedly hitting him in the head with a large rock, prosecutors said. Sheaves helped tie up Hayes' hands before determining he was dead and helped move his body into the trunk of her car. Old friends: Gaskins knew his victim, Neil Hayes, 66, from their time at the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy, California, pictured, so offered him a place to stay upon his release . Hayes' body was later found dumped along the side of a rural road about 35 miles away in Placerville. As part of his no-contest plea, Gaskins insisted authorities go easy on Sheaves, who also was charged with Hayes' murder. Prosecutors agreed, allowing her to plead no contest to accessory to murder. Sheaves, 43, was sentenced to eight years in prison. 'In a way, you almost instigated this, by showing the information from Megan's Law to Mr. Gaskins,' Sacramento Superior Court Judge Sharon Lueras said in sentencing Sheaves. With time served and other factors, Sheaves is expected to be released in 66 days, according to her attorney, James Warden.","Charles Francis Gaskins, 48, was member of supremacist group requiring members to attack anyone with history of child molestation .

"A six-year-old girl has a rare condition that means she's the size of a two-year old and weighs less than two stone. Maci Winters, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, is just 99cm tall and wears clothes with an 18-24 month label (The average six-year-old girl is 116cm tall and weighs over three stone). Maci was born with a rare genetic condition called Russell-Silver Syndrome, a form of primordial dwarfism that affects 1 in 100,000 babies. Maci Winter (with her parents Lena and John and younger brother Ashton), has a rare condition which means she's the size of a two-year old and weighs less than two stone. Her younger brother is already taller than her . Tiny: Maci's condition means she wears clothes designed for a two-year-old and excels at hide and seek . The body is smaller than it should be even before birth and those affected also find it difficult to gain weight. But despite being smaller than her school friends and her younger brother, Ashton, 4, Maci can walk, play and boss them around like any other six year old. Last week, her parents, Lena Appleton, 30 and John Winters, 31, watched her take to the stage in the school nativity. Her mother said:  'Watching her we were so proud, but it did make us realise how big the other children were compared to Maci. 'She was all smiles in the nativity and singing along to all the songs. She lit up the room and kept waving to us begging to have more pictures taken. To us, she's our little Christmas angel.' Although Maci's mental capacity is the same as any other six-year-old, she's well below the average weight and height for her age group. Ms Appleton added; 'When Maci was born we knew something was wrong. I was terrified when she had to be induced at 36 weeks. Small: Maci (left) aged eight weeks next to a four-week-old baby (right). She suffers from a rare genetic condition called Russell-Silver syndrome . 'She weighed just 3lb 5oz and the doctors didn't have a clue why she was so small. 'I . took her home, but she didn't gain any weight when I fed her - she was . too weak to suckle properly. The doctors told us she was a small baby . but she'd catch up eventually.' As a toddler, Maci's head grew so much bigger than her body that she wasn't even able to lift it as she crawled along the living room carpet. Ms Appleton and her partner John, a retail manager at a mobile phone shop, spent the next three years visiting geneticists and dietitians, desperate to know why their little girl wasn't developing normally. At the age of three, a referral to the genetics team at Doncaster Hospital finally brought a diagnosis - Russell-Silver Syndrome. Russell-Silver Syndrome is a form of primordial dwarfism. It means that the body is smaller than it should be even before birth and those affected find it difficult to gain weight . Ms Appleton said: 'We were terrified. Maci only weighed 11lbs and it was scary watching her go through so . many tests. When they finally said that she'd tested positive for . Russell-Silver Syndrome we were so relieved - we could finally help . her.' 'With her blonde hair, cheeky smile and gorgeous blue eyes, Maci loves doing the same things as any other schoolgirl. 'She . has little steps to help with washing her hands and at home loves . nothing more than dressing up like a princess or writing mummy and daddy . notes saying ""I love you"". Despite being two years younger, Maci's brother Ashton is taller . She added: 'We still worry about the impact Russell-Silver Syndrome will have on Maci's life - but she's so confident and cheeky. She does get upset when people mention her size but now she's old enough to tell them off which is quite funny.' Unfortunately, passers-by and other children do comment on Maci's pint-sized form - and it's not always positive. 'In the supermarket, people used to gather around our trolley and gawp,' says Ms Appleton. 'They'd ask ""what's wrong with her?"" 'Then when Maci could walk they'd tell me off and say ""your baby shouldn't be walking"".' 'Everyone at Maci's school is so . understanding, but sometimes we'll go to play areas and other children . will call her a baby and tell her off for playing in there.' But . her younger brother Ashton is already standing up for his older sister. At 103cms, he already towers over her and their height difference makes . playing games even more fun. Their mother said: 'Maci does . get confused and asks why Ashton is taller, but he's so protective of . his sister and he'll always stick up for her. 'She usually wins at hide and seek because she can fit into a little cupboard in the bedroom where he can't find her.' Despite . her specially adapted steps to reach things at school, Maci has had . very few problems. Because of her tiny fingers, she used to find . fastening buttons difficult - but can now put her school uniform on . herself.now she puts on her school uniform all by herself. Tough: Despite being dwarfed by her school friends and her younger brother, Ashton, 4, Maci can walk, play and boss them around like any other six year old, says her mother Lena . Ms Appleton added:  'When she first started school she kept getting knocked over because people would run past and not see her. But she has a 'school buddy' to look after her on the playground and the kids are brilliant.' Maci is being treated with growth hormones to give her a bit more height and has recently had hearing aids fitted. She also finds walking long distances difficult and has a special purple wheelchair to help her along. Common physical traits of those affected include a small, triangular-shaped face and a head which grows to be disproportionate to the rest of the body. Her mother said: 'There are adults with Russell-Silver Syndrome who have led normal lives and had children of their own. We have to be positive for Maci's sake. When we look back at what she's achieved it's just incredible.' Russell-Silver syndrome is a growth disorder that causes slow growth both before and after birth. Babies with the condition tend to have a low birth weight and often fail to grow and gain weight. However, their heads grow at a normal rate meaning they often appear unusually large compared to the rest of the body. Many children with Russell-Silver syndrome are thin and have a poor appetite. The average height for a man with the condition is 4ft 11in and for a woman, 4ft 7ins. Children with the syndrome often have a small, triangular face with a prominent forehead, narrow chin and small jaw. These children are at an increased risk of learning disabilities. The condition is thought to affect about one in every 100,000 babies. It is most commonly caused by abnormalities in genes found in chromosome 7 and chromosome 11.

There will also be a regular catch-up programme taking in the previous week's highlights called In Case You Missed It (ICYMI), hosted by Chris Stark. Content from Radio 1Xtra will also air on the site, including interviews with Mary J Blige and RIck ROss. And each week, a Radio 1 DJ will put together their top five things to watch on the iPlayer. Plus the section features archive content, including a 2011 Live Lounge special from Adele featuring six tracks. All videos are available to watch for 30 days from when they are uploaded. The BBC Trust approved the move earlier this month. BBC Trustee Suzanna Taverne said: ‘It will build on the great success Radio 1 already has online, although it will be important to ensure that everything available through the iPlayer area is consistent with Radio 1's distinctive identity.’ ‘It certainly feels exciting to see it come to fruition - having been a year since it was first mentioned,' added Mr Cooper.

The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 million copies in its first week - just shy of Britney Spears' biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist. 'If I had streamed the new album, it’s impossible to try to speculate what would have happened,' Ms Swift explained. 'But all I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. 'And I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.'

"When Alex Piper's husband suddenly became blind in both eyes 16 years ago, the mother-of-three did not hesitate to take on the role of the family breadwinner. Then, four years ago when the now 41-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer, Alex maintained her job throughout months of radiotherapy and chemotherapy while barely uttering a murmur of complaint. Now, after being diagnosed with stage four stomach cancer and dropping down to a mere 41 kilograms, the Piper family from New South Wales are finally calling out for help by taking their story of struggle and survival to the public. Scroll down for video . Matt and Alex Piper have shared their story with the public in an effort to raise money for their family . The family of five have been struggling financially since Matt became blind 16 years ago, forcing Alex to take on the role as the sole breadwinner of the family . Alex and her husband Matt first met as teenagers before they finally began dating at 21 years of age. Only two years after the duo married, things took a turn for the worse when Matt lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind. Further damage to the nerves in his hands and arms rendered him unable to pursue a career as a masseuse, but the father of three - Charley, 13, Honey, 10, and Willow, 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children. 'It hurt hard. My heart was broken for a very long time,' Matt told A Current Affair. 'To overcome that - I feel and touch now. I've been blind for 16 years now.' Alex and her husband Matt first met as teenagers before they finally began dating at 21 years of age . Only two years after the duo married, things took a turn for the worse when Matt lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind . 'I saw Alex walking down the aisle and that picture I still have a strong image of in my mind.' Alex was forced to provide for her family solely on her own, but things took a turn for the worst when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2010. Despite the emotional and physical demands of the disease, the 41-year-old continued to go to work each day, even after the cancer was found to have spread to her bones and stomach a year later. 'I only had two weeks off work. I did radiation and chemotherapy and I worked the whole way through and I wish I'd taken time for myself,' Alex said. The father of three - Charley, 13, Honey, 10, and Willow, 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children . 'It hurt hard. My heart was broken for a very long time,' Matt told A Current Affair . She was finally forced to leave her career behind three weeks ago, but despite being drained of all energy and appetite and being told by doctors that there is no cure for her illness, Alex still holds hope. 'The doctors have their views on what's possible and what's not possible, but I like to have my own views,' she said. So far, almost $370,000 has been donated to help the Piper family after Alex's aunt, Amanda Fraser, took to MyCause.com to share her niece's story. Before: Alex, who was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, was forced to leave her job three weeks ago fo further treatment after the cancer was found to have spread to her stomach and bones . After: She now weighs only 41 kilograms and, despite being drained of all energy and appetite and being told by doctors that there is no cure for her illness, still holds hope . 'The strain is starting to show, hence our call to arms with this campaign, as we've finally convinced Alex to let us try and assist,' Ms Fraser wrote. 'She is a fighter, she is positive… but Alex can no longer cope with the struggles of bringing up a young family and loss of income. 'The much needed funding that we raise, will be utilised to both ease the financial burden on the family, help to cover the mortgage and allow us to continue to try and find the best and most innovative treatments possible.'","Matt Piper lost his vision 16 years ago and has never seen his three kids .

"In an era of identity theft and massive security breaches, Americans continue to be lax in protecting their identities and personal information, according to new recent report. In a survey of 1,300 people from across the country, only 44 per cent say they are more cautious as a result of recent problems with national retailers in the news. One in four has never changed his or her personal identification numbers and one in five uses the same online banking password for different accounts. One in three Americans say they know their spouse or partner's PIN (library image) An overwhelming 71 per cent say they physically write down their usernames and passwords in order to remember them, leaving open the possibility that anyone could be privy to it. One in three say they know their spouse or partner's PIN and one in 10 admits to knowing their own mother's pin. Facts and figures on identity theft revealed . It's a tangled web and most Americans can't seem to find their way out. Nearly 40 per cent say that at least one person knows their user name and password and one in 10 admits to giving a bank card and PIN to a co-worker or friend to take out cash at an ATM or make a store purchase. Despite that, nearly one in three worries that the friend or co-worker will one day take advantage of their trust in them. Michael Greene, chairman and CEO of ID Watchdog, an online identity theft protection service, said: 'It is important to protect your passwords and use strong combinations with alternate characters and numbers, but don't write them down. 'Users should change their passwords regularly, and also to be sure to use different passwords on your different accounts. 'It's the same as locking your door when you leave the house for the day.' Interestingly 16 per cent of those surveyed say their identity has been stolen before, mostly from theft of wallets, purses, social security numbers and mail. Nearly half say it devastated their credit, debit card and bank accounts and one in 10 were never able to resolve their problems. 'In this digital age, all of our digital information is at risk,' said Greene. 'Hackers steal account credentials in the thousands to millions at a time, and with those credentials they steal your identity.' According to the Federal Trade Commission's annual report on consumer complaints, identity theft continues to top its list of consumer complaints. Americans reported losing more than $1.6 billion to fraud last year. The Commission received more than two million complaints overall, and 14 percent were identity theft related. For consumers who peruse social media, shop and apply for credit online, sharing personal information is often difficult to avoid. Three out of five enter their social security online when asked, and 47 percent say they provide their entire birthdate - month, day and birth year - on social media. 'The best way to protect your identity is with a good monitoring and protection service like ID Watchdog, so you can find the problem before it finds you,' said Greene.","One in five uses the same online banking password for different accounts .

"David Villa ended his international career with a brilliant backheel but couldn't hide his emotions when substituted during Spain's win against Australia. The 32-year-old announced his retirement from playing for his country prior to the World Cup and is set to link-up with New York FC when the defending world champions fly back from Brazil. And the raw feeling was plain for all to see when Villa was hooked by Vicente Del Bosque in the second half of the 3-0 win. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Villa scoring a brace for Spain in World Cup warm-up . Arm around the shoulder: David Villa is consoled by Diego Costa on the Spain bench after being substituted . All over: Iker Casillas (left) and Santi Cazorla went over to Villa as he left the international stage for a final time . Showing their appreciation: Pedro, Casillas and Gerard Pique stood up to applaud Villa upon being taken off . VIDEO Spain bow out on high . Team-mates rushed to console the striker as he exited in the 57th minute. And while he seemed to be holding it together as he trudged off, Villa appeared to burst into tears when he sat down on the bench. Diego Costa had his arm around the former Atletico Madrid and Barcelona frontman while he was comforted by a coach. Pedro, Iker Casillas and Gerard Pique were up in appreciation as he came off. Del Bosque later revealed he was unaware it was Villa's last international. 'He (Villa) certainly seemed very annoyed. He said it was his last game, but I didn't know that. I'm sure he was upset,' the Spain boss told his post-match press conference. 'All I was thinking about is that it was time to kill off the game and we did that.' The win against the Socceroos brought an end to what has been a dismal tournament for Del Bosque's side, who lost their opening two games and are surprisingly on their way home early. What a touch!

"It is known as one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but it seems St Petersburg is also keen to capitalise on its nightlife. Step in the BarBus Maxi, a converted Ikarus 280 bus that is designed to take groups out for a nocturnal tour of the city, while staging an epic party on board. The former public transport vehicle has everything that could be expected of a raging nightclub, including dance floor, fully stocked bar, TV screens and even a pole in the centre of the floor.

A young woman on the BarBus Maxi dances to tunes pumped out by the fully-loaded sound system (right) While a party bus is hardly a new concept, many places forbid drinking on them while others are simply trumped up transport from one club to another. But the BarBus is the destination, says Alexander Berest, the entrepreneur  who used his engineering skills to create the ultimate in fun on four wheels after being inspired by a night out on a normal bus. 'We were in a great mood and one of my friends had a guitar which he was playing,' Berest said. 'The driver was too young to mind us making loud music and the other passengers got involved and we were all singing and dancing. 'As the bus drove through the student's area more passengers got on and joined the party, and the idea for the Barbus Maxi was born from there.' BarBus also boasts leather sofas, a smoke machine, air-conditioning and a mirrored ceiling. Inside the BarBus, which boasts high-back leather sofas and an elaborate lighting system .

"The NHS is still failing to deliver the best diagnosis and treatment to thousands of men with prostate cancer, says the first national audit of services. It shows a ‘worryingly vast variation’ in access to advanced MRI scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques. Half of all men with the disease do not receive all the support services they should in hospitals, the National Prostate Cancer Audit found. The NHS is still failing to deliver the best diagnosis and treatment to thousands of men with prostate cancer, says the first national audit of services. Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK . Four out of five radiation centres in England do not offer brachytherapy – which uses radioactive seeds planted inside the prostate and can help half of men retain their sex lives. The service is not provided at a single centre in Labour-run Wales. Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men. In the UK, more than 41,000 are diagnosed each year leading to around 10,000 deaths annually. Survival rates are below Europe averages. The report, the first audit of how services are organised and delivered by 153 NHS trusts in England and Wales, found they are increasingly using advanced techniques but there is ‘room for improvement’. In the UK, more than 41,000 are diagnosed each year leading to around 10,000 deaths annually. Survival rates are below Europe averages . It says brachytherapy is recommended for those with high-risk cancer but is provided by only 11 of the 54 radiation centres in England and by none in Wales. One in four hospitals in England and two in five in Wales do not have the most sophisticated form of MRI, an imaging technique that can better detect cancer and spare men unnecessary biopsies. The ‘new standard’ of intensity modulated radiotherapy – which helps focus the radiation to the shape of the prostate cancer and spare healthy tissue – is not available at one in ten English radiotherapy centres. It is available at all ten hospitals providing prostate cancer care in Wales. Most damningly, only half of men in England and 60 per cent in Wales can get the support they need, ranging from advice on sexual and continence problems to counselling. Owen Sharp, of Prostate Cancer UK, said the findings could not be ignored and variations in care had to be tackled ‘head on’.","Reports shows a ‘worryingly vast variation’ in access to advanced MRI scanning and the latest radiotherapy techniques .

"Danish doctors claim to have cured childhood obesity by following a set of basic rules which include no second helpings of food within 20 minutes of eating. Snacks and sweets are rationed to once a week, fruit juice or fizzy drinks once a month and children must walk or cycle to school. The rules also state that pots are kept in the kitchen at mealtimes - rather than on the table to avoid the temptation of second helpings. The rules have been drawn up by Danish paediatrician Dr Jens Christian Holm, who claims to have helped 1,300 overweight and obese children. Under the diet plan, which has around 20 rules, sweets are rationed to once a week and seconds are rationed . As part of The Children's Obesity Clinic's Treatment protocol children in Holbaek are scanned by doctors who then go on to develop individual plans . He first began testing his set of rules –The Children’s Obesity Clinic’s Treatment (TCOCT) protocol – in the town of Holbaek, 40 miles from Copenhagen, in 2008. But it has been so successful it has been adopted by eight other districts across the country. Dr Holm says it has been so successful across Denmark that other countries such as Britain should follow suit. Figures published by the NHS next month are expected to show that one in three children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school. And only today a report warned that growing numbers of teenagers had become so obese they needed weight loss surgery. But Dr Holm believes his solution is far simpler and cheaper than gastric band or bypass operations, which cost the NHS up to £15,000 a time. It hinges on sticking to between 15 to 20 rules aimed at improving the diet, boosting exercise levels and slashing time spent sat down. The plan includes promoting free physical activity after school and not allowing children to watch TV or use a computer before 5pm in the evening . Other recommendations include serving food in the kitchen - so second helpings are not so readily available -  and getting children to school by walking or cycling . Under The Children’s Obesity Clinic’s Treatment (TCOCT) protocol, a doctor creates a plan comprising 15-20 components. These, according to the BBC, may include: . 1 - No crunchy muesli or fruit yoghurts for breakfast - choosing oatmeal, dark brown bread, meat and fish instead . 2 - No fast food or white bread for lunch; choose brown bread, meat, fish and vegetables instead . 3 - Portions served up in the kitchen - no pots and pans at the dining table . 4 - Plate proportions for dinner should be: half vegetables, a quarter brown rice, pasta or potatoes, and a quarter low fat fish or meat . 5 - Wait 20 minutes before having second helpings - this allows time for the body to feel full . 6 - Feel satisfied after each meal . 7 - Only two pieces of fruit per day . 8 - Fast food only once a month . 9 - Sweets only once a week . 10 - Snack only once a week . 11 - Limit juice, iced tea, cocoa, soda or lemonade to once weekly - only half a litre in total . 12 - Cycle or walk to school . 13 - Organised physical activity eg dancing, handball or gymnastics . 14 - Free physical activities like walking/biking after school, walking the dog or trampolining . 15 - Screen time (television, computer or tablet) limited to two hours per day . 16 - No television/computer access until 5pm . 17 - Set a regular, early bedtime . One states that children must feel satisfied after each meal so they aren’t tempted to snack later. But if they are still hungry after their first helping, they must wait at least 20 minutes for seconds as this is how long it takes for the body to feel ‘full’. Others include no television before 5pm and for no more than two hours a day as well as no white bread for lunch. Initially they are admitted to hospital for 24 hours where they undergo tests and scans including measurements of body fat, blood sugar and blood pressure. They also answer a very detailed questionnaire about their diets and lifestyle, with the help of their parents. Doctors then help them draw up a more specific set of rules tailored to their likes, dislikes and routines. These stay in place until the child has reached their target weight. Dr Holms said that of the 1,900 patients who have been put on the program since its launch, some 70 per cent have lost significant amounts of weight and kept it off for at least four years. He said: ‘In general, obese children are neglected. They are often lonely and many of them don't participate in activities with their peers. They lack self-confidence. ‘With this scheme there is a real hope they can lose weight and have a good quality of life. ‘We create the environment and tools with which the children and their families can overcome this.’ Dr Holm says that, unless children change these habits, the ‘obesity will persist'. ‘People will get very frustrated, sad, and they will be lost,' he said. ‘Their entire life needs to be changed, because they tend to be lonely, tend to be ashamed of themselves so they need to do this, and to interact with other children in their daily lives.' A report by the National Bariatric Registry – which includes obesity surgeons - today found that 550 men and women under 25 had needed weight-loss surgery. This included 62 under 18s – which it stated was evidence of a ‘clear failure’ of strategies to prevent obesity.","Rules have been drawn up by Danish paediatrician Dr Jens Christian Holm .

"Judging by the show of force, you’d be forgiven for thinking a major terror alert was under way. However, ranks of armed police, along with dogs, a helicopter and 18 cars were actually swooping on an illegal bare-knuckle fight. Up to 500 travellers from Ireland and all over Britain had gathered on a Staffordshire industrial estate for the clash. Staffordshire police dispatched 18 police cars to the scene as well as armed officers and a helicopter following reports of gunfire . Police cordoned off the area after being called to reports of gunfire following a gipsy boxing match in Chesterton, Staffordshire . Police rushed in after a 999 caller claimed guns had been fired between two groups in cars. There had also been reports of speeding vehicles being driven erratically as occupants brandished baseball bats and knives. One member of the traveller community said the gunshots had been fired after the Fight Club-style boxing match had ended, forcing police to cordon off the site. Joe Joyce, 23, who arrived from Ireland for the fight, said: ‘It was an organised event that attracted more than 400 people. ‘It is illegal and the police didn’t know anything about it. They wouldn’t have let it happen if they had known. ‘There were no problems during the fight but an incident happened after and they made everyone leave. Let’s just say, “Bang bang”.’ Bryan Parker, 24, who also came from Ireland for the fight, said: ‘It’s a big event that almost 500 people went to. Something happened after the fight but I can’t talk about it.’ After police cars poured into the Parkhouse Industrial Estate in Chesterton on Sunday afternoon, armed officers in body armour stood guard as colleagues seized axes, baseball bats, hammers and fireworks. Armed officers with police dogs came in full body armour after the 999 call and seized 'a significant number of weapons' Travellers who went to the fight, some of whom came from  Ireland, said there was 'an incident' afterwards but refused to give details . Julie Nelson, of APC Pick Up Services on the estate, said the travellers’ cars had been speeding through town earlier in the day. She added: ‘A Range Rover came down the road at full pelt, followed by two transit vans. They stopped in the road, got out of their vans and were arguing. There was a police helicopter over the estate for about two hours. People were quite worried, what with armed police and dogs around.’ A worker from a joinery firm on the estate, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It got really ugly after the fight – tensions were high and there was a lot of people obviously armed to the teeth.’ Staffordshire Police confiscated a ‘significant number of weapons’, and a 27-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon. Inspector Mark Barlow said: ‘We are investigating reports that a significant number of the travelling community travelled to the area for an illegal fight.’ A number of families with large vans and caravans remained on the industrial estate this morning, though there is no suggestion they are linked with the reported disorder . Police say they are carrying out regular patrols of the area to reassure local residents that the violence is unlikely to re-occur . The industrial estate was quiet, with most firms who rent units taking Sunday off, but witnesses reported erratic driving and scuffles .","Around 500 travellers thought to have attended illegal boxing match on Staffordshire industrial estate yesterday .

"A theme park has banned adults unaccompanied by children from entry over fears that they could be paedophiles. The bizarre rule at Puxton Park, in Somerset, came to light after a bird enthusiast was forbidden from watching a falconry display at the centre on his own. Matthew Richards, 54, had visited with his three grandchildren just days earlier and wanted to return for another look at the birds of prey area - but was turned away. The centre has appeared to contradict itself in justifying the rule - first claiming it has been in place for seven years - before then blaming it on last year's visit from jailed paedophile Phillip Judd - the former mayor of Weston-super-Mare. Turned away: Father-of-three Matthew Richards, 54, was banned from entering Puxton Park on his own . Father-of-three Mr Richards was turned away at the theme park's gate on Thursday with staff telling him they did not admit single men and women on child protection grounds. When he complained, bosses at the tourist attraction near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, defended the bizarre rule and insisted it is 'in line with other parks' - before sanding him away. The married father-of-three said: 'I almost feel discriminated against. I could understand it if it was for the attractions that young children only enjoy, but the falconry is of interest to all. 'I was frankly amazed. I was told the rule applies to single men, and women, for the protection of children. Bizarre rule: The park's chief has justified the move saying 'there is a lot in the headlines about paedophiles and things that are going on with children' 'I couldn't see anything about the rule on the brochure which I picked up at another attraction. 'We have taken one of our grandchildren there before, and I saw that the falconry was there and thought it would be interesting to go back and see the displays. 'They are advertising adult memberships as gifts so I can't understand it.' The park's managing director, Alistair Mead, has claimed the centre was 'forced to implement stringent child protection policies' because of 'the society in which we live in'. He then alluded to the case of Phillip Judd, the former mayor of Weston-super-Mare who visited the theme park before being jailed for child pornography offences last month. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'If you cannot trust civic authority figures then, simply, who can you trust? The park's managing director alluded to the case of Phillip Judd, former mayor of Weston-super-Mare, who visited the park before he was jailed for child pornography offences . Attraction: Matthew Richards was hoping to see a falconry display at the leisure centre in Somerset . 'Mr Judd had visited Puxton Park to undertake a civic duty and his sinister secrets were only recently exposed and he was jailed for his crimes.' The reason appears to contradict the theme park's earlier claim that the rule had existed for seven years. Mr Mead added: 'We would rather be over zealous when unaccompanied adults visit us armed with cameras than put children at any potential risk.' The award-winning Puxton Park is a family-orientated leisure attraction which includes zip lines, a play barn, crazy golf and animal enclosures, as well as an owl zone and a falconry centre. Award-winning: Puxton Park is a family-orientated leisure attraction which includes zip lines, a play barn, crazy golf and animal enclosures, as well as an owl zone and a falconry centre . Mr Richards from High Littleton, near Bath, Somerset, had attended the park with his family, and returned on Thursday only intending to watch another falconry display. But he was banned from entering by staff who claimed their rule was clearly explained on the website. The bird enthusiast had visited the centre just days earlier with his grandchildren (file picture) The 'prices' section online states: 'We are sorry but we are unable to let single men or women without children into the park. 'If you are here to meet someone let one of our reception staff know and they will happily do a tannoy announcement asking them to come and meet you.' Alistair Mead earlier commented: 'There is a lot in the headlines about paedophiles and things that are going on with children. 'We have done our research and in line with all other parks we don't let single men or women in. 'We make it quite clear that if people want to go to the falconry they have to get a prior appointment, and we would take them down to the falconry centre. 'It is in the leaflet. I think if I did a survey of 100 of our customers they would agree that we are doing the right thing.' A new statement on the leisure centre's website reads: 'Our members fully support our decisions and we have received nothing but praise for our policy including positive feedback from a Child Protection Specialist, who commended us for our child protection principals. 'Within seven years we have only had one complaint about this policy from the gentlemen last week. 'At the time of setting the policy the other parks within the area had a similar stance to us. I have spoken to two or three similar client based parks this morning and they still have the same policy as we do. I'm not going to name names as it's unprofessional of me to do so. 'In light of this coverage we will look at what other parks are doing with their admissions policy, speak to our customers and review.'

"A young woman told a life-saving operation on a deadly brain tumour would probably leave her with special needs has defied doctors' predictions - and graduated from university with a teaching degree. Hannah Jones, 21, had to learn how to walk and talk again after suffering a stroke during an operation to remove a cancerous tumour on her brain. She had made the brave decision to go ahead with surgery despite doctors warning it could leave her permanently disabled and with a reduced level of intelligence. Scroll down for video . Hannah Jones, 21, graduated  from the University of Chester with a 2:1 Honours degree in Education - despite doctors warning an operation to remove a brain tumour would leave her with special needs . Miss Jones underwent three operations in total to remove the cancer cells from her brain, suffering a stroke during the last procedure which left her unable to walk and talk. She is pictured left after her first operation, and right having some of her hair removed during treatment . Miss Jones is pictured having a radiotherapy mask created. Doctors told her that  radiotherapy, chemotherapy and three operations would cause so much damage she would never be able to sit A-levels let alone go to university, she says . Amazingly, Miss Jones defied expectations and managed to re-learn to walk and talk. Her parents, Steve and Dianne Jones (pictured) said they are 'so proud of everything Hannah has achieved' But amazingly, she defied all their predictions - and has now made so much progress she has graduated from the University of Chester with a 2:1 Honours degree in Education. She now plans to work in a school for children with special needs. Miss Jones, from Chester, Cheshire, said: 'My three years at uni has been really, really hard. I've still been having treatment and it's been exhausting. 'There were times where I wanted to give up, but my family and tutors were so supportive and kept me going. I'm so happy that I finally got here. 'I'd always wanted to go to university and train to be a teacher, but surgeons told me that the operation I needed to save my life would probably make that impossible. 'I was told that the radiotherapy, chemotherapy and operations would cause so much damage that I would never be able to sit A-levels, never mind go to uni. 'I've always wanted to teach, but especially after I got ill, I wanted to work with special needs children, because I feel I have a better understanding of what they're going through. 'I have just got a job as a teaching assistant in a special educational needs school, and get a great deal of satisfaction from working with children who face many challenges ahead.' Miss Jones is pictured during her second operation. After this, doctors told the family her only option was a third operation, which would scrape tumour cells away from an artery deep in her brain - but that it would almost certainly trigger a stroke . Miss Jones (left) and her sister Molly (right), are pictured on holiday in Bausko, Bulgaria, during Christmas 2007 - before she was ill and the brain tumour was discovered . Miss Jones is pictured on holiday in Woolacoombe, Dorset in July 2008. She underwent a third operation to remove cancer cells from an artery deep in her brain in 2009 . Doctors first discovered the four centimetre tumour growing in Hannah's brain six years ago. After two risky operations to remove it, neurosurgeon Conor Mallucci told the family her only option was a third operation, which would scrape tumour cells away from an artery deep in her brain - but that it would almost certainly trigger a stroke. Miss Jones had the operation in August 2009, and suffered a major stroke while she was in theatre at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool. When she came round, she was unable to talk, stand or even eat by herself, and had to begin the journey to recovery, despite doctors warning it was likely she would be left with special needs. It took four months for Hannah to even be able to stand by herself - but her progress stunned doctors, and she slowly relearned how to do everything she was able to before. During her final operation, surgeons carried out a rare procedure where they inserted 'wafers' into Hannah's brain - that constantly release small doses of chemotherapy. And despite medics fearing that Miss Jones' tumour would soon return, it has remained at bay for five years. Ms Jones has just got a job as a teaching assistant in a special educational needs school, and says she gets 'a great deal of satisfaction' from her job . Miss Jones won a WellChild award - a bravery award given to children with serious medical conditions. As her prize she was sent to fly an aircraft . Miss Jones remembers that others have not been so lucky. She said: 'I met one of my best friends, Christie Butler, while I was having treatment, but sadly, she didn't survive her tumour. Before she passed away, she bought me a beautiful necklace, that I wore on my graduation day. I knew she would want to be there with me.' Her father Steve, a university lecturer, added: 'We are so proud of Hannah and everything she's achieved, but we know we are incredibly lucky. 'So many people who have brain tumours don't make it to that five year point, and Hannah has tirelessly raised funds for the Brain Tumour Charity, regardless of how busy or unwell she has been. 'Her mother and I are so proud of both our daughters.' For more information, visit: thebraintumourcharity.org . Ms Jones now raises funds for the Brain Tumour Charity.

"A new report has found that the generation of Australians who are currently 24 or under will be the first that are worse off than their parents . More expensive houses, fewer jobs and less help from the government - that's the bleak future facing Australians under 24. A new report from the Foundation for Young Australians has found that although the country's youngest generation is more educated and likely to live longer than their ancestors, they're unlikely to have it better than their parents and are predisposed to higher debts and instability, the ABC reports. Almost a third of young people are currently unemployed or under-employed and those who went to university are saddled with $24,000 more debt than their parents. To buy a first home they have to take out loans three times larger than did their parents. New official figures also released on Monday show the average loan for a first home buyer hit a record $310,200 in September. That compares with just $67,500 in 1991, yet average wages have not grown anywhere near the same pace. The proportion of people under 24-years-old working part-time only is three times what it was 30 years ago. By 2050 it's predicted the amount of government spending that directly benefits young people will drop from 46 per cent of total expenditure to 37 per cent. At the same time, spending on older Australians will increase. Young Australians are well aware of the challenges ahead - fewer than one in four believe their life experience will be better than that of their parents. Jan Owen, the CEO of the Foundation for Young Australians which released the report, said that the longer the needs of young people are ignored, the 'bigger and uglier' future economic problems  are going to get . Foundation chief executive Jan Owen says young Australians are the country's social and economic lifeblood. 'We must ensure that we are investing in them today to secure Australia's tomorrow,' she said ahead of the report's launch. The longer the needs of young people are ignored, their potential discounted, and their talents and energy wasted, the 'bigger and uglier' the future economic problems of our nation are going to get. The Renewing Australia's Promise report will be launched in Melbourne on Monday.","The Foundation for Young Australians' new report compared the living standards of various generations .

"Escape: Mrs Milligan, pictured outside the inquest today, said she had grabbed Kit and was trying to swim away from the boat when it caught her leg . The widow of a senior television executive who died alongside their eight-year-old daughter in a bank holiday speedboat accident told his inquest of her 'big mistake' in not using the vessel's kill cord. Sky executive Nick Milligan, 51, and daughter Emily had been on the boat in Padstow, Cornwall, on May 5, last year with the rest of their family when they were thrown into the water. The out of control boat continued to circle at high speed before hitting the family members, killing Mr Milligan and Emily, and injuring his wife Victoria and their three other children. Mrs Milligan, 40, today told the pair's inquest in Truro that she regretted that neither she, nor her husband had been attached to the boat's kill cord, a safety feature designed to cut the throttle in an emergency. She said Mr Milligan, the managing director of Sky’s advertising sales division Sky Media who was known as Nicko to his family and friends, had been wearing it around his ankle. However, when she took over the controls of the boat so that he could go to the toilet she had not attached it to herself, as they were heading back to the mooring. 'I didn’t put it back on because I thought Nicko was going to come back and take over,' she told the jury at the hearing. 'Obviously that was a big mistake.' The Milligans had been on holiday with their four children, Amber, 13, Olivia, 12, Emily, and six-year-old Kit, leaving their home in Wandsworth, south-west London, for a Bank Holiday break just two days earlier. Mrs Milligan lost the lower part of her left leg in the incident, Amber suffered a cut hand, Olivia a bump to her head, and Kit serious injuries and needed 12 operations to save one of his legs. Mrs Milligan told the inquest that she had driven the speedboat - called Milly - about 20 times during 2012 and had completed her powerboat course on it. Describing the build-up to the incident, she said: 'Nicko said he needed a wee and put Milly into neutral and removed the kill cord from around his leg. I went up to the steering wheel and I had always done this to ensure that Kit did not interfere with the controls. 'I stood by the steering wheel and Nicko returned to the bow of the boat and started to play with the children. I was worried as the tide was going out and the boat was about halfway between Rock beach and Padstow beach. 'The sea was flat and calm and I decided to drive Milly back to the mooring. I did not put the kill cord around my leg because it was only a short distance to the mooring.' Mrs Milligan said she was persuaded by her children to do one last lap of the picturesque Camel Estuary but she protested that there was not enough room to turn. Tragedy: Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (left) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family, Victoria and children (left to right) Olivia, Kit and Amber, when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water . Terror: The boat, seen being tailed by a local sailor attempting to bring it under control, hot the family after they fell into the water. Mrs Milligan said that neither she, nor her husband, had been attached to the boat's kill cord . 'As I started to drive back to the mooring, the children all called out that they wanted to go around again. “Nicko then said ""turn right, turn right"". We were not going very fast and I did not think there was enough room to turn. He then grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand. Nicko was standing on my left. 'I remember the acceleration was not smooth and it jerked. Nicko had never caused it to jerk in this way before. I remember feeling like we had hit a wall and we all fell out. It was so sudden, it all happened within seconds. 'I thought afterwards maybe we had hit something to tip the six people out. My husband was 6ft 3in and 15 stone, something must have tipped us out. 'I think it was the action of the boat that tipped us all out. It was just so sudden, we didn't have a chance. We were standing at one point, then the next we were in the water.' Mrs Milligan said her husband had tried to huddle the familit members together inside the boat's turning circle so its propellers would avoid them. 'We all fell into the water,' she said. 'Kit was screaming as I grabbed him and Nicko was telling us to stay together. 'Nicko was splashing about in the water, he was upset. He was saying ‘stay in the middle, stay in the middle’. 'I could see the beach and started to swim with Kit. The boat was going around us very fast and I think the accelerator was at its highest setting. “I was not aware of where the others were but as I swam with Kit the boat came straight towards me and hit me in the chest. It caught my leg and I saw lots of blood.' Pausing to compose herself, Mrs Milligan continued: 'I knew I had to get out of the water. I did not know where anybody else was, other than Kit. Injuries: Mrs Milligan lost the lower part of her left leg in the incident, Amber suffered a cut hand, Olivia a bump to her head, and Kit serious injuries to his leg . Taking control: Mrs Milligan (right) told the hearing that her husband (left) had grabbed the wheel of the boat and accelerated, causing the boat to jerk . Help: A lifeboat crew, a passing boat and some canoeists, attempt to help the family in the water . 'I did not see the boat hit anybody else. It continued to circle. I remember a woman came to help. 'Prior to the accident I am not aware of anything to distract either of us. The route we took that day was one we completed every time we took the boat out and there was nothing out of the ordinary. 'Neither of us had ever made a manoeuvre when we felt unsafe or about to fall out. I would like to clarify that we never ""wave jumped"" in the estuary.' Asked by Cornwall coroner Emma Carlyon about falling out of the boat, Mrs Milligan replied: 'I saw the boat speed away from us - that’s all I can remember - it all happened very quickly. Hero: Water sports instructor Charlie Toogood risked his life by leaping onto the out of control boat after speeding to the rescue with a friend when they saw the family in the sea . 'I thought maybe we had hit something. It was so sudden and we didn’t have a chance. One second we were in the boat and the next second we were in the water. 'I wasn’t aware where anyone else was. My survival instincts kicked in and I just grabbed Kit and decided to swim towards the beach.' Earlier, the inquest heard evidence from pathologist Dr Russell Delaney. He said Mr Milligan died from 'significant' head injuries, which would have been caused by either his ejection from the speedboat, impact with the water or blunt impact from the boat. Asked about Mrs Milligan's evidence that her husband was able to shout to her while in the water, Dr Delaney replied: 'If Nicholas Milligan was in the water and moving his arms and talking and shouting, then that head injury would have occurred after that. 'I would not have expected him to be able to do that if he had sustained that head injury during the ejection.' Mr Milligan was found to have 56mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The legal drink drive limit is 80mg per 100ml. Dr Delaney said Emily died from multiple injuries - particularly to her abdomen - which were also caused by her ejection from the boat, impact with the water or a blunt impact from the boat. The inquest heard that the boat's propeller caused significant injuries to Emily but she would have already been rendered unconscious. 'From that point of unconsciousness, she would have been entirely unaware of what was happening,' Dr Delaney said. 'The injuries to her abdomen were as a result of her ejection from the boat and whatever then happened to her afterwards would have been very rapidly fatal - those are not injuries she could have survived.' The hearing continues. Investigation: Officials in Padstow harbour following the crash. The family had been on the way back to the moorings when the tragedy occurred .

"Facing jail: Businessman Seth Pennington, at court earlier this year, today admitted to his involvement in the lucrative counterfeit drugs scam . A counterfeit drugs ring made up to £60,000-a-week selling fake Viagra through a bogus mail-order fishing-tackle business to customers around the world. The gang, headed by Neil Gilbert, 41, raked in more than £11million offering cheap erectile dysfunction pills and other counterfeit medication. The group used a series of ‘front’ companies claiming to sell jewellery, fishing tackle and cosmetics to accept the electronic payments and laundered the proceeds through more than 100 bank accounts. The money was transferred into accounts, both in the UK and overseas, that were held by gang members or their relatives before being withdrawn or used to sustain the business, the court heard. The court heard that the conspiracy lasted eight years from 2004 onwards and continued even after the gang were arrested in September 2011 following an investigation by an industry watchdog. Businessman Seth Pennington, 41, today admitted his involvement in the scam - seven other members have already admitted their part. He went on trial at the Old Bailey, London, in May but the case was aborted after two days when he was hit by a delivery lorry outside court. Pennington had claimed that his involvement was innocent and believed the products being sold were legal herbal medicines and cosmetics. But he appeared in the dock this morning to plead guilty to selling or supplying counterfeit Viagra and unauthorised products including Cialis, Super Kamagra and Tadalafil. Pennington now awaits sentence alongside Gilbert and other members of the ring. Judge Charles Wide QC granted him conditional bail while a probation report is being prepared but warned him: ‘That is not an indication as to the likely sentence. All options remain open.’ Prosecutor Gillian Jones said: ‘The medicines that were seized which were purported to be Viagra and Valium in fact turned out to be counterfeit. ‘This was big business. The proceeds of the supply of these medicines via websites which have been traced to various merchant facilities is in excess of £11 million - that that is not the real figure. ‘Not all bank accounts have been identified. Some are abroad and haven’t been traced properly and some medicines were paid for in cash.’ An audit kept by Gilbert revealed that the gang received £60,000 a week from the sale of unlicensed medicines during 2011 alone - a turnover of £3million. Miss Jones said: ‘There is no doubt a conspiracy to sell these unlicensed medicines existed. They had to set up and maintain websites through which medicines were sold, rent storage units and packing centres. ‘Offices were rented, stationary and packaging purchased, mail boxes rented to which customers posted cash and merchant banking facilities to allow payments by cards. Ring leader: The court heard that Neil Gilbert, pictured earlier this year, was at the heart of the scam . Involved: Catherine Laverick (right) and Sarah Laverick (left) have previously admitted their part in the scheme . ‘They purported to be trading fishing tackle, cosmetics or jewellery but they were just a front to hide the real merchandise which was unlicensed medicines. ‘As demand for the products grew the customer database widened to countries in Europe including Sweden, France and Germany.’ When banks started raising concerns about the nature of the business, the gang opened accounts offshore in Belize and Panama where fewer questions were asked. Hugh Adair, 36, of Ulceby, South Humberside, pictured earlier this year, was also part of the gang . Pennington was involved in the operation of one of the front companies and allowed payments to be made into his bank accounts. Miss Jones said: ‘He was at the heart of the conspiracy. He was at the beck and call of the head of the conspiracy, Neil Gilbert. ‘He also rented storage facilities for the medicinal products and had access to them. He also carried out stock checks, worked at distribution centres, organised the provision of stationery and money to pay for postage and the stock of unlicensed medicines. ‘He was also involved in selling medicines direct to face to face customers.’ Two of the distribution centres was based in Brighton, the court heard. Miss Jones said that part of the money laundering operation involved cash being delivered from Humberside to a mailbox rented by Pennington in Brighton. ‘He must have at the very least suspected he was dealing with criminal property. ‘There were repeated credits from customers into all three of his bank accounts, many of which were overseas payments. He also met up with other people involved in money laundering.’ Pennington, of Brighton, admitted conspiracy to sell or supply unlicensed medicines, selling or distributing counterfeit goods (Viagra), two counts of money laundering, one of possession of counterfeit goods purporting to be Valium and one count of possession of a medicinal product (Kamagra) without marketing authorisation. Neil Gilbert and and Kristina Soufalakis, 26, also of Brighton, Hugh Adair, 36, Catherine Laverick, 46, and Sarah Laverick, 26, all of  Ulceby, South Humberside, Mark Bristow, 44, of Crayford, Kent, Darrell Jacob, 37, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, have all previously admitted their part in the scam. They will be sentenced during a two-day hearing on a date yet to be set.","Counterfeit drugs gang made up to £60,000-a-week selling fake medication .

"As many as 20 retired British soldiers could face being arrested for murder in connection with the Bloody Sunday shootings of 1972. Attempted murder and criminal injury charges could also be brought against the men, most of whom are now in their sixties and seventies. The soldiers face questioning under criminal caution for their involvement in the incident which killed 14 Catholic civil rights protestors in Londonderry, Ireland. An armed soldier attacks a protestor on Bloody Sunday when British Paratroopers shot dead 14 civilians on a civil rights march in Derry City . As many as 20 British Paratroopers could face murder charges for the deaths of Irish protestors on Bloody Sunday in 1972 . The development comes three years after a £200m inquiry by Lord Saville into the shootings produced its report based on 12 years of investigation. Its findings concluded that all those shot by paratroopers during the march in the Bogside area of Londonderry were unarmed, rendering their deaths 'unjustified and unjustifiable'. The judge added the army had lost control of the situation which is known as one of the most poignant incidents of the Troubles. Colonel Edward Loden commanded the unit involved in the Bloody Sunday shootings . The Ministry of Defence has started sourcing legal representatives on behalf of the soldiers, who have never been formally interviewed by police in relation to the shootings. Colonel Edward Loden, who commanded the unit involved in the attack, was killed earlier this year in Kenya. Loden was exonerated by the Saville Inquiry into the killings, which said that he did not realise his soldiers might be firing at people who did not pose a threat. A source close to the case told The Sunday Times: 'It is possible that some of the soldiers will be prosecuted', adding that action would be 'imminent'. The Police Service of Northern Ireland however said the case could take a little longer. A spokesman said: 'Preliminary work has begun into what will be a lengthy and complex investigation into the events of January 30, 1972. 'For the investigation to be as . comprehensive and effective as possible, police will be asking for . public support in the form of witnesses who gave evidence to the Saville . inquiry.' The representative also revealed detectives would be prohibited from including Saville testimony to pursue criminal charges. Fourteen unarmed protestors were murdered at the march which was held in the name of Catholic civil rights in Londonderry . A mural by by the Bogside Artists, in Bogside, Derry, pays homage to the protestors whose lives were taken by British paratroopers on Bloody Sunday . The soldiers gave anonymous evidence at the Saville Inquiry which cannot be used to pursue criminal charges . A Catholic priest prays above one of the shooting's victims on Bloody Sunday which killed 14 . The expensive Saville inquiry concluded that 26 British Army soldiers had opened fire although not all of their shots hit demonstrators. By-standers hover over one of the 13 men who were killed in the riot on January 30 1972 . Two soldiers, identified only as Lance Corporal F and Soldier G, may have shot as many as eight or 10 people between them, it suggested. Most of the soldiers involved are still alive though their identities have been protected to safeguard them from reprisals. They each gave anonymous evidence at the Saville inquiry, in the hope their testimony would help resolve the situation once and for all. The soldiers were given legal assurances their testimony would not later be used against them in pursuit of criminal activity. Their accounts relied on the defence they acted under 'yellow card' rules of engagement which permits soldiers to open fire if a legitimate threat to life is identified. Several of the men claimed they believed they were under fire, though the shots they heard were in fact echoes of those being fired near a block of flats by their colleagues. Thirteen were killed on January 30 after soldiers opened fire on the streets of Londonderry. A fourteenth protestor died as a result of injuries sustained on the same day.","Retired British Paratroopers will be questioned under criminal caution .

"A husband has told of his grief for his Jehovah's Witness wife who reportedly died after refusing a blood transfusion. Adeline Keh, 40, suffered a fatal infection after giving birth by Caesarean section to her son at Homerton Hospital in east London, her distraught husband Kwaku said. She was transferred to the Papworth heart and lung hospital in Cambridge, where she is said to have refused a blood transfusion and died a month after the birth. Distraught: Kwaku Keh (left) has told of his grief for his wife Adeline (right). The new mother, a Jehovah's Witness, reportedly died after refusing a blood transfusion when she developed an infection . Homerton chiefs have launched an independent review of the tragic case, which was one of four new mothers' deaths at the hospital in nine months. The inquest into Mrs Keh's death found her decision to refuse blood 'may have compromised the final medical intervention', according to a report in the Evening Standard. It was also listed as a cause of death alongside acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and an infection of the Caesarean wound. Mr Keh, a lawyer from Walthamstow, east London, told the Standard he was devastated that 'we never got to come home as a family'. Close: Lawyer Mr Keh told the Evening Standard he and his 40-year-old wife were 'best friends' He added: 'My wife and I were best friends... I was overjoyed and could not wait for them to come home. 'Each time I went to pick her up [from the Homerton] I was told that she could not come home. Eventually my wife lost her fight and passed away.' Jehovah's Witnesses refuse to accept blood transfusions because they say blood represents life, and only God is the giver of life. That belief has led to scores of controversies, many of which have ended up before judges. Last year an Australian cancer patient who was just four months from turning 18 lost a court bid to refuse blood because he was still underage. And in March an English High Court judge gave permission for a baby heart disease sufferer to undergo blood transfusions despite the objections of his parents. A specialist told Mr Justice Keehan the cardiac patient, just a few weeks old, had no 'long-term prospect of survival' without the procedure. Yet the religious movement insists it is 'totally unfounded' to say many Witnesses, including children, die each year after refusing blood. A statement added: 'Surgeons regularly perform such complex procedures as heart operations, orthopaedic surgery, and organ transplants without the use of blood transfusions. 'Patients, including children, who do not receive transfusions usually fare as well as or better than those who do accept transfusions. 'No one can say for certain that a patient will die because of refusing blood or will live because of accepting it.' Mrs Keh's case has prompted a review at Homerton Hospital because it was one of four deaths of new mothers in a nine-month period. 'Mrs Keh’s was a very sad case and our thoughts are with her family,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'Each case was different and there were no obvious similarities, and each was reported to the Coroner’s office for review as is routine in these circumstances. 'As well as being reviewed internally, two of the cases have also been the subject of review by the Care Quality Commission inspectors during their visit to the hospital earlier this year and nothing remiss was found. Reivew: NHS England is independently reviewing the circumstances which led to the death of Mrs Keh . 'We are now working with NHS England to seek a further independent review of the cases to see if any further lessons can be learnt. 'Over 6,000 babies are now born at Homerton Hospital. We are seeing more high risk mothers due to a number of factors including: the increase in women having babies who have other clinical complications or conditions; and the fact that high risk women are referred to Homerton as it has a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit.

"For those weekend camping trips where not have a mobile phone is unthinkable, there is finally a solution - a wood-powered stove that also recharges your phone. The CampStove can burn sticks, pine cones and biomass to generate enough heat and power to charge a phone, light, satnav or gadget that is USB chargeable - while toasting your marshmallows. The quirky invention from US manufacturers BioLite converts the heat from the fire to power a fan and produce an electric charge. Scroll down for video . The BioLite Stove can charge USB gadgets by burning wood (which can also be used for cooking) The BioLite CampStove can recharge any USB gadget, and can use wood or any biomass . They say it can provide enough power for a fully fired stove to cook a meal’s essentials when a device is on charge. Users in the US hailed its effectiveness during Hurricane Sandy when over six million people lost electricity with some able to carry on cooking and keeping electronics charged using the device. The stove’s powerpack slips inside the small 21cm by 12cm cooking chamber and is lit with a match or lighter, weighing in at 935g. It currently retails at £80 ($129) in the US and is set to be available in stores in the UK next summer. BioLite Chief Executive Jonathan Cedar said the firm had been overwhelmed at its popularity. New Yorkers try the gadget on the streets of Manhattan . New Yorker's used the gadget in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy . He said: 'We spent years developing the technology to offer a unique benefit to outdoor travellers to never have to carry fuel again. 'It is exciting to finally bring this product to market and we have been blown away by the enthusiastic response we’ve seen from our users. 'Surplus electricity can be used to charge small electronic devices, making it a true on demand energy source. 'The CampStove is a convenient and green choice, reducing an individual’s carbon footprint and keeping fuel canisters out of landfills by using twigs and other solid biomass instead of non-renewable petroleum gas.' A BioLoQuick spokesman said: 'Like a campfire, you can sit around the CampStove and watch the flames dance as you roast marshmallows and tell stories with friends. 'Half the planet cooks on open fires, leading to two million premature deaths each year and contributing to global warming. 'We’re using the same technology inside the CampStove to bring clean, safe energy access to families across the developing world.'

On Tuesday, Chamoun apologised, saying: 'The video and photos that you are now seeing are part of the making of the preparation. It wasn't supposed to go public. Scroll down for video . Apologised: Jackie Chamoun sits near the alpine ski course on Thursday February 13 after the photographs and video prompted outrage in her native Lebanon . Chamoun has apologised for the footage but it has prompted a social media campaign backing her for her choice and freedom . 'I want to apologise to all of you, I know that Lebanon is a conservative country and this is not the image that reflects our culture'. She said the footage that found its way onto the Internet was never supposed to surface. She has spoken about the video with photographer Hubertus Von Hohenlohe, the German prince and skier who is competing in his sixth Olympics for Mexico. She said he apologized. But the furore over the images has sparked a campaign around the world with people posting naked images of themselves along with the hashtag #stripforjackie. Despite Chamoun's apology, the video has already prompted a social media campaign with it's own hashtag #stripforjackie . The campaign wrote: 'Some women are beaten or killed, others are raped, and the media shifts their attention to a confident talented beautiful woman who represents her country at the Olympic games . The group added that the campaign was about telling 'peers' to set their priorities straight and fight censorship and campaign for freedom . The campaign, dubbed I Am Not Naked, already has more than 14,000 likes on Facebook. The quartet behind the campaign, Cynthia-Maria Aramouni, Mohamad Abdouni, Tarek Moukaddem and Carl Halal, wrote on the page: 'Some women are beaten or killed, others are raped, and the media shifts their attention to a confident talented beautiful woman who represents her country at the Olympic games. 'This is about telling our ""peers"" to set their priorities straight. 'This is to fight censorship.This is for freedom.' Risque: Topless pictures of Lebanese Olympic skier Jackie Chamoun have sparked calls for a ministerial inquiry after they were leaked online . Offensive: The photographs were taken for a calendar, but video footage of the shoot subsequently emerged online which left little to the imagination . The photographs show skier Jackie Chamoun . holding strategically-placed ski equipment to protect her modesty as she . poses in Lebanon's Faraya mountains . Mr Mouakkadem, who owns a local photograph studio in Lebanon, told the International Business Times: 'A lot of people are actually doing it at home. Four, five years ago we had a lot less censorship. This case, with the Olympic champion, is the final drop that has made it explode.' Chamoun herself on Thursday insisted that most people have been 'supporting me and defending me'. Youssef Chamel Khalil, the administrator of Lebanon's Olympic Alpine team, said ""there is no problem"" for Chamoun, and she will compete in the Sochi Games. 'It's OK. In Lebanon, there is a little bit another way to think,' Mr Khalil said. 'Lebanon is a country of so many cultures.' Chamoun, 22, is scheduled to race in the slalom Feb. 21. Topless pictures of a Lebanese Olympic skier competing at the Sochi Winter Olympics have prompted calls for a ministerial inquiry in Beirut after they were leaked online. The photos of Jackie Chamoun, which were taken for a calendar, show her holding strategically-placed ski equipment to protect her modesty as she poses in Lebanon's Faraya mountains. But video of the photoshoot and stills from the film, which leave little to the imagination, emerged online this week and were featured on Lebanese television, sparking a flood of complaints. Her apology did not placate everyone, with Lebanon's Youth and Sports Minister Faisal Karami calling on Tuesday for an investigation into the photos to ensure 'the protection of Lebanon's reputation.' Lebanon is considered among the most liberal countries in the Arab world, with women generally free to wear the skimpiest of attire, and alcohol widely available. But the society remains culturally conservative by western standards and Chamoun's photos touched off a small firestorm. The 22-year-old Chamoun is competing in her second Winter Olympics representing Lebanon at alpine skiing . Chamoun took to Facebook on Tuesday to publicly apologise for the video and stills, which she said showed the preparation for the photoshoot, rather than the final product. Banned: The head of Lebanon's Olympic delegation said Chamoun had been barred from speaking to the media.","Jackie Chamoun is shown holding strategically-placed ski equipment .

"New video evidence in the Bruce Jenner car crash incident could spell trouble for the transitioning reality star following the four-car incident that left one person dead and seven injured on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, earlier this month. An MTA bus traveling behind the Hummer involved is reported to have captured the entire incident on mounted cameras, evidence that is now in the hands of the police. The footage, which has been reconstructed, shows the 65-year-old former Olympian smash his Cadillac Escalade into the back of both the victim’s white Lexus and the Toyota Prius involved. Scroll down for video . New video evidence could spell trouble for Bruce Jenner, according to reports, following the four-car incident that left one person dead and seven injured on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu earlier this month . Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene: An MTA bus traveling behind the Hummer involved is reported to have captured the entire incident on mounted cameras, evidence that is now in the hands of the police . A white Lexus was pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead . Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ. Sources familiar with the video told TMZ that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius. If correct, the MTA video makes a more compelling case that Jenner was following too close, which opens the door to a possible vehicular manslaughter prosecution, claims TMZ. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works. According to previous reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works . The video shows Jenner rear-end the Lexus and when the Lexus clears his lane, his SUV keeps moving and crashes into the Prius . The MTA video is alleged to show that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius . The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which caused a chain reaction that resulted in the luxury sedan veering into oncoming traffic . An aerial view of the crash scene on February 7 shows the damaged cars, and police markings as they work to investigate the cause . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.' 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles. The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California. Bruce married Kris Jenner, pictured together,  in 1991, but their divorce is expected to be finalized next month .","New video evidence could spell trouble for Jenner following the four-car incident that left one person dead and seven injured  in Malibu .

"A man who cut off as much as 12 inches of his former girlfriend's hair has been ordered to shave his head for six months as punishment under a reciprocity law. Virginia man Melvin D. Hunt, 61, has agreed to the terms and must take a razor to his scalp by December 1. His attorney, Billy Shields, said that he didn't think there was anything terrible about the punishment. Scroll down for video . Virginia man Melvin D. Hunt, 61, has agreed to the terms and must take a razor to his scalp by Dec. 1 . 'There are a lot of fellows that go around with no hair,' he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. 'It was part of the deal and my client will abide by it.' Hunt is a former physical education coordinator for a private Chesterfield County school. He pleaded guilty in the September 12 attack on the unnamed former girlfriend. The woman agreed to meet Hunt in Elizabeth Davis Middle School where she works as a physical education and health teacher. He asked her for a hug, then once he was holding her pulled out a pair of scissors and sliced off the woman's ponytail. It wasn't until she saw the hair on the ground that she realized what he'd done. Hunt had met the victim at her school, asked her for a hug, then once he was holding her pulled out a pair of scissors and sliced off the woman's ponytail . Several of her fellow teachers have since cut their own hair in solidarity. Hunt has since resigned from his job at Riverside School. He is also being forced to attend anger management. 'It's akin to the cases where someone steals something from a store or damages or defaces somebody’s property, (and the court requires) they wear a sandwich board out in front and say, ‘Here I am, I did these things and I’m sorry,’' Chesterfield prosecutor Larry Hogan said. The victim has reportedly kept in touch with Hunt, who Hogan said was 'still very much in love with her.' Hunt has been banned from Davis Elementary School.","Virginia man Melvin D.

"Tuesday saw the unveiling of the latest in technological must-haves: the Apple Watch, a gadget targeted at the style conscious as well as the tech-savvy. Wearable tech is one of the biggest buzz terms in the fashion industry right now as firms rush to invest in reserach and developement that will keep them ahead of the curve. Early adopters of the techy trend include Rebecca Minkoff with her 'notification' bracelets and Tory Burch's designer excercise tracking bangle. And now Opening Ceremony are the latest to unveil their stylish digital device. Scroll down for video . Opening Ceremony have collaborated with Intel to create the MICA smart bracelet . The American fashion brand unveiled their smart bracelet as part of their SS15 show on 7th September at New York Fashion Week. The futuristic jewellery comes as part of a collaboration between the fashion brand and tech giants, Intel. The duo announced  their plans for the product back in January at the industry-leading CES conference in Las Vegas. The bracelet can perform functions such as alerting the wearer of meetings and SMS messages . The snake skin effect bangles are set with semi-precious stones and look like a stylish new season accessory but holds several communication functions. The MICA enables women to stay connected via SMS messages, meeting alerts, as well as general notifications delivered directly to the wrist, as well as wireless charging support. Additional features and functionalities are to be revealed at a later date and the product is expected to hit American stores around Christmas time. The bracelet comes as a result of the 'My Intelligent Communication Accessory,' project designed by Opening Ceremony, engineered by Intel. Golden touch: High-tech accessories, such as Tory Burch's Fitbit jewelry line are expected to dominate the spring trends at New York Fashion Week . High-tech high-fashion: Rebecca Minkoff is delving into wearable technology with the launch of two bracelets, including a notification bracelet that lights up when you receive a call or text from certain contacts . Apple unveiled its first wearable accessory to a high-profile crowd on Tuesday, and it met with mixed reactions.  Style queen Gwen Stefani - who flew in on private jet with Dr Dre for the launch - is yet to divulge her opinion. Targeting the style-conscious rather than tech-obsessed for the first time ever, the company is in brand new territory. But the Apple Watch is less of a risk and more an organic step into the next phase of Apple's development. They recently hired ex Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, YSL's CEO Paul Deneve and - crucially - Patrick Pruniaux, ex Tag Heuer. The gadget, which must be paired with an iPhone, debuts next year and prices start from £216 in the UK. It comes in three versions - sport, standard, and a luxury edition, with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated. The display is highly customisable and wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue. The Watch recognises voice commands and carries sensors that can track activity such as steps and heart rate. Style bible Vogue.com was complimentary in regards to its look. 'From a fashion point of view, the external aesthetic seemed neutral: neither super-stylish nor repellent. I would imagine that geeks would love it more than aesthetes,' writes Suzy Menkes. 'I suspect that I, as a non-digital specialist, would fail to use this device to its full capacity. But I like the idea of setting the visual aspects according to my mood. And perhaps my wardrobe. 'A bunch of violets to set off my purple outfits? Why not look at my watch - and dream.' Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was a little less convinced: 'It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design,' she said. 'The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly, essentially an amazing gadget.' Some fashionistas may prove reluctant to wear a smartwatch at all, said Sonny Vu, chief executive of Misfit Wearables, which makes an activity monitor that can be worn as a broach, on a necklace, or on a wrist band. 'Some female consumers are concerned about tan lines, for instance, and many might own a watch that has sentimental value', he said. Many of the fashion experts agreed that the most compelling wearables haven't hit the market yet.","The Apple Watch was unveiled Wednesday 11 September .

"Hard work: Jamie Oliver and his wife Jools. The celebrity chef employs more than 350 chefs in restaurants across the UK and abroad . Jamie Oliver has launched a withering attack on lazy young British workers, claiming that without his ‘tougher’ immigrant staff his restaurant empire would grind to  a halt. Having built up a £150million fortune and a reputation as one of the world’s most successful chefs, Oliver employs more than 350 chefs in restaurants across the UK and abroad, including Fifteen, which helps unemployed young adults get a start in the trade. But the 38-year-old celebrity chef, who worked his way up from the kitchen in his father’s Essex pub, has revealed his frustration at the lack of drive shown by work-shy Britons and that relying on them would force his restaurants to close. He said: ‘The average working hours in a week was 80 to 100 – that was really normal in my 20s. But the EU regulation now is 48 hours, which is half a week’s work for me. And they still whinge about it! ‘British kids particularly, I have never seen anything so wet behind the ears. I have mummies phoning up for 23-year-olds saying to me, “My son is too tired.” On a 48-hour-week! Are you having a laugh? ‘I think our European immigrant friends are much stronger, much tougher. If we didn’t have any, all of my restaurants would close tomorrow. There wouldn’t be any Brits to replace them.’ The father of four runs more than 30 UK branches of Jamie’s Italian restaurants, which he is expanding abroad, as well as Jamie Oliver’s Diner, Barbecoa and the Union Jacks chain, and claims he was working 15-hour days in his father’s pub by the time he was 13. He added: ‘It’s all very well when people are slagging off immigration, and I’m sure there are problems. And older people always complain about youth. The young will be better at different things, but long hours in hot kitchens is not one of them! ‘I was a bit of a workaholic. But I was brought up like that.’ The campaigning chef whose new TV . show, Jamie’s Money Saving Meals, starts next week, sparked more . controversy this week after claiming he found it ‘hard to talk about . modern-day poverty’, citing poor families who fork out on giant . televisions and expensive ready meals instead of cooking cheap but . healthy food from scratch. The . chef, who has also fought to improve standards in school dinners, said: . ‘I’m not judgemental, but I’ve spent a lot of time in poor communities . and I find it quite hard to talk about modern-day poverty. ‘You . might remember that scene in [his previous TV series] Ministry Of Food, . with the mum and the kid eating chips and cheese out of Styrofoam . containers, and behind them is a massive f***ing TV. It just didn’t . weigh up.’ Oliver with trainee chefs his Fifteen restaurant at Watergate Bay in Cornwall, which helps unemployed young adults get a start in the trade. He says European immigrants are 'tougher, much stronger' Oliver’s comments came in a joint interview with fellow TV cook Mary Berry. Speaking about his admiration for The Great British Bake Off judge, he said: ‘Mary has always done it very naturally. Our job essentially is to be a Tom Tom or sat-nav of a recipe. You want people to get there in the safest way and with guaranteed pleasure.’ He also claimed in the interview that he has not ruled out having a fifth child with his wife, 38-year-old Jools, saying: ‘Jools would love another baby. I don’t know if I can handle it, but she is the boss. Whatever she wants, she will get.’ He added: ‘I love her to bits. She is amazing and the best mum in the world. She is fit, she has willpower and never drinks any alcohol. I have tried to get her drunk so many times!’ The interview is published in the October issue of Good Housekeeping, on sale on September 5.","Celebrity chef calls European immigrants 'much stronger, much tougher'

"A shipwrecked fisherman who miraculously survived in the Pacific Ocean by clinging to a foam icebox for two days has revealed how he was just minutes from drowning when he was rescued. Father-of-five Salazar Solano was plucked from the water in a 'terrible' state by the Colombian Navy some 20 miles off the coast  after his small fishing boat capsized. He spent the two freezing nights clutching the cover of a Styrofoam drinks cooler after deciding not to take lifejackets apparently because they were deemed too expensive and unnecessary. Speaking to MailOnline while recovering at home in his fishing village of Bocagrande, Mr Solano says his entire body aches and still feels seasick, but is thrilled to be alive. 'I was about to die,' he said. 'I couldn't hold out any longer.' Scroll down for video . Miraculous: Fisherman Salazar Solano shows his injuries to his arms and body after surviving for two days in the Pacific Ocean by clinging to a Styrofoam ice box until the Colombian Navy plucked him from the water . Lesson learned: Mr Solano spent two days clutching the cover of a drinks cooler which he used to store red snapper after he decided not to take lifejackets apparently because they were too expensive . The 47-year-old and a friend, Tomás Contreras, set sail from the town of Lopez in the south of the country on Friday, October 31, but came into difficulties in stormy conditions. By 1am on Saturday, Mr Solano and Mr Contreras hauled up their nets and filled the ice box with red snapper. But then the 22ft-long fibreglass boat began filling with water due to high waves and, possibly, a leak. The two men tried to bail out the water, but it came in even faster and the boat sagged to one side. They tried to jerry-rig a sail out of a tarp to catch the wind and right the boat, but it was too late. Mr Solano had bothered to take a lifejacket because he felt he was a very good swimmer. Alexis Bonilla, another fisherman from Bocagrande, also said hardly anyone in the village owns a lifejacket because they are expensive and – when all goes well - unnecessary. Instead, Mr Solano grabbed the cover of the Styrofoam ice box, broke in in two, gave one piece to Mr Contreras and clung to the other. Incredible: Video footage released by the Colombian Navy captures the exact moment sailors spotted Mr Solano floating in the open ocean tied to the buoyant icebox . The sailors  manoeuvred their warship towards Mr Salazar before a diver jumped overboard to save him . He also removed his belt and, with a flashlight, fashioned himself a headlamp. Then the boat went down. At that time, they were only a few miles off the coast but, in the dark, they couldn't get their bearings to swim in the right direction. By sunrise on Saturday, they realised they were going the wrong way. 'The current kept taking us farther out to sea,' Solano said. 'We could no longer see the shore. We were both swimming and both getting tired.' The Colombian Navy has an emergency telephone line for such cases. Its vessels are constantly patrolling the Pacific coast often in search of drug traffickers who move cocaine to Central America and Mexico in fast boats and even homemade submarines. This coastal region is remote and nearly road-less thus people get around on ferries, speed boats and canoes. Incident: Mr Solano, 47, and a friend set sail from the town of Lopez in the south of the country on Friday, but two days later strong winds caused their vessel to overturn 21 miles from the coast . Lucky: Mr Solano was rushed back to short and taken to hospital, but despite his near-death ordeal, was found to be suffering from nothing but dehydration. He is expected to make a full recovery . When motors break down or vessels run aground, the Navy is often called in to pick up marooned passengers. But Mr Solano and Mr Contreras had told family members that they expected to return home late Sunday, so no-one in Bocagrande thought to call the Navy's rescue line. By Sunday morning, with Mr Contreras growing weaker, the two men drifted apart and Mr Solano lost track of his fishing partner. Now 22 nautical miles off shore, he prepared for the end. 'My life was nothing,' Mr Solano said. 'What mattered to me was my family'. By sheer coincidence, the Colombian Navy's ARC Nariño corvette was at that moment plowing through the sea nearby. Just before midday, the ship's spotters, who are on deck 24 hours a day, in part, to avoid accidents with tiny fishing boats, spied something suspicious floating in the water. Solano saw the Naval vessel and started yelling. 'The ship was not on a mission to look for him,' says Lt. José Dominguez, a Navy press officer. 'It was out patrolling, doing normal operations like looking for drug boats. It was almost a miracle that we found him.' Incredible video footage released by the Colombian Navy captures the exact moment sailors spotted Mr Solano floating in the open ocean. Miraculous: Salazar Solano, 47, survived two nights in the open ocean by clinging to a Styrofoam icebox . Sailors tossed him a flotation device, but by that point he was too weak to swim for it. A Navy diver jumped in to help the bedraggled castaway who was still grasping the ice box cover. Clad in a T-shirt, green short and his homemade headlamp, the exhausted survivor was hoisted aboard on a stretcher. 'He was in terrible condition,' said Captain Orlando Cubillos, the ship's commander. 'We got there just in time.' Solano was taken to a Navy hospital and treated for dehydration and sunburn. Then, he caught a boat back to Bocagrande where villagers had no idea he'd almost died. It was a bittersweet homecoming because Contreras is still missing. Solano, who is taking antibiotics, remains weak but is expected to recover. 'Fishing is his life,' said Lt. Dominguez, of the by-the-book Navy, who frowns at Solano's disregard for safety but marvels at his resourcefulness. 'He is a sea wolf.' Solano's story has captivated Colombia where maritime lore is rife with miraculous tales of survival. The most famous incident involved the sinking of a Navy ship overloaded with contraband and its sole survivor, a sailor who climbed aboard a life raft then fought off thirst, sharks and the blazing sun for the next 10 days. Published in 1955 in daily newspaper installments, 'The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor' was written by an aspiring Colombian novelist named Gabriel García Márquez.","Father-of-five Salazar Solano gives dramatic account of ordeal to MailOnline .

"A student has created a tiny working camera out of a Lego brick. Graphic design student Ryan Howerter, 21, made a fully functional pinhole camera, which creates tiny photographic prints, housed in the space of the small toy block. The Lego fan's tiny camera takes minuscule black and white photographs measuring 0.16 square inches (one square centimetre square). The camera is seen here in Ryan Howerter's hand. The graphic design student created the working pinhole camera out of a single Lego brick . Mr Howerter, a student at Colorado State University, said: 'You can make a pinhole camera out of nearly anything. 'I love Lego - you can do so much with it.' A pinhole camera is a camera without a lens. It has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light. When . you point the camera at an object, light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted . image on the film along the opposite side of the box. This technique is similar to how eyes see and process images. The smaller the hole, the sharper the image, yet the dimmer it will appear. A pinhole camera's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card, for example. The Lego camera works by exposing a sheet of photographic paper to light from a tiny pinprick. Light comes in the side and strikes the photographic film, creating an image. The paper can then be developed in exactly the same way as a full-size photograph. The camera, which can be held by a Lego figure, is made of a black two-by-two lego brick, a sheet of brass with a hole in the middle, and is sealed using black tape. Mr Howerter said: 'The pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it.' 'The hardest part about building it is removing the central supporting column inside the brick - you have to use a dremel [tool] to get it out. 'I usually expose the pinhole for around ten seconds to get the images.' Mr Howerter was inspired by a working pinhole camera made from a pine nut. His Lego creation only took 20 minutes to build. Here a Lego man is seen with the Lego camera and pictures taken with it. Ryan Howerter from Colorado State University made the tiny camera in just 20 minutes . 'The pictures are a little bit fuzzy but people are impressed by it,'  said Ryan Howerter.

"A charity has been criticised for hiring two former soldiers to mount a 24-hour guard over a stag to stop him being shot by hunters. The mature stag, called Red, is well-known in Somerset's Quantock Hills where the League Against Cruel Sports has bought up land to make 'safe havens' from hunts. But the campaign group is paying £15 an hour for a 24-hour guard after claiming local hunters have tried to force the mature animal into areas where they are allowed shoot it. Scroll down for video . Close protection: Two former soldiers have been hired to stand guard over this stag, called Red, in Somerset's Quantock Hills after fears hunters are trying to scare him onto land where they can legally shoot him . The Countryside Alliance has criticised the move, which it says advertises the stag's location to poachers. The Quantock Stag hunt has denied targeting the animal. A spokesman for the League Against Cruel Sports said: 'We think hunt supporters tried to force him off one of our sanctuaries. 'We have been forced to hire security experts this year. They are ex-soldiers from a private security firm and they are looking after him.' Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the group, added: 'We own sporting rights and sanctuaries to provide safe havens for wildlife away from hunts so that animals can come and go as they please. 'Putting the lives of the animals residing there in danger will not be tolerated, which is why we took the decision to employ extra protection for Red. 'The lengths these people will go to in order to kill an animal is astounding. No animal should have to suffer at the hands of these people and we are absolutely determined and resolute in our efforts to protect the wildlife they are so determined to kill.' Safe: Red has taken up residence on land bought by campaigners to create 'safe havens' from hunting . Stag hunts permitted under the Hunting Act 2004 are designed to control deer numbers by taking out older stags which would otherwise breed with their own offspring. The deer population on the West Country hills has reportedly steadily declined from around 1,000 before the rules were introduced, to around 500 now - a number which pro-hunters claim is better for the population. A meeting of the Quantock Deer Forum - a team who carry out an annual deer count - heard last week that anti-hunt campaigner bought the land where Red roams and sold it to a 'sympathetic buyer' but still retain the hunting rights. Members are now understood to be paying at least two guards £15 an hour each to keep up a vigil at the site. Worthwhile? The Countryside Alliance has criticised the move, which it says advertises the stag's location to poachers. Meanwhile, local hunters the Quantock Stag hunt has denied targeting the animal . Pro-hunt group Countryside Alliance questioned the logic of the League's tactics. Spokeswoman Charlotte Cooper said: 'It seems singularly crazy for the LACS to highlight the whereabouts of this stag, which they claim to be so concerned about, to every poacher in the area. 'I do not know how much it will cost the charity for their team of former soldiers to give the stag a round-the-clock bodyguard for the remainder of the shooting season but questions should be asked as to whether this is a suitable use of donations. 'It also seems highly questionable for the League to claim to take so much care over one deer when conditions at their Baronsdown Sanctuary got so bad a few years ago that over a 12-month period 107 deer were found either dead or dying of starvation or disease.' Nick Gibbons of the Quantock Staghounds has denied the group are planning to target Red since last year.","Countryside Alliance says sending in the guards will lead poachers to stag .

He then threatened to rob them and brandished a handgun that he had tucked in the waistband of his pants. The victim tried to restrain the suspect and was shot, police said. One student who ran to help the victim told NBC: 'I applied the pressure on his wound. I put both my hands right on his hip. 'Also some kid who was an EMT took out a sweatshirt and covered him up and then the officer showed up and carried him out.' Police were still hunting for the gunman today. He was described as African-American, 5'8'-5'9', slim and around 35-40 years old. He was wearing blue jeans, a red hoodie, and red beanie hat and had no facial hair. MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Temple University on Monday.

"Paul Haggis spoke about how he was trolled online by Scientologists after he very publicly renounced the organisation in 2009, describing it as a cult . Oscar-winning film director and former Scientologist Paul Haggis has described how followers of the controversial religion uses the internet to attack people and 'ruin their careers'. In an interview with The Telegraph, 61-year-old Haggis spoke about how he was trolled online by Scientologists after he very publicly renounced the organisation in 2009. 'I know what they do online,' he said. 'I've seen them attack others under false names, try to discredit them, ruin their careers. 'And I've heard about these two people who work in the basement of Special Affairs there and they're just online all day at their computers, going on to various blogs, commenting on people's lives and things they do.' The filmmaker, who is the only person ever to have won the Oscar for best picture two years in a row, said the trolling has forced him to ignore what is written online about his films. Speaking to The Telegraph's Hermione Hoby, Haggis pointed out that Wikipedia had banned Scientologists from commenting. 'So when people comment on me or my films, yes there's a part of me that goes, 'Well that could be absolutely valid or that could be a Scientologist,' he said. Haggis' filmography includes 2004's Million Dollar Baby, Casino Royale and crime drama Crash, as well as his upcoming romantic thriller Third Person. But he has almost become more famous for his explosive parting with the Church of Scientology after 35 years - subsequently denouncing it as a 'cult', and openly discussing the organisation in a 2011 interview with The New Yorker. His resignation letter, which was leaked to the press, denounced the church's support for Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. According to reports, he said that he could no longer remain part 'of an organisation where gay-bashing was tolerated'. The Church of Scientology - which counts Hollywood actors Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley among its members - was founded by the science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1953. The religion, which is based around the idea that humans are ‘immortal beings’ who have forgotten their true nature, has been at the centre of a number of controversies. It has often been branded a cult although church leaders have repeatedly denied it brainwashes adherents. Scroll down for video . A Church of Scientology building in Florida. The religion - which counts Hollywood actors Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley among its members - was founded by science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard in 1953 . Haggis told The New Yorker that a few days after sending his resignation letter, he returned home from work to find nine or ten church members standing in his front garden. In the days that followed, more members and various officials visited his office, distracting his colleagues and becoming 'more livid and irrational' as he refused to change his mind. But Haggis told The Telegraph that he doesn't feel it took courage to leave the notoriously secretive organisation and he has no regrets about leaving Scientology when he did. Haggis' filmography includes 2004's Clint Eastwood-directed Million Dollar Baby (pictured) starring Hilary Swank, Casino Royale and crime drama Crash, as well as his upcoming romantic thriller Third Person . He added: 'Except waiting so long. Being so stupid for so long. But it's really insidious. ‘I was always an outsider and if it can affect me that much – a cynic and a loner and an outsider – go figure! You have to be really purposefully blind, you have to choose to be blind, and that’s what I was doing and that’s what all my friends were doing.’ The church of Scientology did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment.","Filmmaker says church uses internet to attack people and 'ruin their careers'

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that Australian special forces are moving into Iraq, two months after they were deployed to the Middle East. In a meeting with US President Barack Obama in Beijing Mr Abbott told Mr Obama that as hurdles with the Iraqi Government had been dealt with Australia can begin an 'advise and assist' mission. The US president said that the fight against Islamic State militants has progressed into new territory and he needs nations like Australian on his side, News.com.au reported. The decision comes on the back of an announcement by the US to send 1500 more troops into the area. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) told US President Barack Obama Australian special forces would be moving into Iraq . The pair had a one-on-one meeting at the APEC summit in Beijing, China, on Monday . The discussion took place as part of a long one-on-one meeting at the APEC summit between the two leaders, and Mr Obama told reporters after the meeting the campaign in the Middle East had shifted to building up Iraqi security forces, rather than fighting IS. 'As we are setting that up, I am having conversations with Australia and other coalition partners that are already committed to putting trainers in to see how they can supplement and work with us in this overall effort,' he said. Mr Abbott responded to the President's comments saying it was crucial that coalition forces take a strong stance, before branding IS a menace to the world. 'It is important to respond strongly, which is what the US-led coalition is doing,' the Prime Minister said. Mr Abbott told Mr Obama that as hurdles with the Iraqi Government had been dealt with Australia can begin an 'advise and assist' mission . Mr Obama said the fight against IS militants had moved into a new territory and the focus would be on building up Iraqi security forces . But he would not confirm whether more troops would be deployed, but instead said that the priority was getting special forces into Baghdad. SBS reported that the special forces will be armed, but will only be allowed to use their weapons in self-defence. Pictures taken after the meeting when the pair addressed the media show the leaders sharing a joke, laughing as the sit against the backdrop of their respective nation's flags. The upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane and regional trade were also on the table in the meeting between Mr Abbott and Mr Obama. Mr Abbott is in Beijing for the APEC summit, and will meet with other leaders before returning to Australia for the G20 summit in Brisbane . The Prime Minister was greeted by a young girl handing him flowers when he stepped off the plane . In the coming days Mr Abbott will briefly cross paths with Russian President Vladimir Putin and is expected to have 'very robust' talks with the leader about the MH17 tragedy. 'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday. 'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott told US President Barack Obama that Australian special forces would be moving into Iraq .

"A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War is to wed the soldier who battled to save his life. Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorks, was devastated when her sibling, Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. She found comfort in Liam Fisher, 22, also a private in 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, who was a friend of her brothers and tried valiantly to save his life. Brought together by tragedy: Rosie-Ann Stone met fiance Liam Fisher after he tried to save the life of her brother in Afghanistan . He was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. However, Gregg had been hit by a bullet in the neck which severed his main artery and he died of his wounds at the scene. Describing the moment Gregg was killed, Liam said: 'In training, you're told to win the firefight before you tend to the wounded. 'No - you get to the person first. It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything. 'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, ""It's 5m for me and you"". Then the rounds came flying.' Rosie-Ann, 22, met Liam at Gregg's inquest, which was held in Hull in May last year. Killed in action: Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban . They stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages and soon realised they wanted to be more than just friends. They arranged their first date in the seaside resort Bridlington in August last year. Rosie-Ann, 22, said: 'When we got together, people were sceptical. People thought, ""Is she just looking for comfort?"" or ""is she just looking for a replacement brother?"" 'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine. 'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different. He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.' Now the couple plan to marry in York Minster as the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has granted a special marriage licence after hearing of Liam's bravery. Rosie-Ann said she feels Gregg would have been happy about her tying the knot with his comrade. She said: 'Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. 'Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.' More loss: Rosie-Ann pictured when she was younger with Gregg, left, and her sister, Jennie, right, who lost her life in a car crash in 2013 . Liam added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.' Gregg's widow, Sam, will be a bridesmaid at the couple's wedding next March, while his daughter, Grace, who was born six months after he died, will be a flower girl. The couple's engagement has delighted Rosie-Ann’s parents, Bob and Angie. Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel.' Angie said: 'We feel we have gained a son.' The wedding will finally give the Stone family a chance to have a happy celebration as in February last year, they were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe. Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court. Rosie-Ann said she couldn't have gotten through the ordeal without her fiance's support. Happy day: The bride-to-be said her wedding to Liam will be special even though her siblings won't be there . She said: 'A lot of people ran a mile at what was the most difficult period of my life. I told Liam, ""You don't have to put up with it."" His response, was, ""Put up with what?""' Liam said he is honoured to be joining the Stone family. 'They're amazing and I love them,' he said. 'Nothing can stop them.' Rosie-Ann said said their wedding day will be a joyous occasion even though her brother and sister will be absent. She said: 'My dad will be buzzing when he's walking me down that aisle. I'll be wearing high heels, but Dad is quite short. I'll have to bend down so he can lift my veil! 'We're not going to be miserable, because the people who'd kick us the most would be Gregg and Jennie.'","Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead by Taliban in 2012 .

"When The Killing first burst onto British TV screens in 2011, few expected it to be a hit. But despite low expectations, a hit it proved and so a cult classic was born. Now one of the stars of season two, Carsten Bjørnlund, 41, is back with another Danish drama and it promises to be just as tense (and heavy on the stylish knitwear) as its predecessors. Starring Bjørnlund and Trine Dyrholm - an actress dubbed Denmark's answer to Helen Mirren - as two of four warring siblings, The Legacy takes an uncomfortably close look at the dynamics of a defiantly dysfunctional family. Denmark's Helen Mirren: Trine Dyrholm, 42, stars in new Scandinavian thriller, The Legacy . While it might sound like a relatively simple concept, in true Scandinavian style, the plot has more twists and turns than a labyrinth plus enough red herrings to feed the population of Denmark for a year. 'It's a story about secrets, lies, tension and love,' explains Bjørnlund. 'Everyone can relate to being a brother or a sister or a daughter and all of those perspectives are covered in the show. It makes it very easy to connect with the characters along the way.' Not that the majority of us would want to connect with any of the by turns angry, manipulative and dark characters in real life. Bjørnlund's is Frederik Grønnegaard, the estranged son of matriarch Veronika and a man who manages to combine a semi-detached character with not always well hidden anger. Starring role: Carsten Bjørnlund (far left) will be familiar to fans of The Killing and plays Frederik . Familiar face: Dyrholm starred alongside Pierce Brosnan in 2012's Love Is All You Need . Other family members include Signe, the daughter given up for adoption who becomes the sole beneficiary of Veronika's will - and thus the target of everyone else's anger - and Frederik's sister Gro - played by Denmark's answer to Helen Mirren, Dyrholm. 'I really love this character because she's really complex and she's not likeable all the time,' explains the 42-year-old of her art-loving character. 'I like that you have space and room to get all the nuances. I like that none of the characters deserve sympathy but in other ways, they all do.' Dyrholm is no stranger to a complex family saga, having earned plaudits for her deft handling of the role of Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in the fiendishly complex royal romance, A Royal Affair, in 2012. More recently, she has starred in a series of tense thrillers, among them The Legacy, but also creepy German indie flick, Who Am I – No System Is Safe. All this has led to her being compared to the UK's own Helen Mirren; a comparison which she says - 20 year age gap between her and Mirren notwithstanding - is something she delights in. 'Well, I don't mind that title,' she chuckles. 'I'm a big fan of hers so its an honour to be compared to her. Tense: Her latest role is as art-loving Gro Grønnegaard who is devastated by the death of her mother . Tense: Gro is infuriated to discover that her mother has left the family home to a hitherto unknown sibling . 'I'm just interested in good work and I started out when I was pretty young and I've been privileged to work on some brilliant films and I try to challenge and develop myself. I see Helen Mirren as someone to work towards.' That she has had so much good work is testament, in part, to the Danish love of a strong female lead along the lines of Lund and Nyborg - something that Dyrholm is grateful for. 'We have long had a tradition for complex and interesting female parts,' she smiles. 'All the characters in Danish dramas tend to be quite complex. 'I'm aware, though, that we're standing on the shoulders of all the other series that have been popular in Denmark and abroad. 'If it hadn't been for Sarah Lund and Brigitte Nyborg, we wouldn't be able to move on to do all the things that we do.' And no one knows that better than Bjørnlund, whose fledgling career got a shot in the arm when he landed the part of Christian Søgaard, a soldier intent on appropriating his junior colleague's wife, in the second series of The Killing. Popular: The Killing became a huge hit in the UK and elsewhere when it was released in 2011 . Hit: According to makers DR, The Legacy was even more popular in Denmark than The Killing and Borgen . Fascinating: Bjørnlund says Britons find Danish life exotic - hence the success of Danish TV series . 'I wasn't in London when The Killing came out, so it was only when we made the Legacy that I realised how much people loved it,' he says, pleased. 'I think it's good that we, as a small country, can produce dramas that so many people around the world love. I'm proud of that. 'I think Denmark is having a golden age for drama,' he adds. 'I don't want to jinx anything but it would be a shame not to admit that - as long as it lasts anyway!' But while it was The Killing that made his name, Bjørnlund wants The Legacy to do even better - and hopes what he describes as a British 'fascination' with all things Danish will propel it forward. 'I think Denmark seems exotic to people from the UK,' he explains. 'Even though our lives seem similar, there are slight differences that make it exotic for you.' There are more than slight differences between British (and most Danish) families and the one portrayed in The Legacy though. Bjørnlund doesn't think so and says there are even similarities between the dysfunctional Grønnegaards and his own family. 'It differs in many ways but there are problems,' he admits. 'Of course there are!' From the Christiansborg Palace (Borgen) to Politigården (Police Headquarters, The Killing), the success of Danish drama has provided a shot in the arm for the Danish tourist industry. 'Danish films and TV series certainly help to brand Denmark internationally and attract visitors to Denmark,' explains Visit Denmark's Kathrine Lind Gustavussen. 'Britain is now the biggest non-Scandinavian market for visitors to Copenhagen and across the whole of Denmark, tourists from the UK booked 40.3 per cent more overnight stays in 2013 than in 2009. 'According to VisitDenmark's Brand Survey 2014, 20 per cent of Britons now associate Denmark with movies and TV series.' Popular though locations made famous by Borgen and The Killing are, The Legacy has more than a few lovely stop-offs of its own, not least the Thorvaldsens Museum (thorvaldsensmuseum.dk) where Gro spills a glass of champagne during a particularly frustrating moment. Other top spots associated with the new show include the pretty Svendborg Harbour, the glamorous Den Frie art gallery (denfrie.dk) where Gro works and her Islands Brugge apartment which is even available to rent via Stay Copenhagen. 'The so-called Nordic Noir wave has painted a somewhat gloomy picture of the Danes,' adds Gustavussen, who is keen to prove that the Danes aren't quite as glum as The Legacy would have you believe. 'Visitors who want to immerse themselves in Denmark's gritty ambience might be disappointed but hopefully they will leave with a more romantic, happy and colourful impression of the country.' Not if Dyrholm and Bjørnlund get their way.","Veteran actress Trine Dyrholm stars  in new Danish thriller, The Legacy .

"Nearly two million Catalans voted in favour of splitting from Spain in a symbolic referendum held on Sunday. Supporters hope that the result, which has so far seen 80 per cent vote in favour of an independent Catalonia, will see a binding ballot on the issue. However, only 40 per cent of eligible voters have turned up to vote, which could in part explain the high number of pro-independence votes. Separate state: Pro-independence people hold a Catalan independence flag after a symbolic vote on independence for Catalonia from Spain saw 80 per cent vote in favour . Around 2.23million out of 5.4million potential voters have so far cast their ballot in the informal referendum, a number which may increase as the vote will formally remain open for another two weeks. In the booth, Catalans are being asked two questions: whether they wanted Catalonia to be a state and whether this state should become independent from Spain. While the vote will formally remain open for another two weeks, the regional government said on Monday 80.7 percent had until now answered 'yes' to the two questions, with 10.1 percent voting 'yes' and 'no' and 4.5 percent voting a double 'no'. 'We have earned the right to a referendum,' the regional government head Artur Mas told cheering supporters. He deemed the vote a historic success, setting the stage for a full referendum. 'Once again Catalonia has shown that it wants to rule itself.' Despite the strong support for independence in the poll, only 40 per cent of eligible voters turned up to vote . More time: Around 2.23million out of 5.4million potential voters have so far cast their ballot in the informal referendum, which will remain open for another two weeks . Volunteers count votes in a symbolic independence vote in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, near Barcelona . Pro-independence demonstrators of Catalonia raise their regional flags to support an informal vote . Rafael Catala, Spain's Justice Minister, accused Mas of organizing 'an act of pure political propaganda with no democratic validity. A sterile and useless event.' He said the government might take further legal measures against the vote. Polls show that the majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million inhabitants want an official vote on independence while around half support breaking centuries-old ties with Spain. There was a festive atmosphere as hundreds lined up in front of another school in Barcelona, with some wearing pro-independence regalia. 'I voted for independence because I've always felt very Catalan,' said Nuria Silvestre, a 44-year-old teacher. 'Maybe I wasn't so radical before, but the fact that they are prohibiting (the vote) from Madrid has made me.' Catalan TV showed similar lines of voters across the region. In response to the informal vote, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy urged the region to return to 'sanity' and for talks 'within the legal framework of the constitution'. He said the vote would be 'neither a referendum nor a consultation nor anything of the sort'. He added: 'What is certain is that it will not have any effect.. More than one million people queued up to cast their vote in the informal poll in north-eastern Spain . Demonstrators hold a Spanish flag as they protest on Madrid's Plaza de Catalunia for unity of the Spanish state . Voters in Barcelona wait in the rain to vote in the non-binding poll on the independence of Catalonia from Spain . A man poses with his ballot at a polling station on whether Catalonia should break away from the rest of Spain . Spanish unionists hold Spanish flags and banners during a protest against independence in Madrid . Spanish state prosecutors have announced they will open an investigation to determine if by holding the informal vote in defiance of the court's suspension the Catalan government has broken the law. Catalonia has seen rallies of hundreds of thousands of pro-independence supporters for the past three years. It is a wealthy region of 7.5 million people and contributes more to the Spanish economy than it gets back through central government funds. Economic and cultural grievances have fuelled Catalan nationalism. Catalonia's push for independence comes two months after Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom. Mr Mas said after the defeat of the 'Yes' campaign: 'This is a powerful and strong message that the UK is sending to the entire world - that if there is such a conflict elsewhere in the world, you have the right way to try to resolve these differences,' 'So it is not a setback, it is a very positive message for us and should be for the central institutions in Madrid.'","More than 80 per cent vote yes to independence in  non-binding poll .

"The foundations of a huge Anglo-Saxon feasting hall, the first to be discovered in more than 30 years, has been found below a village green in Kent. The hall, where a king and his warriors would have enjoyed epic days-long feasts, has laid just inches underground for 1,300 years. A team from the University of Reading working with villagers and local archaeologists made the exceptional discovery in Lyminge, Kent. At 69 feet by 28 feet, the hall would have been an impressive structure with room for at least 60 people. Excavation site: An aerial view of the foundations of a Anglo-Saxon feasting hall found below a village green in Lyminge, Kent . Animals bones which were found buried in pits near the edge of the hall signal the many extravagant feasts held at the biggest hall for miles around, before it was abandoned and later destroyed. A piece of gilded horse harness was also found among the foundations which has helped archaeologists date the site to the late sixth or early seventh century. Jewellery, bone combs and a well preserved manicure set consisting of three small bronze rods strung onto a piece of wire were also found. Dr Gabor Thomas, director of the Lyminge excavations, told The Guardian: ‘The horse harness decoration is very significant. Horse harness mount: This high-status gilt copper-alloy decorative mount would probably have been attached to a bridle or harness for a horse, dating it to c.525-575 AD. This finding supports the view of pre-Christian culture in this period being based on a warrior society, with horses at forefront of this ideal . Grooming set: Sets consisted of three bronze tools attached to a wire ring. They often have scrapers for nails, 'ear scoops' for the age-old ear wax problem, and tweezers . Triangular bone combs: Two triangular composite bone combs were found. They are made of three pieces of bone riveted together, the central piece being the carefully sawed teeth . Animal skulls: Animals bones which were found buried in pits near the edge of the hall signal the many extravagant feasts held at the hall . ‘It's not just a wonderful find, but . evidence of the status of the people who used this site. The ability to . own and upkeep a horse was the mark of the warrior aristocracy.’ Dr Thomas mentions Beowulf, the most famous of all surviving Anglo-Saxon poems, is set in the late fifth century and describes the eponymous hero coming to a hall such as the one most recently discovered. He said: ‘This would undoubtedly have been the scene of many Beowulfy type activities, great assemblies for feasts that lasted for days, much drinking and story-telling, rich gifts like arm rings being presented, all of that. ‘There could have been no more visible sign of wealth and status than raising a hall like this. ‘This is before centralised tax collecting and coinage, too early for royal palaces as such. ‘To keep control you had to keep on . the move, stopping at significant places, literally feeding off the . land, off the rich food offerings that would be brought everywhere the . king arrived.’ Feasting: Beowulf, the most famous of Anglo-Saxon poems, describes the eponymous hero coming to a hall such as the one discovered . Tanya Gold, Daily Mail journalist, dresses as a 6th-century woman at Anglo Saxon settlement of West Stow, in Suffolk (file picture) Dr Thomas believes that the hall foundations indicate the last of the ancient pagan rituals. The timber from the structure is long gone but archaeologists found the outline of the building by post holes and plank gaps for the wood to be laid horizontally to create the walls. The team came to Lyminge last summer and searched the site which had been open land for almost 1,000 years. Ground penetrating radar suggested there were some structures underground but nothing quite as big as what they found. There is evidence that the hall was damaged, if not destroyed, by fire which was a common fate for wooden buildings centered on an open hearth. Dr Thomas said he believes the hall was abandoned deliberately as the Anglo-Saxons of that tribe, along with many others, turned to Christianity. The settlement at the site was also abandoned and a new village settled on a hill nearby a new church. Previous excavations in the village, just a few miles from the Eurotunnel terminal, including in the church graveyard have revealed thousands of years of habitation in the area. The graveyard was founded in AD633 and is said to be the original burial place of St Ethelburga. At 69 feet by 28 feet, the hall would have been an impressive structure . with room for at least 60 people. Pictured here is the cricket field in . Lyminge, Kent . Dr Andrew Richardson, an Anglo-Saxon specialist from the Canterbury Archeological Trust, described the discovery as a 'fantastic achievement and a major find for understanding the kingdom of Kent.' He told the MailOnline: 'It is a very rare find. In Kent we have found lots of cemeteries and rich burials but have been much less successful at finding where people lived. Although little farms have been found this discovery of one of the major halls is incredible.' Dr Richardson explained how after the collapse of Roman Britain in the fifth century, Kent quickly established itself as a sophisticated independent kingdom which made the most of its location by tapping into trade networks. 'This hall would have been used for high-status feasting full of wealthy and sophisticated people,' said Dr Richardson. The archaeologists plan to return next summer. Mr Thomas said: 'There’s more of this story.’","The foundations were found under a village green at Lyminge, Kent .

"She is known as the 'zoo lady' to neighbours and friends. And with 70 animals ranging from cats to raccoons living in her bungalow, Jordan Ryan appears to be living up to her nickname. The animal lover shares her home with 20 snakes and 10 lizards, as well as three dogs and a cat. All but the rabbits and alpaca live inside the Carmarthenshire home she shares with her boyfriend and the pair have had to organise set play times for their growing collection of animals, so none get eaten or attacked. Miss Ryan, 24, started collecting the animals seven years ago. Jordan Ryan (left) has 70 animals living with her and partner Dean Fletcher at their Carmarthenshire bungalow . Miss Ryan, 24, has earned the nickname the zoo lady because of her large collection of animals at her home . But but her collection got even larger when she started to work as a veterinary nurse. Eventually her mother asked her to move into the flat next door after she grew uneasy with the increasing number of snakes beneath her bed. She said: 'I have always been obsessed with pets and animals - even as a kid I was bringing snakes and lizards home and hiding them under my bed. 'Most of my animals now are rescue animals and they're all well cared for. The couple have turned their home into a zoo, with snakes and lizards inhabiting rooms inside their bungalow . Mr Fletcher (left) says he would like a lemur to add to the collection, while the alpacas (right) live outside . The couple have started opening their home to hold charity events so people can see their collection of animals . Three alpacas live on land outside the property, along with rabbits and ferrets who live outside the bungalow . 'We have set times when each of them are allowed out for play time to make sure nobody gets eaten.' Miss Ryan then moved in with her boyfriend, Dean Fletcher, 27, three years later and the pair are thinking of expanding their collection to include lemurs and meerkats. She added: 'We started with a few snakes and ferrets and it grew from there. Miss Ryan started collecting snakes, and now has 20 living in the house, along with a raccoon and a hedgehog . Miss Ryan has three dogs and her and her partner (right) have to organise playtimes to keep the animals safe . A tarantula is one of the animals that has a home in the couple's bungalow alongside lizards and snakes . 'Most of the animals live in the house. We just keep them wherever there's space. I have a room especially for snakes. 'We live in a bungalow with an acre of land. The alpacas, rabbits and ferrets are outside, but everything else is in with us. 'The alpacas will stick their heads through the door and if they're feeling brave they'll steal your toast but that's as far as they get inside.' 3 alpaca . 1 coatimundi . 1 raccoon . 1 Hedgehog . 10 ferrets . 20 snakes . 10 lizards . 4 rabbits, . 3 frogs . 2 tarantula . 2 millipedes . 3 dogs . 1 cat . 4 terrapins . 6 fish . She admits she has earned the nickname Zoo Lady and some friends have put of visiting her home in Gorslas because of their fear of snakes. Local children now also visit her home animals and Miss Ryan has started doing events for charity. Miss Ryan is now at Cardiff University training to be an operating department practitioner, working during surgery at hospital. Miss Ryan added: 'Dean wants to get a lemur, that's how we ended up with the raccoons. 'You need a license for a lemur but not for a raccoon so it was a compromise. 'Next we're thinking about meerkats and after that we'll look at a lemur.'","Jordan Ryan started her collection 7 years ago, hiding snakes under her bed .

"A BBC programme due to be aired last night which promised to unmask 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood was shelved at the eleventh hour after a last minute submission by his lawyer. The corporation had intended to broadcast Panorama, Fake Sheikh: Exposed at 8.30pm following the Court of Appeal's decision today to allow producers to broadcast recent images of the undercover reporter. But shortly before the programme was scheduled to air, Mr Mahmood's lawyers submitted new information relating to one of the cases it included. Mr Mahmood's lawyers had previously lost a High Court challenge to prevent his image from being broadcast. A BBC programme which promised to unmask 'Fake Sheikh' Mazher Mahmood and set to be aired last night was shelved at the eleventh hour after a last minute submission by his lawyer . The investigative journalist had launched a last minute challenge against a High Court judge's refusal on Friday to grant him an injunction over tonight's screening, claiming his human rights would be jeopardised. He claimed that revealing his current appearance would exacerbate the existing risk to his safety caused by his investigative work and would impact upon his family life. But, Lord Justice Elias and Lady Justice Sharp refused him permission to appeal, saying he had not shown any error in Sir David Eady's ruling. A Panorama programme examining his methods was due to be shown on BBC1 last night at 8.30pm. But despite the outcome in court, the BBC instead decided to show a Panorama episode investigating the disappearance of Blackpool schoolgirl Charlene Downes. BBC head of news James Harding said: 'This is a seriously good piece of work, extremely revealing and squarely in the public interest. But the worst of all worlds is when you get the big picture right, and trip up over a detail. 'So when some information we'd been asking to see for many days was sent to us by Mazher Mahmood's lawyers at seven o'clock last night, we, as a responsible broadcaster, had to consider it. 'We're looking at it, and we'll make sense of it as quickly as we can, and then we'll broadcast it.' It is believed BBC bosses are keen to air the programme as soon as the legal issue has been resolved, meaning it could be screened later this week. It was reported this morning that the corporation had been chasing Mr Mahmood's lawyers over information for a number of days before the programme was due to air. The investigative reporter was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July . A  BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC had intended to broadcast Panorama, Fake Sheikh: Exposed tonight following the Court of Appeal's decision earlier today to allow the BBC to broadcast images of Mazher Mahmood. 'Shortly before transmission Mr Mahmood's lawyers submitted new information relating to one of the cases in the programme which, as a responsible broadcaster, the BBC needs to evaluate. Once this has been done we will broadcast Fake Sheikh: Exposed, including recent footage of Mr Mahmood, as planned.' Mr Mahmood later said: 'I hope the BBC will see sense and postpone any broadcast until the conclusion of any proceedings. 'I hope then that they will review and consider the evidence properly (and not threaten broadcast without the full facts) and stop the broadcast. This may be a vain hope. They are determined to condemn me whatever the truth. 'In the meantime, if they do go ahead, I would ask anyone interested to keep an open mind on any allegations they do indeed make.' The reporter's elaborate stings led to the exposure of dozens of people, from hapless royals to hardened criminals while he worked for the now defunct News of the World. Mr Mahmood was the key prosecution witness against former N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos, but the case collapsed in July when judge Alistair McCreath told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that there were 'strong grounds' to believe that Mr Mahmood had lied on the witness stand and 'had been manipulating the evidence'. Mr Mahmood, who denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged, is currently suspended by The Sun and a number of cases in which he was set to be a witness have been dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service while investigations continue. Last week, Mr Mahmood's counsel Adam Speker told the High Court judge that showing his current appearance in a broadcast which was likely to be watched by millions was intrusive and not in the public interest. Because of his work, threats had been made to Mr Mahmood, who lived a reclusive life in secure accommodation with 24-hour surveillance and where his neighbours did not know his real identity, he said. The programme, was described by Mr Mahmood's counsel, Justin Rushbrooke QC as a 'hatchet job', . Mr Mahmood was behind the sting on Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt (left) and Mohammed Asif (right), who were later convicted of match fixing . The injunction he sought would have covered any images taken since April 5 2006 not already in the public domain. Mr Mahmood had been filmed in shadow during an appearance on the Andrew Marr show in 2008, photos in a memoir he had written were not sufficient to identify him and various courts, including the Leveson inquiry, had taken steps to conceal his physical identity. Manuel Barca QC, for the BBC, said that Mr Mahmood's identity was no secret and that the case was not about any fears for his safety but about protecting his livelihood and the shelf life of his professional stock-in-trade. He said the public interest was self-evident, not least in the context of the Contostavlos trial. The judge ruled that Mr Mahmood had not discharged the heavy burden of proof under the Articles of the Human Rights Act upon which he relied. In a trailer for tonight's Panorama, the BBC said it would broadcast interviews with some of Mr Mahmood's highest profile targets and the men who helped him expose them. They allege that the Fake Sheikh was the real crook, using sophisticated entrapment and even creating crimes and fabricating evidence. In 2011, Mahmood exposed the Pakistan cricket . cheats whose fixing scandal rocked the sport. His . trademark disguise was born in 1984 when he was sent to expose a vice . ring operating out of a hotel near the Birmingham National Exhibition . Centre. He decided to pose as a wealthy young Arab looking to buy a Ferrari. With . a huge gold Rolex on his wrist and a deferential entourage of hired . hands surrounding him, the 'King of the Stings' found he could get . access to pretty much any well-known individual. In . 2005, Princess Michael of Kent was exposed by the Fake Sheikh making . some startling comments about fellow royals. She described the late . Princess Diana as a 'nasty'  woman and said Prince Charles had merely . married a 'womb'. But his career has featured some high-profile failures. In 2002, he claimed to have uncovered a plot to kidnap . Victoria Beckham and her sons and ransom them for £5million. Five men . were arrested. But the case collapsed as the main witness, a Kosovan . asylum seeker, was deemed unreliable and had been paid £10,000 for the . story. In 2006, he clashed with George Galloway, who claimed the reporter attempted to trap him by posing as an Islamic businessman. The Respect MP responded by circulating photos on the internet Mahmood - threatening his anonymity - after the journalist failed in his bid to ban their . publication.","Programme about the journalist is due to be shown on BBC1 last night .

"A little girl has gone from foster care to fairy tales as she lives out her fantasies through her dressing up box. Alice Lewis', 10 from Atlanta, Georgia, dreams became a reality after she was adopted by a photography couple who have encouraged their daughter's penchant for dressing up. Alice has assumed the identity of Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz and Joan of Arc, thanks to her photographer mum and cosplay, a performance art which uses costumes and fashion accessories. Scroll down for video . Alice Lewis was adopted by photography couple Kelly and James who encouraged their daughter to live out her fantasies through the dressing up box . For years Alice played make-believe while she dreamed of having her own happily ever after with a family, which she found, aged 7, when she was adopted by James and Kelly Lewis. The mother and daughter began cosplaying almost immediately with the pair first dressing up just two weeks after Alice moved in with her new parents. Kelly and Alice were shopping when the young girl spotted a Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz dress and her mum asked if she wanted to buy the outfit and pose for a photo shoot in character. Alice has transformed herself into many cosplay characters including Joan of Arc, pictured . Kelly Lewis is a professional photographer so was already equipped with lots of props for the photoshoots, here Alice is transformed into the animated character Coraline . Kelly says that Cosplay helps Alice to cope with her past . It wasn't just her appearance that Alice wanted to change. With her new life the 10-year-old decided to reinvent herself by changing both her first and last name after joining the family in July 2012. Originally named Destiny by her birth mother, Alice thought long and hard about a new name. Kelly, 33, explains that choosing a new name was not a decision that Alice took lightly. 'Once we had an adoption hearing scheduled Alice started practicing her new last name. She then asked us if she could have a new first name as well. The ten-year-old was originally called 'Destiny' by her birth mother but decided to change her name once she was adopted . Alice renamed herself after the character form the Lewis Carroll story at the age of 7 . Alice opted for the fairy tale  name as she saw some of herself in the character . This image of Alice was taken in the courthouse where she was adopted . The 10-year-old took part in the Alice in Wonderland shoot for her 8th birthday . 'We spent weeks of sifting through the names of various Disney princesses before Alice decided that she wanted to be Alice, after Lewis Carroll's beloved character. 'Alice asked to take on my middle name, as I was now her mother forever, and so she became Alice Elizabeth Lewis.' Alice says that she finally settled on the storybook name as she saw some of herself in that character. Kelly (left) often takes part in the photo shoots with her daughter . Here the pair dress as Morticia and Wednesday Adams from The Adams Family . 'I love the character of Alice because she's curious and clumsy. I like it when she is asking herself questions while she's falling down the rabbit hole.' In celebration of her new name, Alice dressed up as Alice in Wonderland and enjoyed a cosplay photo shoot for her 8th birthday on November 8th 2012. 'We both really enjoy buying the little dresses and props from thrift shops for our shoots.' Says Kelly. The mother and daughter enjoy going shopping together for fancy dress costumes, here she dresses as Marie Antoinette . Kelly says that Wonder Woman was Alice's favourite shoot as she was able to wear a wig and do the superhero pose . 'We took the Alice in Wonderland shots in several locations over a few days. 'The photographs of Alice in the room with the checkerboard floor were actually shot in the courthouse where she was adopted.' Kelly added that she believes that Alice's love of dressing up has enabled her to overcome her painful past. 'Alice is a very imaginative child. Playing make-believe is how she coped with all of the abuse, neglect, and rejection she's lived through. Alice's family are very open about her adoption and hope that their story will inspire others . Alice as India Stoker from the film Stoker with her mother Kelly behind the camera . 'Cosplaying gives her a creative outlet to express herself and be whoever she wants to be. It's her dream to become an actress.' Since the Alice in Wonderland adventure, the mother and daughter have enjoyed many other cosplay photo shoots, where Alice has posed as a variety of characters, including Marie Antoinette, Edward Scissorhands,  and Wonder Woman, which was a particular highlight for the 10-year-old. 'Wonder Woman was Alice's favourite cosplay because she got to wear a wig and do the superhero pose' says her mother. Alice makes a convincing Edward Scissorhands in this cosplay transformation . Alice is transformed into a dark Little Miss Muffet (left) and Carrie White from the Stephen King novel Carrie . As photography was a part of Kelly's life before Alice arrived, she already owns plenty of props and outfits that come in handy when cosplaying. Kelly says that she hopes that Alice's story will help other couples who are thinking about adopting. 'We're very open about Alice's adoption and she's proud of it. 'If one person is inspired to adopt a child after reading or hearing about Alice's story then it's worth every negative comment from people who don't understand.' Kelly added that Alice herself is also hopeful that her story will encourage others to adopt. 'Alice is very passionate about kids in foster care. She independently started writing and illustrating her adoption story because she wants kids to know how great adoption can be.'","Alice Lewis was adopted by photography couple Kelly and James in 2012 .

"Social network LinkedIn faces a class-action lawsuit over a premium search feature on the website, in which an applicant's co-workers from their work history are identified and may be approached. The lawsuit, Sweet v. LinkedIn, alleges 'Reference Search' prevented employment opportunities for plaintiffs Tracee Sweet, Lisa Jaramillo, James Ralston and Tiffany Thomas, The New York Times reported. 'A reference search locates people in your network who can provide reliable feedback about a job candidate or business prospect,' Linkedin says on its website. 'You'll see a list of people who have worked at the same company during the same time period as the member you'd like to learn more about.' Lawsuit: LinkedIn is facing a class-action lawsuit over its Reference Search feature . The plaintiffs' lawsuit alleges that 'LinkedIn members are not notified by LinkedIn (or anyone else) when potential employers run a Reference Report on them. 'Indeed the only parties that have information concerning the running of a Reference Report on a LinkedIn member are LinkedIn and individual or entity that pulls the Reference Report.' They then allege, 'As such, any potential employer can anonymously dig into the employment history of any LinkedIn member, and make hiring and firing decisions based upon the information they gather, without the knowledge of the member, and without any safeguards in place as to the accuracy of the information that the potential employer has obtained.' 'Such secrecy in dealing in consumer information directly contradicts the express purposes of the FCRA, which was enacted to promote accuracy, fairness, and the privacy of personal information assembled by credit reporting agencies,' they continue. The plaintiffs, who say in the suit they are seeking damages and a trial by jury, are being represented by Tom M. Friedman and James L. Davidson. Davidson told The Times 'You may never know you did not get the job based on one of these so-called references.' Meanwhile, LinkedIn spokesman Joseph Roualdes told The Times the lawsuit is without merit and that LinkedIn is serious about users' privacy. He told the newspaper 'A reference search, which is only available to premium account holders, simply lets a searcher locate people in their network who have worked at the same company during the same time period as a member they would like to learn more about. A reference search does not reveal any of that member’s nonpublic information.' Davidson said in an email sent to MailOnline Monday morning that no additional comments are being made right now. Roualdes said in the emailed statement sent to MailOnline morning 'We take member privacy very seriously. We believe that the legal claims in the recently-filed lawsuit are without merit, and we intend to fight it vigorously. LinkedIn helps people find their dream jobs, and jobs find the right people. 'A reference search, which is only available to premium account holders, simply lets a searcher locate people in their network who have worked at the same company during the same time period as a member they would like to learn more about.

"Drinking plenty of water would usually be seen as a healthy habit – and many of us could probably do with upping our daily intake. But for one young mother it is an addiction which drives her to down a staggering 44 pints a day. Sasha Kennedy, 26, carries large bottles of water with her wherever she goes and rarely sleeps for more than an hour a night without waking for a drink. She is forced to go to the toilet up . to 40 times every day and has even quit jobs over the lack of quality . water in her workplaces, she says. Yesterday, Miss Kennedy, from . Southend-on-Sea, Essex, revealed she consumes 5.5 gallons of water over . 24 hours. You drink how much? Sasha Kennedy with a selection of bottles of her favourite tipple . Though her daily water intake far . exceeds the maximum 3.5 pints recommended by experts, she says she has . been checked by doctors and has no health problems as a result. Psychogenic . polydipsia is an uncommon clinical disorder characterized by excessive . water-drinking in the absence of a physiologic stimulus to drink. It is commonly, although not always, encountered in patients with psychiatric disorders. Complications . can include incontinence as well as renal and congestive heart failure. Patients can also suffer from potentially fatal water intoxication when . the balance of electrolytes in the brain is disrupted. The diagnosis is one of exclusion. Management includes fluid restriction along with behavioural therapy and certain drugs. Miss Kennedy said: ‘If I feel my . mouth start to get dry I have to get my next fix of water – it’s all I . can focus on. People never really think anyone can drink that much until . they get to know me – then they just cannot believe their eyes. ‘I feel thirsty pretty much all the time and always have to be sipping water – it’s an addictive habit. ‘The most sleep I’ve ever had is about one hour and 15 minutes, because I am getting up to drink or nip to the loo.’ Miss Kennedy, who is a full-time . mother to Reggie, two, and Fraser, one, developed her habit when she was . just two years old. She began nagging her parents for more water, which . prompted them to take her to the doctors. But medical experts confirmed there was nothing wrong with her. By the age of six she drank so much water that her mother started leaving a jug of water by her bed each night. Glass half full: The young mother-of-two drinks 25 litres of water a day, the equivalent of 100 glasses . Drinking up: The mother-of-two - who claims she has no health problems - even wakes up several times a night to sip water and go to the toilet . She started taking a bottle of water . to school each day and would stay close to the water fountain at break . time while the other children went out to play. By 13 she was already drinking up to 26 pints each day. ‘By that stage my parents had got rid . of the jug by my bed at night and replaced it with a five-litre (nine . pint) plastic container,’ she said. ‘When I was 16 and left school I started work in a shoe shop stockroom and everyone began to notice how much I drank. They ended up moving the water cooler next to my desk.’ Miss Kennedy quit her next job, at a carpet firm in Dartford, Kent, because the quality of their tap water was not good enough. By her early 20s she was downing 35 . pints a day and her addiction peaked when she began working from home . for a telecoms company in 2007. She now drinks between 31 and 44 pints . each day. Experts yesterday said Miss Kennedy’s . condition was rare, with the average adult drinking little more than . 200ml of water per day. Dr Emma Derbyshire, a nutrition . consultant, said: ‘Over-hydrating with any fluid is possible and in . extreme cases it can be dangerous, but this is very rare.’","Sasha Kennedy downs almost six gallons during a 24-hour period .

"Sexting - the art of sending your partner a racy message - might not be a new phenomenon but it is becoming increasingly popular. What's more, if a new survey is to be believed, it's no longer confined to teenagers with 38 per cent of British adults confessing to sending saucy text messages to their other halves. Of those, 40 per cent come from London, making the capital the raciest place in the nations - on their phones at least. Something to hide? 39 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men say they have peeked at a partner's phone . Caught out: Politician Anthony Weiner and presenter Vernon Kay have both been embroiled in sexting scandals . Inspiration: Mad About You by Sinead Moriarty, £7.99, is published by Penguin . But while the capital's phones are buzzing with naughty messages, those living in Dorset, Devon, Somerset and Cornwall prefer a more direct approach and were the least likely to send a naughty missive. The increasing popularity of sexting does have its pitfalls however, with 24 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men polled saying they suspect their partners of cheating on them. As a result, 39 per cent of women and 26 per cent of men confess to regularly checking their partner's phones for extracurricular sext messages. The results of the poll, which canvassed the views of 1,000 people in relationships, were released to coincide with the launch of Mad About You, a new novel by author Sinead Moriarty. Billed as a ‘marriage thriller,’ Mad About You tells the story of Emma, who moves to London with her husband, James, and young children. Things take a turn for the worse when a new nanny is employed and James begins to spend increasing amounts of time in the office. While the arrival of the new nanny throws Emma's love life into disarray, there is some good news for those thinking of hiring an au pair. Although sexting contributes to marital strife, according to researchers, 62 per cent of women and 73 per cent of men would have . no trouble trusting their partner with a young and attractive . nanny. Like Vernon Kay, who famously incurred the wrath of wife Tess Daly after a sexting scandal in 2010, it seems it might be safer to step away from the phone.","38 per cent of British adults say they regularly send racy text messages .

"Daniel Laurikietis, 32, has been barred from teaching for life after performing a sex act on a teenager . A drama teacher has been banned from the classroom for life after plying a teenager with alcohol and performing a sex act on her. Daniel Laurikietis, 32, began contacting the girl through Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and text messaging when she was just 15. After speaking to her Laurikietis, who taught at Haslingden High School in Rossendale, Lancashire, discovered the teenager had mental health issues. But instead of referring the issues to someone who was fully qualified, he tried to help her himself, a disciplinary panel said. Around three years after the contact began, in March 2013, he invited her to his home where they drank together and he performed a sex act on her, the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard. A Professional Conduct Panel found his actions amounted to 'unacceptable professional conduct, that is misconduct of a serious nature that falls significantly short of the standard of behaviour expected of a teacher'. The former teacher admitted all the allegations and that he was guilty of 'conduct of a dishonest and sexually motivated nature'. He had already been warned by the school about 'inappropriate contact with students' by creating an alias Twitter profile six months before the incident with the girl, referred to as Pupil A. The panel did not specify the age of the girl when the incident took place. NCTL panel chairman Nicolé Jackson told him: 'You have extensively abused your position of trust in relation to a vulnerable pupil with a history of self-harm. 'You exploited that position of trust for your own purposes. You failed to treat Pupil A with dignity and mutual respect. 'Your conduct amounted to a blatant disregard to the need to safeguard Pupil A's well-being. 'Her well-being was affected and put at risk. 'You ignored the policies and practices of the school at which you were employed, despite an earlier warning.' Bosses: The 32-year-old resigned from Haslingden High School in Rossendale, Lancashire, after the incident . The panel recommended that Mr Laurikietis should be banned from the profession for life. Accepting the recommendation, Alan Meyrick - decision-maker on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education Nicky Morgan - said Mr Laurikietis' conduct was 'particularly serious'. He added: 'It involved a wholly inappropriate relationship with a vulnerable student that culminated in the consumption of alcohol and sexual activity. 'Whilst he has acknowledged his mistakes he has shown little regard for the effect his behaviour had on the pupil concerned. 'In all the circumstances I agree that the order should be without provision for an application to apply for it to be set aside. 'This means that Mr Daniel Laurikietis is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. 'Furthermore, in view of the seriousness of the allegations found proved against him, I have decided that Mr Daniel Laurikietis shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.' The panel banned Laurikietis (above) from teaching in any English school, sixth form or children's home . The former teacher now describes himself as a self-employed actor, teacher, director and 'Semi-Professional Geek' on Twitter. He posted mostly about sci-fi films including Star Wars and Star Trek alongside comic book characters, and occasional posts ranging from the theatre industry to singers Morissey and Kanye West. One supporter on the site claimed he was still a 'top teacher' despite admitting the allegations. Mark Jackson, headteacher at Haslingden High, said: 'Mr Laurikietis had already resigned from his post when these allegations came to light. 'However, we followed the correct procedure and the case was fully investigated and appropriately dealt with in his absence. 'We then referred the matter both to the Disclosure and Barring Service and the National College for Teaching and Leadership.'","Daniel Laurikietis, 32, began contacting the girl when she was 15 years old .

"It has become as much of a festive staple as turkey and tinsel – but now Do They Know It’s Christmas? is getting a very modern update. Three decades since their charity single first topped the charts, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure relaunched Band Aid yesterday. And while time may have taken its toll on both of them, they proved they have lost none of their youthful passion as they vowed to raise millions for victims of the ebola crisis in West Africa. The pair are enlisting the help of a string of youthful acts – sprinkled with a few veteran singers – to record a new version of the song which raised £8million for famine victims in Ethiopia in 1984. Scroll down for videos . All for a good cause: One Direction have joined the line-up for the latest version of Band Aid 30, which will record Do They Know It's Christmas? for the fourth time in three decades . Joining the fun: Coldplay's Chris Martin and U2's Bono are also getting involved in the remake of the song . Announcing the Band Aid 30 project, Sir Bob, 63, joked he still feels ‘ineffably glamorous and sexy’ with his shock of white hair and husky Irish drawl. Ure, 61, jokingly conceded: ‘We are old. There is no doubt about it. One of us has too much of a hair quota.’ Already expected to go to No 1, the track will be recorded on Saturday and will be available to download from Monday for 99p. A physical copy of the single, with artwork by Tracey Emin, will follow, costing £4. But in a sign of the changing times, Sir Bob said the CDs will not be available for another three weeks because many of the factories that produce them have closed. It is the fourth time the song has been recorded, but the stars are enlisting a roster of new talent, many of whom are too young to remember the first Band Aid. Contributors will include singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, 23, Jessie Ware, 30, Paloma Faith, 33, Ellie Goulding and Emily Sandé, both 27, and boyband One Direction, none of whom is older than 22. Inspired: Bob Geldof and Midge Ure (left) were inspired to re-record the song because of the 'phenomenal bravery of the National Health doctors and nurses who volunteered to go out there' All the big names: Ed Sheeran has signed up and revealed Chris Martin was responsible for getting him involved . Representing the old guard is U2 frontman Bono, 54, who has appeared in two of the three previous Band Aid recordings, and Coldplay singer Chris Martin, 37, who took part in 2004. Sir Bob said that the lyrics of the track had to be updated because the new appeal is not designed to combat hunger. However, he said that as in the Ethiopian famine, the root cause of the ebola crisis is poverty, adding: ‘That is radically unacceptable.’ He conceded raising money would be harder because some will try to listen to the track for free on the internet. But he said: ‘It really doesn’t matter if you hate the artists. It really doesn’t matter if it turns out to be a lousy recording. What you have to do is buy this thing.’ Adele will also perform on the track which will raise money to fight the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa . Hoping for success: Sam Smith will be hoping to surpass the original version, a response to the famine which was causing a huge death toll in Ethiopia, which was released in 1984 and sold 3.7million copies . Have faith: Paloma faith will join the likes of George Michael, Sting and One Direction on the charity single . Irish singer Sinead O'Connor will perform on the single, which will be recorded on Saturday . 30 years ago: Bono (left), Paul McCartney (centre) and Freddy Mercury from Queen (right) took part in Live Aid concerts in 1985 - a year after the first Band Aid . From left are George Michael of Wham,  Bob Geldolf, Bono of U2, Freddie Mercury of Queen, Andrew Ridgley of Wham! and Howard Jones, who performed at the Wembley concert . Band Aid was first put together in 1984 when Boomtown Rats frontman Bob Geldof and singer-songwriter Midge Ure brought the greatest bands of the time together to record a charity single. Geldof had been so moved by the famine in Ethiopia that he decided to ring around contacts he had made in the music industry. Artists including the likes of Bono, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney, Queen, Bananarama and George Michael met at a studio in Notting Hill, London, where they were given 24 hours to produce the record. More than 70,000 people filled Wembley for the all-day concert which raised millions for those suffering in the famine in Ethiopia . The musicians worked around the clock, with Boy George flown in by Concorde to record his lines, eventually putting together Do They Know It's Christmas?. The single topped the charts and sold 3million copies, spending five weeks at number one. In 1985, the Live Aid concerts were held at Wembley and at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The the two concerts ran for a total of 16 hours as nearly 2billion people tuned in worldwide to watch the event. Artists who were not on the original 1984 track, such as The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Madonna took part in the concerts, which raised £150million for the Ethiopian famine. A second version of Do They Know It's Christmas? was released in 1989, with new artists such as Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue and Cliff Richard. The single reached number one again, where it remained for three weeks. In 2004, 15 years later, Sir Bob announced that Band Aid would reform to raise money for the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan. Bono, Paul McCartney and George Michael were the only artists from the original recording to sign up for the single, which shot to number one, where it stayed for four weeks including Christmas. Bono and co., were joined by the Sugababes, Robbie Williams, Will Young, Chris Martin and dozens more. Sir Bob's last Band Aid outing was in 2005, when Live 8 saw musicians collaborate to pressure world leaders to give more aid to African nations . Dizzee Rascal was the only person to add lyrics to the track with a rap section which he improvised on the day of the recording. In 2005, ten concerts were held worldwide for Live 8 - intended to put pressure on the heads of state of G8 group of nations, who were meeting in Scotland, to pledge more money to tackle hunger in Africa. After the concerts, which included most of the artists on the 2004 track, the G8 pledged to double aid to some African nations to $50million a year. This week Bob Geldof announced Band Aid would return to raise money to fight the deadly Ebola virus, which has killed thousands in western Africa. The single will be recorded on Saturday, November 15 and released on Monday, November 17. One Direction . Adele . Ed Sheeran . Sinead O'Connor . Ellie Goulding . Alt-J . Olly Murs . Bastille .

"Loss: Prominent preacher Myles Munroe was among nine people killed in a plane crash Sunday in The Bahamas . Severe weather was likely a factor in the small plane crash that killed nine people, including a prominent Christian minister and his wife, on approach to the island of Grand Bahama, the foreign minister said Monday. Heavy rain was buffeting the region when the Lear 36 Executive Jet struck a shipping container crane in Freeport as it tried to land, Foreign Minister Fred Mitchell said. Mitchell said that a commercial Bahamasair flight making the same route, from Nassau to Freeport, had turned back because it was unable to land around the same time as the flight carrying the Rev. Myles Munroe and several members of his Bahamas Faith Ministries. Civil aviation authorities launched an investigation on Monday. The death of Munroe, one of the most prominent pastors in predominantly Christian Bahamas, stunned the country. 'It is utterly impossible to measure the magnitude of Dr. Munroe's loss to the Bahamas and to the world,' Prime Minister Perry Christie said. 'He was indisputably one of the most globally recognizable religious figures our nation has ever produced.' Born in 1954 in the islands' capital of Nassau, Munroe founded Bahamas Faith Ministries International in the early 1980s after studying at Oral Roberts University, a Christian liberal arts school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Preacher and his wife: Dr Myles Munroe and his wife Ruth were killed in a plane crash in Grand Bahama. The plane crashed while making an approach for landing at Grand Bahama International Airport . Wreckage: The crash took place on Sunday afternoon and killed all nine people on board the private jet. The plane  struck a crane at the Grand Bahama Ship Yard, exploding on impact and crashing into the ground near a junkyard area . Stunned: The Department of Civil Aviation reported that the plane was a Lear 36 executive jet which departed the Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA) for the Grand Bahama International Airport . Life's work: Monroe, 60, was president and founder of Bahamas Faith Ministries International and was traveling to Grand Bahamas to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum . In shock Tearful mourners gathered at Bahamas Faith Ministries last night soon after they learned that Dr Myles Munroe died in a plane crash on Grand Bahama with eight others yesterday . The charismatic pastor quickly became an influential religious leader among many evangelical Christians, giving sermons around the world and occasionally appearing on televangelist Benny Hinn's popular programs. He was also a motivational speaker and the author of numerous books, including the 2008 best-seller 'God's Big Idea: Reclaiming God's Original Purpose for Your Life.' As news of the plane crash spread, members of his church were shown weeping on a Bahamas TV station or raising their hands in prayer. Fellow Christian pastors expressed shock. 'At times like these, I don't try to figure things out, I just know that all things ultimately figure into a larger and higher purpose that we may never fully understand in this present limited reality,' Bishop Carlton Pearson, a high-profile U.S. minister who was a friend of Munroe's for 40 years, wrote on his Facebook page. Well-known: Dr. Myles Munroe, a prominent pastor, and his wife, Ruth, were among those killed in the crash. Munroe was the founder of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship which has extended from the shores of the Bahamas to Africa and Asia . Personality: Dr Munroe is a well-known author and motivational speaker who visited various African countries. Tough conditions: Heavy rain was buffeting the region when the Lear 36 Executive Jet struck a shipping container crane in Freeport on landing . Munroe, 60, and his entourage were traveling to Grand Bahama to attend the 2014 Global Leadership Forum that he organized. He planned to have dinner in Freeport about 90 minutes after his plane's scheduling landing with former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young, a speaker at the event, Mitchell said. Munroe's wife, Ruth, was also on the plane, along with the pastor considered second-in-command at Bahamas Faith Ministries, Richard Pinder, as well as the group's youth minister and his wife and child. Munroe, who grew up poor in the Bahamas, was considered an inspiration for many people in the island chain and abroad, the foreign minister said. 'He has really put his name on the world stage and helped the Bahamas achieve recognition for talent,' the foreign minister said. 'He was a leader in our country,' said Christopher Duncan. 'He spoke at a number of national events. I've read some of his books. Just the way he viewed life and the way he understood God's purpose for our lives made you look at life a different way.' 'Dr. Munroe was a spiritual fiber of our country,' added Monique Dorsett, who lives in the Bahamas but is vacationing in Miami. 'He epitomized Christianity and the way he lived. He was international .'

"Tom Daley has opened up about his gay relationship for the first time, admitting that it was him who made the first move with his boyfriend. While the 19-year-old Olympic diver did not confirm the identity of his beau, rumoured to be American screenwriter, Dustin Lance Black, he said during the interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that it was 'love at first sight'. But Tom also revealed that making the decision to come out and reveal his sexuality was 'terrifying'. Love at first sight: Tom Daley tells Jonathan Ross that he knew his boyfriend was the one when he first saw him . Speaking about his new love, Tom said: 'I’d never felt like anything like it . before. We were at a party and I hadn’t even spoken to him all night. I . didn’t know what to do or if he was gay at first.' But though the young sportsman may have been slightly unsure of himself, that didn't stop him from making his intentions clear with the object of his affection. Dating? Dustin Lance Black and Tom were spotted together in LA back in October . He said: 'I typed ""call me"" in his notes with a smiley face on this phone and the next day he texted. He makes me feel safe and happy, right now I couldn’t be happier.' On the ITV show - that will be aired on Saturday 7th December - Tom said: 'I’d never felt the feeling of love, it happened so quickly, I was completely overwhelmed by it to the point I can’t get him out of my head all the time. I’ve never had it before where I love someone and they love me just as much.' Neither Tom nor Milk screenwriter Dustin have confirmed or denied their union, but The . Sun newspaper reports that they met at London's Soho Hotel in the . springtime. Later in October this year, Tom and . Dustin were spotted grabbing coffee together from a cafe in Los Angeles, . where the Oscar-winning writer lives. Asked why he hasn't identified his beau, Tom said: 'At the moment, I wouldn’t like anything to change. 'I hope it doesn’t get ruined by the media attention, everyone has been so supportive and I hope it continues that way.' Tom also revealed that he didn't come out straight away because he felt his new found sexuality . was 'like a dirty little secret' that made him feel 'alone and trapped', . but by telling his best friend Sophie, the weight was lifted off his . shoulders. He said: 'I felt like there was . something wrong with me, I didn’t know other people out there felt that . way, I felt so alone, so locked away and couldn’t say anything. 'Now that everyone knows, I have . nothing to hide, those chains that I felt wrapped around me are gone and . I can carry on with my life as normal and be happy.' Emotional interview: The British diver opened his heart on the ITV chat show . Weight lifted: Tom says he feels so much better now he's not hiding his 'dirty little secret' Still a mystery: The athlete's personal life was thrust into the limelight when he posted a video on Monday, saying he was dating a man . And of his family's reaction to his news, Tom added: 'My family will always want to look out for me and not want me to get hurt but they were worried what the reaction would be like in case people would be horrible to me in the streets. “Now that it’s all happened they couldn’t be happier, the support of the public has been an added bonus, it makes me smile to think about it - my life at the moment is perfect.' Tom also credits his new beau for . making him fall back in love with diving, having been disappointed by . his performance at the London 2012 Olympics. 'He saved me from not wanting to dive . anymore,' Tom said. 'After the Olympics I was down in the . dumps, as it’s such a hard way to get back into everything, but he gave . me the extra motivation and made me work harder and that is exactly . what I need.' But while he's happy in his gay relationship, Tom says he doesn't want to label himself just yet. No labels: Though he is in a relationship with a man, Daley is not worried about calling himself gay or bisexual right now . Best of British: Ellie Goulding, Professor Brian Cox, Tom, Olivia Colman and Jack Dee appear on the Saturday night talk show . Experiments: Tom even joins Professor Brian Cox and Jonathan for some science-based fun on the show . He . added: 'Everything is all pretty new so I don’t see any point in . putting a label on it -  gay, bi, straight, any of those kind of . labels. 'All that I . feel happy about at the moment is that I’m dating a guy and couldn’t be . happier, it shouldn’t matter who I’m dating and I hope people can be . happy for me.' The interview with Jonathan marks the first time Tom has spoken about his sexuality, aside from the YouTube video message he posted earlier this week revealing his relationship. And of announcing the news via the video-sharing . site, Tom said: 'It was a terrifying decision to make, I didn’t know . what the reaction was going to be like, I didn’t know how it was going . to go but I felt I needed to say something.

Now . a role model for young teenagers who are confused about their . sexuality, Tom offered them advice by saying: 'Tell one person. Tell . your story, how you feel.

"A five-year-old girl who was viciously mauled by a dog as she rode her bike in the street has showed her inspiring recovery - and her long road ahead. Payton White was playing with her big sister Camryn outside their great-grandmother's home in Collinsville, Oklahoma on October 21 when a neighbor's Rottweiler-Bullmastiff mix approached them. Camryn later told her mother that the two-year-old dog, Harley, had circled around them before attacking Payton and dragging her into a ditch, the Tulsa World reported. A neighbor heard the girl's screams and managed to pull the dog away from her and call for help. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Payton White grins for photos three weeks after she was viciously attacked by a neighbor's dog . Fighter: Payton, pictured laughing with her mother, needed six hours of surgery and numerous stitches . Her mother, Sherri White, was still at work at a dentist's office when she got a frantic call from nine-year-old Camryn and raced to St John's hospital. 'When I saw her there was a huge gaping hole,' she told the newspaper. 'You could see inside her neck and... there were muscles hanging out of her arm.' Payton suffered two skull fractures and multiple lacerations on her head, neck, arm and body. She was later transferred to The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis where she underwent six hours of surgery and received hundreds of stitches, her father told News on 6. 'It was a really long night, and I was really scared that my child wasn't going to make it,' White told the Tulsa World. 'If he had gotten any closer to that artery, we would have lost her.' Injured: Payton is pictured in hospital after the dog grabbed her and bit into her neck, back and arms . Recovery: Payton, pictured left and right in hospital with her mother, remained in hospital for eight days . Fears: Her mother, Sherri White, said she couldn't believe her daughter's injuries when she arrived at hospital . The family remained at the hospital for eight days and they have been returning for physical therapy and counseling. Payton is back home and grinned for photos for the Tulsa World - but behind the smiles, are new fears, her mother said. She is now terrified of neighborhood dogs she previously played with and that, in the aftermath of the attack, she has become increasingly 'cranky'. The incident has also set back her attending classes at kindergarten. The little girl has also been suffering from headaches and vomiting, exacerbated by her nerves since the incident, and also has PTSD, according to a Facebook page set up by the family. 'It's pretty much flipped our lives upside-down in every way,' White said. 'It's going to be a really long road.' Attack: She had been on her bike with her sister last month when the neighbor's dog began circling them . Scene: The neighbor killed the two-year-old dog, a Rottweiler-Bullmastiff mix, on the day of the attack . Cassie White, an aunt who set up the Facebook page as well as a fundraising page, has moved closer to the family to watch over the little girl. 'She doesn't really sleep,' she said. 'She's been having nightmares.' The dog, Harley, was shot dead by his owner on the day of the attack, according to authorities, who said the killing did not break any laws. White claims that the owner mistreated the dog and had failed to keep him away from the neighborhood children. She said her other daughter had previously been attacked by the dog. It is a misdemeanor to allow a dog that has previously bitten or injured someone to repeat the behavior, but the sheriff's office didn't have any records showing the dog had a history of violence.

"Determined: Home Secretary Theresa May said the Government must 'redouble' its efforts to stamp out female genital mutilation . The public would be 'shocked' to know how many young girls are subjected to female genital mutilation in the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May said yesterday. Speaking in the Commons, she said the Government was doing everything it could to warn young women about the dangers of the practice. Although the secrecy surrounding female genital mutilation (FGM) means it is hard to determine the scale of the problem, . there are thought to be around 66,000 affected women and girls living in England and Wales. The . practice occurs in 28 African and Middle-Eastern  countries, and . is most common among Britain's 600,000 ethnic Africans. Mrs May said: 'Sadly, what we see are too many examples of this terrible crime continuing to take place. I think most people would be shocked to know how many young girls within the United Kingdom are subjected to female genital mutilation. 'We need to redouble our efforts to make sure we educate young girls about the prospects of being taken abroad or having this done to them, but also ensure that we educate others not to do this terrible act.' Her comments followed a question from Conservative MP Amber Rudd (Hastings and Rye), who noted that yesterday was the United Nations' International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation, and called the practice a 'violent and dreadful crime'. Also known as female circumcision or simply as 'cutting', female genital mutilation involves removing all or part of the clitoris, the surrounding labia (the outer part of the vagina) and sometimes the sewing up of the vagina, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood. The barbaric tradition has no medical benefits, and is carried out for cultural reasons, often because it demonstrates a girl's virginity on her wedding night. In cultures where mutilation is common, 'uncut' girls are considered more likely to be promiscuous, unhygienic, and prone to diseases such as HIV/Aids. Families often club together to fly professional 'cutters' to the UK from Africa, after which they perform mutilations on pre-pubescent girls for as little as £40, often without anaesthetic, using blunt knives, razor blades or scalpels. Painful secret: Many women who have suffered genital mutilation are too frightened to speak out because they risk being shunned  by their communities  (picture posed by model) In other cases, girls are flown abroad to their family's native country to help minimise the risk of detection. The practice is illegal under the 2003 Female Genital Mutilation Act, and carries a jail term of up to 14 years. Despite this, no-one has yet been successfully prosecuted. In the short-term FGM may cause severe pain, potentially life-threatening bleeding and infection. In the longer-term, it can lead to severe complications in childbirth, substantial pain during intercourse and lasting psychological trauma. An All-Party Parliamentary Group on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) was launched in December 2011 to raise awareness and eliminate FGM in the UK. More than 50 MPs and Peers of all parties are now involved. Julie Christie-Webb, head of UK programmes at the anti-mutilation charity FORWARD, described this as 'a small step towards improvement'. She said there are presently around 24,000 girls in Britain aged under 15 who are thought to be at high risk of genital mutilation. FORWARD exists to help safeguard women and girls, as well as supporting those living with the consequences of FGM. Mrs Christie-Webb praised parliament's increased focus on the practice, but said the results had not yet become visible on the ground. she said: 'I have had around 15 child protection queries come to me since August. There hasn't been a recent decrease in the number of referrals we get that relate to FGM. 'One big shift in how FGM could be dealt with is if there was an improvement in data collection. 'Often I think female genital mutilation is not treated as a priority, and that needs to change.'","66,000 women and girls  in England and Wales subjected to illegal and barbaric practice, say experts .

"Guests on board luxury Viking River Cruises in China are being left confused when they receive the bill for their trip. Holidaymakers are discovering that any tips given to staff during are debited as payments to the 'Shanghai Carpet Factory' on bank statements - separate to their main bill. It has led to travellers being baffled, despite the cruise company's advertising line 'There's no mystery to finding a great river cruise'. Viking Cruises have admitted to using a partner company to accept passengers' tip on their trips . The Great Wall of China is one of the key ingredients of a Viking River Cruise . A booklet given to passengers aboard the Yangtze River cruise stipulates that tips charged will appear on their statement as the  carpet company, according to The Telegraph. A spokesman for the Swiss-based Viking Cruises told MailOnline Travel: 'In accordance with local law, Viking Cruises uses a Chinese partner company to complete the transaction. 'We are open and transparent about this and make our guests aware of this to avoid any confusion when their statement arrives.' Viking have two luxurious cruises of China on its itinerary.

"George W Bush has made no secret of his ambitions as a portrait artist - but his latest subject is one really close to his heart. The former President has unveiled his newest oil painting, which shows him standing side by side with his father George H W Bush, who was President eight years before him. The Presidential double-act is the latest in a slew of paintings by George W Bush. Other subjects have included Russian president Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Germany's Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama. New work: Portrait artist and former U.S. President George W Bush has revealed a new work - showing himself (right) with his father, 41st President George H W Bush (left) Father and son: George W Bush (left, with his father in November 2013) has written a new book discussing the life, political and private, of his father . Bush Jnr has also indulged in less serious subject, including the cat belonging to his mother, Barbara, and his own legs in the bathtub. He discussed his latest work on the Today Show this morning, where he said he tried to capture the 'gentle soul' of his father. He has previously painted his father individually. Speaking about his artistic process, he said: 'I was very proud to be standing next to a man I admire greatly. First thing I wanted to make sure is I got the noses right. I've tried to paint a gentle soul, and I did it. As for me, I kind of bumbled through.' It is part of a promotional drive for a new book by Bush Jnr about his father, who was in the White House from 1988 to 1992. The book, named 41 because his father was the 41st president, sees the leader open up about his father, covering topics such as Bush family life, meetings with world leaders and the Watergate scandal. Political influence: Bush has written how his father helped arrange a meeting with Vladimir Putin, also the star of one of the former President's portraits (left), in 2007 . World leaders: Bush also painted Tony Blair, who was British Prime Minister for almost his entire time in the White House . Bathtime: Bush also took on less serious scenes, such as himself in the shower . Splish, splash: Another one of Bush's works showed his own legs in the bathtub . A section dealing with Vladimir Putin shows that Bush Snr was continuing to play a part on the world stage well into his 80s. Although the two almost talk politics, George W Bush would still use his father to help host world leaders - such as Putin in 2007, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report. In an excerpt from the book, Bush told how he asked his father to invite Putin to the family compound at Walker's Point, Maine, so the two leaders could talk about missile defense programs. In a surreal episode, Bush Snr, then 83, took Putin into the Atlantic on a speedboat. While the idea 'startled' the Russian leader at first, he 'loved' being driven at top-speed by the octogenarian politician when the time came. On display: President Bush showed off his works at a display earlier this year - featuring likeness of leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel (center) Spiritual: As well as political figures, Bush's attentions were turned towards men such as the Dalai Lama . Art AND politics: Bush is shown above smiling next to a portrait of Barbara Bush's pet dog . They also went fishing, Bush wrote, though only Putin managed to catch anything. Elsewhere the book shows how a shocked Bush Snr told President Nixon to resign after learning he would lose an impeachment hearing over revelations he lied to the American people. Bush Snr, then chairman of the Republican National Committee, sent a letter to Nixon urging him quit for his own good and that of the country, according to a preview of the book by Drudge Report. It said: 'I now firmly feel that resignation is best for this country, best for this President... If you do leave office, history will properly record your achievements with a lasting respect'. The next day, he resigned. 41 is due to be released tomorrow. 'A portrait of my father': George Bush, whose book (right) comes out Tuesday, has previously drawn his father (left). He described that portrait as his favorite .","Former President revealed portrait in TV interview about his father .

"A man charged in the rape of a 13-year-old girl - who has been accused of later fleeing and is suspected of then raping women in six states - was photographed with an apparent smirk on his face during a Monday court appearance. Massachusetts prosecutors urged Judge Janet Kenton-Walker to keep the man, Gregory Lewis, locked up at a dangerousness hearing while he awaits trial. Authorities say Lewis cut off his court-ordered electronic monitoring device and fled Massachusetts after being charged in 13-year-old girl's rape. He was captured in New York last month after what police called a cross-country crime spree. Lewis is suspected of robbing and raping female escorts in Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Oregon, North Carolina and Utah, Massachusetts state police have said. Suspect: Gregory Lewis, pictured, seemed to smirk during his dangerousness hearing. He has been charged in the rape of a 13-year-old girl and is suspected of robbing and raping women in six different states . Court appearance: Lewis, seen in this November 10 photo, pleaded not guilty last week to 17 charges stemming from the alleged rape of the 13-year-old girl and the alleged beating of his stepfather . Crime spree: Gregory Lewis, right, is seen in this November 3 file photo. Massachusetts state police have said Lewis is suspected of robbing and raping female escorts in multiple states . During a court hearing Monday, prosecutor Courtney Sans asked a judge to find that Lewis, 26, of Southbridge, is a danger to the community and to continue to hold him without bail. Sans said 'Based on the nature of his crimes here and his subsequent acts, I would say he is a danger to the community,' according to Masslive.com. 'Any bail is unlikely to ensure his return to the commonwealth.' A Southbridge police officer, identified by Masslive.com as Sgt. Carlos Dingui, testified Monday that he and state police continue to hear from other police departments around the country. Lewis' attorney, Michael Hussey, said he knows it's unlikely Lewis will be released on bail. But Hussey objected to labeling Lewis as dangerous, saying doing so would deprive Lewis of his constitutional right to be presumed innocent. Capture: In this October 28 file photo, rescue workers stand near the Hudson River where fugitive Gregory Lewis crashed his vehicle into the river in Fort Edward, New York . 'What I'm concerned about is the label,' he said in court, Masslive.com reported. 'These allegations impinge upon his right to be presumed innocent.' Judge Janet Kenton-Walker did not immediately rule. She said she will issue her ruling within the next day or so. Lewis pleaded not guilty last week to 17 charges stemming from the alleged rape of the 13-year-old girl and the alleged beating of his stepfather. Massachusetts state police have said Lewis told several people that his goal was to return to Massachusetts to kill his 13-year-old accuser. Another hearing was scheduled for December 15.","Authorities say Gregory Lewis cut off his court-ordered electronic monitoring device and fled Massachusetts after being charged in the rape of a 13-year-old girl .

"The mother of the actor who sang the popular 1986 hit 'The Chicken Song' has been killed by her own car in a bizarre accident after fly-tippers blocked a country lane with rubbish. Olive Stevens, the mother of actor Michael Fenton Stevens, was driving down the lane in Orpington, Kent,  when she and other drivers had to turn around because of rubbish blocking their passage. The 88-year-old was standing behind her car while a kind passer-by reversed it for her, but was tragically knocked over and later died of her injuries. Olive Stevens, the mother of actor Michael Fenton Stevens (pictured together) died after being hit by her own car in a bizarre accident caused by fly-tippers near her home in Orpington, Kent . Mr Stevens, the voice of The Chicken Song from the 1980s programme Spitting Image, has spoken of his outrage that the road had been blocked by fly-tippers. 'It was a terrible tragedy but we don't hold any ill-feelings or malice towards the driver. 'The only thing about this I do feel resentment for is whoever thought it was ok to just throw rubbish on a road. 'They think that it's only a cost to the council to clean up, but this shows there are human consequences to any accident.' 'My mother was 88 and lived a long life. What if it had been a bus filled with schoolchildren, who had not been able to stop in time? 'This sort of thing needs to be clamped down on.' Mr Stevens, who has also appeared in The Bill and Who Dares Wins, said his 'caring' mother may have become flustered when she had to turn her Nissan Micra around. 'My mum was driving along this single-track lane when she had to stop because there was a load of fly-tipped rubbish strewn across the road. Mrs Stevens was described by her son as 'loving and caring towards everyone'. She died in hospital after suffering a head injury when she was knocked over . The 88-year-old became a full-time carer for  her neighbour following the death of her husband 10 years ago . 'She couldn’t get past and then quite a number of vehicles ended up stopping behind her, including a dust lorry tasked with cleaning up the mess, I think. 'People were reversing and trying to turn around in this narrow lane, and my mother was struggling. 'A man got out of another car and offered to help. 'From what I gather, he got into her car and as she opened the passenger door, something happened and the car went backwards. 'My mother was thrown to the ground with some force and suffered broken ribs and quite severe grazing. 'The blow to the back of her head caused a bleed in her brain which killed her.' A 55-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and was bailed until next year pending further enquiries. Mr Stevens however said the family did not hold him accountable for the tragedy. 'I’m sure my mother got a bit panicked by the mess and some kind-hearted passenger offered to help her turn round. 'As far as I am concerned, that man was simply trying to help an old lady, and sadly the consequences were tragic.' The actor with his mother as a child. Mr Stevens said he only felt resentment to the fly-tippers who blocked the street as their actions had 'human consequences' The actor said he did not hold the driver responsible for his mother's death, adding he was certain the man was 'kind-hearted' and was trying to help her when she became panicked . Mrs Stevens, who was on her way to the hairdresser when the accident happened, was described as the 'life and soul of the party' by her son who has appeared in The Bill among other television programmes . 'A remarkable woman': Mr Stevens added his mother was 'sprightly' and 'extraordinarily caring' to all she met . Mrs Stevens, a retired nurse, became a full-time carer for one of her neighbours following the death of her husband 10 years ago. She was described as 'loving and caring towards everyone,' by her 56-year-old son. 'She was a remarkable woman - she was still so sprightly and active and extraordinarily caring to all she met.' Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident. A Met Police spokesperson said: 'Police were called at 0826hrs on Thursday, 6 November to reports of a collision in Skeet Hill Lane, Orpington involving a Silver Nissan Micra and a pedestrian. 'It is believed at this early stage that the victim was unable to continue her journey through Skeet Hill Lane due to a lorry blocking the road that was removing fly-tipped refuse. 'A passenger from a second vehicle offered to assist the victim in reversing her Micra down the lane. 'The victim was not inside the vehicle when it was moved. While reversing, the Micra collided with the victim, causing serious injuries. 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found an 88-year-old woman with serious injuries. 'She was taken to a south London hospital where she later died.'

"Samsung's Smart TV could used by hackers to watch everything that happens in your living room by gaining access to the device's built-in camera and microphones, it has been claimed. Malta-based security firm ReVuln posted a video showing how its researchers had learned to crack the television to access its settings - including any personal information stored on it. 'We can install malicious software to gain complete root access to the TV,' they claim in the video. Vulnerable: Samsung's Smart TV can be penetrated by hackers who can install malicious software on to the device to record whatever is picked up by its built-in microphones and cameras . With such malware installed, hackers could use the Smart TV's built-in microphones and camera to hear and see everything in front of it. Samsung's Smart TV can be used to browse the internet, use social networks, watch net-based commercial film streaming services and play online games, among other things, from the comfort of your sofa. The devices can also be controlled by voice commands and gestures, using their microphones and cameras to detect what is happening in front of them. However, while the Smart TV's are connected to the internet they are vulnerable to hackers who can access the device and access files stored on them. Luigi Auriemma, co-founder of ReVuln, says he has found a way to track down the IP address of the device and gain access to seize control and scour any drives connected to it. The video appears to show he is able to access remote files and information like the viewing history, as well as siphon data from USB drives attached to a compromised set. Mr Auriemma told Ars Technica: 'At this point the attacker has complete control over the device. 'So we are talking about applying custom firmwares, spying on the victim if camera and microphone are available, stealing any credential and account stored... on the device, using his own certificates when accessing https websites, and tracking any activity of the victim (movies, photos, music, and websites seen) and so on. 'You become the TV.' Personal information: A video posted by Malta-based security company ReVuln reveals how once their researcher gained access to the Smart TV he was able to scour all connected drives and read data from them . The research raises the possibility that owners of consumer devices connected to the Internet are exposing themselves to similar kinds of security threats that faced by users of personal computers, Ars Technica notes. The cable boxes of the future could be able to detect when viewers are cuddling on the sofa and automatically serve adverts for contraceptives. U.S. cable provider Verizon has applied to patent a set-top box technology that can observe what's going on in the room and show viewers adverts based on what it detects. In U.S. Patent Application 20120304206 the company suggests it could detect when people are 'cuddling' then show 'a commercial for a romantic getaway vacation, a commercial for a contraceptive, a commercial for flowers [...] etc.'. The technology would integrate a range of sensors into their products, including thermal imaging cameras, microphones and motion sensors, to detect the mood their audience and tailor media content to suit. Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch called the new technology a 'privacy nightmare waiting around the corner' and called for it to be reined in 'before consumers lose control for good'. It has disturbing echoes of George Orwell's dystopia 1984, where the population were constantly watched by authorities through cameras integrated in their television screens. Devices from lighting systems to air . conditioners to computer games consoles now rely on online . functionality, but their operating systems often do not have the same . kinds of security measures now commonly deployed on Microsoft and Apple . powered devices. At the moment, ReVuln's exploit only works once hackers have managed to breach the network which the television is connected to. As such, Mr Auriemma told NBC News, he expects the main danger is of hackers targeting specific companies or individuals. 'In our opinion, it’s more interesting and realistic to think about attacks [against] specific targets reached via open/weak/hacked Wi-Fi or compromised computers of a network, instead of mass-exploiting via the Internet,' he said. 'That’s interesting due to the effects of the vulnerability (retrieving information and the possibility of monitoring) which are perfect for targeted attacks, from a specific person with a TV at home to a company with TVs in its offices.' Revuln plans to sell information on the vulnerabilities to the highest bidder, the Register reported, claiming this will 'speed up' fixes faster than merely reporting them to the manufacturer. The company would not go into details about the flaws it has discovered. The possibilities of such vulnerabilities are worrying with increasing numbers of consumer electronics devices being equipped with sensors, cameras and microphones to detect what is happening around them. Earlier this month it emerged that U.S. cable provider Verizon has applied to patent a set-top box technology that can observe what's going on in the room and show viewers adverts based on what it detects. In U.S. Patent Application 20120304206 the company suggests it could detect when people are 'cuddling' then show 'a commercial for a romantic getaway vacation, a commercial for a contraceptive, a commercial for flowers [...] etc.'. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said of that device: 'Smart TVs with in-built cameras and microphones are a privacy nightmare waiting around the corner. 'It is only a matter of time before technology using facial recognition, audio analysis and monitoring what you watch is common place. 'What is essential is that consumers know exactly what they are buying and where the data is going.' A spokesman for Samsung said: 'We have discovered that only in extremely unusual circumstances a connectivity issue arises between Samsung Smart TV’s released in 2011 and other connected devices. We assure our customers that our Smart TVs are safe to use. 'We will release a previously scheduled software patch in January 2013 to further strengthen Smart TV security. We recommend our customers to use encrypted wireless access points, when using connected devices.'","Security experts reveal they have been able to gain access to the device and scour its hard drives and connected drives for information .

"Mesut Ozil admits he was delighted Arsenal secured the services of 'world class' forward Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. The German international signed for the club for a club record £42.5m fee last summer, and is joined at the club by Sanchez this season. Ozil is looking to kick on in his second campaign in England and believes the Chilean forward has given the whole club a lift. Mesut Ozil believes Alexis Sanchez will score plenty of goals at Arsenal in his debut season . Alexis Sanchez has scored twice early on in his career and Mesut Ozil says the forward is world class . 'Not just me, but I think the whole team are happy because we've added a world class player,' Ozil told Arsenal Player. 'He played at Barcelona and scored lots of goals so you know he has quality and we're pleased to have him. 'I’m sure we'll see lots of goals from him this season.' Ozil was criticised by large sections last year after struggling with form and injuries at times. Despite this, the World Cup-winning playmaker still contributed with nine assists and five goals in the Premier League. The 25-year-old says he is 'proud' by his feats as chief creator, and believes they are just as important as the goals scored. He still wants more though, both individually and as a team. Mesut Ozil is looking for more goals and assists this season after settling in London . The playmaker won the World Cup with Germany in the summer but is now raring to go again .

"Six scientists who were each sentenced to six years in prison because they failed to predict a deadly earthquake in Italy which left 309 people dead have been cleared. The group, which includes some of the country's most respected seismologists, was jailed for manslaughter after underestimating the risks that an earthquake posed to the town of L'Aquila. The medieval mountain town was decimated by the killer quake in 2009, which measured more than 6.3 on the Richter Scale and killed more than 300 people and left thousands homeless. Devastation: The mountain town of L'Aquila, pictured after the deadly earthquake which struck in 2009 . Warning: Local residents, pictured among debris, experienced tremors in the lead-up to the earthquake . Mourning: The earthquake, which measured 6.3 on the Richter Scale, killed more than 300 people . The scientists were members of a Major Risks committee that met in the town after a series of small tremors but concluded that there was little risk. But just days later, at 3.32am on 6 April, the town was struck by the earthquake - injuring more than a thousand people and killing hundreds in their sleep. Judges in the first trial in 2012 said the committee members gave a 'misleadingly reassuring statement' that prompted at least 29 people who wanted to leave the town to stay instead. They were jailed in October that year. A seventh man, government official Bernardo De Bernardinis, who claimed there was ‘no danger’, was absolved of the main charges and his sentence reduced to two years. The experts were also ordered to pay more than €9 million (roughly £7million) in damages to survivors. There was widespread outrage at the verdict, particularly from those within the scientific community. The journal Nature called it 'perverse' and the sentencing 'ludicrous' given the recognised difficulty of predicting earthquakes. Some compared the sentence to the torture of Galileo, the astronomer who was imprisoned as a heretic until he repudiated his claim that the Earth moves around the Sun. Outrage: The scientific community spoke out against the sentencing of the seismologists in 2012. Above, rescue workers search for people trapped under a building that was brought down by the killer quake . Distraught: One family looks at what remains of their town the morning after the earthquake struck . Rubble: Firefighters sort through debris after the earthquake. Victims' families today said that overturning the verdict was a 'misjustice' and their lawyer described it as 'an earthquake within an earthquake' Following the appeal verdict on Monday the victims' families' lawyer Attilio Cecchini said the overturned verdict was a misjustice calling it 'an earthquake within an earthquake'. Members of the public in court shouted ‘Shame on you. Shame on you!’, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. One resident said: 'This state does not carry out justice it only defends itself.' Another relative said: ‘They have murdered them a second time with this verdict.’ The father of a victim said: ‘The divine law of God sees everything and justice will be done ultimately.’ The prosecutors could still appeal the innocent verdict to Italy's highest court but are expected to wait until the judges' reasoning in published, within the next three months. The case was watched closely by seismologists around the world who insist it's impossible to predict earthquakes and that no major temblor has ever been foretold. In 2011, about 5,200 international researchers signed a petition supporting their Italian colleagues and the Seismological Society of America wrote to Italy's president expressing concern about what it called an unprecedented legal attack on science. But prosecutors focused on a memo issued after a March 31, 2009 meeting of the Great Risks commission which was called because of mounting concerns about the months of seismic activity in the region. According to the commission's memo - issued one week before the big quake - the experts concluded that it was ‘improbable’ that there would be a major quake though it added that one couldn't be excluded. In 2011, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Society told FoxNews.com that the investigation 'has a medieval flavour to it - like witches are being put on trial.' Despite the difficulty in predicting . earthquakes, Boschi had warned - prior to the 2009 disaster - that a . large earthquake would hit Italy but that he didn't know when, his . lawyer said. Widespread damage: Bodies were still deing discovered three days after the devastating earthquake which hit the medieval mountain city and its province . Speaking at the time of the sentencing, Dr David Rothery, senior lecturer in Earth Sciences, Open University, said:'I hope they will appeal. Earthquakes are inherently unpredictable. 'The best estimate at the time was that the low level seismicity was not likely to herald a bigger quake, but there are no certainties in this game.' Prof Malcolm Sperrin, director of Medical Physics, Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, said: 'Assuming that negligence and malpractice are not factors here then the prosecution, and now sentences, of the Italian seismologists comes as a considerable surprise. 'In seismology, as with many other branches of the pure and applied sciences, opinions are derived from observables and the application of experience and training. 'It is never the case that predictions are completely without uncertainty and any scientist will make this clear as well as an estimation of how accurate such predictions are. 'If the scientific community is to be penalised for making predictions that turn out to be incorrect, or for not accurately predicting an event that subsequently occurs, then scientific endeavour will be restricted to certainties only and the benefits that are associated with findings from medicine to physics will be stalled. 'It is worth pointing out that many of the valuable contributions made by scientists such as penicillin, radiobiology etc have stemmed from the enquiring mind rather than absolute certainty of success.'","Town of L'Aquila was struck by quake, which measured 6.3 on Richter Scale .

"Amazon is rumoured to be launching a smartphone next year to take on Apple and Google. The firm is believed to have signed a deal with Foxconn, who also make Apple's iPhone, for five million phones to be delivered late next year.

Amazon's Kindle Fire HD tablet: The retail giant is now believed to be developing a phone for its Kindle range . It already has its own app store for the devices, which run a modified version of Google's android software. 'It makes perfect sense, they have seen the Kindle tablet do well, and that was the perfect test bed for a phone,' Stuart Miles of Pocket Lint told MailOnline. 'Judging by its sales figures, it seems a phone launch would be a success.' 'They've got the app store, the music store and the operating system.' However, Mr Miles believes the Kindle phone is unlikely to be radically different from the competition. 'It'll be a smartphone in the same vein as Apple and Google, with the same look at the tablet,' he said. However, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has recently patented a radical airbag system for mobile phones. The system works using a series of air jets to stabilise the phone, while airbags protect it on impact . 'Some smartphone parts makers involved . in the supply of Amazon’s new smartphone model, which is scheduled to be . launched between the second quarter and the third quarter of 2013 at a . unit price of US$100-200, said that Foxconn is expected to ship as many . as five million units of the new device in the year, given the fact that .

"Disney’s timeless princesses and villains have captured the imagination of millions across the world. But what would they look like if their exaggerated features were translated into real-life anatomy? Israeli artist Karen Graw, who works under the name ‘Avalonis’, attempted to find out in this series of portraits. From top left to right, then next rows: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider, Mother Gothel, Tiana, Charlottle LaBouffe, Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo, Giselle, Jane, Tarzan, . Cinderella, Belle, Prince Adam, Gaston, Jafar, Mulan, Alice, Jasmine, Aladdin, Aurora, Prince Philip, Maleficent, Cruella, Meg, Hercules, Pocahontas, Snow White, The Evil Queen, Ariel, Prince Eric, Ursula . Ms Graw said she manipulated each photo until she got ‘the right features and made them real enough looking.’ She admitted to having some difficulty with ‘ridiculously proportioned Disney characters’ such as Hercules and Cruella de Vil. The results, however, are surprisingly realistic and show just what a real-life Belle or Cinderella might look like if you bumped into them on the street. These portraits were designed by Israeli artist Karen Graw. Below each portrait is the original character created by Disney. From top left clockwise: Prince Philip from Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent also from Sleeping Beauty, Cruella Deville from 101 Dalmations, Meg from Hercules, Ursula, Prince Eric and Ariel from the Little Mermaid .

"Most brides opt for a traditional tiered white wedding cake decorated with delicate pink roses and lace for their big day. But one bride-to-be wanted something more alternative - and she sure got what she asked for. Celia, a bride from Haltwhistle, Northumberland, snapped up this black iced tyre cake online after seeing a beautifully decorated image, but what she actually received was much less glamorous. Not what she bargained for: When Celia's wedding cake arrived, she was shocked by the monstrosity, it was nothing like the cake she had dreamed of (L) Arriving at the reception on her wedding day, Celia was horrified to be confronted by a lopsided mess that barely resembled the well-finished three-tier cake she had requested. Not only were the tiers lumpy and uneven, but they were leaning to one side. Instead of being smooth, rounded and shiny like the promised picture, the icing on the cake Celia received was different shades of unappetising grey and cracked all over. The joins had been inexpertly covered with black ribbon, and the roses which had been on the cake dropped off. Describing the cake that she received, Celia wrote: 'A . few defects due to maker being unskilled. Uncut, along with large . amount of awful cupcakes for free. No topper or decoration. Unusual . design. Very heavy.' She added: 'Picture on the left is as it is, picture on the right is how it should have been. Complete disaster...offers please? I have roses which fell off this abomination if required. Sorry no returns.' For sale: Describing the cake that she unexpectedly received, Celia wrote: 'A few defects due to maker being unskilled. Uncut, along with large amount of awful cupcakes for free' The bids started at just 99p for the black cake and Celia received 11 bids in the time that it was up for grabs. She has, however, ended the sale - most likely due to a comment from a concerned baker who wrote: 'Sorry, but as an experienced cake maker I just thought I would contact you. I don't think you will be . Cake-shaming: The Twittersphere seemed to be rather amused by the cake that was on offer . able to/really should sell this cake on eBay, not least of which for health and safety reasons.

'Unfortunately there are now many so . called ""cake makers"" setting themselves up with limited or no . experience, and this is the result.'

"A cancer victim endured agonising head freezing sessions cooling her scalp to -4C to save her hair from gruelling chemotherapy. Shelley Cain opted for the painful treatment after her 10-year-old daughter Ruby begged her not to go bald. The 38-year-old vowed to fight for her life and her looks, after breaking the news of her breast cancer to her two children. Mrs Cain had to endure three hour sessions of the 'cold cap' treatment, which doctors warned was hit-and-miss, not guaranteeing its success. Mother -of-two Shelley Cain, 38, endured painful 'cold cap' treatment, freezing her head to -4C during her chemotherapy to save her looks after promising her daughter Ruby, she wouldn't lose her hair . The 38-year-old from Hertford, was diagnosed with breast cancer in June last year. She said she vowed to fight for her life and her looks after telling her two children, Ollie, six, and Ruby, 10 (pictured left with their mother) The therapy stops hair loss from the cancer-killing drugs by cooling the head to -4C. It meant the HR worker retained a full head of hair, as well as her eyebrows, throughout her treatment. Mrs Cain said she forced herself to get out of bed, get dressed and put on make-up every day to stop her feeling like a cancer patient. And she now credits her stringent beauty regime with helping save her life, keeping her sane and positive throughout the process. The 38-year-old, who is also mother to Ollie, six, said: 'I didn’t want it to look like I was dying to my children. 'I screamed for the cancer nurse to remove the cap when she first put it on as it was unbearably cold and painful. 'But I was so determined to stay looking well for her kids, it got me through the pain. 'I didn’t want to scare my children by looking ill and losing my hair. I wanted them to recognise their mummy and not be frightened by my appearance.' Mrs Cain, pictured with her son Ollie, has finished treatment, retaining her hair and eyebrows and is now in remission . She added: 'It wasn’t easy. If I looked in the mirror and recognised myself then I didn’t feel like a cancer patient, it helped me beat the cancer.' Mrs Cain, of Hertford, who is married to project engineer Richard Cain, also 38, was diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in June 2013. She  said she tried to play the illness down to her children - but they had seen a family friend die of the condition and were 'devastated'. Doctors were positive about the diagnosis and told her she would probably just need an operation to remove the lump. But when tests revealed cancerous tissue had been left behind, Mrs Cain was told she would need to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To ease the blow she promised not to lose her hair and went through the gruelling cold cap therapy, for all six of her two-hour chemotherapy sessions. The process was so severe it left blocks of ice on her head. And the mother-of-two was told she had to be really gentle with her hair, only washing it once a week as well as avoiding brushing or blowing dry it. Now, eight months after her treatment, Mrs Cain is in remission and no longer needs treatment. She said: 'Ruby was terrified that I would lose my hair. She’d seen a cancer patient before and it really scared her that I would look that ill. 'But thanks to the cap, my kids didn’t really notice any difference in me and I still read them a bedtime story every night and looked like their mummy. 'The last few chemo sessions were particularly painful but I still persevered with the cap. 'I'm sure not losing my hair helped me to keep my spirits up. More importantly, it meant the children could recognise the mummy they loved, which took away a lot of their fear' - Shelley Cain . 'Psychologically, I’m sure not losing my hair and eyelashes helped me to keep my spirits up. 'More importantly, it meant the children could recognise the mummy they loved - which took away a lot of their fear.' Dr Bessam Farjo, co-founder of the Farjo Hair Institute and Medical Director of the Institute of Trichologists, said hair loss can be particularly traumatic while battling disease. 'For women, losing their hair can drastically alter their sensuality and how they perceive themselves - typically leading to a plummet in confidence,' he said. 'Many women question whether their partner still finds them attractive, while others may become socially reclusive as they fear people may notice their thinning hair.'","Shelley Cain was diagnosed with breast cancer in June last year .

"Authorities in South Dakota revealed this afternoon that human remains discovered in a partially submerged car last year were two young women who disappeared in 1971. During a news conference today, Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley stated that the evidence gathered from the site where a 1960 Studebaker Lark was found in a creek was consistent with a car accident.

Cheryl Miller and Pamella Jackson, of Vermillion, were last seen in the car on their way to a party in May 1971. Nearly 43 years later, the missing persons case has been officially closed and foul play has been ruled out. According to officials, the victims' vehicle was stuck in a third gear, the lights were on, and their skeletal remains were in the cabin and not in the trunk. One of the tires on the car was damaged. The car keys were found in the ignition. Investigators also recovered Miller's purse, which contained her driver's license, photos and notes from her classmates.

State and local officials held a news conference Tuesday afternoon confirming that the 1960 Studebaker unearthed in September included the remains of Cheryl Miller and Pamella Jackson, both 17-year-olds who attended Vermillion High School . Jackley said Tuesday that the bridge under which the Studebaker was spotted was new at the time of the accident, and there was still construction going on at the site. It does not appear that alcohol played a role in the wreckage. 'I think it's fair to say that law enforcement and the families never quit searching,' the attorney general added. The families of the two girls were on hand for the announcement but declined to publicity speak, only issuing a brief statement that said: 'Out journey is done.'

Broner has referred to Mayweather as his ‘big brother,’ and the 37-year-old – widely regarded as one of the greatest ever boxers - has tried to advise the young pretender on how to successfully rise through the weight divisions. Broner lost his WBA Welterweight title last December when he was defeated by Marcos Maidana and afterward Mayweather explained that he’d tried to help his young apprentice. ‘I tried to tell him about certain moves he needs to make in certain fights. And then he asks me a question and I'm telling him or I'm teaching him different moves - he says ""naw big brother, I got it, I got it,""' said Mayweather . 'And I said, ""Listen to me, it's different at this level. The way that you're shining on D-level fighters and C-level fighters, you're not going to be able to do that to A and B-level fighters.'"" Coming to a venue near you: Broner has been busy doing personal appearances around the country at venues including at Lit, a strip club in Queens, New York . Like his idol, Floyd Mayweather, Broner isn’t shy about flaunting his wealth and his Instagram account includes countless images of the 5ft 7in boxer with large bags of money and expensive jewelry . Broner bounced back from that defeat to beat his next opponent Carlos Molina in May, although it wasn’t without incident. Broner managed to get himself suspended over a racist slur against his opponent when he shouted 'I just beat the f*** out of a Mexican,' after his 10-round win. Soon afterwards he attempted to boost his poor public image when he was filmed handing $1,000 to a homeless man. Since then the boxing bad boy has consistently made the headlines for all the wrong reasons including for refusing to leave a tip on a $24 check and instead wrote 'Or Nah.' Earlier this month he posted a video entitled Adrien Broner Death Speech in which he revealed that when he gets to heaven he plans to smack Michael Jackson 'because he was black and he wanted to be white.' Broner is due back in training in December although it hasn’t been announced who his next fight is against, until then he continues with his tour of personal appearances at nightclubs around the country.

"A new series of heartbreaking pictures has revealed even babies 40 years on are suffering the horrific effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Canterbury born Francis Wade captured the distressing images at the Thi Nghe and Thien Phuoc orphanages in Saigon, which are home to children born decades after the war. Yet despite the conflict ending in 1971, the orphanages are caring for children suffering disabilities thought to be caused by a chemical used by U.S forces, which was sprayed on crops, plants and trees. This young child, Nguyen Thanh Nhan, aged four suffers from hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, a disease associated with Agent Orange . This little boy cries out after suffering the effects of Agent Orange, which will eventually kill him . Seventeen-year-old Nguyen Canh Ngo in his bed at one of the orphanages. Many of the children here also suffer from acute mental health problems . Many of the children at the Thi Nghe orphanage suffer from deformities such as these and are bed-ridden requiring round-the-clock care . Those caring for the children sometimes tie the children to the beds or tie their hands together to prevent them from injuring themselves . In rural southern Vietnam, where much of the spraying of Agent Orange by US forces in the Vietnam War occurred, families still depend on children to work and create income. Many of the children end up in the care of the orphanages as their families cannot afford the burden of a disabled child and they are abandoned there. Mr Wade, a freelance journalist now based in Bangkok, explained: 'The very sad subtext to this all, and the reason why I visited the orphanages, is that many families in Vietnam, particularly in the rural areas that were sprayed with Agent Orange are too poor to carry the burden of a disabled child, and so abandon them at orphanages. The majority of children at Thi Nghe orphanage in Saigon were abandoned by their parents who could not afford to care for them . The children at the orphanages stay there until they are 17. After that they are then sent to adult care homes . A teenage boy sits in the corner of one of the wards at the Thien Phuoc Orphanage. Mental health is often still stigmatised in Vietnam . 'So the families living in areas where there's still heavy contamination have the double curse of being far more likely to produce disabled offspring, and not having the means to care for them.' Agent Orange is the combination of the code names for Herbicide Orange and Agent LNX, one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the U.S. military as part of its chemical warfare programme, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. Over the course of 10 years, American forces sprayed nearly 20million gallons of the chemical in Vietnam, Laos and parts of Cambodia in an effort to deprive guerrilla fighters of cover by destroying plants and trees where they could find refuge. U.S. aircraft sprayed Agent Orange over large areas of the jungle in Vietnam during the war . Scores of people died during the war from 1962 to 1971.

"A teacher who tweeted about wanting to stab and shoot pupils that she hated is being allowed to continue working at the same California school despite outrage from parents. Krista Hodges, who works at Newark Memorial High School, posted the series of offensive messages, on social media between April and June this year. In one vile post, she claimed 'I already want to stab some kids. Is that bad? 19 more days' - while in another she wrote 'so happy to be done w/school for 10 days, but especially to be away from the ones who truly try my patience & make my trigger finger itchy'. Scroll down for video . Krista Hodges (above), who works at Newark Memorial High School, posted the series of offensive messages on social media between April and June this year . On learning of the tweets, the district disciplined Hodges sending her a written reprimand - but amazingly they allowed her to keep her post, San Jose Mercury News reports. Shocking: Series of messages posted about pupils on Twitter by teacher Krista Hodges . Tim Erwin, interim superintendent of the school, confirmed there was an investigation into Hodges' online messages but would not expand on what her punishment was. He added that he consulted California education law, school board policy and the teacher's union contract to guide him in deciding discipline for Hodges. He said: 'The only thing I can say is we were made aware of it, and we followed our policies and procedures and that investigation has concluded.' It was one of Hodges' colleagues who brought the tweets to the attention of the district and the school principal and the shamed teacher has now deleted her Twitter account. In an apologetic email, Hodges said: 'If I had thought for one moment that someone would read anything I said on Twitter and take me seriously, you'd better believe I would have been much more careful with what I've said.' On May 28, she also wrote: 'Y’all think you can hate us teachers … guess what we feel the same about you. We are just not allowed to show it #Isecretlyhateyou.' Many parents are said to be dismayed by her continued employment at the school. In an NBC innterview, one mother, Vanessa Chavez, said: I think she should be fired, she should not work at the school. It's not okay, It's unacceptable.' But in contrast, some pupils have jumped to the teacher's defense claiming they do not want her to be fired because 'she's a great teacher'. Kept her job: Krista Hodges has been allowed to continue her post at the school despite posting a series of vile messages about her pupils on Twitter . One student, called Alisha, tweeted: 'She's a great teacher and person, those tweets were blown up into a bigger deal than what it was. Everyone vents.' School board President Nancy Thomas was said to be 'speechless' after seeing the tweets but declined to comment on whether the written reprimand was appropriate. She said the school board lets administrators handle personnel issues, unless they come before the board.","Krista Hodges posted Tweets about pupils at Newark Memorial High School .

"A Chinese man has been sentenced to death after he attacked and killed a doctor who had carried out plastic surgery on his nose that he was not happy about. The attack happened in the Ear, Nose and Throat Department of the No. 1 People's Hospital in the city of Wenling in China's Zhejiang Province last October. Zhejiang's provincial Higher People's Court heard that Lian Enqing, 33, had been unhappy about his nose and had requested that the doctors carry out plastic surgery to improve the shape.

But afterwards he did not like the way it looked, and also claimed that it no longer worked properly and that he could not breathe easily with his nose. His sister Liao Qiao, 27, told the court that when her brother complained to the hospital he had felt as if they did not treat his complaint with respect, and he had lost his temper. She had appealed for the court to show leniency because her brother had mental issues.

"A mum-of-two who lost her iPhone in a British pub was stunned when it turned up 6,000 miles away - in China. Clare Kerrigan had given up hope of finding her missing iPhone 5c after it disappeared in a pub in Coventry, West Midlands, in August. But the 38-year-old received an email from Apple on Monday saying the phone had been traced to a nursery in China. Clare Kerrigan was shocked to discover her missing iPhone 5c has been traced to a city in China . The message informed her the iPhone was in the city of Shenzhen in the Guangdong region - 5,975 miles away from her home in Coventry. Ms Kerrigan said when her phone had first gone missing she used the Find My iPhone app, but it could not locate the phone as it was switched off. She bought a new phone and forgot about the incident until she received the email from Apple on Monday saying it had been located. Incredibly, using the Find My iPhone app Ms Kerrigan is now able to see where it goes and even if the new owner is playing music. It was first located at the Futiancun Kindergarten in the south of the city. Ms Kerrigan  believes her iPhone was shipped to Asia to be sold on the black market. The mum-of-two, who lives with her daughter Elizabeth, six, and three-year-old son Michael, said:'I had a night out with friends and we got several taxis and ended up at The Cedars pub in Coundon and walked down the road. Using the Find my iPhone app Ms Kerrigan discovered the phone was at a nursery in the city of Shenzhen . 'I either left it on the wall of the pub or in a taxi. It was a 5C so it was a bit slippy. I had only had it a couple of weeks so it didn't have many photos or much stuff on it. 'I came home and fell into bed and the next day I had a look around the house and realised it was gone. 'I phoned the pub and taxi companies and local polie and they all drew a blank. 'I spoke to O2 and got it cancelled and on the Find My iPhone app it was switched off so I couldn't see it. 'Then I got a new handset and I didn't really think about it again until Monday night when an email popped up saying it had been found. 'When it came up with Shenzhen in China I couldn't believe it.' Apple informed Ms Kerrigan on Monday that the iPhone is in Shenzhen- 5,975 miles away from Coventry . Using the Find My iPhone app she is able to see where the phone goes and if the new owner is playing music . The tracking app has since shown the iPhone moving around the city but Ms Kerrigan said she was reassured by Apple that it could not be reactivated. She added: 'I spoke to Apple and the man said somebody has probably bought it online but the handset is useless because it is locked. 'He put my mind at rest and said there is no way it can be reactivated because I was worried about my personal details on there if it was. Stolen phones are often shipped to China or Africa because Apple's high-tech software makes it almost impossible to reactivate a stolen handset in the UK . Using the Find my iPhone app Ms Kerrigan can press a button and make the phone bleep in China . Smartphones are so expensive in Asia the black market is flourishing - with hundreds of stolen British gadgets shipped overseas in suitcases and fruit containers . 'He seemed to think that it couldn't be unlocked so someone in China has my phone but can't use it. 'He laughed and said if it was him he would just watch it. 'It hasn't moved too far since Monday. If I press a button on the app then I can make the phone make a noise in China which is funny.' 'Now I've got another phone popping up 6,000 miles away. I can't believe it. 'There's not much the police can do over here to get it back so I've got to accept its in the hands of the Chinese now. Shenzhen is a major city in the south of Southern China’s Guangdong Province, situated immediately north of Hong Kong .

"Despite being an Olympic gold medalist, TV presenter and fitness fan, I don’t want to always look like I’ve just jumped off the cross trainer (even if I have). Tracksuits are far from flattering and, as a busy mother-of-three, I still want to look presentable as I dash from workouts to the school run, a meeting, or the supermarket. For years, I carried bulky bags full of training kit but, nowadays, I like to travel light, so I always keep an eye out for functional, transitional sportswear that looks stylish at both a ‘body pump’ class and the school gates. Luckily, we’re seeing something of a sportswear explosion on the High Street. Fuelled by the popularity of yoga and Pilates, gym kits are having a major makeover. Never before has workout gear looked so unlike the scratchy tracksuits I wore as a young athlete in the early Nineties. Luxury website Net-a-porter launched Net-a-sporter this year, selling designer tank tops, leotards and even tennis skirts. And since sportswear makes up 27 per cent of the £26 billion British fashion industry, jogging bottoms have never been hotter. But the trick is to buy items that don’t look like PE kit, so they can be worn to the gym and out for dinner. To prove how easily it can be done, I put some of the most versatile sportswear available through its paces. Scroll down for video . PRINT LEGGINGS . I was looking forward to getting these on as I love the quirky print. Once I did, I was less impressed. Too baggy for workouts but not tapered enough to make them flattering, they hover in no man’s land. I personally wouldn’t buy them. 2/5 . Floral luxe trousers, £95, sweatybetty.com .

"By the gloomy light of our caving headlamps, it looks like a geological rubbish dump: a brown, muddy chaos of shadowy crevices and boulders – some the size of buses – that fell from the roof. Welcome to The Frozen Deep, the biggest cave chamber in Britain, which has recently been discovered below Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. By the way, I’m the tiny figure in the middle of the photo standing in the distant white glow at the far wall. Lit properly for the first time by underground photography specialist Gavin Newman, with five of our team spread out across its vastness holding synchronised flashguns, The Frozen Deep is a wonderland featuring pure white stalactite columns – the 20ft one on the left of the picture is the country’s longest. Spot me if you can: David Rose's silhouette can be seen at the back of the recently discovered Frozen Deep chamber beneath Somerset's Cheddar Gorge. The white 20ft stalactite on the left is the largest in Britain . Quite a feat: David Rose in the breakthrough dig in Reservoir Hole Cave, Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. Beyond this tight section of passage, explorers found the Frozen Deep Chamber . The Frozen Deep is at the far end of a cave system known as Reservoir Hole. It has been explored by cavers since 1951, but no one had ventured beyond an apparently impenetrable rockfall at the end of its main tunnel, which is called the Grand Gallery. However, a strong draught blowing from the cracks between the boulders suggested that if a way through could somehow be found, there must be more open cavern. In early 2008, Dr Pete Glanvill, 61, a retired GP and a doyen of the local caving scene, put a team together to take up the challenge. Armed with hammers, crowbars, drills, explosives and a large quantity of scaffolding, the team probed various blind alleys in search of the elusive chamber. Finally they began to push at the right spot. With a series of successive breakthroughs starting earlier this year, they reached the end of a squirm they dubbed Hard Times to became the first humans to enter Resurrection, a massive open rift. Seen from the side: A graphic shows the journey taken to the Frozen Deep . The Frozen Deep – which could be accessed from a passage 30ft above the floor – was by now just around the corner. That . week Glanvill happened to be on holiday. ‘They waited for me to get . back before they went down into the chamber,’ he said.  ‘I thought that . was pretty decent of them.’ It takes a little time to appreciate just how big this chamber is. To . get from one end to the other takes close to ten minutes, in part . because one has to follow a circuitous route laid between strips of . fluorescent tape in order to avoid damaging the unique crystals and . cracked mud floors. The . floor area is almost 32,291 square feet – big enough to fit in about six . of the naves  of nearby Wells Cathedral. Measured by  volume, The . Frozen Deep is almost 1,412  million cubic feet, against the cathedral’s . 388,000 cubic feet. Its . discovery may not be the end of Reservoir Hole’s secrets. At the lowest . part of the chamber, a small stream flows down a muddy passage that the . team called Dingley Dell  and into a pit, where the roof dips beneath . the water’s surface. Vast: Explorers believe the cave could turn out to be even bigger as they think it is linked to other known underground chambers . Preliminary dives have established that the passage continues underwater, and appears to join a much bigger  tunnel. At this point, Reservoir Hole is very close to Cheddar’s ‘lost river’ – the massive borehole bearing the River Yeo, a major underground watercourse that emerges at the bottom of the gorge. In the Nineties, cave divers explored it  for more than half a mile, but eventually reached a blockage. ‘The hope now is to get back to the river upstream of that point via Reservoir Hole,’ said team member Martin Grass, 57. If that happens, perhaps in the next few weeks, it may well be possible to find links with some of the other already-known underground chambers and caves on top of the Mendip Hills, some of them miles away. Potentially, The Frozen Deep may turn out  to be just a part of one of the greatest cave systems in Europe.","Journalist David Rose descends hundreds of feet below ground into the Frozen Deep at Cheddar Gorge, Somerset .

"Back-to-back failures to qualify for the Champions League could cost Manchester United £150million. Defeat to former pupil Ronald Koeman's Southampton saw Louis van Gaal's side drop to fourth and raised fears of another costly year outside Europe's top competition. With the Premier League title a two-horse race between Chelsea and Manchester City, Koeman confident his side can stay third and perennial qualifiers Arsenal just a point behind United, the chilly temperatures at Old Trafford on Sunday may not have been the only thing sending a shiver down the spine of club officials. Wayne Rooney (left),  Michael Carrick (centre) and Angel di Maria react after going 1-0 down on Sunday . United captain Rooney cut a dejected figure as he left the pitch at full-time after the loss to Southampton . Chief executive Ed Woodward has already outlined the importance of making the top four. This season United will miss out on more than £50m thanks to loss of gate revenue and competition money. That figure will be at least the same amount next year and with £150m emptied from the club's bank account on summer transfers, a series of new top earners on the wage bill and more expected to follow, qualification is essential. One expert believes the damage could go up to £150m. Dusan Tadic (second right) pounced in the 69th-minute to secure victory for the Saints at Old Trafford . Professor Ellis Cashmore, from Aston University, explained: 'It's hard to quantify but in terms of reputational damage you could be talking treble the £50m. 'United need to qualify and the Glazers will want them to qualify but if they don't the long-term damage casued by underachievement could actually be more important.' Prof Cashmore believes United have already lost some of their aura. Louis van Gaal's side have dropped below Southampton into fourth place in the Premier League table .

"A Florida pizza delivery girl miraculously survived being shot in the face on Halloween night. Lyndsey Cooper of Tampa Bay was returning home from her shift as a Papa John's delivery driver when a man in a skeleton mask allegedly shot her in the face and nabbed her purse with just $40 in tip money. 'I just don’t understand why somebody would do that to my daughter, over tip money, Lyndsey's mother Dawn Cooper told WPTV in tears. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Survived: Lyndsey Cooper survived being shot in the face by a man wearing a skeleton mask on Halloween night when she was returning home from working as a pizza delivery girl . In recovery: Lyndsey underwent reconstructive surgery and has had to have her mouth wired shut . 'I heard a pop. I was asleep in my room right there. It woke me up. It was just one pop and I thought it was a firework,' Dawn Cooper said. Lyndsey's mother recalls her daughter frantically running into their Coconut Grove home clasping her chin. She said, 'This entire part of her face was gone. The gums the teeth, the bone, everything.' Lyndsey is being treated at St. Mary’s Medical Center where she's had reconstructive surgery and has had to have her mouth wired shut. Dawn's mother says she believes whoever robbed her daughter must have known her schedule because he was waiting for her to arrive back at her home just in time to rob her.

"The Mayans built astonishing temples in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras - but now some believe the ancient peoples fled their dissolving civilization and ended up in Georgia. Historian and architect Richard Thornton believes a 1,100-year-old archaeological site shows that Mayan refugees fled Central America and ended up in the North Georgian mountains near Blairsville. His astonishing theory is based on the discovery of 300 to 500 rock terraces and mounds on the side of Brasstown Bald mountain that date to 900AD - around the time the Mayans began to die out. City Spotting: This 3D virtual reality image was made from the ruins found in the Brasstown Bald mountain . Ruins: Carey Waldrip shows the many mysterious rock pile terraces near the Arkaquah Trail in Brasstown Bald, Georgia. The mounds are possibly tied to a Mayan civilization . Georgia Mountain: The theory revolves around an area near Brasstown Bald mountain, pictured, potentially being the 'fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto failed to find in 1540' Mr Thornton’s blockbuster theory . revolves around the area near Brasstown Bald potentially being the . ‘fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto failed . to find in 1540’. He described it as ‘certainly one of . the most important archaeological discoveries in recent times’. The Mayans died out around 900AD for . reasons still debated by scholars - although drought, overpopulation and . war are the most popular theories, reported the Atlanta Journal . Constitution. The remains were first found by retired engineer Carey Waldrip when he went walking in the area in the 1990s. Archaeologist Johannes Loubser excavated part of the site and wrote a . report about it in 2010, but does not believe the rock terraces are Mayan. ‘I . think that (Mr Thornton) selectively presents the evidence,’ Mr Loubser . told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. ‘But he’s a better marketer than . I and other archaeologists are.’ Look at this: The remains were first found by retired engineer Carey Waldrip, pictured, when he went walking in the area in the 1990s . Row: Not everyone was impressed by historian and . author Richard Thornton's, right, theory. University of Georgia . archaeology professor Mark Williams, left, who was cited in his article, . labelled it as 'complete bunk' Mr . Loubser, who excavated a rock wall and small mound, added that claims . like this must be backed up with ‘hard evidence’ because of the various . conflicting opinions in the archaeological world.' Mr Loubser believes the structures could . have been built by the Cherokee Indians or an earlier tribe between . 800AD and 1100AD. 'It . is possibly the site of the fabled city of Yupaha, which Spanish . explorer Hernando de Soto failed to find in 1540, and certainly one of . the most important archaeological discoveries in recent times' He stopped digging because he realized the site could . be a grave. Still, Mr Thornton claims early maps of the location named two villages . ‘Itsate’, which was how Itza Mayans described themselves. The terrace . structures and date helped him reach his conclusion. 'It was commonplace for the Itza Maya to sculpt a hill into a pentagonal mound,' he argues. 'There are dozens of such structures in Central America.' But not everyone is impressed by Mr . Thornton’s theory. He cited University of Georgia archaeology professor . Mark Williams in an article on Examiner.com. ‘I am the archaeologist Mark Williams mentioned in this article,’ Professor Williams said on Facebook. ‘This is total and complete bunk. There is no evidence of Maya in Georgia. Move along now.’ Theory: The Mayans could have left Central America and ended up in the North Georgian mountains . Fascinating: The Mayans died out around 900AD for reasons still debated by scholars - although drought, overpopulation and war are the most popular theories (file picture) ‘The sites are certainly those of Native Americans of prehistoric Georgia,’ Professor Williams told ABC News. ‘Wild theories are not new, but the web simply spreads them faster than ever.’ Mr Thornton wasn't bothered by the ensuing debate, in fact, that's exactly what he wanted. 'I’m not an archaeologist. I’m a big picture man,' said Mr Thorton to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'We’re hoping this article stirs up some interest. I was just trying to get the archaeologists to work some more on the site and they come back snapping like mad dogs.' 'This is total and complete bunk. There is no evidence of Maya in Georgia. Move along now.' Archaeologist, Mark Williams . He works with a company called History Revealed Media that helps create three-dimensional maps of excavated sites and said that when he compared his map of the Georgia site, it reminded him of other Mayan works. 'It’s identical to sites in Belize,' he argued. The .

"Lewis Baker is the 30th Chelsea player to have left the club on loan this season alone. He is perhaps the club’s brightest prospect in years and could now spend the rest of this campaign at Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. There have been some dissenting voices at the Blues’ use of the system, with the staggering statistics used as a stick to beat the big spenders with. Thirty this season, and similar numbers in each of the last three, too. VIDEO Scroll down to see Lewis Baker's audacious back heel goal against Arsenal U21s . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has seen 30 players leave the club on loan throughout this season . The talented Lewis Baker has joined Sheffield Wednesday on a youth loan which could span the season . John Terry is the last academy player to have really impacted upon the Chelsea first team . Marco Van Ginkel (left) is at AC Milan and Kenneth Omeruo is one of three who joined Middlesbrough . Matej Delac (right, starring in a pre-season friendly) is one of the more experienced players to depart .

But Josh McEachran (left) wasn't able to make his mark for Wigan Athletic last season . Jose Mourinho knows there are two types of loan deals. The first is to allow the real talents to hone their skills in lower divisions in a bid to hit the ground running on arrival back at Cobham. The second is to merely push players into the shop window; those who will not make it into the club’s first-team squad, but who could happily carve careers for themselves in League One, the Championship or lower reaches of the Premier League. Mourinho cannot escape the fact that the only player of genuine title-winning pedigree to break through from the academy over the last 15 years is John Terry. But now he believes they have a cluster ready to make the big time. The manager said at the start of the season that he would have failed should Baker, Isaiah Brown and Dominic Solanke don’t find themselves England players in the future. Borussia Monchengladbach have taken Eden Hazard's brother Thorgan on loan for the campaign . Christian Atsu has not done featured regularly for Everton while Islam Feruz (right) has been in Greece . He also spoke about the academy structure at Chelsea last month. 'If you don't bring kids through the academy, the best thing is to close the academy,’ he said. ‘If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough, and you don't bring kids up, then close the door and use the money to buy players. ‘You need to prove the academy works well and is worth it. ‘For the first time I have been at Chelsea there is a clear group of four or five players between 17 and 20 clearly identified that we know — unless something happens inside their heads — that have to be Chelsea players. 1. Tomas Kalas – Koln (season-long) 2. Wallace – Vitesse (season-long) 3. Cristian Cuevas – CU de Chile (season-long with a view to a permanent) 4.

Joao Rodriguez signed for Bastia (left) with Wallace at Vitesse until the end of the season . Victor Moses is trying to make a further name for himself while at Mark Hughes' Stoke City . Stipe Perica (left, playing for Vitesse) and Alex Davey (for Scunthorpe) are both loaned for the season . Marko Marin has struggled to make his mark at Chelsea but is plying his trade at Fiorentina in Serie A . Ulises Davila (pictured in the summer) is at Tenerife, while Jamal Blackman played for Boro at Liverpool . Christian Cuevas (centre, playing for Peru) is currently on loan  with Club Universidad de Chile . John Swift spent time at Rotherham earlier this year before a switch to Swindon Town . ‘If, in a few years, Baker, Brown and Solanke are not national team players, I should blame myself.’ Baker is the first of the clutch – that includes Ruben Loftus-Cheek - to depart temporarily, and will learn his craft in the second tier. Chelsea see this as key in their players’ development and offers an indication as to whether they will sink or swim when asked to make the step up. Past experiences dictates that more than a few could fail, however. Big things were expected of Josh McEachran, for example, but his floundering in the Championship meant he is extremely unlikely ever to play at Stamford Bridge again. The game time their crop of young talent is currently garnering should stand them in good stead to make a run at the first team; and if not, to impact on other Premier League clubs further down the line. Patrick Bamford perhaps won’t provide much competition for Diego Costa or Loic Remy as a central striker, but – given his prowess for Derby last year and Middlesbrough this – should find he enjoys a career in the top flight. But then there are the likes of Tomas Kalas who is at German side Cologne, even though the central defender so impressed at the back end of last season. Looking back to last year, the central midfielder George Saville formed part of Brentford's midfield who passed their way out of League One and earned a permanent move to Wolves on the back of it. While he never played for the Chelsea senior team, they should consider that a job well done. Central midfielders Oriol Romeu (left) and Nathaniel Chalobah have been at Stuttgart and Burnley respectively . Fernando Torres was loaned to AC Milan but has since joined boyhood club Atletico Madrid . Big things are expected of Lucas Piazon (at Vitesse, left). Mario Pasalic joined La Liga side Elche . Bertrand Traore celebrates scoring for Vitesse during the Dutch Eredivisie match against FC Groningen . Ryan Bertrand has formed part of Southampton's back four and Gael Kakuta is at Rayo Vallecano (right) There are too many who fall by the wayside, though. McEachran is clearly one. Wigan nor Watford didn't fancy him last year and - despite being given chances at Swansea City and Middlesbrough - he has now been farmed out to the club's partner team Vitesse. Gael Kakuta has jumped from club to club, too. The man whose transfer in 2009 cost Chelsea more than a few headaches needs to kick on but they have afforded him ample opportunity. Now at Rayo Vallecano, his time is now. Mourinho just hopes that the alarming lack of academy products playing for Chelsea will change. Ruben Loftus-Cheek . The imposing box-to-box midfielder made his first-team debut against Sporting Lisbon last month. Seen as the one of the club’s top prospects, the 17-year-old stands at 6ft 4in and is able to dominate a game with his physical presence and range of passing. Lewis Baker . Dubbed the academy’s successor to Frank Lampard, Baker appeared for Chelsea in last season’s FA Cup and is the current England Under 20 captain. A bustling midfielder with a lethal eye for goal, the 19-year-old will be eager to try his hand in the Championship with Sheffield Wednesday. Jeremie Boga . Frequently the shining light in games well above his age group, the diminutive attacking midfielder is the focal point of the Chelsea Under 21s attacking play. Able to fearlessly run at defenders and possessing a great finish, at just 18 Boga is one of the jewels in the academy crown. John Swift . Having lost his way at Rotherham in the first half of the season, Swift has a chance to be a vital part of high-flying Swindon’s promotion push from League One. With an accomplished creative eye and a composure on the ball that belies his 19 years, Swift provided the craft to Baker’s hustle for last season’s youth side. Izzy Brown . Snapped up from West Brom in 2013, striker Brown has been tipped for England stardom by Jose Mourinho. Helping England win last summer’s Under 17 European Championship, Brown’s hold-up play, technique, speed and finishing ability means he is adept across the front line.

"Do you remember how you felt the last time your plane was hit by turbulence? If you are anything like most passengers,  you almost certainly endured a nerve-shredding experience. But an airline pilot has now  offered reassurance to nervous flyers after penning a blog which discusses the facts surrounding the topic. Scroll down for video . Patrick Smith, an active airline pilot, travel blogger and author, suggests that pilots consider turbulence to be nothing more than 'a comfort and convenience issue, not a safety issue per se. Annoying, but not dangerous' Patrick Smith, an active airline pilot and author, suggests that turbulence 'is far and away the number one concern of nervous flyers'. However, in his Ask The Pilot blog, Mr Smith says pilots consider incidents of rough air to be nothing more than 'a comfort and convenience issue, not a safety issue per se. Annoying, but not dangerous'. Talking about what happens to the aircraft during an episode of turbulence, the 48-year-old said: 'During turbulence, the pilots are not fighting the controls. 'Planes are designed with what we call positive stability, meaning that when nudged from their original point in space, by their nature they wish to return there. 'The best way of handling rough air is to effectively ride it out, hands-off. (Some autopilots have a turbulence mode that desensitizes the system, to avoid over-controlling.) 'It can be uncomfortable, but the jet is not going to flip upside down.' Patrick Smith  has published a book called Cockpit Confidential, described as a behind the scenes look at 'the strange and misunderstood business of commercial aviation' There are more than 12 million people in the UK who suffer from aerophobia – a fear of flying. Many of the country's leading airlines now offer courses designed to help people overcome their fears, while aerophobics can also benefit from the increasing number of flight simulators throughout the country which are aimed at helping familiarise passengers with the safety measures and systems that pilots have to keep their passengers safe. Mr Smith said that a number of people had questioned him over whether climate change would increase incidents of turbulence, adding: 'Will climate change increase the number of severe turbulence encounters? 'Possibly, but in the meantime remember there are also more airplanes flying than ever before. 'The worldwide jetliner fleet has more than doubled in the past 20 years, and it continues to grow. 'It stands to reason that as the number of flights goes up, the number of incidents will also go up, regardless of changes in the weather.' Mr Smith added: 'For what it's worth, thinking back over the whole history of modern commercial aviation, I cannot recall a single jetliner crash caused by turbulence, strictly speaking. 'Airplanes are engineered to withstand an extreme amount of stress, and the amount of turbulence required to, for instance, tear off a wing, is far beyond anything you'll ever experience.' Boston-based Mr Smith, took his first flying lesson at age fourteen. His first job with an airline came in 1990 and he has since flown cargo and passenger jets on both domestic and international routes. He travels extensively in his spare time and has visited more than seventy countries. His Ask the Pilot column initially ran in the online magazine Salon.com for ten years between 2002 until 2012. He was voted one of the 25 Best Bloggers of 2013 by TIME magazine, and has also published a book called Cockpit Confidential – described as a behind the scenes look at 'the strange and misunderstood business of commercial aviation'. Just last week eight passengers and 14 crew members were injured on board a Singapore Airlines flight to Mumbai when it hit sudden turbulence. A number of those hurt were treated at hospital after the A380 flight number SQ424 landed safely at Mumbai's Terminal 2 after the plane was shaken at 15,000ft. Boston-based Mr Smith, took his first flying lesson at age fourteen. His first job with an airline came in 1990 and he has since flown cargo and passenger jets on both domestic and international routes . There are more than 12 million people in the UK who suffer from aerophobia – a fear of flying. Aerophobics can  benefit from using flight simulators aimed at helping passengers understand a plane's safety measure . In May 2013, 11 passengers were injured and photos revealed a chaotic cabin when a flight with the same carrier ran into turbulence on the way to London during food service. However, Mr Smith said that such incidents appeared to be extremely rare, adding that passengers who report such incidents often exaggerate the effects. 'Be wary of passenger accounts in news stories,' he said. 'Not to insult anyone's powers of observation, but people have a terrible habit of misinterpreting and exaggerating the sensations of flight, particularly if they're scared. 'Even in considerably bumpy air — what a pilot might call 'moderate turbulence,' a plane is seldom displaced in altitude by more than 20 feet, and usually less. 'Passengers might feel the plane 'plummeting' or 'diving' — words the media can't get enough of — when in fact it's hardly moving. Virgin Airlines offer courses to help passengers overcome their fear of flying (picture posed by models) 'In rare circumstances, however, it is worse, to the point where a plane's occupants can be injured or, even more uncommonly, aircraft components can be damaged. 'How rare? Put it this way: The type of encounter that United [when passengers were injured in February 2014] and Cathay [also in February 2014] ran into is the sort of thing even the most frequent flyer will not experience in a lifetime. 'And of the small number of passengers injured each year, the vast majority of them are people who did not have their seat belts on when they should have.' 'Be wary of analogies. You might hear somebody compare turbulence to 'driving over a rough road,' or to 'a ship in rough seas.' 'I don't like these comparisons, because potholes routinely pop tires, break axles and ruin suspensions, while ships can be capsized or swamped. There are no accurate equivalents in the air.' While Mr Smith admits that patches of turbulence can occur unexpectedly, most incidents are reported to the pilots well in advance, giving passengers time to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts following instructions from the captain. 'First and foremost, turbulence is, for lack of a better term, normal,' he adds. A Singapore Airlines flight bound for London was a chaotic mess after it hit turbulence in May last year . 'Every flight, every day, will encounter some degree of rough air, be it a few light burbles or a more pronounced and consistent chop that sometimes gets your coffee spilling and the plates rattling in the galley.' 'Pilots receive weather and turbulence forecasts prior to flight; once aloft we get periodic updates from our dispatchers and meteorologists on the ground,' he said. 'We have weather radar in the cockpit, as well as our eyes to see and avoid the worst weather. And perhaps most helpful of all, we receive real-time reports from nearby aircraft. 'With all of these tools at our disposal, we have a pretty good idea of the where, when, and how bad of the bumps. 'But every so often they happen without warning. Almost always it's a mild nuisance, but the lesson here is to always have your belt fastened, even when conditions are smooth.' Do pilots keep their belts fastened in the cockpit? 'Yes, always,' he explains. 'Is this one of those things that, well, hey, we sometimes ignore and get lackadaisical about? No, and neither should you.'","US pilot Patrick Smith says turbulence is 'number one concern of flyers'

"Thai authorities have arrested a beach vendor after he shoved and chased away a Russian tourist because she wouldn’t rent a sunlounger or parasol from him. The heated confrontation on Koh Larn, a picturesque island in the Gulf of Thailand, was recorded by a fellow beachgoer and the online video clip has gone viral in the Southeast Asian country. It shows the pushy male vendor hovering over the woman and kicking sand at her as she attempted to soak up the sun in a public area where sunlounger or parasol rentals are not required. Beach bum: Police launched an investigation after a vendor shoved and chased away a Russian tourist . After approaching her on popular Nang Nual Beach, the angry vendor circles the woman, who is seated on a beach towel, and berates her as she begins to pack up her belongings and put on her flip-flops. The argument continues as the vendor, standing impatiently with his left hand on his hip, starts to kick sand at the upset holidaymaker. That’s when the woman jumped to her feet and whipped her towel toward the vendor, spraying sand in his face, which is covered. He proceeds to grab the bikini-clad woman by the arm and shove her away from the water, but she stands her ground and continues to plead her case.

With more force, the aggressive man shoves the woman a second time and she storms off camera and continues to shout at him. Fellow beachgoers are seen relaxing or playing nearby, but no one bothers to intervene on the woman's behalf.

Sand storm: The woman became increasingly frustrated and whipped her beach towel toward the vendor . Face-off: The holidaymaker continued to stand her ground, but no one bothered to intervene . The man, from Cambodia, was held because he entered Thailand illegally, but he was not charged for the confrontation because the victim is no longer in the country and it would be difficult to secure a conviction, authorities told the newspaper. The vendor, known as Ping, told police the incident occurred last year and he was following his boss’ orders. The video found its way onto the Internet this month. In an act of embarrassment, police took the handcuffed vendor back to the beach on Sunday and forced him to re-enact the row with a model as a photographer snapped pictures that were shared with Thai media.

"Their 11-game winning streak may have come to an abrupt end after Saturday's horror show against Malaga, but Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique were still out and about the following night. Amidst renewed talks of crisis at the Nou Camp after Juanmi's goal sent the La Liga title challengers crashing to their first home defeat since November 1, the pair were spotted outside the Casino de Barcelona at around midnight on Sunday.

Returning to his hometown to meet his former colleagues at the beach venue, Chelsea midfielder Fabregas will have brought his own tales of woe to distract his pals from their state of sorrow. With his team on the end of some debatable refereeing decisions during their ill-tempered 1-1 draw against Burnley the previous day - just ask Jose Mourinho - Fabregas will be looking ahead to Sunday's Capital One Cup final clash with London rivals Tottenham, hoping that fortune will favour his side at Wembley. Messi and Pique will no doubt be wishing their luck will also change after Saturday's loss as the Catalans' disappointing show meant they missed out on the opportunity to leapfrog arch rivals Real Madrid at the top of the La Liga table, and a win for Carlo Ancelotti's side the following day opened up a four-point gap. Both players were subject to some criticism during the defeat, with Messi's performance at the Nou Camp, despite showing flickers of brightness, described as 'fretful' by Sportsmail's Oliver Holt. Two goals would have drawn him level with old foe Cristiano Ronaldo in the race for the 'Pichichi' (top scorer) trophy.

Pique argues with the referee Juan Martinez Munuera before being booked in Saturday's La Liga loss . Pique, too, was collared for remonstrating a foul and received his fifth yellow card in La Liga this season to ensure he'll miss next weekend's away game against Granada. So it's no surprise, then, that the trio were keen to let off some steam, but with Luis Enrique's men heading into a tough fixture against a rampant Manchester City side and whisperings of an end to Barcelona's hegemony in European football, it is vital his players get their heads down. Against Malaga they showed a distinct lack of inventiveness despite flaunting a front three of Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, who appeared to fade into anonymity again behind his stellar strike partners. Arriving at Manchester Airport a mere 13 hours after their visit to the casino, it will be straight back to work for Messi and Co as his side become increasingly dependent on him in times of self-doubt. One thing we can be sure of is that Manuel Pellegrini and his men will be smelling blood heading into Tuesday night and the 27-year-old will have to be at his very best if Barcelona are to take home some faith.

"We all enjoy a good wedding but Jen Glantz loves them so much she's decided to make a living out of the special day - as the world's first professional bridesmaid. The 26-year-old came up with the idea after taking on the duty at all her friends' weddings. And she proved so good at it, she decided to offer up her services to strangers. New Yorker Jen made the unusual decision to become a professional bridesmaid after performing the duty three times for friends and family . Jen, pictured left, performs bridesmaid duties at the wedding of good friend Alli Blum in New York . Jen, who promises she can get guests off their seats, shows off her dance moves at the wedding of friend Mel Sutliff in Florida . Jen (Second from right), pictured at the wedding of friend Mel Sutliff, will also arrange bridal showers and hen parties as part of her professional bridesmaid service . For a small fee, Jen promises to get guests dancing as well as help write the speeches. She'll even lift the bride's dress when she needs to go the loo. 'I've always loved weddings and I love being a part of them,' says Jen, from New York. 'My favourite thing is watching the bride walk down the aisle. It's the moment she's been building up to over a mad year of planning, rehearsals, the bridal shower and the hen do. 'It's such a lovely moment and it's such a wonderful feeling to be part of that.' She adds: 'I think there's something so special about two people promising to spend their lives together - I love witnessing that first hand.' She also has an ulterior motive - she's keen to find a groom of her own. She hopes that attending more weddings will increase her chance of finding Mr Right - much to the delight of her mother. 'I'm always trying to catch the bouquet,"" she says. 'I am quite shy with guys and I've never been close to going down the aisle myself. 'My mum says I'll be able to meet eligible groomsmen at all these weddings and she's thrilled.' Jen, right getting ready to be bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in Florida, says she hopes attending lots of wedding will increase her own chances of finding Mr Right . Jen started by advertising her services on classified website Craigslist. And within a just a few hours she was inundated with messages. 'I said I could help carry the bride's dress and lift it when she needs to do things like go to the bathroom,' explains Jen. 'My services also included filling the dance floor as well as planning the hen do and the bridal shower. 'Right after I posted the ad my inbox blew up and it was crazy. 'I received responses from women in the UK, Australia, Vietnam, Turkey and Israel.' Jen admits she was taken aback by the huge demand. 'There were so many reasons for having a professional bridesmaid,' she explains. 'Some said their friends weren't very good at helping to plan the big day, others said their best friends were too far away to come to their wedding. 'Some people just didn't have any close friends.' Jen, here hugging a friend at the wedding of friend Mel Sutliff, has already received responses from women in the UK, Australia, Vietnam, Turkey and Israel . She adds: 'I was pretty shocked - I thought people would think I was crazy but women seem to really like the idea. 'It's the men who think I'm mad. They don't really know what goes in to being a bridesmaid and what hard work it actually is but I hope this will educate them.' Jen has yet to put a price on a day of her bridesmaid services . Jen, who has been a bridesmaid three times for friends and family, currently has two weddings booked in September this year with total strangers in New York who are paying her expenses - including travel and the dress. But she is yet to set a price for a day of bridesmaid duties. She says: 'It's all a matter of what the budget is and what the couple can pay me. 'I don't think having a professional bridesmaid should necessarily be expensive and I want to be able to work with all sorts of budgets."" As business booms, her surreal line of work has been compared to Hollywood film, 27 Dresses, where actress Katherine Heigl plays a wedding nut. 'A lot of people say my life is very much like the film,"" she says. 'My wardrobe is pretty full at the moment but I can see it being overrun with bridesmaid dresses in all colours and shapes.' And, like the film, Jen hopes her story will have a happy ending too in the form of a wedding of her own. 'I really would like to find Mr Right,' she admits. 'I just hope it's not a case of always the bridesmaid, never the bride.'","Started advertising her services on Craigslist for small fee .

"A new cardboard wine bottle has been created by a Californian-based team that is made from compressed recycled cardboard with a plastic liner inside. PaperBoy is the brainchild of packaging company Ecologic Brands and Truett-Hurst winery, and claims the carbon footprint of their 'molded pulp' bottles is 67 per cent smaller than that of its glass cousins, and weighs a whopping 85 per cent less. 'Campers, hikers, and fishermen can carry this lightweight package and enjoy premium wine from a 750-mL bottle almost anywhere,' CEO Phil Hurst explains in a statement to Fastco Design. Booze it up while saving the planet! Eco-friendly PaperBoy wine is packaged in compressed recycled cardboard, and is 85 per cent lighter than glass bottles . 'From mountaintops to impromptu pool parties. Heck, even the final frontier - space,' PaperBoy's website reads. Mr Hurst adds that the bottle is also collapsible, so it can easily be retained and returned to a recycling site following use. And while you are right in thinking that glass wine bottles are recyclable too, they only actually end up in recycling plants 28 per cent of the time, compared to paper, which has a 91 per cent recycling rate. Sleek design: 'From mountaintops to impromptu pool parties', PaperBoy wine is fully collapsible after use, so can be easily recycled . Ready to go! Although glass bottles are recyclable, they only end up in recycling plants 28 per cent of the time, compared to paper, which has a 91 per cent recycling rate . And there's more. Mr Hurst says that if the 207 million cases of wines shipped around the country each year were packaged in the light-weight PaperBoy bottle, it would save roughly 50 million gallons of diesel and 560,000 tons of CO2. The concept was originally dreamed up up by London-based designer Kevin Shaw, at packaging firm Stranger & Stranger. Mr Shaw coined the name and the Twenties-era styled cartoon design. 'How to save the planet with a paper bottle!' the label reads. Now that's something we can all drink to. PaperBoy is available in 44 states and sells a 2012 Paso Robles Red Blend and a 2012 Mendocino Chardonnay, both $14.99.","Weighs 85 per cent less than traditional glass bottles and features a plastic liner inside .

"Rory McIlroy just helped Europe win the Ryder Cup, and it appears he may be victorious in his love life as well. The Northern Irish golfer, 25, had a famous and beautiful supporter in the stands at Gleneagles on Sunday - South African actress and model Shashi Naidoo. Naidoo posed with McIlroy's family in a picture posted to the champion golfer's Instagram, and she posted other pictures out on the golf course to her account as well, in one shot riding a golf cart with McIlroy's mother Rosie. Scroll down for video . New flame for Rory? South African model/actress Sashi Naidoo posed for pictures with Rory McIlroy's family this weekend as the Northern Irish golfer competed in the Ryder Cup . Winner, winner: McIlroy (pictured) helped Team Europe win the Ryder Cup for an eighth year in a row at Gleneagles on Sunday . Family time: The South African model posted this picture on Instagram of her driving around Gleneagles with McIlroy's mother Rosie, which she later removed from the site . In an Instagram video of McIlroy making a key putt, the 33-year-old model writes: 'And that's how you do it! Rory McIlroy 8th hole.' The World Number One played a key role in Europe's victory over the U.S. over the weekend and was caught starting the celebrations early yesterday when a bottle of champagne popped prematurely, spraying all over him and Graeme McDowell. McIlroy famously broke off his engagement to ex-girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki this past May, just days after sending out their wedding invitations. Wozniacki, a Danish professional tennis player, later revealed that McIlroy broke up with her in a short phone call and hasn't talked to her since. The tennis pro recently made a slight at McIlroy's short stature in the press, saying in one interview that she was looking forward to dating a taller man she can wear heels next to. Former long-term love: McIlroy last dated Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, but abruptly broke off their engagement with a phone call last May . Naidoo pictured on the left at the 2012 Virgin Active Sports Industry Awards and on the beach in St Tropez . Shortly after their high-profile split, McIlroy was rumoured to have struck up a relationship with 25-year-old Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde. After being introduced by mutual friends last year, the pair remained tight-lipped about whether or not they were exclusive. But the golfer famously missed a practice session in the run up to the Open when he learnt that Miss Forde had been involved in a serious car crash - flipping her Fiat 500 Abarth six times on the M40. Fashionista: Naidoo, pictured in a selfie posted to her Instagram, writes her own fashion blog called Shashi's Closet . The South African beauty also uploaded this picture of her and Sir Alex Ferguson to her Instagram account at the weekend with the message: 'Got to walk a few rounds of golf with Sir Alex Ferguson. What a legend!' Summer romance: Irish model Nadia Forde, 25, was introduced to McIlroy following his split from Caroline Wozniacki and the pair were rumoured to have struck up a relationship . And he was later seen out partying with the pretty brunette in Liverpool in July following his triumph in the tournament. Despite the summer romance, McIlroy now claims he has refocused himself on his golf game, and it appears to have paid off with the recent Ryder Cup win. McIlory spoke with the BBC the day before the Europe versus America championship, saying 'golf is my girlfriend at the minute'. 'I'm at the stage of my career and the stage of my life when I'm putting golf first.,' he said. 'Golf is the priority for me right now. For the foreseeable future that is what it is going to be.' Previously close:  McIlroy cancelled a practice session in the run up to the Open back in July when he learnt that Miss Foorde had been in a car crash . He also talked about how his golf career would make it hard to start any relationship right now: 'We're never really in the same place for very long. It is hard to keep relationships going [even] if you want to start one.' Naidoo, meanwhile, appears to be single after divorcing husband Marc Sandler in 2011. Earlier today, the model took to Twitter to deny rumours that she was McIlroy's new love interest. She posted: 'I am NOT dating Rory Mcllroy or any other golfer for that matter. I was in Scotland supporting Team Europe at the Ryder Cup.' Naidoo is famous in South Africa for co-hosting a magazine show called 20Something, and for being named the celebrity winner of a reality show called Tropika Island of Treasure. She also owns modelling agency, Alushi, who represented Reeva Steenkamp before she was killed by her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day last year. Victor: Rory was seen with Miss Forde outside the trendy Empire nightclub in Liverpool (above) following his Open triumph in the summer but he now appears to have a new love interest in Shashi Naidoo . In the days after Miss Steenkamp's death, Naidoo said: 'It's still a big shock to us. I've known Reeva for years and she was an incredible, beautiful soul. It's shocking. An amazing girl has gone too soon.' She also writes a well-followed fashion blog called Shashi's Closet. But a traumatic experience appears to have taken Naidoo to Scotland this weekend. South Africa's Sunday Tribune reports that Naidoo was attacked in her upscale Johannesburg home on September 21, while she was sleeping. Naidoo woke up to the attacker, and was able to fight him off and push a panic button to get help. However, the attacker escaped and stole some of Naidoo's property including an iPad. Her father, Harry Naidoo, told the Tribune that his daughter was seriously rattled by the break-in and went to Scotland to 'clear her mind'. She is due back in South Africa today.","Rory McIlroy, 25, helped Europe win the Ryder Cup on Sunday, with the support of South African model Shashi Naidoo .

"Chinese councillor Zhong Xiefei died after drinking rice wine while out at lunch on his first day at work . A Chinese councillor died on his first day at work after drinking too much at lunch with his new colleagues. The deputy county chief in Guangxi suffered alcohol poisoning after indulging at lunchtime. Local media reported that Zhong Xiefei drank rice wine with other provincial and county-level chiefs on his first day, April 9. It is understood Zhong's family found him sleeping later that night, noting he was snoring loudly, giving them no cause for concern, reported shanghaiist.com. But at 6am the next day, he was found dead in his bed. On Monday, the authorities concluded that Zhong had died from excessive alcohol consumption. The seven other officials who joined him to drink were fired. In November an official from Heilongjjang province was suspended from the Communist Party after one of his party guests died from drinking too much at a banquet he had organised. A month later, another official was suspended after a school visit descended into a drinking party leaving an administrator dead in Peng'am county, Sichuan. President Xi Jinping's administration has launched a crackdown on similar events, trying to curb the number of extravagant banquets. Since the action was taken sales of moutai have dropped significantly and wine has replaced liquor at official dinners. Rice wine is made from fermentation of rice starch, converting it into sugars. It typically has a higher alcohol content - between 18 and 25 per cent - than wine made from grapes, which is between 9 and 16 per cent. It is commonly used in Chinese and other Asian cuisine. A common substitute used is pale dry sherry.

"Ingenious: The iPhone Gramophone uses a simple horn attached to a hardwood base to amplify the phone's tinny speakers by three or four times . For the mobile gadget enthusiast who nonetheless loves to have that period look at home, one U.S. designer has come up with the ultimate iPhone dock. The iPhone Gramophone borrows the iconic analogue horn speaker from the earliest sound playback devices and uses it to amplify the sound from Apple gadgets' weedy speakers. Simply place your iPad or iPhone in the solid walnut base and the metal horn will boost the volume of the gadget's speakers by three or four times - with no need for electricity. The retro device is the brainchild of Matt Richmond, a San Francisco-based furniture designer who built the original prototype from a Twenties horn speaker bought from an East Bay antiques shop. 'I found this old Victrola horn that had a shape I really loved, and I thought, ""How cool would it be if I could use this with my phone?"",' he said. 'I held up my phone to the opening on the speaker, and I could immediately tell it was something that would work.' Taking a heavy piece of hardwood, Mr Richmond carved a hole for the horn, a slot for his phone, and a channel to connect the two. The result was a elegant but functional iPhone speaker dock, with no battery or plug required. The nascent product needed little in the way of marketing: everyone who saw Mr Richmond's original device wanted one of their own and soon, after word reached the internet, he had more orders than he could hope to fill. So Mr Richmond refined his designs and teamed up with luxury brand Restoration Hardware to bring his product to a wider audience. Compatibility: With a base hand-crafted from solid walnut, the Gramophone accepts all iPhone models - the new connector on the iPhone 5 poses no technical problems for its iron and brass horn . Inspired: The retro device is the brainchild of Matt Richmond, a San Francisco-based furniture designer who built the original prototype from a Twenties horn speaker bought from an East Bay antiques shop . With a base hand-crafted from solid walnut, the retail version of the iPhone Gramophone accepts all iPhone models - the new connector on the iPhone 5 poses no technical problems for its iron and brass horn. Like Mr Richmond's original prototype it needs no electricity or batteries, and so can be used wherever its owner bothers to heft it. However, its old-school amplification technology means its not for head bangers. 'It’s not overpowering, so it’s great in the background,' Mr Richmond said. 'And it’s directional – you can point the horn where you want the sound. If you put it in a corner it’ll really fill a room.'

"A UK company is set to revolutionise the future of commercial air travel with a windowless plane that allows passengers to choose panoramic views of the world around them or swipe a touch screen to surf the internet or check their email from 35,000ft. Windows would be replaced with ultra-thin and highly-flexible screens that would display outside scenery captured by cameras attached to the plane’s exterior or act as a personal touch screen computer. The concept is the brainchild of the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) and is still in its design phase, but developers believe it could become the world’s first windowless commercial aircraft in the next ten years. Scroll down for video . Windows would be replaced with ultra-thin and highly-flexible screens that would display outside scenery . Passengers in the 'window seat' would be able to surf the internet or check their email on the wall screen . Passengers in the ‘window seat’ would be able to choose their view or use the full-length screens as an in-flight entertainment system, while those with middle or aisle seats would be able to access the futuristic system on a screen embedded in the head rest in front of them. Views displayed on the high-definition screens would be capable of changing as the passenger moves his or her eyes. In addition to providing entertainment, the screens fitted directly into the fuselage or into the wall panels, would provide subtle cabin lighting from gently glowing walls and could be switched on or off. The system could help to offset jet lag as lighting panels would allow passengers to control colour changes associated with sunrise and sunset. That would help them to adjust to time zone changes on long-haul journeys, according to CPI. Flying into the future: CPI said its windowless plane would be lighter and would translate into reduced costs . But the screens are not just for the enjoyment of passengers as they are designed to reduce aircraft weight and costs for both airlines and travellers . CPI said the fuselage would be lighter without windows and that would translate into fuel savings, fewer harmful emissions and lower operating costs for airlines. Ultimately it could mean lower fares and wider seats for passengers. For every one per cent reduction in weight the approximate fuel saving is 0.75 per cent. CPI said there would be more cabin room without windows and that could result in more leg room for travellers . The system would allow passengers to control colour changes associated with sunrise and sunset . Even though they are incredibly futuristic CPI believes the screens could be produced at a cost that is unlikely to be any more than current displays. The company said it will take around five years before the screens, using organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), are ready for full production. Based in north-east England, CPI is a member of the UK’s High Value Manufacturing Catapult, which is aimed at spurring development in new and emerging technologies. With government funding CPI works with firms to create new products, including the OLED screens at its facility in Sedgefield, County Durham.","Windows would be replaced with ultra-thin and highly-flexible screens .

"Probe: The Justice Department is investigating alleged misdeeds by DEA workers in Colombia unrelated to the Secret Service scandal . A new investigation may reveal that the Secret Service isn’t the only government agency that has hired prostitutes for Colombian sex romps. The Justice Department Inspector General's office said Monday it is investigating possible misconduct by three Drug Enforcement Administration workers in Colombia unrelated to the Secret Service incident with prostitutes at a Cartagena hotel that erupted last month. The agency said the probe began based on info provided by the Secret Service and that the DEA is making its employees available for interviews by the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigators. CBS News reported that three DEA agents were under investigation for allegedly hiring prostitutes in Cartagena. In a statement to the network, Justice Department spokesman Jay Lerner said: 'The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General is investigating allegations about potential misconduct by Drug Enforcement Administration personnel in Colombia, unrelated to the Cartagena hotel Secret Service incident.' The IG said it is receiving full cooperation from the DEA and that the IG is coordinating the investigation with the Homeland Security Department's inspector general, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and the Secret Service. The DEA, which enforces U.S. controlled-substance laws, has permanent offices in Colombia. The Bogota-based DEA regional director, who oversees the Cartagena office, did not immediately return email or cellphone messages. The woman who brought down the Secret Service: Dania Suarez is pictured during a radio interview about the Secret Service prostitution scandal . Seedy: The U.S. Secret Service agent allegedly took Miss Suarez to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe after agreeing to pay her $800 for sex . A statement to CBS from the DEA said: ""DEA takes allegations of misconduct very seriously and will take appropriate personnel action, if warranted, upon the conclusion of the OIG investigation."" In the Secret Service probe, investigators have interviewed the Colombia prostitute at the center of the affair, Dania Londono Suarez. She said a dispute over payment led to the April 12 incident becoming public. Party: Dania Suarez has said she was swindled by the U.S. agent who agreed to pay her for sex . One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez, she said in a recent interview. She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash', dinero' to get the point across. She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do. The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'. The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door. Police became involved, setting off a Secret Service investigation . A dozen Secret Service officers and supervisors and 12 other U.S. military personnel have been implicated in the incident, which took place before President Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas. Eight people with the Secret Service, including two supervisors, have been axed from their posts as a result of their involvement. The Secret Service is moving to permanently revoke the security clearance for one other employee, and three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing. Prostitution is legal in Colombia.

"A movie fan has renovated one of the most famous buildings in Star Wars after it was in danger of being lost forever.

"A female former MP has been accused of abusing a schoolboy at a drug-fuelled Westminster sex party in the 1980s. Her alleged victim has claimed he was forced to perform a sex act on the woman politician at one of a number of parties, where it is alleged that children as young as 13 were abused. Andrew Ash, now 45, has claimed that as a teenager he was regularly taken to London from northern England, where he was in care, to attend the depraved parties. Allegations: Andrew Ash, now 45, has told Scotland Yard that he was abused by a former female MP at a drug-fuelled Westminster sex party . Mr Ash told the Sunday Express newspaper that he has passed the name of the former MP, who can not be named for legal reasons, to the Metropolitan Police. He has alleged that the depraved parties were organised by a paedophile ring involving David Smith, Jimmy Savile's  former chauffeur who was found dead on the day he was due to stand trial for child sex crimes uncovered by Operation Yewtree. Mr Ash said that a number of politicians and celebrities, including Savile, attended the parties, where drugs such as cocaine and speed would be supplied to revellers, as well as bottles of champagne. Involved: Mr Ash alleged that the depraved parties were organised by a paedophile ring involving David Smith (pictured), Jimmy Savile's former chauffeur . He said that the woman MP had been drunk at the time of the assault, and had been laughing as she carried out the abuse. 'I didn’t really know what was going on but the others around her were goading her on', he told the Sunday Express, adding that he felt 'humilated'. Last year police were believed to have seized video footage and photographs allegedly taken at a sex party from a well-known paedophile. Mr Ash claimed that there is footage showing a senior male MP in the same frame as him, although no abuse can be seen taking place. He said he had been interviewed for 70 hours by the Met Police’s Paedophile Unit, both at a safe house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire and in London, but said he is frustrated by a lack of action. Mr Ash said he was molested by the male MP on another occasion, who abused him an a garage behind a Rolls-Royce. 'Another politician turned up with a video camera but the man abusing me just smirked and joked, ""OK, OK, I’ll vote any way you want"" as if he was being blackmailed. What I want to know is why they haven’t arrested him yet if they have this evidence,' he said. Mr Ash said that as well as speaking to police officers during his interviews, he believes that intelligence officers, who had been made aware of the high-profile names he had accused, were also present. Dutch officials also sat in on at least one interview as Mr Ash claimed to have been taken to Amsterdam several times to be abused by paedophiles including convicted child killer Sidney Cooke. He says Cooke, now 84, made him film the abuse of another young boy. Claims: Mr Ash said that a number of politicians and celebrities, including Jimmy Savile, attended the parties, where drugs such as cocaine and speed would be supplied to revellers, as well as bottles of champagne . Mr Ash also told police he was abused by a famous celebrity. He said: 'This particular person was able to get youngsters into glitzy nightclubs in the West End. After one evening he invited me and a young girl back to his house where he made us have sex before joining in.' A spokesman from the Met Police said the force would not be commenting on the allegations.","Andrew Ash claims he was forced to perform a sex act on the woman .

"Britain will be accused by 180 Iraqis next week of breaching international law by torturing and killing prisoners during the controversial Iraq War. Lawyers representing the group - who claim they are victims of abuse or their family members were unlawfully killed - will accuse the UK of a 'systemic' policy of abuse committed between 2003 and 2008. The case - which will be heard in the High Court from January 29 - will see British soldiers and intelligence officers accused of unlawful interrogation practices. Controversial: Britain will be accused by 180 Iraqis next week of breaching international law by torturing and killing prisoners during the controversial Iraq War . Lawyers acting for the group will place a file of statements before two judges which details alleged use of 'stress positions' and  hooding as well as beating, sexual abuse and religious abuse of illegally detained prisoners. Some of the claims made in the . statements are incredibly shocking with sexual depravity and insults to . Islam featuring strongly. In one case, a soldier is alleged to . have masturbated over a prisoner while another is alleged to have . committed sodomy with his finger. The High Court will also be told how . female interrogators stripped and feigned seduction in exchange for . information from prisoners. Worrying: The death of Baha Mousa, an innocent  hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003, is just the tip of the iceberg, it will be claimed next week. He is pictured with his family . According to The Observer, the court . will hear that in some cases, the torture led to the death of a . prisoner. The claims come just weeks away from the 10th anniversary of the . war in Iraq. The court . will rule on whether the alleged abuses were isolated and were unaware . to commanders, politicians and senior Ministry of Defence officials or whether they were . authorised as policy. The statements from the group which will . be presented to the court were complied by human rights lawyer Phil . Shiner, from the Public Interest Lawyers group. He held meetings with victims and their relatives - mostly in Lebanon - were he heard the allegations of abuse. The Ministry of Defence has always maintained that issues around interrogation and detention during the Iraq War were dealt with at the inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa, an innocent  hotel worker killed whilst in British custody in Basra in 2003. Accuser: The statements from the group of Iraqis which will be presented to the court were complied by human rights lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, from the Public Interest Lawyers group . The driving forces behind the case at the High Court next week are a human rights lawyer and an author. The group of Iraqis who make the . allegations of abuse against British soldiers are represented by human . rights lawyer Phil Shiner. He works for the Birmingham-based . Public Interest Lawyers group and has a reputation for working on issues concerning international, environmental and human rights law. Mr Shiner has also written numerous articles on international and human rights law. Much of the evidence which will be heard . by the High Court next week was taken by him following meetings in the . Lebanon with the alleged victims and their families. He has previously accused the . Ministry of Defence (MoD) of 'deploying every dirty trick in the book' to avoid accountability over the treatment of soldiers in Iraq. Speaking previously, he said: 'There must be a judicial inquiry into the UK's detention policy in south-east Iraq. 'The MoD has deployed every dirty . trick in the book to prevent accountability for the hundreds of torture . and unlawful killings cases of Iraqi civilians.' Mr Shiner also represented the victims in the Baha Mousa Public Inquiries. He was the 'Human Rights Lawyer of the Year' in 2004, as designated by Liberty and Justice. Andrew Williams, who is the . author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa, has also been campaigning for 'the truth' into allegations of abuse. He wrote A Very British Killing: The Death of Baha Mousa which was published in October last year. A description of the book claims it . tells the 'inside story' of the death and examines 'institutional . brutality' and a 'flawed military police inquiry' into the death. His . book claims that the death of Baha Mousa was not about 'a few bad men' or 'rotten apples'. The High Court hearing is scheduled over three days from January 29. The MOD also has its own internal probe into alleged abuse through its Iraq Historic Allegations Team. But Andrew Williams, who is the . author of a book on the death of Baha Mousa , told The Observer that his . death was just the tip of the iceberg. 'This . is the crucial moment of decision', he said. 'This is our last chance . to get to the truth of what happened. This is what we demand of others, . but we do not demand it of ourselves.' The court will be told of five 'state practices' which the lawyers will claim were 'unlawful, right to the top'. They claim illegal interrogation techniques were taught at Chicksands, near London, which is an army intelligence facility. Many . of the alleged incidents happened while prisoners were being held in . custody, although it will be claimed that some took place at people's . homes .","The group will accuse the UK of a 'systemic' policy of abuse over five years .

"It may sound like something from 2011 thriller Limitless, but researchers have discovered a pill that helps adults learn new skills as quickly as children. A professor at Harvard rewired the brain of a visually impaired women to process images by giving her Alzheimer’s drug donepezil. The pill boosts chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin and acetylcholine, which are both found in high concentrations in the brains of young children. In 2011 thriller Limitless, Bradley Cooper, pictured centre, takes a pill that opens up closed regions of his brain. This boost his intelligence, motor skills and ability to learn new languages . These chemicals naturally reduce with age. Children under seven develop new skills rapidly because their brains go through what’s called ‘critical periods’ of development. Due to high levels of certain chemicals and the fast growth of the brain, young children learn new languages, absorb information and pick up musical skills, for example, much faster than adults. In adults, these skills become harder as the brain reaches peak development and loses this ‘elasticity’. In Limitless, Bradley Cooper takes a pill that opens up closed regions of his brain to boost his intelligence, motor skills and more. The drug donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. This means it increases the amount of acetylcholine around nerve endings and helps boost brain function. Professor Takao Hensch gave donepezil to a 14-year-old girl called Shannon, a patient at the Boston Children’s Hospital. Shannon has a condition called amblyopia that impairs her vision, also known as a ‘lazy eye.’ Children develop new skills rapidly as their brains go through 'critical periods' of development. This means they learn new languages, absorb information and pick up musical skills much faster than adults. In adults, these skills become harder as the brain reaches peak development and loses this 'elasticity' In December, Professor Hensch used an . epilepsy drug called valproate to teach tone-deaf adults how to pick out . different musical notes. The men who took part in the experiment had no musical training as children and were asked to perform online tasks to train their ears. After two weeks of the exercises, they were tested on their ability to differentiate tones to see if the training had more effect than it typically does for men of their age. Participants . who took valproate were able to correctly identify an average of . 5.09 notes, while people in a control group could only identify 3.5. Following tests with donepezil, Shannon was able to process images with her affected eye, in the same way a newborn would. In December, Professor Hensch similarly used an epilepsy drug called valproate to teach tone-deaf adults how to pick out different musical notes. Participants who took the valproate were able to correctly identify an average of 5.09 notes, while people in a control group could only identify 3.5. ‘The brain is not losing its plasticity forever as we grow older,’ Professor Hensch told The Atlantic. ‘Instead, it throws on the brakes at certain times. It’s the brain’s job to be elastic, and it wants to rewire. 'But through evolution, it’s created a lot of molecules to make sure it doesn’t rewire too much.’ He continued: ‘Much of our adult behaviour reflects the neural circuits sculpted by experience in infancy and early childhood. ‘At no other time in life does the surrounding environment so potently shape brain function - from basic motor skills, sensation or sleep to higher cognitive processes like language. ‘How this plasticity waxes and wanes with age carries an impact far beyond neuroscience, including education policy, therapeutic approaches to developmental disorders or strategies for recovery from brain injury in adulthood.’","Donepezil is used to improve memory function in Alzheimer’s patients .

"The evidence for 'Planet X' - the mysterious hypothesised planet on the edge of our solar system - has taken a new turn thanks to the mathematics of a noted astronomer. Rodney Gomes, an astronomer at the National Observatory of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, says the irregular orbits of small icy bodies beyond Neptune imply that a planet four times the size of Earth is swirling around our sun in the fringes of the solar system. Planet X - perhaps mis-named now that Pluto has been demoted to a dwarf planet - has been widely hypothesised for decade, but has never been proven. Gomes measured the orbits of 92 Kuiper belt objects - small bodies and dwarf planets - and said that six objects appeared to be tugged off-course compared to their expected orbits. The hypothetical planet - four times the size of Earth - will float beyond Neptune and Pluto and cause disturbances in the Kuiper belt of asteroids . He told astronomers at the American Astronomical Society on Tuesday that the most likely reason for the irregular orbits was a 'planetary-mass solar companion' - a distant body of planet size that is powerful enough to move the Kuiper belt objects. He suggested the planet would be four times bigger than Earth - around the size of Nepture and would be 140 billion miles from the sun, or about 1,500 times further than the Earth. Alternatively an object the size of Mars on an irregular orbit that bought it to within five billion miles of the sun - close to Neptune's orbit - could be the solution. However, due to the distances involved, it will be tough to for Earthbound astronomers to catch a glimpse of the hypothetical newest member of our solar system. Even non-planet Pluto is hard to spot thanks to the distances involved. The Kuiper belt lies on the outskirts of our solar system, and calculations imply a planet also lurks out there . The solar system as we know it, showing (l-r), Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune . While other astronomers are on the astronomical fence, they have applauded his methods. Rory Barnes, from the University of Washington told National Geographic  that Gomes 'has laid out a way to determine how such a planet could sculpt parts of our solar system. 'So while, yes, the evidence doesn't exist yet, I thought the bigger point was that he showed us that there are ways to find that evidence. 'I don't think he really has any evidence that suggests it is out there.' Hal Levison, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said: 'It seems surprising to me that a [solar] companion as small as Neptune could have the effect he sees. '[But] I know Rodney, and I'm sure he did the calculations right.' The previous ninth planet, Pluto, is one of the largest of the Kuiper belt dwarf planets, at some 1,400 miles wide. It got downgraded by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 for failing to meet all the criteria of a 'planet', namely that its mass is not sufficient enough to clear its orbit of surrounding objects.","Distortion to orbits of asteroids beyond Pluto imply mystery planet is tugging at them, claims astronomer ."
"If you're looking for the ultimate body and soul boost, we suggest a sip of 'miracle tree' juice. Moringa Green Superleaf Powder, produced by superfood brand Aduna, is not only packed with health-elevating nutrients but 10 per cent of profits are channeled back to help farmers in Africa too. What's not to love? The powder is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle tree’ – one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet. The superfood phenomenon has been found to boost immunity, lower blood pressure, alleviate stress, fight fatigue, improve digestive health and increase libido. And that's just on the inside. It's also a tonic for the hair, nails and skin. Aduna's Moringa Green Superleaf Powder (left) is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle tree’ (right) one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet . Aduna, meaning 'life' or 'world' in the local language of The Gambia and Senegal, is a food brand with a difference - ten per cent of profits is channeled back to help farmers in Africa . Aduna, meaning 'life' or 'world' in Wolof, the local language of The Gambia and Senegal, is a food brand with a difference. 'Our mission is to breathe the vibrancy of Africa into the daily lives of people around the world, whilst creating a virtuous circle that feeds positive impacts back to the source,' explains Andrew Hunt, Aduna Co-Founder and Managing Director. That virtuous cycle means that whilst you're giving your body some African-grown tlc, the farmers in Africa who grow this type of crop are receiving some tlc back. In rural areas of Africa, women supply the vast majority of labour for harvesting and processing crops. And in North Ghana where Aduna have their processing centre, women provide up to 80% of labour. 'Aduna’s core business model is designed to create demand for the under-utilised, but extraordinary, natural products cultivated by these small farmers, who are generally surviving on less than $1 a day,' says Andrew. In North Ghana where Aduna have their processing centre, women provide up to 80% of labour . 'More than seventy percent of Africa’s one billion plus population live in rural areas. From this huge number, ninety percent depend on small or micro-scale farming as their primary source of livelihood. It would be fair to say that agriculture is the lifeblood of Africa,' he adds. So what makes moringa so miraculous? It contains almost 25% protein including all nine of the essential amino acids, which helps to support the building blocks of proteins required for optimum growth, repair and maintenance of healthy skin cells. It provides 13 essential vitamins and minerals at RDA levels, including skin-supporting vitamins A, E, riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), phosphorus and zinc, which have beauty benefits for strong, supple healthy skin, nails and hair. Moringa is a drought-resistant and fast-growing crop which makes it an ideal and sustainable income-generating activity for the remote rural producers that Aduna was created to support . Moringa also boasts an exceptional antioxidant profile including vitamins and phytochemicals (plant chemicals), which can help to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. The tree is more potent than other antioxidant rich superfoods and has six times the antioxidant content of goji berries. No wonder celebrity like Lily Cole and Livia Firth are fans of the superfood powder. Moringa is a drought-resistant and fast-growing crop which can be harvested in just six weeks after planting and is also perennial. That's what makes it an ideal and sustainable income-generating activity for the remote rural producers that Aduna was created to support. Aduna's Moringa Green Superleaf Powder is officially the fastest-selling superfood in the UK . Every part of the moringa tree is valuable: from the seeds that are used for purifying water or producing rich cosmetic oils, to the bark, roots and flowers and, of course, the leaves. Once cut the leaves must not be touched by sunlight, so are harvested in moonlight. The leaves are then washed in purified water and naturally shade-dried. At this stage of the process, the nutritional value of the leaf increases significantly, up to over ten times that of fresh leaves. Since landing in London's top department stores, Selfridges and Liberty's, and on the shelves in Holland & Barrett stores nationwide (£7.99), Aduna's Moringa Green Superleaf Powder is officially the fastest-selling superfood in the UK.","Aduna Moringa Green Superleaf Powder is made from the naturally-dried leaf of the moringa ‘miracle tree’

It has found ‘possible tacit co-ordination’ on prices, with the ‘Big Six’ firms apparently moving tariffs up and down at the same time. Specifically, there is new evidence that they are quick to raise prices when costs rise but slow to reduce them. Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months, but the Big Six – British Gas, SSE, Eon, Npower, Scottish Power and EDF – are delaying passing this on. Soaring: This graph shows how average energy bills have risen over the past few years . Static: Fewer people switch energy suppliers after apparently giving up hope of getting a better deal . Supplies: Energy prices have risen beyond inflation as the profits of the Big Six have climbed upwards . The watchdog said the firms were also penalising long-serving customers by routinely charging them higher tariffs. Ofgem . said: ‘Profit increases and recent price rises have intensified public . distrust of suppliers and highlight the need for a market investigation . to clear the air.’ The . CMA could decide to break up the Big Six, with power generation and . supply separated from the business that sells electricity and gas to the . public. But Mr Laidlaw set a bomb under the process by suggesting . the inquiry, which will take two years, could have disastrous . consequences. He said energy firms were likely to delay investing in new . power stations if there was a risk of the firms being split. Ofgem . has already forecast that spare electricity capacity – the difference . between power station output and peak demand – could fall as low as 2 . per cent by 2015-16. Asked if that situation would now worsen, Mr . Laidlaw said: ‘It’s just become more difficult, clearly, because we’re . now going to have to wait until we see the outcome of this review.’ The . lack of meaningful competition means many families and pensioners are . paying as much as £250 a year too much. Yet between 2009 and 2012, . energy firm profits rose 410 per cent to nearly £1.2billion – as bills . increased by 12.5 per cent. Energy Secretary Ed Davey dismissed the blackout warnings as ‘absolutely and utterly wrong’.‘The . lights will stay on,’ he said. ‘We are seeing record levels of . investment in energy. Independent generators are coming in.’ He insisted . that while Centrica may cut back on building power stations, there were . plenty of firms willing to fill the void. Ofgem director Dermot Nolan warned of a new aggressive regime of fines if firms failed customers.He . said: ‘We are disturbed by the rising level of profit. If competition . is working effectively it should be pushing profit margins down and . forcing efficiency improvements.’ John Robertson, a Labour MP and . member of the Commons energy select committee, added: ‘Scare stories . from people like Sam Laidlaw are simply untrue. This is blackmail.’ Ed . Miliband will say in a speech today that high energy costs ‘stifle’ small firms on which the economic recovery depends. He will say . family businesses have lost out from this week’s price freeze by SSE, . which is only for households. And firms do not have the same protection . from rogue practices as domestic customers. If Labour wins the next . election, it will set up a new energy regulator which would ban . suppliers from rolling customers on to more expensive tariffs without . their consent. 1) Regular meter readings. Make sure you check every time you receive a bill, rather than relying on an estimate by your energy provider's estimate. 2) Change to online bills. You could save up to 10 per cent. 3) Avoid . prepayment meters if you can, and swap to a billed meter. Even if you have . to pay to get one, it's probably worth it for the savings you'll gain. 4) If you're in financial trouble . some . companies offer special deals, which help ease any difficulties you . might be facing. But don't just assume this will be the cheapest option - . make sure you still do your homework. 5) Dual fuel (gas and . electricity from the same supplier) is not always the cheapest option. 6) Monthly direct debit payments could save you five to 10 per cent as companies are more confident that customers won't default and . earn interest on any overpayments. Check any extra payments are refunded at the end . of the year. 7) Move beyond the Big Six. Some of the best tariffs are now offered by smaller providers such as . First Utility, Ovo Energy and Spark Energy. In a recent survey, Good . Energy and Ecotricity topped the table for best service with 82 per cent . customer satisfaction.","Centrica boss says industry likely to stop building power stations .

"For Russell Brand, it seems being a self-styled anti-capitalist revolutionary really does pay the bills. The left-wing comedian's new Revolution book has enjoyed monumental sales - earning the star and his publishers a staggering £230,000 in just 11 days. The sales figures may further fuel his reputation as 'a champagne socialist' - a label he was given by Twitter users after ducking out of left-wing demonstrations in London on Wednesday night to head to an exclusive celebrity-packed West End party. Scroll down for video . 'Champagne socialist': Russell Brand was slammed on Twitter after ducking out of left-wing demonstrations in London on Wednesday night to head to an exclusive celebrity-packed West End party . Brand appeared on ITV's Lorraine this morning to promote his children's book , a version of the Pied Piper of Hamelin . Comic Russell Brand claims he is to record an Oasis song as a response to those who have been treating his rants like the lyrics to Blur hit Parklife. The star has found that his Twitter messages featuring his thoughts on society have prompted others to add the word Parklife because they sound like the rambling lines of the Blur song released in 1994. Brand said he was not offended by the mickey-taking but was planning to team up with Noel Gallagher to record a version of the hit Roll With It by Oasis, who were famously Blur's chart rivals and had a high profile battle to top the charts 19 years ago. Since Dan Parker posted the tweet (top), social media users, including Nigel Farage, have mocked Brand for the wordy narrative in his book. Today the comedian failed to see the funny side as he responded to the Ukip leader . The joke, which came from Twitter user Dan Barker, was even retweeted by Nigel Farage today - and Brand quickly hit back at the Ukip leader showing a severe sense of humour failure. But in an interview with radio station Magic, he told presenter Jo Parkerson: 'I'm a comedian, and I make all my living out of mucking around and talking, and I've certainly tormented people in the past. So yeah, I don't mind that, I think - unless it's malicious.' He pointed out that his sidekick from his old Radio 2 show, Matt Morgan, had similarly said 'Parklife' many years ago when he launched into a rant. Brand went on: 'I don't know Damon Albarn particularly, but I've spoken to Noel Gallagher and we plan to respond with a Roll With It single. I'll say 'Roll with it' after every seven words.' The comedian and actor said his old pal Gallagher would not be attending his live show at the Royal Albert Hall in London next week. 'I've not invited him, because he's not been supportive enough lately, ' he said. 'If he's seen anywhere near the vicinity, I'm going to have someone grab him by the eyebrow, tie a kite to it, and send him off into the ether.' Official figures from Neilsen Bookscan show that the book has already sold 22,119 copies since its launch on October 23. So far it has only been released in hardback and its retail price is £20 - although it is available at much cheaper on Amazon and other Internet sellers. It is published by Century Publishing, whose owners Pearson PLC are the largest education company and book publisher in the world - and owners of the Financial Times. One publishing expert said: 'It's an awful lot of money to turnaround in such a short period.' Popular: Revolution has already raked in £230,000 for Brand and his publishers . The book has been panned by critics who laid into the wordy comedian for his naïve and insulting views. In the book, he questions why companies export cars, why Julian Assange is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy and compares the country's workers to Josef Fritzl's daughter. On Wednesday night, Brand joined  thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators as they descended on Westminster for a protest which saw scuffles with police. The star - who quit drink and drugs 13 years ago - was spotted donning one of the Guy Fawkes masks widely used by members of radical groups. Brand - who is worth £9million - said he wanted to see a 'loving, peaceful protest' and told activists: 'Stay cool, stay cool. I think you should be careful. Don't get beaten up and arrested tonight.' He then left the protest early to join celebrities including fellow comedians Jimmy Carr and David Walliams in the West End for the press night of Made In Dagenham at the Adelphi Theatre. Many took to Twitter to criticise the millionaire. Sophie Lak tweeted: 'Russell Brand loves a revolution but then leaves demonstration early to go to a celeb freebie party #fakeass.' And Stephen Baker posted: 'I wonder if anti capitalism Russell Brand was driven there by his Chauffeur in the Merc? What a hypocrite.' The star also came under criticism recently when it emerged that his film project is being backed by bankers. Hefty profits: The comedian, thought to be worth around £9million, appeared on Lorraine today . It was revealed that Mayfair Film Partnership had raised nearly £1 million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers and Premier League footballer Wes Brown to make the documentary about Brand. Investors were enticed with generous tax breaks to support the film, portraying Brand, 39, as a ‘troubled visionary’ seeking to change the world. He has previously called for an 'orgy of banker bashing'. Talking about the financial crisis he added: 'When looking for the culprits look for the people who have got loads of bonuses and loads of money, they're the people that are criminal, they're the people that need to be prosecuted.' And in his book, Revolution, he calls for the abolition of debt and states saying: 'When people say, ""the system works"" they mean ""the system works for me."" The slags.' He has previously declared on Newsnight: ‘David Cameron says profit isn’t a dirty word. Well I say profit is a filthy word.’ These trenchant positions appear at odds with his use of venture capital to finance the upcoming film as well as the hefty sum he will pocket from book sales. Film backed by bankers: It recently emerged that the star's documentary about himself was made by Mayfair Film Partnership - which raised nearly £1 million from wealthy capitalists including investment bankers .

"Children can now build their own drug dens with a shocking new play kit inspired by TV show Breaking Bad. The sell-out £160 kit, branded 'SuperLab', lets any child or adult recreate Walter White's notorious crystal meth lab. Complete with protective masks, drug paraphernalia, figurines and a version of the car from the show, infants can even reenact scenes from the series. The toy looks similar to a classic Lego set, although it is not connected to the Danish company in any way and was made by a separate firm. 'Bricking Bad' allows children - or adults - to construct the industrial meth lab set up by Walter White and drug boss Gustavo Fring . The 500-brick set, made by Citizen Brick in the United States, comes complete with figures of the main characters and enables you to build the entire meth lab . The RV used by the characters to rustle up their drugs. Customers are given all the drugs paraphernalia with the kit . Outraged commentators took to Twitter to speak out against the bizarre toy. Jeff Myers tweeted: 'Made for children raised by parents who should know better.' Jacques Gonzales added: 'Definitely not for kiddies!' The drama, in its fifth and final series, follows chemistry teacher Walter White on his journey to raise money for his family's future when he is diagnosed with lung cancer. The schemer from Albuquerque, played by Bryan Cranston, enlists the help of a former pupil Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul. A global hit, it is hailed by critics and watched by millions around the world. Drug boss Gustavo Fring (left) and police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (right) have been fashioned into figurines .

"Thinking about getting that dolphin tattoo you've always wanted? Check the bottle first. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to tattoo parlors, their customers and those buying at-home tattoo kits that not all tattoo ink is safe. Last month, California company White and Blue Lion Inc. recalled inks in in-home kits after testing confirmed bacterial contamination in unopened bottles. Alarming: The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that not all tattoo ink is safe . Liquid menace: The ink can carry bacteria that can spread through the bloodstream . At least one skin infection has been linked to the company's products, and FDA officials say they are aware of other reports of infections linked to tattoo inks with similar packaging. Infections from tattooing are nothing new. Hepatitis, staph infections and even the superbug known as MRSA have been tied to tattoos. Dirty needles and unsanitary environments are often to blame. But people getting tattoos can get infections in the skin even in the cleanest conditions. The ink can carry bacteria that can spread through the bloodstream — a process known as sepsis. Symptoms are fever, shaking chills and sweats. Less severe infections may involve bumps on the skin, discharge, redness, swelling, blisters or excessive pain at the site. According to Linda Katz, director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, 'Tattooing poses a risk of infection to anyone, but the risk is particularly high for those with pre-existing heart or circulatory disease, diabetes or compromised immune systems.' Delayed reaction: The FDA has received reports of bad reactions to inks years after tattooing . And you may not be out of the woods for a while: The FDA says it has received reports of bad reactions to tattoo inks right after tattooing as well as years later. The FDA says it is concerned that consumers and tattoo artists may have some of the contaminated products from the July recall. White and Blue Lion may have just been one distributor. Some of the recalled bottles have a multicolored Chinese dragon image with black-and-white lettering, while some are missing manufacturer information. In general, the FDA says those looking to get a tattoo should always ensure that the ink has a brand name and a location of the business that manufactured it. 'What the consumer can do is talk to the tattoo artist and see the ink bottles,' said Katz. This isn't the first outbreak linked to tattoo ink. Reports of infections have increased as tattoos have become more popular in the last decade. Three years ago, 19 people in Rochester, New York, ended up with bubbly rashes on their new tattoos, linked to contaminated water that was used to dilute the ink. Permanent tattoos aren't the only tattoos that carry risk. An FDA alert earlier this year warned that temporary tattoos popular with kids and often found at beaches, boardwalks and other holiday destinations can be dangerous. The main risk is from black henna, an ink that is combined with natural red henna and can include chemicals that can cause dangerous skin reactions. In that notice to the public, the FDA said regulation differs from state to state and can be lax in some places. 'Depending on where you are, it's possible no one is checking to make sure the artist is following safe practices or even knows what may be harmful to consumers,' the alert reads.","California company White and Blue Lion Inc recalled in-home tattoo kits over bacterial contamination last month .

"He is typically a stoic Commander-in-Chief. But now, Barack Obama's former top adviser has revealed in a new book what happens when the President loses his famous cool. David Axelrod,  Obama's top strategist during his 2012 presidential campaign, claims the 53-year-old once cussed at him in front of others and stormed out of a debate-prep session in a fit of rage. In his book, 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics', he describes how he attempted to offer Obama some constructive criticism prior to his first debate with Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Scroll down for video . First-hand account: David Axelrod (left), who was Barack Obama's top strategist during his 2012 presidential campaign, has revealed in a new book what happens when the President (right), 53, loses his famous cool . Under pressure: Axelrod claims Obama (right) cussed at him and stormed out of the room in a fit of rage after he offered the politician constructive criticism before his disasterous 2012 debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney (left) However, Obama refused to accept his advice, Axelrod writes. Instead, in an unexpected move, the US leader reportedly exclaimed: 'Motherf****r's never happy!' before storming out of the room in front of stunned onlookers, according to Business Insider. 'That was a first,' Axelrod says in his book. 'Obama and I had been working together for a decade, through some pretty hairy moments, but he had never before lost his temper in this fashion.' He added: 'He certainly never attacked me so harshly, especially in front of others.' And perhaps Obama could have done with heeding Axelrod's advice - as his first debate proved to be disastrous, with 67 per cent of viewers declaring that Romney had won it, according to a poll. Only 25 per cent said the same of the President, whose poor performance was watched by more than 60million Americans in October 2012, the poll by CNN/Opinion Research revealed.

Left, Obama  talks to reporters  in the Oval Office on February 17 . In his book, Axelrod theorizes that Obama's loss of temper and reference to him as a 'Motherf****r' was actually down to the politician's frustrations with his own insufficient pre-debate preparation. 'My sense was that the president knew he wasn't ready,' he writes. 'His mind-set, his reluctance to embrace the game, had been wrongheaded from the start, and now it was clearly hurting him.' Ultimately, Obama went on to be re-elected President in November 2012, defeating Romney 51.1percent to 47.2percent. He was sworn into the Oval Office for a second term on January 20, 2013. It is not the first time Obama has apparently lost his renowned cool. In 2012, the President failed to keep his temper under control in Connecticut after hecklers interrupted a speech he was giving at a rally in Bridgeport and began chanting at him. Astonished attendees watched as Obama halted his own speech to address the hecklers, who are believed to have been activists seeking more global AIDS funding. 'Excuse me, excuse me,' he said repeatedly, trying to speak over the crowd. When the hecklers kept chanting, Obama fell silent for several seconds, looking visibly angry and raising one hand in frustration as the crowd began to boo around him.

'You've been appearing at every rally we've been doing. 'We're funding global AIDS. And the other [Republican] side is not.' 'So I don't know why you think this is a useful strategy to take,' he finished, jabbing his finger angrily in the direction of the hecklers. The crowd's boos turned to cheers as Obama spoke. 'So, what we would suggest,' he added, 'I think it would make a lot more sense for you guys to go to the folks who aren't interested in funding global AIDS and shout at that rally. Because we're trying to focus on figuring out how to finance the things that you want financed.' Then he turned to another group of hecklers on his other side, adding: 'You guys same thing.' As more chants filled the rally, he said: 'Alright, you guys have made your point, now let's go.' Fighting to regain the momentum of the rally, he held his hands up saying: 'Everybody - we're alright. 'Come on guys,' he said. He then fell silent again, watching with pursed lips as the crowd booed the hecklers once more. The President waited nearly 20 seconds for the noise to stop. Then, he attempted again to continue with his speech. But he was forced to wait in silence for another 20 seconds before finally saying: 'Hey! Listen up everybody!' Mr Obama finally regained control of the rally and continued with his speech.

"The reason for the growth of California's mighty mountain ranges has long been a mystery, but scientists have now proposed an intriguing theory. They say the growth is due in part to humans pumping groundwater our of an underground resevoir of water in California's Central Valley. This causes the mountains to rise and fall the thickness of a dime and, while it's a small amount, it could be responsible for increasing earthquakes in the region around the San Andreas Fault. Unexpectedly fast growth of mountains in California's vast ranges has been attributed to human intervention, according to a new study. Pumping groundwater out of Central Valley has made some mountains rise by as much as 0.11 inches a year. Pictured is Monument Peak in California . To come to the conclusion, the geophysicists from several universities including Western Washington University and the University of Nevada carried out GPS measurements of the region. They found that the mountains closer to the Central Valley, where the bulk of the region's groundwater pumping takes place, grew faster than ranges further away. Water has been pumped from California's . Central Valley for more than 150 years, changing what used to be a marsh . and extensive lake, called Tulare Lake, into fertile agricultural fields. In . that time, about 40 cubic miles (160 cubic kilometers) of water was . removed - the capacity of Lake Tahoe - dropping the water table in some . areas more than 400 feet (120 meters) and the ground surface 16 feet (5 meters) or more. The . weight of water removed allowed the underlying crust or lithosphere to . rise by what is known as isostatic rebound, when there is no longer a balance between Earth's upper crust and its surface. This may have raised the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains by as . much as half a foot since about 1860. Over the last 150 years, scientists estimate there has been a total rise of about six inches (15 centimetres) in the Californian mountain ranges. The biggest rise has been around the Central Valley, though, where mountains continue to grow faster than expected at up to 0.1 inches (three millimetres) a year. It's also thought that, in tandem with summer groundwater pumping, winter rains contribute to the changing heights of the mountain ranges. While seasonal changes in the Central Valley aquifer have not yet been firmly associated with any earthquakes, studies have shown that similar levels of periodic stress - such as that caused by the motions of the moon and sun - increase the number of microquakes on the San Andreas Fault. If these subtle seasonal changes are capable of influencing the occurrence of microquakes, it's possible that they can sometimes also trigger a larger event, said Roland Bürgmann, a geoscientist at the University of California, Berkeley and co-author of the Nature paper. 'The stress is very small, much less than you need to build up stress on a fault leading to an earthquake, but in some circumstances such small stress changes can be the straw that breaks the camel's back,' Bürgmann said. 'It could just give that extra push to get a fault to fail.' The study was based on GPS measurements from California and Nevada between 2007 and 2010. It showed that the faster-than-expected rise of mountains in Sierra Nevada and other ranges was due to humans pumping ground water out of the valleys in California, which could trigger stresses in the San Andreas Fault . The geophysicists made the measurements with the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Plate Boundary Observatory GPS network of 1,100 stations, which provide millimetre-precision data on the mountains in the region, which have only been possible in the last few years . The study was based on GPS measurements from California and Nevada between 2007 and 2010 and was led by scientists Colin Amos at Western Washington University and Pascal Audet of the University of Ottawa. 'Other studies have shown that the San Andreas Fault is sensitive to small-scale changes in stress,' said Amos. 'These appear to control the timing of small earthquakes on portions of the fault, leading to more small earthquakes during drier periods of the year. 'Previously, such changes were thought to be driven by rainfall and other hydrologic causes.' This work ties overuse of groundwater by humans in the San Joaquin Valley to increases in the height of nearby mountain ranges and possible increases in the number of earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault, said Maggie Benoit, programme director in NSF's Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. 'When humans deplete groundwater, the amount of mass or material in Earth's crust is reduced,' said Benoit. 'That disrupts Earth's force balances, causing uplift of nearby mountains and reducing a force that helps keep the San Andreas fault from slipping.' The California Aqueduct, pictured on the right, is a system of canals and tunnels that takes water from places including the Central Valley across California. It has been blamed for the recent rise of the mountains which could in turn be increasing the chances of earthquakes . Torrential winter storms drop water and snow across the state, which eventually flow into Central Valley streams, reservoirs and underground aquifers, pushing down the crust and lowering the Sierra by 0.04 to 0.11 inches (one to three millimetres). In the summer water flow into the Pacific Ocean, evaporation and ground water pumping for irrigation, which has accelerated because of drought, allows the crust and surrounding mountains to rise again. In response to the current drought in . the region, about 7.5 cubic miles (30 cubic kilometers) of water has . been removed from Central Valley aquifers between 2003 and 2010, causing . a rise of about 0.4 inches (10 millimeters) in the Sierra over that . time. Bürgmann said that the flexing of Earth's crust downward in winter would clamp the San Andreas fault tighter, lowering the risk of quakes, while in summer the upward motion would relieve this clamping and perhaps increase the risk. 'The hazard is ever so slightly higher in the summer than in the wintertime,' he said. 'This suggests that climate and tectonics interact, and that water changes ultimately affect the deeper Earth. 'The Coast Range is doing the same thing as the Sierra Nevada, which is part of the evidence that this can't be explained by tectonics. 'Both ranges have uplifted over the last few years and both exhibit the same seasonal up and down movement in phase. 'This tells us that something has to be driving the system at a seasonal and long-term sense, and that has to be groundwater recharging and depletion.' The new research was published in the journal Nature.","Pumping water out of California's Central Valley is making mountains grow faster than expected, according to a team of geophysicists .

"Web giant: Online retailer Amazon.com wants to register the .amazon domain name . South America is squaring up to online retailer Amazon in a battle over the coveted web domain name the firm shares with the continent’s tropical rainforest. Brazil and Peru are formally opposing the e-commerce giant’s plans to register the .amazon URL ending with the internet overseer Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The countries, which host 73 per cent of the jungle, say it would stop ‘the use of this domain for purposes of public interest’. These, they added, ‘related to the protection, promotion and awareness raising on issues related to the Amazon biome.’ It would also, they said, ‘hinder the possibility of use of this domain to congregate web pages related to the population inhabiting the geographical region’. ICANN said it will now send Amazon.com an ‘early warning’ where it will ask for the firm’s reasons for applying to use the sought-after name. It will then weigh up both sides of the argument, and make its final decision as to who should be allowed to use it. A time frame has not been given. The U.S. company has already spent . £100,000 in trying to register the name, and this would be returned if . the application was ultimately rejected, reported GlobalPost.

Hot on her heels is Paul Noble, 48, . who has spent 15 years drawing a fictional city populated by human . faeces who engage in sex acts. His nominated work is called Public Toilet - which forms part of his imaginary metropolis. The inhabitants of the partially ruined city are living excrement, who, in some scenes, engage in orgies. His work, which was on show at the city's Gagosian gallery last year, has been described as a parody of an ideal city. Noble, whose work includes a hellish . Heaven and a utopian Hell, has said that he will only make one more work . in his Nobson Newtown series. Judges praised his visions of a ‘dysfunctional and dystopian world’ in which ‘people become turds and turds become people’.

Elizabeth Price, 45, from London, is in the running for the contemporary art prize for a trilogy of video installations, including User Group Disco (above) Price's work work includes West Hinder, inspired by the sinking of a ship in 2002 with a cargo of luxury cars, and The Woolworths Choir, which featured degraded footage of girl groups . Tate Britain director Penelope . Curtis, who is chair of the jury, said of the shortlist: 'They are . artists that have brought a kind of slowness of looking, it's not a . quick fix. 'None of . these works are something that you can get in a few minutes. You have to . spend an hour or two to get it, whether it's film, drawing or . performance.' The judges said there was a 'humanity' running through all the artists' work. They hailed Noble's art as 'a compelling life project' of 'incredible, monumental graphite drawings'. His work is an 'utterly compelling ongoing narrative' and a 'limitless journey of discovery', they said. The artist takes almost 'an omnipresent view' of a 'dysfunctional world' in which 'people become turds and turds become people'. The Turner judges described Chetwynd, whose recent . exhibition Odd Man Out 2011 took the form of a five-hour play . addressing issues of 'democracy, the right to vote and the consequences . of decision-making', as a 'very interesting character' who involves the . audience in her work. 'She changed her name in 2007. That seems on the face of it... a small point. 'But the idea of changing her name to . Spartacus... seems to have liberated her to make this ongoing . increasingly diverse form of practice that includes as many people as . possible,' the judges said. A Tax Haven Run By Women was inspired . by 'financially independent women' such as Dolly Parton and took the form . of a game show with two teams competing for a ride to a tax haven. Fowler, best known for his film portraits of public figures, is said to have an 'autobiographical and biographical thread to his work'. Price started to make films four years ago and has a musical background - she co-founded the indie-pop outfit Talulah Gosh. Judges praised her 'powerful body of work over the last three years'. Work by the shortlisted artists will go on show at Tate Britain in October and the winner will be announced in December.","Lali Chetwynd changed name to Spartacus five years ago .

"Britain’s super-rich are turning their backs on buying up historic stately homes in favour of building their own from scratch, according to luxury estate agents. Experts in the top end of the property market say sky-high renovation costs and restrictive planning regulations are driving the wealthy to dream up their own ideal homes from scratch. And they are filling their dream homes with every conceivable luxury without the need for a bottomless sink fund to pay for the costly upkeep of older houses. Scroll down for video . New grandeur: The super-rich are increasingly turning to custom-designed houses rather than existing stately homes. Pictured above is Field House, near Ablington, Gloucestershire, which is on sale for £4million . Splendour: Another striking example of the new opulence is the above property, Abbotts Wood, near Taplow in Buckinghamshire. It is currently on the market with an asking price of £7.5million . Interior: Pictured is the living and dining area of Abbotts Wood, which is set in 56 acres of its own land and built in the Palladian style with modern materials . Luxuriant: This indoor cinema room is another part of Abbotts Wood, one of an increasing number of properties built to order on country estates of the super-rich . The new, multi-million-pound properties have been popping up across the country over the past few years - and are being heralded as the stately homes of the future. Wealthy buyers have been drawn to building new homes from scratch because the costs are significantly lower than restoring and running period properties. Modern technology like eco-friendly biomass boilers and solar panels can dramatically reduce the running costs of new homes, which are easier to build and adapt in the first place due to laxer planning laws. However, the grandeur of the properties is unchanged from those built hundreds of years ago. Old style: Field House in Gloucestershire, pictured from above with its garden visible, was built in the classic Cotsworld style, though it is only a few years old . Sturdy: The construction of the new wave of stately homes makes extensive use of heavy woods and stone. Pictured is Field House's hallway . Extensive: The kitchen in Field House, pictured, has both stone-paved floors and marble tops to its work surfaces, which estate agents say will endure for decades . Lengthy: Field House also boasts its own swimming poolin its garden, with skuyights and exposed wooden beams . Rustic: The wooden beams dissecting this living room give the £4million new-build a more authentic feel, in keeping with the older properties in the region . Picturesque: Field House also has extensive grounds, featuring its own walled garden . Sun-kissed: The £2.75million Yew Trees, pictured above, is another example of a newly-built home, which was finished in 2013 . Traditional: The Georgian-style home, in Hampshire, has a modern kitchen with a classic colour scheme, and boasts an Aga as well as sweeping white work sufaces . Winding driveways flanked by sprawling gardens, leading in turn to opulent facades are still the norm. Interiors, too, have been given a modern makeover but traditional building materials such as wood and stone still feature highly. Swimming pools, tennis courts, riding stables, personal gyms, cinemas and wine cellars are among the flashy features built in to the modern stately homes. One example, Leyton House, was built in 2014 on Crown estate land in Oxshott, Surrey, and is on the market for a £6.5million through Knight Frank. It boasts six bedrooms, an indoor pool, spa and gym, a 3D cinema, underfloor heating and walk-in wardrobes in every room. Palatial: Leton House, which is built on Crown land near Oxshott, Surrey, is built in the Palladian style and is set to sell for £6.85million . Airy: The huge hallway has two rows of tall windows, letting in a huge amount of natural light. The open feel is accentuated by two fold-back doors . Cooling off: The seven-bedroom home boasts its own indoor swimming pool next to the garden, overlooked by a huge skylight . Kitted-out: The kitchen is awash with modern features including expansive worktops, modern hobs and an assortment of other cooking devices . Another is Kingswood House, completed this year from Cotswold stone and sits among six acres of land in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, close to the Blenheim estate. It has six bedrooms, five reception rooms, seven bathrooms, a grand, tree-lined drive, a biomass boiler and a private bore hole supplying water to the house. The house, on the market for £4.5million with Strutt and Parker, also has grand landscaped gardens, separate accommodation for a housekeeper and nanny and a tennis court. Cotswold-style: Kingswood House, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, is buily from stone hewn in the Cotswolds and has a guide price of £4.5million . Approach: Likely stately homes of old, the property has a sweeping, tree-lined driveway along which visitors can see the full grandeur of the house . Courts: Kingswood House also boasts its own tennis court - sports facilities are one of the features demanded by many wealthy homebuilders bringing their dream to life . Towering: The stone-floored hallway features a spiralling staircase which extends two floors up and is bathed in light by a downward-facing window . Experts claim the luxury mansions will still be standing in 200 years’ time - and will be looked upon as the period houses of their time. Mark Wheeler, director of country houses at Hamptons estate agents, said: 'In recent years there has been a definite move away from the drafty, old rectories and Edwardian manor houses towards modern, comfortable and cost efficient properties. 'It is many people’s dream to design and build their own house exactly to their own specifications. 'The quality nowadays is so much higher and the running costs are significantly less in comparison to centuries old houses. 'New builds also come with a 10-year guarantee, so effectively you have cost-free living for a good while rather than instant renovation bills or maintenance costs. Opulent: Warrenbayne, a Palladian-style house on St George's Hill private estate near Weybridge, Surrey, is set to sell for £12.5million . Personal leisure centre: The huge home also features its own swimming pool, and a Jacuzzi-style whirpool bath, all surrounded by stone floor panels . Classical style: The pillared home has a grand dining area which looks on to an outdoor pool lined with trees . 'In a hundred years time these modern stately homes will be the period houses of their time. I think they will stand the test of time because the build quality is extremely high. 'There are some similarities between new and old though - the principals of quality and grandeur are still as important as they ever were. 'You have to remember that old stately homes were cutting edge when they were built. Modern stately homes are just following in that same tradition.' Country living: Ash Park, near Plaistow village in West Sussex is on the market for £5.95million and has its own lake and 8.6 acres of landscaped gardens . Fancy a dip? The home also has its own stylish swimming pool, as well as tennis courts, a lake and seven bedrooms . William Morrison, of Knight Frank, added: 'There has always been a desire among buyers to build their own houses exactly to their specification. 'But it is even more evident at the top of the market where people can afford to build their dream homes with everything they want inside. 'Many large, older houses are listed buildings - making it difficult to adapt them plus running costs are often very high. 'With modern stately homes you have the ability to build a property which is state of the art, cheap to run and environmentally friendly. 'The emphasis is still on quality and being cutting edge, as well as showing off modern British architecture.' Wooded: Beechwood House near Dippenhall, Surrey, has six bedrooms and a guide price of £4.25million . Red-brick: This home near Dorking, Surrey, is set to sell for £3.85million, and combines older-style brickwork with new, modern features . Interior: The inside of the home, which boasts a large stone fireplace, are also very modern, with exposed brickwork criss-crossing the windows . Luxuriant: As with the other homes, the kitchen of this property is kitted out with modern conveniences and huge windows facing the garden to let in the light .","Estate agents say that the super-rich are no longer buying up existing stately homes but building their own .
Multi-million-pound properties are just as opulent as palatial homes of old, but with added cutting-edge features .
Some of the reasons driving Britons away from classic homes of the wealthy are high running costs and planning laws ."
"An independent Scotland will not be able to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, a senior Games official has warned. Olympic Committee vice president Sir Craig Reedie said Scottish athletes were highly unlikely to be able to represent their new country at the next games if the country votes for independence next week. Sir Craig, who is also president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said there would not be enough time between Scottish independence in March 2016 and the start of the Games that summer to allow Scotland into the event. The revelation comes amid mounting concern in Westminster over a surge in support for independence. A poll for Sunday Times put the ‘Yes’ camp ahead on 51 per cent to the No camp's 49 per cent. Panicking Westminster politicians have drawn up a last-minute plan to save the union – promising Scotland sweeping new powers on tax and welfare. The prospect of missing out on the world’s biggest sporting event will offer the ‘No’ to independence camp further ammunition against separation. For Scotland to be allowed to compete, the country’s new sporting body will have to show that it is ‘an independent nation recognised by the international community’. But because of the short time frame between independence and the opening of the Games, Sir Craig told the Observer he thought it would be ‘very, very difficult’ for a newly independent Scottish team to take part. He said: ‘I have no idea how long that process of recognition will take. In practical terms the IOC has tended to use recognition by the United Nations. ‘Many of the sports will have qualifying competitions that have all but finished. I don't know if it could be done in time. I suspect it would be very, very difficult.’ A working group on Scottish sport, set up by the Scottish Parliament and chaired by former first minister Henry McLeish, concluded in May that a Scottish team at the Rio Games was feasible. Scroll down for video . But Sir Craig said: ‘It would be difficult to deliver in time because I simply don't know when an independent Scotland would be recognised by the IOC.’ He said he believed some athletes may choose to continue representing Team GB regardless of the outcome of the vote. The British Olympic Association, chaired by Lord Coe, said it had not formed a view on what it would do if Scotland voted for independence.","Independent Scotland will not be able to compete in the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"What's black and white, slightly seedy and yours for about £1.50? Meet the newest creation from McDonald's in China, a pair of burgers that could almost be a pun on the ancient Yin-Yang symbol. While some have questioned the rationale behind the multi-coloured meat feast, it appears the answer may lie in a Chinese saying. Double the fun? The burgers are certainly eye-catching, but some have claimed their appeal ends there . 'Heibai liangdao tongchi' is an expression to describe someone who 'eats from both sides' - meaning they have friends high-up in Government (the white side) and in organised crime - referred to in China as 'black society'. According to local website The Beijinger, 'the black burger has a black pepper sauce with bits of onions. The white burger was harder to place, but the sauce has a spicy kick with a sweet finish.' Bun pun: The black and white  burgers are apparently a reference to a Chinese saying . Not all those who tried to burger combo thought it was a hit, and the website Beijing Cream posted a tongue-in-cheek review claiming it 'looks - and tastes - like hell.' 'I would sooner eat a century egg bathed in stinky tofu with a chicken-foot garnish than order this again,' the mystery blogger declared. A deal for the burgers is available via McDonald's website in China, the Huffington Post reported. The set meal costs £2.60 (RMB27), but the set of burgers by themselves cost £1.55 (RMB16).","New black and white buns are said to be a pun on a Chinese saying .

"A high-flying Google exec with a passion for super-fast, top of the line sports cars has proved himself to have an equally good sense of humor, when it comes to his boy's toys. As vice president of engineering and long-time Google employee, Benjamin Sloss Treynor, 43, became an instant millionaire at the time of the company’s $23 billion IPO in 2004. That wealth has afforded Treynor the finances to be able to indulge his passion for collecting some of the most exclusive sports cars around, including a Ford Raptor, a Ferrari 458 Italia, and a McLaren 12C Spyder, which he keeps in his six-car garage. Dream team: Google's Benjamin Sloss Treynor shows off five of his fancy sports car . Car lover: Benjamin Sloss Treynor and his wife collect a Ferrari after recently bidding the highest for it in a charity auction in Sept in Monza, Italy . Treynor isn’t shy about his collection either and as with any self respecting tech nerd he is very active in chat forums sharing his passion with other sports car nuts. Sometimes Treynor’s candidness about his car collection has got him into trouble with other forum members of the SVT . Performance forum, most of whom can only dream of having a car collection as exotic as his. One forum member recently questioned if Treynor could really own all the top of the lines vehicles which he claims too and challenged him to prove he owned what he said he did with an usual task involving placing bread on some of his most exclusive rides. 'I don’t think you’re real. I request a . picture of your new 12C Spyder with a piece of bread on the hood,' wrote . one poster, who posted under the username Ford-racer. Treynor may be very important and very . rich, but as is the Google ethos he is also something of a regular guy - . as he proved by rising to the challenge set by his forum buddy. Not only did Treynor comply on Sunday by posting a picture of his extremely rare McLaren 12C Spyder, but he photographed some English crumpets on top, as befitting a British-built vehicle. For this photograph of his McLaren Spyder, Treynor photographed some English crumpets as befitting a British-built vehicle . Treynor placed a loaf of New York Rye on top of his American Raptor .

Treynor captioned his Spyder photo saying 'the art and science of the British sports car lives on at McLaren, and nothing says ""God Save The Queen"" like crumpets!' He didn't stop there either, for a photo of his brand-new high-performance Ford Raptor truck, Treynor placed a loaf of New York Rye Bread. 'Nothing says ""USA"" like 'FORD', and what better pairing than a great loaf of New York Rye?' he wrote. Then on top of his Ferrari he placed Italian bread. He wrote: 'Nothing complements the smell of fine Italian leather like the smell of fresh Italian bread!' Ford_racer, real name Kyle Hirschi, told Wired that he knew Treynor was legit, but came up with the bread on the hood idea as an inside joke after the Google exec was called out by someone else on the forum. On the SVT Performance forum user ford_racer asked Treynor to post pictures of bread on his cars . Sense of humor: Further evidence of Treynor's humor can be found on his Google+ profile . In the past, Treynor had responded by posting a . picture of his kid holding a sign that had the name of the SVT . Performance forum on it. 'Treynor is easily one of the more genuine and down to earth people on SVTP,' said Hirschi. 'He’s never condescending or arrogant when showing off his toys, and he’s clearly a genuine car enthusiast.

"Documents recovered from an ornamental lake at the extravagant home of Ukraine's fugitive president are being dried out in a sauna in a bid to uncover some of the billions of dollars purported to have gone missing under his kleptocratic regime. When Viktor Yanukovich fled his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev, hundreds of papers were hurriedly thrown into the water to destroy evidence. But many were in plastic folders, meaning some documents were still legible and they are now being closely analysed. The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project told MailOnline: 'There are some important stories in the documents that show exactly how the government of Ukraine has been operating. 'I think prosecutors will also find plenty of materials and will investigate money laundering and misuse of government funds.' Scroll down for video . Documents recovered from an ornamental lake at the extravagant home of Ukraine's fugitive president are being dried out in the sauna of his guest house in a bid to uncover some of the billions of dollars purported to have gone missing under his kleptocratic regime . When Viktor Yanukovich fled his sprawling luxury estate in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev, . hundreds of documents were hurriedly thrown into the water to destroy evidence . According to the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, the documents include 'receipts detailing his [Yanukovich] extravagant spending, financial investments, and lists of press enemies' Many of the files were in plastic folders, meaning some documents were still legible and are being closely analysed . The people of the country, who earn on . average earn between £2,400 and £4,200 a year, flocked to see Viktor . Yanukovich's hastily vacated property last weekend. A group of volunteer divers discovered the documents had been hastily discarded and retrieved them from the lake at the property which is packed with riches well beyond the reach of a man with an official salary of less than £15,000. Twenty journalists from a dozen media outlets spent the weekend sorting, separating, and drying the soggy and clumped documents - those that need to are being dried out in the sauna of his guesthouse. Almost 700 of the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 documents recovered have already been posted online. New documents are being added every hour. Drew Sullivan, editor at the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project told MailOnline:  'There are about a dozen reporters working on the reporting and they are assisted now by another dozen but many, many more Ukrainians have been giving them food, supplies and more support.  It really is a citizen movement and the people are giving them everything they need but they expect some good reporting in return. 'They want to know what has really been happening. When they needed scanners, they got between 15 and 20 scanners to get the around 100,000 documents scanned.  That's our latest estimate.  We have five programmers and system people at OCCRP who are also working.  They have designed a site from scratch mostly over a few days.'

This morning Swiss police raided the Geneva offices of Yanukovich firm. Switzerland said on Thursday it would order banks to freeze any funds in Swiss banks found to be linked any Yanukovich funds. Yesterday Ukraine's interim authorities officially formed a new government and Ukraine's parliament set about taking measures to recover some of the billions of dollars they say went missing under his regime. The parliament approved Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a key member of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's party, as prime minister. He told parliament that the former government had left the country with $75bn of debts. Vladimir Putin granted shelter to Ukraine's fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych has a news conference scheduled today  (file photo) 'Over $20bn of gold reserve were embezzled. They took $37bn of loans that disappeared,' Yatsenyuk said. 'Around $70bn was moved to offshore accounts from Ukraine's financial system in the last three years,' he claimed. Today it was announced the Ukraine's central bank will limit foreign currency withdrawals from banking deposits to 15,000 hryvnia ($1,500) per day, to tame hryvnia volatility. In a bid to shore up Ukraine's fledgling administration, the International Monetary Fund has said it is 'ready to respond' to Ukraine's bid for financial assistance. The European Union is also considering emergency loans for a country that is the chief conduit of Russian natural gas to western Europe. Ukraine's finance ministry has said it needs $35 billion over the next two years to avoid default.","Swiss prosecutor has opened money laundering investigation into ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich and his son Oleksander .

"When one forklift won't quite do the job, the answer really is simple... use two forklifts. While it doesn't look like the safest work practice ever, a video of two removal workers has been posted online using a forklift truck to lift another forklift on to the back of a trailer. The dangerous-looking manoeuvre appears to be used as a solution of lifting a large shipping box to the front of a trailer without a proper ramp or loading bay. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The video shows the first forklift lining up the container as it edges closer to the trailer . The second forklift then lifts up the first and helps it on to the back of the trailer, allowing it to move the container further into place . It is not clear where the video was taken, but according to Yahoo News, the footage was posted to Facebook on July 2 and has now been shared across social media and blogging sites. The video shows the first forklift lining up the container as it edges closer to the trailer. Once the box is safely in the trailer the second, larger forklift enters the scene, the driver carefully placing the forks underneath the first vehicle. The second forklift then lifts up the first and helps it on to the back of the trailer, allowing it to move the container further into place. The manoeuvre allows the workers to move the shipping container further down into the trailer . The larger forklift then helps the first back down to the ground after it has dropped off the container. While the manoeuvre may not look like the safest ever, it is nowhere near as stomach-churning as the remarkable three-point turn Austrian driver Joachim Held is forced to complete on a narrow road halfway up a mountain. In January, MailOnline reported how the driver carried out the manoeuvre twice a day, every day - and had never made a mistake so far. Joachim, who began driving trucks aged just 19, has to do the perilous turn in the mountains of Eisenerz, near Styria. He said: 'I have done this so many years that it's second nature now.' However, he added: 'I can understand why people find it scary.'","Video posted online showing a forklift lifting another forklift on to trailer .

"Nick Clegg today admitted his shame at setting fire a collection of rare cacti as a teenager on a school trip to Germany. The Lib Dem leader said he did a ‘very bad thing’ and he was not proud of the incident in the summer of 1983. The pro-EU politician claimed that his youthful experimentation with arson while on an exchange trip to Munich was an example of ‘rare anti-Europeanism’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'not proud' of the incident in the summer of 1983 . As a student at the elite Westminster School, Mr Clegg was among several teenagers who travelled to south east Germany 31 years ago to stay with the families of pupils at a school in Munich. The trip was organised for language students by Richard Stokes, a German teacher at Westminster. Mr Clegg was sent to stay at with the family of a judge who was also a collector rare cacti. One night, after getting ‘very drunk’ he ventured into conservatory housing dozens of specimens with schoolfriend Tom Browne. Mr Clegg admitted singing the 'beards' of several cacti belonging to a German judge during a school trip . The future Deputy Prime Minister then took out his out his lighter and starting to singe the ‘beards’ of the priceless plants. Some recall five cacti were damaged, others claim it was as many as 15. Challenged about claims by BNP leader Nick Griffin that the Lib Dems were led by a ‘convicted arsonist’, Mr Clegg confessed to his crime. ‘I have never been convicted of arson at any time in my life but I did commit a very bad thing when I was a teenager,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘It’s such an odd story, I set light to some cacti, it’s such a surreal thing. In Europe no less, an example of rare anti-Europeanism.’ Questioned about whether drink had been taken, Mr Clegg admitted: ‘I behaved, like many teenagers do, I behaved badly. ‘I was told off. I had to do penance. I had to do a form of community service, digging up flowerbeds in a suburb of Munich. I’m not proud of it.’ Mr Clegg, second left, was a student at Westminster School in London at the time of the trip . Mr Clegg also missed out on cycle rides through mountains and visits to Oberammergau and Nuremberg as part of his punishment. His teacher, Mr Stokes, said the young Clegg was ‘ashamed’ by his behaviour. In a 2010 biography of Mr Clegg by journalist Chris Bowers, Mr Stokes said: ‘The judge was incandescent, and we had to decide what to do. ‘I said we should sleep on it. Nick comes out of it quite well, if that’s not too much of a contradiction. ‘He was anguished and very ashamed, gutted by what he had done – he hadn’t realised what he was doing. ‘It wasn’t a wish to inflict clandestine damage – I imagine there was a party going on and then this happened. He was appalled.’ Nick Clegg suggested he would not block a referendum in the event of a future coalition . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today hinted he would not stand in the way of David Cameron's plans for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union in a new coalition after the next general election. The Liberal Democrat leader said there would be more important issues for him - such as ""fairer"" taxes - in any coalition negotiations in the event of another hung parliament. His comments come after Mr Cameron said he would not lead another government after the election next year unless there was a commitment to a referendum before the end of 2017. While Mr Clegg said he stood by his position that there should not be a referendum unless there was a fresh transfer of powers to Brussels, he indicated that it was not a ""die-in-the-ditch"" issue for him. 'I am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines,"" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'Are there die-in-the-ditch issues which I have highlighted in the past which I care about, frankly, even more than this? Yes. I think fairer taxes is something I've campaigned for. 'That is something I care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held.' Mr Clegg said that past history suggested there would be changes to the EU treaties which would require a referendum in the UK under legislation passed by the coalition. 'I have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum,"" he said. 'If you look back at the development of the European Community, and subsequently the European Union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at European level. 'So I think, if history is any guide, it's more than likely to happen again. At that point there should be a referendum, we've guaranteed that in law.'","Deputy Prime Minister says he did a 'very bad thing' on school exchange .

"The State Department has only 'advised' Americans against traveling to the Libyan city of Benghazi even after Britain, Germany and the Netherlands today urged their citizens to immediately leave the in response to what was described as an imminent threat against Westerners. The U.S. pointed to a travel advisory issued earlier this month and did not strengthen its warning even after the European countries issued statements variously describing the threat as specific and imminent but none gave details as to its exact nature. Today sources within the British department linked an . al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) to the latest threats who are an offshoot to the terrorists responsible for last week's hostage crisis in Algeria that ended with the deaths of 37 Westerners and 29 Islamists, the Independent reports. The threat is also said by the department to . be potentially linked to one of Aqim's runoff groups in Libya, Ansar . Al-Sharia, which fled Benghazi after the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi last year that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens. This file photo shows Libyan military guards check one of the U.S. Consulate's burnt out buildings days after the deadly terror attack there. The warnings come a day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton testified to Congress about . that deadly attack that also killed four Americans. It also comes while French troops battle . al-Qaida linked militants in Mali. The State Department tried to downplay the terror threat, insisting there is 'no specific information pointing to specific, imminent threats against U.S. citizens.' But the government did say that threat of kidnapping and targeted violence remains 'significant.' They also added in the latest warning that Americans should, 'review personal safety plans, remain aware of surroundings, . including local events, and monitor local news stations for updates. 'Maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance . your personal security.' Germany and Britain urged their nationals still in Benghazi to leave 'immediately' while Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Thijs van Son said that 'staying in this area is not to be advised.' It was not immediately clear how many people could be affected; Britain's Foreign Office said likely 'dozens' of its citizens were in the city, while Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Thijs van Son said there are four Dutch citizens registered as being in Benghazi and possibly two more. Secretary of State Clinton testified at Congress yesterday about the deadly Sept. 11 terror attack that killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. Several countries have for months advised against all travel to the city, especially after the U.S. consulate was attacked, and local residents said that many foreigners had already left in recent weeks. Benghazi, a city of 1 million people, is a business hub where many major firms employ Westerners. It also was where the Libyan uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi began in 2011. Gadhafi was eventually toppled and killed after NATO backed the rebel movement, and the Arab country has since struggled with security. Al-Qaida-linked militants operate in the country alongside other Islamist groups. Adel Mansouri, principal of the International School of Benghazi, said British and foreign nationals were warned two days ago about a possible threat to Westerners. He said the school's teachers were given the option of leaving but decided to stay. The school has some 540 students. Most are Libyan with some 40 percent who hold dual nationality. US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed on September 11 in Benghazi. Less than 5 percent are British while 10 to 15 students have U.S.-Libyan nationality, Mansouri said. Classes were not due to resume until Sunday because of a holiday Thursday. 'We told the British ambassador we are staying, and we'll be in touch,' said Mansouri, himself a Libyan-British dual national. 'We don't see a threat on the ground.' Saleh Gawdat, a Benghazi lawmaker, said French doctors who were working in Benghazi hospitals have left the city and that the French cultural center has closed out of concerns about potential retaliation over the French-led military intervention in nearby Mali, which began two weeks ago. Violence in Benghazi has targeted both foreigners as well as Libyan officials in recent months — with assassinations, bombings and other attacks. In addition to the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate, an Italian diplomat's car was fired on by militants in Benghazi. The consul, Guido De Sanctis, wasn't injured in the attack earlier this month, but the incident prompted Italy to order the temporary suspension of its consular activities in the city and send its foreign staff home. Islamist extremists are often blamed for targeting security officials who worked under Gadhafi, as a kind of revenge for torturing or imprisoning them in the past. Many city residents also blame Gadhafi loyalists who they say are trying to undermine Libya's new leaders by sowing violence. Ibrahim Sahd, a Benghazi-based lawmaker and politician, said that the new government is putting together a plan to beef up security in the city and this 'might have worried the Westerners of a backlash.' Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist with links to al-Qaida who is now an analyst at London's Quilliam Foundation, said other groups inspired by the terror network have been gaining a following since Gadhafi's fall. There have been nearly a dozen attacks against Western targets in Libya recently, he said. 'It's the same al-Qaida ideology that is driving these militants,' Benotman said. He added, however, that the militants were unlikely to target oil or gas installations in Libya because they need support from the population. 'Targeting these installations would turn Libyan workers and tribes against them,' he said. Oil companies working in other parts of Libya said they were aware of government warnings to citizens but there were no immediate plans for evacuations.","State Department continues to tell Americans to be 'cautious' while in city where its consulate was attacked and Ambassador and three others killed .

"Scientists have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube to come up with an enzyme that may have been crucial to the origins of life on Earth. The enzyme is called ribozyme, and it is made from ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a molecule that is already known as essential for creating forms of life. And, the enzyme not only reveals clues about how life may have begun, and subsequently evolved - the breakthrough could provide a tool for evolving molecules in the future. Origins of life explained? Scientists have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube to come up with an enzyme that may have been crucial to the origin of life on Earth. It's called ribozyme and is made from ribonucleic acid (RNA - illustrated) - a molecule that is essential for all known forms of life . Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California, created the enzyme made from RNA. Modern DNA-based life forms appear to have evolved from a simpler ‘RNA world', in which molecules self-replicated and evolved. The newly-created enzyme works in a similar way. It knits together a ‘copy’ strand of RNA, using an original RNA strand as a reference or ‘template,’ according to the study published in the journal Nature. But it doesn’t clone a molecule that's identical to itself. Instead, it makes a mirror image of itself - like the left hand to its right. This means it can 'bond' more efficiently to develop a living form. No research team has ever made such so-called ‘cross-chiral’ enzymes before. The emergence of such enzymes in a primordial RNA world - which the new study shows was plausible - may have been key to creating the first forms of life. ‘When I start to tell people about this, they sometimes wonder if we're merely suggesting the possibility of such an enzyme - but no, we actually made it,’ said Professor Gerald Joyce, of the university. As well as showing one possible path for life’s beginnings, the breakthrough could provide a tool for evolving new molecules. An illustration of the western hemisphere in the Early Jurassic period (long after the first organisms evolved) is shown . Biology on Earth evolved in such a way that in each class of molecules, one ‘chirality’ or asymmetrical feature came to dominate. Virtually all RNA, for example, are ‘right-handed’ and called D-RNA. The structural similarity of the enzyme to RNA makes interactions within that class more efficient - just as a handshake is more efficient when it joins two right or two left hands, rather than a left and a right. RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. It's one of three important molecules that are essential for all known forms of life - as well as DNA and proteins. Genetic information in a cell flows from DNA through RNA to proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell, while DNA is considered the 'blueprint' of the cell. It carries all the genetic information required for the cell to grow. RNA is essentially the 'DNA photocopy' of the cell, the RNA Society explains. When the cell needs to make a certain protein, it activates the protein's genes to produce multiple copies of a piece of DNA in the form of messenger RNA. These copies are used to translate the genetic code into protein, so RNA expands and regulates the amount of a given protein that can be made in a gene. This new study has produced a new enzyme from RNA, which mimics natural evolution and could help scientists unravel the origin of life on Earth . ‘Scientists generally are taught to think that there has to be a common chirality among interacting molecules for biology to work,’ Professor Joyce explained. But his original study three decades ago showed that self-replicators would have had a tough time evolving in such a mix. ‘Since then we’ve all been wondering how RNA replication could have started on the primitive Earth,’ he said. The new enzyme was created using a technique called test-tube evolution. Professor Joyce and post-doctoral researcher Jonathan Sczepanski started with a 'soup' of about a quadrillion short RNA molecules. Their sequences were essentially random and all were 'right-handed.' They deliberately set up the molecules to create a 'joining reaction' - so the right-handed molecules joined with the left. They could then be pulled out of the solution, and amplified. After 10 of these selection-and-amplification rounds, the researchers had a strong candidate ribozyme. After technical tweaking, they had created the enzyme and intend on researching it further. Professor Joyce said: ‘Ultimately what one wants is to turn it loose, in the lab, of course, not in the wild, to let it start replicating and evolving and seeing what results.’","Scientists claim to have mimicked natural evolution in a test tube .

"Claire Orton (above) giggled after exhaling onto the 'extremely poorly' child while it was being treated at University Hospital in Coventry, a tribunal heard . A nurse who breathed on a critically ill baby while she was suffering from a throat infection and said the newborn was ‘better off dead’ faces being struck off. Claire Orton giggled after exhaling onto the 'extremely poorly' child while it was being treated at University Hospital in Coventry, Warwickshire, a tribunal heard. She had told colleagues she had been ill with a throat infection before she deliberately breathed on the infant’s face as if to infect him, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing was told. Orton was being investigated by Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust over a separate incident when the allegations over 'Baby B' came to light. Colleague Daniel Top told the panel how he was shocked after Orton made the insensitive comments - which came while she under investigation for allegedly leaving a student nurse to look after a poorly baby, despite being unqualified to do so. Robin Somerville, NMC panel chair, said the panel believed Mr Top's evidence. He said: ‘Mr Top demonstrated to the panel what he said he saw. ‘This consisted of a sharp exhalation directly onto Baby B’s face. He added that you had then walked away and giggled. ‘The panel believed this evidence. ‘The panel understood that there was an undoubted sense of strain on the ward as a result of Baby B’s situation. ‘In these circumstances, the panel considers that your remark was not intended maliciously but as an expression of an opinion to any colleagues who were in the vicinity.’ Orton previously told the panel that her breathing on the baby might have been mistaken for her ‘sighing’ at the sadness of the baby’s condition. Orton could be struck off as a nurse at University Hospital in Coventry, Warwickshire (pictured) if her fitness to practice is found to be impaired. The Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal into the allegations continues . In the earlier incident, the nurse was found to have failed to call assistance to a student nurse who was left in care of another sick baby on 2 July 2012. She was accused of not responding promptly to Jade Matthews's calls for help while the child was suffering from brachycardia - a low resting heart rate. Orton accepts that a doctor was not called and that she failed to record any notes about the incident. She later admitted she should not have allowed the student nurse to look after the baby, but thought it was a good learning experience. Orton denies inappropriately breathing on Baby B's face and saying the child would be 'better off dead.' If her fitness to practice is found to be impaired, she could be struck off. The hearing continues.","Claire Orton giggled after breathing on 'extremely poorly' baby, tribunal told .

"If you are looking for an excuse to have a more active love life, a new study may help. Scientists believe that sex helps humans avoid disease by wiping out genetic mutations. By analysing hundreds of people’s DNA, they found that disease-enabling mutations gradually vanish from human genes. But Casanovas who have a lot of casual sex won’t benefit from a life free from illness, because the process takes hundreds of generations. Scientists claim that sex helps humans avoid diseases by gradually wiping out genetic mutations. By analysing hundreds of people’s genetic code, they have found that disease-enabling mutations vanish from humans’ genes . For decades, scientists have debated the genetic advantages of sexual reproduction. Now, researchers from the University of Montreal and the Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre in Montreal, Canada, have just shown how humanity becomes less likely to develop or catch diseases the more we mix our genetic material together. Previous research has revealed that as humans procreate, generation after generation, the exchange of genetic material between man and woman causes our species to evolve little by little. The chromosomes of parents -  threadlike structures made of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleus of most living cells, which carry genetic information in the form of genes - recombine to create the chromosomes of their child, but they don’t mix together in a uniform way. Scinetists found that chromosomes (pictured) recombine frequently in some segments of the genome and less in others, which tend to carry a significantly greater proportion of genetic mutations that can cause disease. These segments accumulate more bad mutations until they are recombined . The researchers studied the sequenced genomes of hundreds of individuals from Canada's Cartagene genetic data repository and the multinational 1,000 Genomes Project. They found that the proportion of mutations associated with disease was significantly higher in low recombining segments of genomes known as ‘coldspots’ relative to highly recombining regions. They also discovered that the bad mutations in these coldspots were more damaging than the mutations in the highly recombining segments. The team compared the finding across four populations: Africans, Asians, Europeans and Canadians of French descent. Genomes from each of the genetic groups exhibited the behaviour they expected to varying degrees. African individuals showed the smallest relative proportion of disease-associated mutations on their genome's coldspots, while Western Europeans showed the largest. The experts found that chromosomes recombine frequently in some segments of the genome and less in others, which may take many generations to eventually recombine. Using biological samples and genetic data from different populations around the globe, the researchers found that the segments of the human genome that don't recombine as often as others, tend to carry a significantly greater proportion of genetic mutations that can cause diseases. These segments accumulate more bad mutations until they are recombined, meaning that our genetic material gets worse before it gets better. But thanks to sex, mutations that cause diseases are eventually wiped out from humans’ genetic code. Dr Philip Awadalla, who led the study, said: 'Since these mutations rest on less dynamic segments of our genome, the process can potentially take many hundreds of generations.’ ‘This discovery gives us a better understanding of how we, as humans, become more or less at risk of developing or contracting diseases.’ The study also gives scientists a better idea of where to look for mutations that cause disease, in the human genome, which could speed up the discovery and identification of mutations associated with a number of illnesses.","Researchers from the University of Montreal and Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Centre studied hundreds of people’s genetic code .

"People living in certain parts of the UK are being forced to pay up to £170 million a year more for their broadband, due to a 'postcode lottery'. New research from a broadband comparison site has revealed that in some cases, families are paying more than double what their neighbours are, despite living just 50 yards apart. The study, the biggest ever of its kind, looked at more than 1.7 million postcodes covering 97 per cent of British households. Research from Broadbandchoices.co.uk looked at 1.7 million postcodes and found that people in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands have the greatest choice of provider, price and speeds. Residents in Herefordshire and Rutland had the worst with some people paying £5 more than their neighbours . The study from Broadbandchoices.co.uk found speeds and prices often differ from street to street - sometimes within 50 yards - with postcode affecting choice of providers, deals and available speeds. This system means 13 per cent of internet users are being penalised because they don't have access to cheaper deals - adding more than £60 to their yearly broadband connection bills. Millions of broadband users are also suffering from reduced download speeds and limits. In some areas customers can choose from 10 providers, while others have just five options. This means that although some could pay as little as £2.99 per month for their broadband package, others are being forced to spend £8.15 or more. The difference in availability doesn't . only vary from county to county, some users in the same towns and even . the same street can get better deals than their neighbours. Those living on Bartons Place in . Newmarket, Suffolk, for example, could find themselves paying over twice as much for . their broadband than other houses less than 50 yards away - but getting . just a third of the download speed of their neighbours. 1.

Residents of Scarrowhill Road, Hornsby Gate, Cumbria, pay an extra £5 per month as well as receiving slower download speeds and having two fewer providers to pick from compared to neighbours just half a mile away on the same street. The survey also reveals a north south divide in the number of providers. Those in the South have an average of 10 while those in the North of England have a pool of 11 to choose from. Herefordshire has the worst overall broadband choice where users have the narrowest choice of providers - at an average of eight. The county also has the slowest advertised download speeds of just 12.3Mbps and pay the second highest minimum costs in the country of £5.47, second only to Rutland residents who have to pay a minimum of £5.99 a month. Greater Manchester topped the study with the lowest broadband costs at just £2.99 per month, average advertised download speeds of up to 28Mbps and an average choice of 12 providers. People living on Bartons Place in Newmarket, Suffolk, pictured, pay over twice as much for their broadband than other houses less than 50 yards away - but get just a third of the download speed of their neighbours . Those in the South can take some solace in the fact they just nudge the North when it comes to average advertised download speeds with 22Mbps compared to 21Mbps. The difference in download speeds between counties ranges from 8.5Mbps to 40Mbps, meaning a two-hour HD film takes as little as 10 minutes (at 40Mbps) to download, whilst for others it will take nearly an hour. Dominic Baliszewski, of broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'Broadband has become an essential utility for people in the UK and it's madness that in 2013 people are being penalised simply due to where they live. 'The Government has a responsibility along with providers to ensure a consistent standard of broadband service for every household in the UK. Residents living at one end of Scarrowhill Road, Hornsby Gate in Cumbria, pictured, pay an extra £5 per month, get slower download speeds and have two fewer providers to choose from compared to neighbours just half a mile away at the other end of the street . 'However, with the recent announcement that the Government will now roll out superfast services to 95 per cent of homes by 2017, it seems the goalposts are being repeatedly pushed back. 'Most customers will not even be aware that they are at a digital disadvantage. These discrepancies in speed and price occur when different broadband providers install their technology in different exchanges located around the country. 'If your local exchange has been 'enabled' by lot of different providers, you will have a great selection of broadband services to choose from. However, if you only have a handful of providers enabled at your local exchange, your choice will be extremely limited.' He added: 'Strong broadband competition is vital to ensuring that customers get the best possible service at the best possible price, but even if you live in an area with limited options you should still regularly shop around.'","New study compared broadband choice and price at 1.7 million postcodes .

"During the Ordovician period 470 million years ago life on Earth thrived, but why? It's a question scientists have struggled to answer, but now an ancient meteorite found in a quarry in Sweden could be the missing link that explains what happened. The fossilised space rock is thought to be the remains of one of two asteroids that crashed between Jupiter and Mars, the debris of which later bombarded Earth and kickstarted the variation of life. Scientists say they may have found the 'missing link' that explains the biodiversity of life on Earth 470 million years ago. The 'mysterious object' (right) was found at the Thorsberg quarry in Sweden (left). The meteorite is 8 × 6.5 × 2 centimetres in size. It was found in the youngest quarried bed of the Thorsberg quarry . The find was made at Thorsberg quarry, where about 100 other fossil meteorites have also been found before. The Ordovician period covers the time on Earth between 485 and 443 million years ago. During those 45 million years the area north of the tropics was almost entirely ocean. Most of the world’s land, meanwhile, was part of a southern supercontinent called Gondwana. The period is synonymous with a general biodiversity of life on Earth - in the early Ordovician period life on Earth thrived. The reason for this is unknown, but some theories suggest the arrival of meteorites such as the L chondrites could have kickstarted the resurgence. It wasn’t all fun and games during the Ordovician period, though - towards its end massive glaciers formed on Gondwana as it shifted towards the South Pole. This drained shallow seas and caused sea levels to drop, ultimately resulting in the mass extinction of 60 per cent of marine invertebrates on Earth. Another theory for the mass extinction, however, suggests a ten-second gamma ray burst blasted Earth’s atmosphere, exposing life to deadly levels of radiation. The international team of researchers in their paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, however, say this particular rock is unlike anything ever found. And it could be the 'missing link' for an asteroid collision that had previously been thought to have been vapourised. Over 500 million years ago a small asteroid crashed into a larger one between Jupiter and Mars. This impact resulted in the creation of many fragments that eventually bombarded Earth 470 million years ago. These fragments are known as L chrondrites, and they are the second most common type of meteorite on the planet. It's believed these impacts may have kickstarted the resurgence of biodiversity on planet Earth, when life became more varied and complex. This occurred during the Ordovician period, prior to which biodiversity had gone through a lull. However, while the meteorites are thought to be the remains of the larger asteroid, scientists had been puzzled as to why there was no sign of the smaller asteroid. Until now, no evidence of the other asteroid had been found on Earth, putting a damper on the theory. Some had suggested the second asteroid simply vapourised on impact. The find was made at Thorsberg quarry, where about 100 other fossil meteorites have also been found before. The international team of researchers in their paper published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, however, say this particular rock is unlike anything ever found . The meteorite is thought to be the second of two asteroids that collided between Jupiter and Mars 470 million years ago. Evidence for the larger one has already been found in the form of L chondrite meteorites, the second most common meteorites on Earth, but this new find is the first evidence for the other asteroid in the collision . The meteorite found in Sweden has reignited interest, however, because it's possible it is a piece of that second asteroid, as it appears to have been part of the same meteor shower as the L chondrites. If true, it will add a great deal of credence to the entire theory that seeks to explain the sudden resurgence of life during the early part of the Ordovician period. The meteorite was found by quarry workers three years ago. Other meteorites have been found in the same quarry before, but all of them were L chondrites. This new rock was different from the others the researchers noted after studying its crystals, but was in the same rock layer and dating in the lab, suggesting it arrived during the same time period as part of a wider meteor shower. While still in the same class of primitive achondrites as L chondrites, it's not exactly the same because of small differences in its elemental composition. The team is hopeful that the finding suggests that others will be found, hopefully some that can offer more evidence of their origin. The unique meteorite has not been given an official name yet - for now it's simply being referred to as the 'mysterious object'. And it could just be the missing link that explains one of Earth's greatest mysteries. The asteroid collision resulted in the creation of many fragments that would eventually bombard Earth 470 million years ago (illustrated), called L chrondrites, the second most common type of meteorite on the planet. It's believed these impacts may have kickstarted the resurgence of biodiveristy on Earth . The Ordovician period covers the time on Earth between 485 and 443 million years ago.

"The creator of Mad Men has hit back over the controversial ‘Falling Man’ style poster for the series by claiming that it is being used by the media to ‘exploit’ 9/11. Matthew Weiner said it was ‘ridiculous’ to say he was being insensitive by using the billboards, which features a man in a suit tumbling through the sky. He also claimed the image of a businessman falling out of a window had been around since before the September 11 2001 attacks - even though Mad Men was first shown in 2007. Falling: New Yorkers said the Mad Men poster reminded them of the iconic image of the 'Falling Man' who hurled himself out of the World Trade Centre . Do you think Mad Men's 'Falling Man' image is insensitive to 9/11 victims? Do you think Mad Men's 'Falling Man' image is insensitive to 9/11 victims? Now share your opinion . Weiner was branded ‘cruel’ and ‘tasteless’ over the use of the advert for the fifth season of Mad Men by families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11. The billboard was put up all over Manhattan including streets close to Ground Zero and shows the black shadow of a man falling against a white background. New Yorkers said it reminded them of the iconic image of the ‘Falling Man’ who hurled himself out of the World Trade Centre to escape the burning building. He and dozens of others chose to commit suicide rather than burn to death during the attack which killed 2,977 people. In an interview with Salon.com Weiner said that the media were just using the Mad Men poster as an ‘excuse to show that picture (the Falling Man) again’. Cruel: Matthew Weiner, the creator of Mad Men, has been called 'cruel' and 'tasteless' for using the 'Falling Man' style image . Weiner said that journalists were just looking for an excuse to ‘trot out’ the Falling Man picture which was ‘always a controversial picture to someone who lived through it’. He said: ‘As someone who was very, very involved in the (Mad Men advertising) campaign, and trying to get people to watch the show, I was stunned that someone would try to bring it up again.’ His robust comments are unlikely to . satisfy outraged 9/11 families including Deborah Burlingame, whose . father Charles was the pilot of the jet which crashed into the Pentagon . on 9/11. She has said that Weiner was ‘stupid’ for ‘evoking the tragic memory of those poor souls’ who died during the terrorist attack. Ms . Burlingame has said: ‘I think this advertiser has decided that creating . a controversy, at the expense of the thousands of people who will be . hurt by this image of man falling to his certain death, is worth it.’ John . Feal, who heads the Fealgood Foundation supporting 9/11 emergency . workers, has also said the advert ‘lacks sensitivity’ because for some . the disaster will ‘always  be an open wound’. The fifth season of Mad Men is due to premier in the US this Sunday. AMC, . the network on which Mad Men is shown in America, has defended the use . of the advert and said it was a metaphor for the turmoil experience by . Don Draper, the main character.

"Jailed: Ian Lewell, 41, has been sentenced to two years in prison after taking a PC hostage and threatening her and others with knives and an infected syringe . A career criminal covered in tattoos has been jailed for two years after holding a woman police officer hostage with five knives and a syringe he said was infected with hepatitis C. Ian Lewell, 41, who had taken pills and injected himself with medication, refused to release PC Laura Furby after a late-night stand-off on Guernsey in October last year. PC Furby entered his bedroom to negotiate with him but he pulled out the weapons and said he had hepatitis C and she and anyone who came near him could 'have it too'. Her colleagues donned riot gear and mounted a rescue attempt but Lewell hurled a fire extinguisher as they tried to climb the stairs. Pc Furby escaped when Lewell fell asleep but he woke and moved towards two officers with the syringe as they entered to arrest him and they shot him with Tasers. Lewell was jailed at Guernsey's Royal Court  for two years yesterday. Crown Advocate Rory Calderwood said three officers rushed to a social services house in the island's St Sampson's area on October 24 last year after reports of someone 'smashing up the place'. They found Lewell - whose face is covered with tattoos of insects and flowers - clutching a broken shard of bannister but PC Furby offered to go inside and talk to him because the pair had met before. The court heard he swallowed pills and injected himself with medication before grabbing a pack of five knives. He was also wielding a syringe, claiming he had Hepatitis C and anyone coming up the stairs could 'have it too'. Terrifying: Lewell was wielding a syringe, claiming he had hepatitis C and anyone coming up the stairs could 'have it too' Weapon: This is one of five knives the thug had in his bedroom - he was arrested after her dropped off and officers Tasered him . PC Furby said in a witness statement: 'I went back into the hallway and I was now about a foot away from Lewell, who had the knives clutched in his left hand. 'He began puffing out his chest and began looking into my face with a scary intensity. 'He then said to me ""You cannot leave, I'm not going to go calmly, they can come and get me"". 'I felt a draining from my head to my toes and a deep-rooted feeling that everything was about to go wrong.' Lewell, who suffered from mental health issues and had a string of former convictions, spent a week in hospital after the incident in an induced coma after vomit got into his lungs. He denied ever intending to harm PC Furby but pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and causing £465-worth of damage to social services-run property.","Ian Lewell, 41, jailed for two years after he refused to release PC Laura Furby .

"A Los Angeles woman fled onto her roof when a transient broke into her home Wednesday and terrifying photos have revealed how close the intruder came to finding her. Melora Rivera bravely crawled onto her Venice roof and had the wherewithal to take her cell phone and call police. 'Once I saw him in the house, I knew that we both couldn’t be there,' Rivera told CBS LA from her Venice home. Scroll down for video . The stuff of nightmares: Venice, California resident Melora Rivera is seen in the foreground as a homeless man who broke into her home lunges out onto the roof where she'd fled in fear . Status update: Rivera cowers under her roof checking her phone as she waits for police to find the intruder who is lurking around her property . Police arrived on the scene just minutes after Rivera's frantic call as she hid beneath an eave of the roof. An area blogger snapped a photo just as the itinerant, later ID'd by police as 29-year-old Christian Hicks, lurched onto the roof behind her. It was a moment borne of nightmares. But brave Rivera kept her composure. 'I knew that I didn’t want to have a confrontation with him of any sort, you know, not knowing what his intention was,' she told CBS LA. In spite of her composure, Rivera--who works in showbiz and had a small role the 2012 Whitney Houston film Sparkle--revealed that she did have at least one overarching fear as she clung to the roof. Cover: A police officer provides cover while Rivera begins her descent from the roof into the arms of firefighters . Helping hand: Authorities arrived just minutes after the terrifying photo was taken . 'It was my biggest fear was that he was going to be forced by the cops to come hide in basically the same place I was hiding,' Rivera said. Lucky for her, that didn't happen. Police managed to coax the intruder down after giving Rivera a ladder on which she could climb to safety. Even as Rivera was still reeling Wednesday from the experience, she worried for people like Hicks in her neighborhood. She told CBS LA: 'I think it’s very obvious for most of us who live around here, when someone seems to be suffering from a mental illness, and to continue to let these people walk around without offering them assistance, to protect them and us. That, I think, is the heart of the problem.' Taken into custody: The man was eventually coaxed down by police. Hicks' bail has been set at $50,000 . Cuffed: Hicks was put on the floor and handcuffed before being taken away. Neighbors said that he had been wandering around other peoples' yards that morning . Lucky escape: Eye witness Craig Miller told MailOnline: 'What is amazing is that I happened to see it and there just happened to be an LAPD car right there. Who knows what could have happened to that girl otherwise' Eye witness Craig Miller said: 'I was driving my car to work and just happened to look over to my left and saw this person kicking in the front door to a house, obviously I knew something was wrong, I turned around to get the address and call 911 to report it and I just happened to see an LAPD car at the stop sign so I flagged them down and told them what was going on. 'The next thing I know these guys are surrounding the house and there's a female up on the roof. 'What is amazing is that I happened to see it and there just happened to be an LAPD car right there. Who knows what could have happened to that girl otherwise. The police did a great job, they dealt with it in seconds and had a chopper up in the air.' Alex Thompson, who runs neighborhood watch website Venice311.org, heard the call out on the police scanner. She told MailOnline: 'I heard a call come out for a burglary, a burglar had entered a home. I was on my way to the bank and the address was on the way so I went down there. 'As I come around the corner and I look up and there's this half naked girl cowering underneath the awning and the police have their guns drawn. 'I stood there with some other residents and we thought she was the burglar up on the roof not listening to the officers' commands. 'I took my camera phone out and started taking pictures, then all of a sudden this horrifying dark figure pops up on the other side of the roof and everybody on the other side of the street was like, 'oh no', it was the scariest Jack in the box, freak show, weird situation. 'At that point we realize he's the burglar and the girl is the victim freaking out. The cops keep him at bay and get the girl safely off the roof and the guy down and in cuffs.' Eagle-eyed Alex - who often patrols Venice on her bike listening to her scanner - says other residents revealed they recognized the man as someone in cuffs earlier that morning. The lovely Ms. Rivera was in bed when the intruder entered her home. The Atlanta native has appeared in several films including the Whitney Houston movie Sparkle . Others told Alex they had called the cops to report the guy in their yard. But Alex said: 'That's the problem, the people who called on him don't press charges. 'The police stopped him earlier that day and called the home owners back and said ""we need you to do a field show up to identify him"", but oh no they couldn't be bothered. 'The police can't hold him if people aren't going to press charges and these situations escalate.'","The photo snapped by a passerby as police surrounded the Los Angeles home is the stuff of nightmares .

"Pope Francis greets the crowd at the end of his weekly general audience today . A little bread and wine 'does no harm,' Pope Francis said to a divorced woman as he flew in the face of Catholic convention by telling her it's okay to take communion. Catholic teachings traditionally forbid divorcees from the Eucharist, so the divorcee had written to its spiritual leader asking for advice about how she could be part of the ritual. She had told him she didn't want to do anything that would be wrong in the eyes of the church. Pope Francis has for some time been looking for a solution to the problem, saying that ‘something must be done’ to help those that want to. Last month he told a morning mass in Rome that divorcees should not be condemned but rather ‘accompanied’. Argentinian divorcee Jacquelina Sabetta wrote to Francis last year asking ‘what to do, given that to take communion would be violating one of the rules of the church'. Seven months later she was amazed to receive a phone call from someone who ‘presented himself as Father Bergoglio’. After apologising for the lateness of his response Francis reportedly said  'It is a question that we are discussing at the Vatican because a divorced person who takes communion is not doing any harm. ‘ . The phone call was initially revealed by the woman’s new husband on Facebook. Julio Sabetta said the call to his wife from the Pope was ‘the best thing that had happened to him in life, after the birth of his children. ‘ . Francis is becoming renowned for his impromptu phone calls to those who write to him. Last year he comforted an Italian woman whose son had been murdered, as he worked at a petrol station. The Catholic Church forbids divorcees from taking communion, but Pope Francis has been looking for a solution to the problem saying that 'something must be done' to help those that want to . And in January he surprised a group of Spanish nuns when he left an answerphone message wishing them happy New Year, before ringing back later for a chat. Vatican spokesman Ciro Benedettini said that the conversation was part of a private phone call. 'The Vatican does not comment on private calls made by the Pope', he said. But previously the Vatican denied claims by a gay Frenchman who said that Francis rang him personally and told him that his homosexuality was not a grave sin. The news will be a balm to Catholic divorcees around the world who presently feel excluded from the church by a sense of shame. A formal change in doctrine is expected be discussed at the Extraordinary Synod for the Family in October this year. In the run up to the gathering, which is similar to a parliament, the Vatican has commissioned a ‘sex survey’ from every diocese in the world asking for parishioners’ opinions on divorce, gay marriage and celibacy.

"Weak and bleeding, a Union Army officer who stood fast commanding his artillery battery and was killed as thousands of Confederate forces advanced on his troops received an honor Thursday from President Barack Obama that was more than 150 years in the making: the Medal of Honor. It is the nation's highest military honor for battlefield valor. Obama awarded the medal to First Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing, who was killed on July 3, 1863, during the three-day Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. The fight often is described as a turning point of the Civil War. A distant cousin, Helen Loring Ensign, of Palm Desert, California, accepted the framed medal. 'This medal is a reminder that, no matter how long it takes, it's never too late to do the right thing,' Obama told about 60 descendants and supporters of the 22-year-old Wisconsin native during a brief ceremony in a windowless White House meeting room. Scroll down for video . Honored: President Barack Obama bestowed the nation's highest military honor on the Union Army officer First Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing . Defended: On the third day of battle, Cushing's small force stood its ground under severe artillery bombardment and an assault by nearly 13,000 Confederates . Address: President Obama spoke Thursday of Cushing's bravery at Gettysburg . Ceremony: Obama stood next to Cushing's descendant Helen Bird Loring Ensign after she was presented with the Medal of Honor . Cushing commanded about 110 men and six cannons, defending the Union position on Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge . Cushing was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, raised in Fredonia, New York, and buried at his alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, after his death at age 22. He commanded about 110 men and six cannons, defending the Union position on Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge, a major Confederate thrust that was repelled by Union forces. On the final day of battle, Cushing's small force stood its ground under severe artillery bombardment and an assault by nearly 13,000 advancing Confederate infantrymen. Wounded in the stomach and right shoulder, Cushing refused to move to the rear and insisted on ordering his guns to the front lines. Obama quoted Cushing as telling a fellow soldier who had urged him to go to the rear that he would 'fight it out, or die in the attempt.' Obama also paid tribute to the thousands of unknown young soldiers 'who saved our union' and observed 'that I might not be standing here today, as president, had it not been for the ultimate sacrifices of those courageous Americans.' The presentation to Cushing was all the more extraordinary because recommendations for a Medal of Honor normally must be made within two years of an act of heroism, and the medal presented within three. Congress had to grant an exemption for Cushing's honor. Remebered: Obama posed with Ensign as well as the lawmakers that helped her ancestor be posthumously awarded . Determined: Wounded in the stomach and right shoulder, Cushing refused to move back and insisted on ordering his guns to the front lines. He was shot and killed as Confederate forces closed in on his position . 'Sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the passage of time,' Obama said. He acknowledged efforts by Cushing's supporters, including members of Congress, who pushed for the posthumous honor. Included in that group is Margaret Zerwekh, a historian from Cushing's birthplace of Delafield. Obama said she spent more than 25 years researching and writing letters on Cushing's behalf. 'What's more, she even managed to bring Republican and Democrats together to make this happen,' Obama said, two days after elections in which voters expressed their frustration over Washington gridlock by putting the GOP in control of the Senate. Obama told Zerwekh that 'we may call on you again sometime in the next several months.' Wisconsin Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican, and Ron Kind, a Democrat, led the congressional effort to see that Cushing received a Medal of Honor. Later Thursday, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were honoring service members, veterans and their families at a musical event on the South Lawn. Mrs. Obama and Jill Biden, the wife of Vice President Joe Biden, lead 'Joining Forces,' a nationwide campaign to rally the country to support its troops. Descendant: Cousin Helen Bird Loring Ensign is one of Cushing's descendants and was presented with the Medal of Honor at the Thursday event . The Cushing name is prominent in Delafield in southeastern Wisconsin. A monument to Cushing and two of his brothers — Naval Cmdr. William Cushing and Army 1st Lt. Howard Cushing — stands at Cushing Memorial Park, where the town holds most of its Memorial Day celebrations. Wisconsin's lawmakers in Congress had attached an amendment to honor Cushing to a defense spending bill in 2010, but then-Sen. James Webb, D-Va., stripped it out. Webb argued it was impossible to go back 150 years to determine who should receive a medal. He predicted that doing so could spark a flood of claims. The Medal of Honor is given to service members who risk their lives in acts of personal bravery above and beyond the call of duty.","Obama bestowed the Medal of Honor on Gettysburg soldier 1st Lt.

"Robin van Persie is determined to play for Holland at the 2018 World Cup and intends to carry on until the age of 40. The Manchester United striker scored four goals to help his country to third place at this summer's World Cup in Brazil and has already set his sights on the next one in Russia, when he will be 35. And thinking beyond that, Van Persie is keen to stretch his playing career for as long as possible despite suffering various injury problems over the years. Longevity: Robin van Persie wants to represent Holland at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and continue playing until the age of 40 . Back in action: Van Persie was given an extended break after the World Cup this summer but is back playing for Manchester United at the beginning of the Louis van Gaal era . Speaking about the next World Cup to Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, Van Persie said: 'I will be 35 then and I will do everything to be there. 'I live quietly, this saves a few years. My goal is to play at the highest level for as long as possible and being available for the national team is a part of that. 'I am 31 now and I have a little less than nine years to go. I won't be playing for a major club at the age of 40, although I do still want to be playing professional football at that age. That's my goal.' Flying Dutchman: Van Persie scores his memorable diving header in Holland's 5-1 win over Spain at the World Cup finals, one of four he contributed as the Oranje finished in third place . Misfiring: Van Persie heads towards goal in United's 0-0 draw at Burnley. They haven't won yet this season . Van Persie is already his national team's all-time leading goalscorer with 47 and is eight caps short of a century. Having been given an extended break by Louis van Gaal, his former coach with Holland, after the World Cup, he has so far started two matches for Man United this season. Van Persie has suffered a succession of injuries both with United and former club Arsenal but is confident he can continue until the age of 40. The striker will captain the Dutch side in Guus Hiddink's first match in charge, the Euro 2016 qualifier with the Czech Republic in Prague on Tuesday night.

"Jewish campaigners are demanding a German pulp magazine be shut down for glorifying Nazi soldiers in World War II. Der Landser - translated literally as The Squaddie - is a small magazine published by the giant Bauer media group whose pages are filled with stories of derring-do, glory and chivalry. But those it praises are foot soldiers in either the Wehrmacht - the Germany army during the Second World War which facilitated in numerous massacres of civilians - or the soldiers of the Waffen S.S. Controversial: The magazine praises foot soldiers in either the Wehrmacht, the Waffen, or fighting, S.S. The Waffen S.S were seen as one of the main perpetrators of the Holocaust. In a recent issue, a group of Waffen S.S. in Greece are swigging wine after a battle and declaring; 'These Greeks . are a good natured lot - we conquer them and they are still friendly!' In previous issues soldiers of S.S. divisions like Das Reich have been portrayed as fighting machines who fought only for honour and their Fatherland. But no mention is ever made of the atrocities they took part in. Das Reich, for example, laid waste to the village of Oradour sur Glane in 1944, killing over 650 people. Glorified: The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles is angry that Hitler's Nazi soldiers have been portrayed in a  positive light . And the Totenkopf, or Death's Head division, murdered 99 British soldiers in Le Paradis in France in 1940. In previous issues of Der Landser, which has been published continuously since 1957, both divisions were glorified with no mention of participation in atrocities. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles, named after the death camp survivor who devoted his life after the war to bringing Nazi killers to justice, said it is time to call time on Der Landser. It called on the German government to shut the publication down. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the centre said: 'It portrays these men as honourable soldiers like British, American, Canadian or French soldiers.  But the reality is they were murderous thugs.' In a time of rising neo-Nazism in Germany, Rabbi Hier said publications like Landser which glorify the soldiers of the Third Reich, have no place. The copies are available through Amazon and downloadable through Apple and i-Tunes. Distributors for the magazine in Germany said they have no plans to halt production but the country's interior ministry, mindful of the harm done to Germany's image abroad through such works, has promised a full probe which will seek ways to possibly shut it down. The respected German magazine Der Spiegel once described it as 'a specialist journal for whitewashing the Wehrmacht.'

"FC Toronto president Tim Leiweke has hit out at Jermain Defoe, claiming he can 'get the hell out of our way' if he does not want to return to the MLS. Defoe, who signed for the American club six months ago on a four-year-deal, is currently being paid £90,000 a week and has played 16 matches for his new side. Despite scoring 11 goals in his time there - an impressive goals-per-game ratio - Defoe is said to be looking for a premature end to his spell in the USA, in favour of a move back to the Premier League. Jermain Defoe has not settled well into the MLS, and wants a quick return to England . Deadline day moves to QPR and Leicester fell through, but the former could still be an option for Defoe . Speaking at Ryerston University, Toronto president Leiweke said: 'I personally don't think Defoe will come back. I think if he doesn't want to be here you get rid of him. 'My attitude is, if you want to be here and buy into what we've been doing, let's go...I will be with you every day. If you don't want to be here, get the hell out of our way.' Defoe was linked with deadline day moves to Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City, but after both fell through the ex-Tottenham striker is said to be exploring other avenues. FC Toronto though, are in pole position when it comes to selling the want-away forward. Defoe still has three-and-a-half-years left on his deal, and his club will want to hold out until January to enable them to recoup some of their £6 million transfer fee. Leiweke was quick to compare Defoe to David Beckham, a success story of promoting the MLS around the globe. 'Has Jermain Defoe ultimately adapted as well as David Beckham did? 'David Beckham had more character, more grit, more determination than any player I've ever been around. Never once did he run, hide or fade away.' Defoe has been with Toronto for less than a year but he could be on the move again .","Jermain Defoe is likely to leave FC Toronto in the near future .

"The French Foreign Ministry has been forced to begin negotiations with the U.S. State Department about making payments to Holocaust survivors or risk losing out on a billion dollar contract. The state-owned Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF) runs some of the fastest and most efficient lines in the world but has a dark history which saw it transport thousands of Jews to their deaths in German concentration camps. The company transported some 76,000 French Jews to Nazi concentration camps during the wartime occupation – of which only about 3,000 survived. State-owned SNCF runs some of the fastest and most efficient lines in the world but has a dark history which saw it transport thousands of Jews to their deaths in German concentration camps . SNCF formally apologized for its role in 2011, but claimed that it acted under coercion from the Nazis and has - until now - always sought to avoid making reparations. Only now that subsidiary Keolis is attempting to secure a $6.5 billion contract to build a 16 mile light-rail network connecting Maryland’s suburbs has the company decided that it might have to reconsider its previous position. The 35-year contract for the Purple Line project is one of the biggest government contracts in the state's history, but opposition from Holocaust survivors has left the Kelois bid hanging in the balance. Leo Bretholz, a Holocaust survivor who lives in Maryland, doesn’t believe that local tax dollars should go toward SNCF or its subsidiaries. Holocaust survivor Leo Bretholz lives in Maryland and doesn't believe that local tax dollars should go toward SNCF or its subsidiaries . The 92-year-old has gathered more than 150,000 signatures on a petition that blasts the ‘unconscionable’ possibility that the company could now reap profits from its taxpaying victims. ‘Until they properly acknowledge their role in the Holocaust and take full responsibility, the people of Maryland should not allow their tax dollars to be used to help the company expand its business here,’ he wrote in an editorial for the Baltimore Sun last month. Bretholz escaped from an SNCF train headed for the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942, and he believes the company actively collaborated with the Nazis, claiming that its workers earned profits from the deportations and played a direct role in implementing them. ‘They pursued payment on this after the liberation of Paris, after the Nazis were gone,’ he wrote, citing an invoice that SNCF sent to the French government. ‘They even charged interest for late payments. This was not coercion, this was business.’ The bad-feeling against SNCF has prompted senators in the state to propose a bill which would make it illegal for the French to apply for prestige projects. Prisoners arrive at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland in 1945: SNCF transported some 76,000 French Jews to Nazi concentration camps during the wartime occupation ¿ of which only about 3,000 survived . Holocaust survivor Leo Bretholz, now 92, points to his name in a record book of passengers of french trains / convoys bound for Nazi death camps . The Holocaust Rail Justice Act, co-sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, would prohibit Maryland from entering public-private partnerships with any company that deported Nazi prisoners during the Holocaust without paying restitution to 'all identifiable victims of the deportations or to their families.' That would also include foreign companies with Holocaust ties and any entities they partially or completely own. The Maryland state legislature is to debate the bill this month. When the bill was first announced in January, Alain Leray, head of SNCF in America, said his company would analyze the proposed bill for ‘possible discrimination’. He insisted that his company had as much right as any other to operate as a successful business in the U.S., but now with a billion dollar contract at stake SNCF is reconsidering its position. 'The SNCF wants desperately to do business here,' Harriet Tamen, a Manhattan attorney representing some 600 U.S., Israeli and French Jews, told the New York Daily News. 'It wasn’t an attack of morals that caused them to reach out now.' She said she has communicated her clients’ expectations to SNCF, and is now awaiting an offer. Keolis is attempting to secure a $6.5 billion contract to build a 16 mile light-rail network connecting Maryland's suburbs known as the Purple Line . Keolis also recently won a $2.7 billion contract from Boston’s Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority. Four years ago, SNCF issued a public apology in Florida over its wartime conduct after bidding for a rail contract to connect the cities of Orlando and Tampa. And last August Senator Chuck Schumer introducing a measure that opened SNCF up to compensation suits in U.S. courts. SNCF has continually argued that it is immune to legal action over the Holocaust thanks to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Mr Schumer said: ‘Survivors and family members of those who perished have long attempted to hold SNCF accountable for its active role during the Holocaust, but so far the company has succeeded in cloaking itself in foreign sovereign immunity, evading jurisdiction in United States courts.’ Mr Schumer added: ‘The Holocaust Rail Justice Act would finally enable survivors and family members to hold this French rail company accountable in a court of law for sending thousands to their death during World War II, and allow survivors and family members an opportunity for justice.’ Railroad tracks lead to the entrance gate at Birkenau, part of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the largest Nazi concentration camp and extermination camp in operation during World War II .","SNCF runs some of the most efficient railway lines in the world but has a dark history during which it transported thousands of Jews to their deaths .

"It was the shocking photograph that went viral on Thursday. Melora Rivera cowered, half-naked, under the eaves on her roof as an intruder lurked, looking for her just yards away. Now Melora has spoken to MailOnline about the terrifying ordeal and shared the photographs that she took as she desperately waited for rescue. The dramatic pictures show cops with their guns drawn moving in on the house in Venice, California as the disturbed transient searched for the horrified TV writer. Rivera, 30 - who is still reeling from the home invasion on Wednesday morning - told MailOnline: 'I felt like I was becoming the plot to a horror movie, it was terrifying, all my instincts told me I had to get out of there. Scroll down for video . The stuff of nightmares: Venice, California resident Melora Rivera is seen in the foreground as a homeless man who broke into her home lunges out onto the roof where she'd fled in fear . Intruder alert: Melora was on the roof for 30 minutes and took pictures on her phone as she awaited rescue . My heroes: Firefighters arrive on scene with a ladder to bring Melora down from the roof and end her nightmare . Status update: Rivera cowers under her roof checking her phone as she waits for police to find the intruder who is lurking around her property . 'This guy had kicked my front door in, chased me up to my bedroom and followed me out the window on to the roof, all I could do was hide. 'If the police hadn't got there when they did, who knows what could have happened. I thought I might have to jump off the roof. My mind keeps playing over and over all the possible ways this could have played out.' Rivera - who only moved in to the rented property three weeks ago - was fast asleep when the intruder first started scoping the house at 8.15am. The New Yorker was woken by someone jiggling the knob to her front door and knocking. She said: 'My bedroom is in the loft and there’s a ladder coming up from near the front door so the sound woke me up. I looked at my phone and the few people it could have been hadn't texted to say they were coming round. 'I hesitated for a second and eventually I come down and look out of the window and see the guy walking away, he was talking to himself, it sounded like he was commenting on a car parked in the street.' Rivera says that as a single woman she has learnt not to advertise the fact you're home alone. 'I wasn't going to shout after him and ask him what he wanted. I just let him keep going,' she said. Shrugging off the visit Rivera contemplated taking a shower ready for work – but instead she decided to go back to bed. 'It’s a worrying thought because the guy came back 15 minutes later and I could have been taking a shower,' she said. 'There's no lock on the bathroom door and the window is way too small to climb through, he could have come straight in to get me. I would have been trapped like a scene in Psycho. 'But luckily I was lazy that morning and decided to go back to bed to get a little more sleep. My laziness may have helped save my life.' Terror: Melora told MailOnline: 'There was six cops pointing their guns up at me and a helicopter overhead... and I'm stuck on a roof with no pants on, it was crazy' Cover: A police officer provides cover while Rivera begins her descent from the roof into the arms of firefighters . Helping hand: Authorities arrived just minutes after the terrifying photo was taken . Taken into custody: The man was eventually coaxed down by police. Hicks' bail has been set at $50,000 . Fifteen minutes the intruder was back and this time he meant business. He started ramming the door with his shoulder. 'I looked down from my bedroom and could see the door buckling with every charge,' said an animated Rivera. 'It seemed relentless, this guy was going to carry on until he got in, I was scared. I called 911 and told them someone was trying to break in my house. 'I was giving them my address when a big chunk of my door broke inwards and I saw the guy's hand coming inside to unlock it.' Rivera decided her best plan was to escape. Her bedroom is in the eaves of the house meaning her windows are low down. She slid back the glass door of one of the windows and kicked the screen panel out. ‘I literally crawled through the window and as the intruder steps one foot in my house, I step one foot on the roof,' she said. 'But he didn't stop there. He came up the steps to my bedroom and as I’m crawling around the roof I see his head pop out through the window. The next thing he’s on the roof with me.' Fortunately a passer-by had seen the intruder – since identified as mentally ill Christian Hicks aged 24 – kicking in Rivera's front door. He flagged down a passing squad car and the officers descended on the property, their guns drawn screaming at the intruder to come down. The whole time Rivera was on the phone to a 911 dispatcher. 'The dispatcher tried to keep me calm, she kept saying ""the police have an eye on the suspect, he's on the roof,"" I was like ""I know, I'm on the roof too mam, that's the problem,"" it was nerve-wracking.' Police managed to coax Hicks down off the roof after firefighters gave Rivera a ladder on which she could climb to safety. Amazingly Rivera says the whole incident lasted as long as 30 minutes and she managed to take some photos as it all unfolded. 'There was six cops pointing their guns up at me and a helicopter overhead, and a bunch of people are watching from the sidewalk, and I'm stuck on a roof with no pants on, it was crazy,' she said. 'It was a weird sensation to feel like your life is in jeopardy and people are watching it, I wasn't trying to be a Law & Order episode, I didn't want to die before the credits.' Rivera says she's happy to have escaped unscathed and owes her dramatic escape to her mom who works as a TV news anchor in Georgia. Lucky escape: Eye witness Craig Miller told MailOnline: 'What is amazing is that I happened to see it and there just happened to be an LAPD car right there. Who knows what could have happened to that girl otherwise' 'The one thing she would say a lot and remind me of a lot is the adage that you don't ever let somebody take you to a second location. 'You know, if someone is trying to kidnap you or carjack you, you need to escape now, you need to fight in the moment. 'That was my instinct, don't stay in the house and confront this guy, get as far away from him and this situation as possible. 'By the time I saw the police cruiser approaching my house I heard him coming up to my bedroom. They arrived just in time.' Rivera - who writes for TV and also had an acting role the 2012 Whitney Houston film Sparkle – must now decide whether she still feels comfortable living in a neighborhood she’s only called home for the last three weeks. 'I just got staffed as a writer on a show which was a huge step up for me so I moved to Venice to be closer to the office. I wanted to live the dream and move by the beach. Then this happened, it really sucks, I'm not sure what to do next.'","Melora Rivera, 30, said she felt like she was in 'the plot of a horror movie' when disturbed Christian Hicks forced his way into her Venice Beach home .

"Author Tom Bower has claimed that family jewellery smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia at the outbreak of World War Two has been lost by Barclays bank . Author Tom Bower has claimed that family jewellery smuggled out of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia at the outbreak of World War Two has been lost by Barclays bank. Mr Bower - who has written biographies on music mogul Simon Cowell and Virgin boss Richard Branson - said the family heirlooms were smuggled out of Prague  two days into Hitler's occupation in March 1939, as his family fled the Czech capital. They were then kept in a safe-deposit box in the Barclays branch in Finchley in 1986. But in March 2012, Mr Bower said he discovered that the precious jewels had disappeared. He admits he did not keep detailed records of what was in the box, which he claims was filled with 'several plastic bags filled with necklaces, rings, earrings, hat pins and brooches all sparkling with diamonds, rubies and emeralds'. Writing in the Sunday Times, he said he saw the contents, placing the deeds to his own house in the metal box. But after his father passed away, Mr Bowen visited the box to withdraw his own personal documents and said he discovered the jewels were missing. He said: 'The family heirlooms, which had been protected from successive regimes in central Europe, were finally lost thanks to Barclays.' Mr Bower complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, but his complaint was rejected after an adjudicator found 'there was no conclusive evidence to show what exactly was in the box'. He said the way the situation was dealt with was 'a disgrace'. Mr Bower - who has written biographies on music mogul Simon Cowell and Virgin boss Rochard Branson - said the family heirlooms were smuggled out of Prague two days into Hitler's occupation in March 1939, as his family fled the Czech capital. They were then kept in a safe-deposit box in the Barclays branch in Finchley in 1986 . A Barclays spokesman said: 'We have corresponded with Mr Bower on this matter on several occasions in the past, and both our rigorous investigation and that of the Financial Ombudsman Service have concluded that his jewellery could not have gone missing while in our safekeeping. 'At no time while Mr Bower was the owner of the box was the bank in possession of the key. Writer Tom Bower (right) is known for his biographies of the rich and influential . 'We have apologised to Mrs Bower for the inconvenient process in closing her dormant account and offered her a gesture of goodwill last March. The claim of harassment by members of our branch staff is wholly unjustified.' Bower, a journalist and investigative historian, has previously published a book on Branson and has also written books about Robert Maxwell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell.

The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft. It is most famous for the Dambusters . raids, which saw 19 Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes . Wallis's 'bouncing bombs' in 1943. Vera - built two years after the raids, in 1945 - was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in 1978 and . underwent a 10-year restoration.

On May 16, 1943, 19 aircraft set out . to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the . Sorpe. The idea was to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany. The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, but also supplied drinking water. The squadron was assembled by Wing . Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - . using special bouncing bombs, invented by Barnes Wallis. They were not told that they would be . bombing the Ruhr valley until six hours before the raid began, following . weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached. The first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves . bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact. Although the mission was hailed . a success, eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids.","Lancaster bombers united on windswept RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire for what will probably be last time .

"They are now frail old ladies. But nearly seven decades ago these women were serving as guards at Hitler’s death camps, shepherding hundreds of Nazi Germany’s victims to their deaths. The women are among some 24 suspects now being investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their wartime roles as accomplices to mass murder. Despite the fact there are no witnesses left alive to testify as to what they did, prosecutors hope that the mere fact of serving in a place of suffering and death will be enough to bring charges and guilty verdicts. Probe: Charlotte S, left, now 94, was an SS guard in the Nazi death camps Ravensbrück and Auschwitz, according to Stasi records, while Gisela S, is pictured right in her card index of concentration camp guards . Horror: Prisoners produce weapons in the concentration camp of Dachau during World War Two . Last week a former Dachau guard . identified only as Horst P, aged 87, was pictured at his Berlin home . with a collage of photos of him in his SS uniform beneath the words Mein . Kampf – the title of Adolf Hitler’s hate-filled blueprint for racial . war. Now the central . authority for the prosecution of Nazi war crimes, based in Ludwigsburg, . has sent out files on 24 more suspects, including three women. Gertrud . Elli Schmid, now 92 and living in Hamburg, is one of the suspects. She . was formerly an SS guard at Majdanek in the Polish city of Lublin where . an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during WW2. Prosecutors . have traced her SS identity card. After service in Majdanek she was . sent to Auschwitz, also in occupied Poland, where 1.1million prisoners . were exterminated. Now . wheelchair bound, she was tracked down by the daily newspaper Bild. Her . daughter said: ‘We know that my mother had something to do with . Auschwitz. We have tried to talk with her about it but her memory . doesn’t really function any more.’ Tortured: Prisoners look out from behind a barbed wire enclosure at the Dachau concentration camp in Germany in 1945 . Another . SS woman has been identified as Gisela S. Now 90, she lives in a care . home in northern Germany. She too worked at Auschwitz. Charlotte . S, 94, was a guard at the women’s concentration camp of Ravensbruck . where diarist Anne Frank was briefly incarcerated before being sent to . her death at Belsen. Ravensbruck . held mainly women and Charlotte S is said to have been a terrifying . figure who beat up  prisoners and unleashed her Alsatian dog on them. Tried . in Communist East Germany after the war, she was locked up for 15 . months for attacking prisoners and stealing from them, but this time . prosecutors hope to charge her with accessory to murder. A . man on the list is Oskar Groening, cleared of war crimes in 1948. He . served in Auschwitz as a clerk sorting through the clothes and . possessions of the victims. Survivors: French prisoners pictured when the Nazi concentration camp of Dachau, near Munich, was liberated by Allied troops at the end of April 1945 . Work: Children are seen behind barbed wire in Auschwitz . He said: 'I . was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which . basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from . the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin. 'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin. 'It . was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight . to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be . showered before going to work. On trial: Oskar Groening, now 92, pictured in his S.S. uniform when he served in Auschwitz, has been deemed fit to stand trial for his role as an accomplice to mass murder at the camp . 'Many . Jews knew they were going to die. One time a drunken SS man discovered a . crying baby on the platform. He grabbed the waif by its legs and . smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw . it.' He . claims he applied for a transfer and fought in Belgium until his . capture. He, too, now faces an  indictment of complicity to commit mass . murder. On one night in January 1943 he saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed. 'It . was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas . chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for . prisoners who had escaped,' he went on. 'There were more than 100 prisoners . and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the . chamber and the door was shut. 'Then a sergeant with a gasmask went to a . hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside. 'In . that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir . of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day. 'I again made an application for a . transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian . Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture. But you can . imagine that down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my . dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them. 'I . have never been back there because of my shame. This guilt will never . leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement.' He, too, is in the eye of prosecutors who believe him to be worthy of an indictment of guilty of complicity to mass murder. Notorious: Groening was responsible for guarding the possessions of the doomed arrivals as they stepped off the trains bringing them to Auschwitz (pictured) in Poland. He claims he committed no crimes at the complex .","Authorities serve files on two dozen suspected war criminals .
