"Warren Buffett has tried calming the fears of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders since the firm failed to beat the market last year. The 'Oracle of Omaha' told investors that they should be confident in the company's prospects. Buffett released an upbeat annual letter Saturday. He told investors in the Omaha, Nebraska, based conglomerate that just about everything turned out well for Berkshire's 80-odd subsidiaries last year. Optimistic 'Oracle': Warren Buffett said that his predictions for his company Berkshire Hathaway are strong going into 2014 even though they lagged behind the S&P last year (pictured in May 2013) And Buffett says the company has a solid foundation that now includes owning 8 1/2 businesses big enough to be part of the Fortune 500 if they were separate companies. The latest addition to that list was the ketchup-maker Heinz, which Berkshire bought half of last year. Buffett says that deal will start paying off in 2014 after one-time charges of $1.3billion related to restructuring and the purchase itself limited Heinz's profits last year. He continued his optimism through the weekend, as the he said in the annual letter he writes to Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman Charlie Munger was released and details their plans for growth. 'Charlie and I have always considered a 'bet' on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be a very close to a sure thing,' Buffett, 83, said in his annual letter, referring to his 90-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger. 'America's best days lie ahead.' Full-year profit rose 31 per cent to $19.48billion, or $11,850 per Class A share, while operating profit rose 20 per cent to $15.14billion, or $9,211 per share. For the fourth quarter, net profit . rose nearly 10 per cent to $4.99billion, or $3,035 per share, and . operating profit rose 34 per cent to $3.78billion, or $2,297 per share. Results . improved in many of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's more than 80 . businesses, from retail to railroads, insurance to ice cream. Financial family: Warren's son Howard (left) seemed cheerful alongside his son Warren (right) at a conference on February 18 . 'On the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year - in certain cases very well,' the world's fourth-richest man wrote to shareholders. Buffett said he remains on the hunt for more big acquisitions, which he calls 'elephants,' after two recent big purchases: a $5.6 billion acquisition of Nevada utility NV Energy by Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy unit, and the $12.25billion investment in Heinz. Buffett has long recommended diversified investments in basic businesses capable of steadily boosting revenue over the long haul. While Berkshire is known for its insurance businesses, Buffett said profit from a 'Powerhouse Five' of large non-insurance unit - the BNSF railway, Iscar for metalworking, Lubrizol for chemicals, Marmon for industrial products, and MidAmerican - might boost pre-tax profit in 2014 by $1billion from the $10.8billion they collected in 2013. Book value per share at the end of 2013 rose 18.2 per cent from the end of 2012, to reach $134,973.","Investment firm lagged behind the S&P in 2013 after making big bets .

"Two sisters orphaned in last year's Alps massacre have started a new life with their aunt and uncle, but will always have armed police guards, it emerged today. Zainab al-Hilli, eight, and her sister Zeena, four, lost their parents and grandmother after they were gunned down in their BMW on a holiday to Lake Annecy on September 5, 2012. Saad al-Hilli, 50, mother Iqbal, 47, and grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were killed alongside 45-year-old French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, in a crime that has still not been solved. Mystery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 8, was pistol-whipped and left for dead, and sister Zeena hid under her dead mother's skirt in the unsolved Alps massacre that claimed the lives of their parents and grandparents . Unsolved: French police investigating the horrific murder . of Saad al-Hilli (left) have, more than a year on, finally released a portrait of the possible . killer (right) Zainab was left fighting for her life after being shot in the shoulder and bludgeoned over the head with a gun, while Zeena hid underneath her mother's skirt in the back of the car and survived unscathed. Ruling: High Court judge Justice Baker today agreed the orphans' maternal aunt and uncle should be their guardians . But because it is believed Zainab . saw the assassin, the sisters will be getting an armed police guard, the High Court heard. Judge Justice Baker made special guardianship orders allowing the orphans to live with their . maternal aunt, uncle and cousin. In making the guardianship order he commended the aunt and uncle 'for the dedication that have shown to the girls. They have without hesitation taken on the responsibility of caring for their nieces and welcomed them into their home. 'They have, of course, had to do this whilst addressing their own grief and sense of loss. They have had to withstand the intrusion of professionals coming to carry out assessments and other enquiries and the inevitable media attention. 'I commend them for all that they have done, and all that they are going to do in future, for the benefit of the girls'. He also sent his 'very best wishes to the girls. In the last few weeks, they have moved to live with their aunt and uncle and have started their new schools'. The girls had been in foster care since the murders. Another uncle 54-year-old Zaid al-Hilli from Chessington , Surrey is on bail over the deaths thought to be linked to a disputed will. But he denies any wrongdoing. Under the special guardianship order the aunt and uncle are given exclusive power to exercised parental responsibility for the children. The judge said it also provides a degree of permanence, stability, and security for the children. Denial: Zaid Al-Hilli says he does not have any involvement in his brother's death, and remains on police bail . He added: 'It is in the interests of Zainab and Zeena to retain their existing family links and their identity as the children of their tragically deceased parents. 'Accordingly, and rightly, no party has proposed adoption as the appropriate outcome in this case. Manifestly, however, given their traumatic experiences, they do require an order which gives them a higher degree of stability and permanence and in my judgment a special guardianship order meets that requirement. 'Accordingly I make special guardianship orders appointed the aunt and uncle to be special guardians of the girls.' He said the local authority would still provide support for the girls. The aunt and uncle have made an application to live permanently in England . The judge said while it was not a matter for him but the immigration authorities, in his judgment 'it would manifestly be in the best interests of the girls for a way to be found for them to continue to live in this country with their aunt and uncle.' The ruling was made earlier this month but only made public today.","Zainab al-Hilli and her younger sister Zeena, lost parents and grandmother .

"Saad Al-Hilli, one of the four people killed in the Alps murder two years ago today . Those responsible for the murders of four people including members of a British family in the Alps may got away with ‘the perfect crime’, investigators conceded today. Their chilling words come on the second anniversary of a bloodbath which has baffled detectives. It was on September 5, 2012 that Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, and his wife, Iqbal, 47, died alongside her mother and a French cyclist. The Al-Hillis' daughters, Zainab, seven at the time, and Zeena, four, survived the savage attack close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France. ‘The further we advance, the less conviction we have,’ conceded local prosecutor Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry. ‘It lacks the element of a witness which allows everything to be opened up. On a number of occasions we thought we were on the right track.’ Mr Maillaud said that ‘after two years’ hundreds of people had been interviewed, thousands of documents read, and numerous forensic tests carried out ‘but there is no priority line of investigation that stands out.’ Conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come, Mr Maillaud told France’s Metronews: ‘We have tried everything possible, but we’re perhaps we’re in the presence of the perfect crime.’ Detectives thought they had made a breakthrough in June when a 35-year-old Iraqi convicted criminal was questioned for three days, but he provided an alibi. In another bizarre twist, it has emerged that Mrs Al-Hilli had a ‘secret ex-husband’ who died in mysterious circumstances in America on exactly the same day as the quadruple killing. The Al-Hillis, from Claygate, Surrey, originally came from Iraq, and one theory is that their links to the regime of former dictator Saddam Hussein may be a reason for their murders. The scene of murder in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps . Lt Col Benoit Vinnemann, one of the police commanders working on the case, has meanwhile raised the prospect of a ‘family secret’ which may have provided a motive for the murder. He said Iqbal Al-Hilli was ‘secretly married’ to an American dentist 13 years her senior, identified only at James T, between February 1999 and December 2000. The short relationship was ‘never spoken about’ and James T died in Natchez, Mississippi - on exactly the same day as the Alps killings - with one theory being that a poison dart was used to assassinate him, though the official cause of death was a heart attack. Mrs Al-Hilli died next to her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, while local cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car. There have been claims that Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, of Chessington, Surrey. Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, the brother of murdered Saad, was arrested last year but released because of lack of evidence . Zaid Al-Hilli was arrested last year under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because of a lack of evidence. Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old old former policeman from the Annecy area, also spent four days in custody over the killings in February. The gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking, but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders. Investigators say that whoever carried out the crime is likely to be a trained marksman, and to know the local area extremely well. This has led to well-sourced theories that Mr Mollier, the cyclist, may have been the principal target. He had recently left his wife and two children to live with a multi-millionaire heiress, with whom he had just had a baby, and there were said to be tensions in the relationship. There have been accusations that the French authorities are involved in a cover-up, as they insist that Mr Mollier was just an unlucky passer-by who got caught in the crossfire. Zainab and Zeena, the surviving daughters, are now in the care of members of the Al-Hillis' extended family. They have been given round-the-clock security because those responsible for the murders are still at large. Zainab is certain to have seen those responsible, although she is not thought to have provided any kind of detailed description. The killings took place in an isolated lay-by on a mountain road not far from the tiny village of Chevaline. A detective involved in the case said: 'The reality is that whoever did it left no forensic evidence, and disappeared without trace. It is sadly quite possible that this will never be solved.'","Saad and Iqbal Al-Hilli died alongside her mother and a French cyclist .

"Sentenced: Brenda Heist, 53, will spend a year in jail for violating her probation stemming from a February arrest for using a stolen ID . A mother of two who disappeared from her central Pennsylvania home in 2002 and was later declared legally dead before reemerging in Florida will spend a year in jail on a probation violation. Brenda Heist, 54, who is known in the Santa Rosa County court system under the alias Kelsie Smith, was sentenced Tuesday. She pleaded no contest to failing to check in with authorities in the Tampa area after leaving the Pensacola area following her April release from jail. Heist had been on probation for using someone else's identification during a traffic stop, the Pensacola News Journal reported. The 54-year-old woman left behind a husband and two children when she disappeared from her home outside Lititz, Pennsylvania, in February 2002 while going through an amicable divorce. In 2010, Heist was declared legally dead. Then in April of this year, she turned herself in to deputies in Monroe County, Florida, and revealed she was a missing person. The one-year jail sentence stems from a February 15 arrest for using an identification card during a traffic stop, which Heist had stolen from a Milton resident whose house she cleaned . Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police station last Friday . Brenda Heist, who was eventually . presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going . missing from their Pennsylvania home, walked into the Alachua County Jail in Gainsville, Florida, April 26 after violating her probation. The . 54-year-old was released from jail in April after being arrested for . drug possession and driving with an expired tag in Pinellas County, . Florida. Following her release, she did not report to her parole officer, according to WTSP leading to the warrant for her in Santa Rosa County. Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania . It emerged last month that Heist had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind. Heist's story has made headlines nationwide, leading to an appearance on Dr. Phil's talk show in late May. In an exclusive interview with Dr. Phil McGraw for Today Show, a tearful Heist dressed in orange prison garb begged for her family's forgiveness and attempted to justify her decision to disappear from their lives 11 years ago. ‘I just kept saying to myself, “They're better off without me,""' she said. Following her resurfacing, friends have spoken of their . shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her . runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out. For a time . she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and bookkeeper . and living with friends. Pictures reveal her drinking, swimming and tanning with her new acquaintances to whom she never told her real story. 'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her . friend's eyes, that are calling us today,"" Detective Sergeant Schofield, . who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online. Sondra . Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on . weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my . three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for . her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, . had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.' Another friend who knew Heist as 'Lovie Smith' said she had no idea she was being deceived. Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants she ran into in the park. She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce. When building her new life, she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died. Brenda Heist has spoken for the first time about the circumstances that prompted her to just get up and leave her children more than 11 years ago . Heist told Dr. Phil that she now regrets having revealed herself after 11 years because it has re-opened old wounds for her children . She never revealed she . had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been . murdered. 'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said. 'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.' It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - . lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients. When the deception was discovered she moved on again. Over the 11 years she is . said to have three aliases.  She also went by Kelsei Smith and even . served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered. For . a time, it seems she was homeless although where and when is unclear. Her real identity didn't emerge until she turned up at a Florida police . station this week. And as the news came out her family reacted in horror that they had been living a lie. Shock: New friends of Heist were shocked to hear of her real identity and that she'd left her family 11 years before . All grown up: Morgan Heist, pictured with her brother Lee, has said she wishes she had never cried for her missing mom who has finally showed up after eleven years . Anger: Her children Morgan Heist, 19, and her brother Lee, 23, have reacted angrily to the news and say they want nothing to do with her . Her daughter, Morgan Heist, 19, took to Twitter to reveal how angry she was after realizing her mother had willfully left. 'This doesn't . seem real. I feel like I'm in my own horrible nightmare and can't wake . up.' She also tweeted that she was glad her father was now exonerated of any blame or suspicion about his wife's disappearance. 'To every person who ever questioned my dads place in my moms dissapearance, (sic) take that.' Heist was reported missing by . her husband on February 8, 2002. The then 42-year-old was last seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, . Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle. In April, she walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida, and announced who she was. Heist has told detectives she left her family because the . pressure was too much and she snapped. She said she was sitting on a park bench and crying when she met a group of homeless people, who invited her to hitch-hike with them to Florida. Former home: Brenda Heist walked out on this house in Lititz, Pennsylvania on February 8, 2002 that she shared with her husband Lee and two children . Disbelief: Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home . When she disappeared, Heist's daughter . was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester . University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey.

"As a record-breaking NFL player, Aaron Rodgers has seen more than a few hairy moments. But there's one he particularly enjoys - and for some Green Bay Packers fans, it's behind the team's run of victories. The 31-year-old quarterback sparked frenzied debate when cameras caught him casually stroking a nine-inch ginger beard on Sunday. Lucky fuzz: Jeremy's Wilcox, the owner of the nine-inch ginger beard which has become Aaron Rodgers' lucky charm, says it's all a bit of fun. 'People come up to me all the time and ask if they can touch it', he added . In action: This is the moment during Sunday's Packers game which prompted a deluge of speculation . Now it's emerged he and the bristles' owner have had their good luck ritual for most of the season, and it happens at almost every home game. To the more superstitious - or the fantasists, depending on your point of view - Jeremy's Wilcox's chin is to thank for Packers' unbeaten run of home wins. But Mr Wilcox said from his log cabin in the town of Maine: 'It's just guys having fun'. The 39-year-old is a communications technician whose job it is to provide help from the sidelines at the Packers' home games in Wisconsin. He remained relatively unknown until the cheerful online storm which followed the Packers' game on Sunday against the Detroit Lions on national TV. Meme-worthy: Reaction on Twitter was bemused and light-hearted, and it wasn't long before a Vine appeared . It prompted a deluge of interview requests and he was soon outed as the beard's owner, including on the front page of the Wasau Daily Herald. He told the newspaper he began growing the beard two years ago, and $18million-a-year star Rodgers simply caught his eye one day and gave it a tug. 'It's never at the same time or same place', he said. 'It's just lighthearted. It's a lot of fun - just guys having fun. 'I don't do anything with it. I let it run wild. People come up to me all the time and ask me if they can touch it.' The Packers have won all eight of their home games this season, and as their best-paid and most famous player Rodgers can take more than a small share of the credit. High-profile: As a record-breaking player, Aaron Rodgers (right) has seen more than a few hairy moments . Dip in fortune: The Green Bay quarterback did get stamped on, but came back from the dressing room to win . The quarterback signed a five-year contract worth up to $130million last year, including a salary cap of $17.9million in 2014 which rises in each year until the end of the deal. His lucky charm has not been completely successful, of course. He was carted off to the locker room with an injured ankle on Sunday after Detroit Lions star defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh stomped on it - a move which earned him a suspension. But he returned in the second half - and duly led the Packers to a 30-20 victory.","$18million-a-year NFL star goes in for regular tug on thick ginger bristles .

"His face blackened by soot and oil from hours spent aboard a blazing passenger ferry, rescued Briton Nick Channing-Williams admitted yesterday that he feared he would not escape the inferno. The 37-year-old showjumper was one of the last of more than 400 passengers and crew taken by helicopter from the Norman Atlantic at the climax of a massive rescue operation lasting 36 horrific hours in rain-lashed, stormy seas. At least ten people died during the fire in the Adriatic and Mr Channing-Williams told of moments of absolute terror when he did not think he would live. Nick Channing-Williams, who spent hours on board a burning car ferry off the coast of Greece, was pictured covered in soot, after he was airlifted to safety and brought to shore in Italy . A massive rescue operation lasting 36 horrific hours in rain-lashed, stormy seas got under way as the Norman Atlantic (pictured) went up in flames . Speaking after being reunited with his Greek fiancée Regina Theoffili, who had been rescued from the roll-on, roll-off ferry hours earlier, he said: ‘When the flames are licking up around the boat and there is just no sign of help and they are talking about sending a boat that is going to be four hours away you feel somewhat helpless.’ As alarms sounded, he went up on to the main deck. ‘The flames were huge, and all the cars were on fire,’ he said. ‘It was very scary, to be honest. There was only one place you could stand, which was in the rain.’ Passengers spent hours awaiting rescue, shivering and shaking in the rain and cold because, like him, they had not had the chance to gather suitable clothing. Panic set in as the ferry began to list on to its side, lines to rescue crafts snapped and the deck became red hot from the flames engulfing areas below containing some 200 cars and lorries. The British show jumper was reunited with  his fiancée Regina Theoffil after they were separately winched from the deck of the blazing ship . Mr Channing-Williams said: ‘The fire was basically cooking everybody’s feet and everyone was in a queue to get on a lifeboat. With the heat being so enormous, people just panicked. I didn’t even try and get on one. Regina and I were stood upstairs and just hoped for the best, really, that someone would come and help us.’ He said he spent Sunday night at the front of the ferry with other people after climbing down a rope to try unsuccessfully to help tie lines from a tugboat to the ferry. At one point they were trapped when flames blocked their path. He also described how his fiancée saw one man slip to his death beneath the ferry after slipping on the bottom rung of a ladder. Mr Channing-Williams, who lives near Athens, was travelling to see his family in Berkshire for New Year. Mr Channing-Williams's mother Dotty (second left), her partner Steve Jobar (second right) and his sisters Karen (left) and Nicole (right) are relieved to hear he has been rescued . Mr Channing-Williams after showering off the soot was reunited with his fiancee after being separated for a few hours . He described his reunion with his fiancée as ‘quite emotional because we were separated for a few hours and in the early hours I was starting to question whether we were going to get off it or not’. A photograph sent to his family by a member of the Italian Air Force shows a grinning Mr Channing-Williams covered in black soot and oil after he spent more than a day trying to avoid acrid fumes. He was uninjured. Mr Channing-Williams’s mother Dottie, 70, from Wickham, Berkshire, shed tears of relief after her son borrowed an emergency worker’s telephone to say he was safe. Marcus Gondolo-Gordon (left) and his family - wife Mia (right), daughter Phaedra (pictured on his lap when she was 22 months old but now seven) and other daughter Seraphina, five, were on the burning ferry . 427 people were rescued, including 56 crew,but the original ship’s manifest listed 478 passengers and crew . ‘I’m so relieved he’s coming home,’ she said. ‘This is going to be the best New Year ever.’ Her son and his fiancée had been travelling from the western Greek port of Patras to Ancona in Italy when the fire mysteriously broke out below the main deck near Corfu. The Italian government said 427 people were rescued, including 56 crew, but the original ship’s manifest listed 478 passengers and crew. Officials could not immediately explain the discrepancy. Italian prosecutors announced yesterday that they had opened a criminal investigation into the ferry fire and would look into whether negligence had played a role. It is still unclear what caused the blaze to break out on a car deck of the Norman Atlantic on Sunday, but investigators will focus on whether a lorry packed with olive oil may have triggered the disaster. The lorry was too tall for the car deck so that it just fitted in to the allocated area and at one stage during the rough seas its metal roof is reported to have begun scraping the ferry’s ceiling causing sparks that may have ignited the blaze. Only nine days before it caught fire, an inspection of the 26,904-ton ferry, which was operated by Greek shipping company Anek, found it had failings with fire safety and its plans for how to handle passengers in the event of an emergency. Among those also rescued was Briton Marcus Gondolo-Gordon, a former film and advertising manager, wife, Mia, and daughters Phaedra, seven, and Seraphina, five. The family, who live in Corfu, had been on their way to a skiing holiday. Speaking after collecting Seraphina from hospital where she was treated for hypothermia – many families had rushed on to the deck when the sirens sounded, leaving behind warm clothes – he said: ‘It’s been an ordeal but thankfully we are all safe and well.’ Italian, Greek and Albanian ships and helicopters were involved in a fraught rescue hampered by thunderstorms that at one stage saw tugs flanking the damaged, blazing ferry to provide protection from the waves as helicopters attempted to lift passengers to safety – women, children and the elderly first. Most of those rescued were transferred to nearby ships, but some were taken directly to hospital. Other survivors spoke of passengers trampling over one another and fights breaking out among men forcing their way on to helicopters before women and children. Turkish passenger Saadet Bayhan said: ‘We experienced the Titanic. The only thing missing was that we didn’t sink.’","Nick Channing-Williams, 37, admitted he feared he wouldn't escape inferno .

"Peter McAlear, 75, would have to carry a load of gear like spare trousers, underpants and pads . Something as simple as having a cup of tea at a neighbour's house used to be fraught with anxiety for Peter McAlear, 75. And staying overnight at his son's home was all but impossible. A little under a year ago, Peter underwent treatment on his prostate that left him, like thousands of other men, suffering from incontinence. 'It destroys your confidence,' says Peter, a retired chartered engineer who lives near Glasgow. 'I'd have to carry a load of gear with me - spare trousers and underpants, as well as pads. 'I'd dread going round to other people's houses. If you sat down on their furniture, there was the worry you might leak. 'I used to stay overnight at my son's home, but then I didn't dare. And a holiday was out of the question.' It has been isolating for Peter, a father of two and grandfather of three. 'I lost my wife five years ago, and it's important to keep going,' he says. Urinary problems are often the first sign of prostate cancer. The prostate is a small gland that sits between the bladder and the penis and surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. In the early stages, prostate cancer is often symptomless, but as tumours grow, they can press on the urethra and/or the bladder, making men feel the need to go to the loo more frequently or more urgently. More severe incontinence is a common side-effect of surgery to remove the prostate. Around 5,000 men have this surgery each year and at least half will have short-term incontinence in the months afterwards, says James Catto, a consultant urological surgeon at the University of Sheffield. Men have two sphincters (rings of muscle acting like a one-way valve) that keep them dry. One between the bladder and the prostate - known as the internal sphincter - and one in the urethra just below the prostate gland. 'These weaken with age, but in some men the prostate enlarges and reduces leakage by acting like a cork in a bottle,' he says. Scroll down for video . Removing the prostate (radical prostatectomy) can expose the weak sphincter and lead to incontinence in some men. The internal sphincter sits next to the prostate, so surgery to take out the gland involves removing it, too. 'Men are left relying on the remaining sphincter,' says Professor Catto. 'Many have a degree of incontinence just after surgery because this can be bruised by the operation.' Incontinence after surgery is usually stress incontinence. Here, leaks occur as extra pressure is put on the bladder, for instance, by coughing or laughing. In theory, once the bruising has settled down, so will the urinary problems. However, two in every ten men will have long-term incontinence that leaves them using pads, according to the NHS. More severe incontinence is a common side-effect of surgery to remove the prostate . Some, like Peter, are left with no control at all - with a near continual stream from the bladder. This can occur when key muscles and nerves around the bladder are damaged during surgery, so the bladder contracts when it shouldn't. Mandy Fader, professor of continence technology at Southampton University, says far more needs to be done to support men practically - with better guidance on products that improve quality of life - and psychologically. It's not only men who have surgery who are at risk - older forms of radiotherapy, using an external beam of radiation, can also lead to incontinence. New, more focused techniques, such as brachytherapy, which places radioactive seeds in the tumour, are thought to have a much lower risk. In rare cases, incontinence can be a side-effect of a procedure called TURP (trans urethral resection of the prostate), which is sometimes offered to treat an enlarged prostate, a benign condition thought to affect 60 per cent of men over 60. TURP involves trimming the prostate to widen the gap for the urethra. Again, this can leave the sphincter damaged - usually temporary, indirect damage from the heat used. But problems can persist if the sphincter is damaged during the procedure. Peter's problems were probably triggered by the radiotherapy he had after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999. The treatment worked, and his PSA level (a measure of a protein secreted by the prostate gland, very high levels of which can be caused by cancer) had been 115 when he was diagnosed, but went down to 0.4 - a healthy level. Though it started to rise again after four years, it was controlled with hormone therapy and regular scans. New  incontinence management project, part of True NTH, focusses on improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer, funded by Movember . Around three years ago, however, Peter started to lose control of his bladder. 'Sometimes, I couldn't make it to the loo in time. Then it started happening all the time,' he says. Peter mentioned his problems a few times to his urologist, but it was a year before he was offered pills to desensitise his bladder. These, he says, 'worked too well'. He was hospitalised with a bladder infection as a result of fluid retention, where he wasn't able to pass urine at all. He was told that the radiotherapy he'd had before had made his prostate less elastic and his urologist suggested he have a TURP procedure. Peter knew this could cause temporary incontinence. 'After a few days, my problems should have settled down - but they didn't,' he says. 'I became totally incontinent. At the hospital, they gave me a pads, but they were not fit for purpose, as they're so big and bulky. 'No one talks to you about what's happening to you.' But a new research project, led by Professor Fader, is designed to transform the experience of men like Peter. The incontinence management project, as it is known, is part of a wider programme called True NTH, focusing on improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer and funded by the Movember charity campaign. The first part of the project will be a website offering advice. 'Men can be too embarrassed to ask for this information,' says Professor Fader. 'It's common to see incontinence products for women advertised on telly, but it's still not talked about for men.' Indeed, many end up relying on sanitary pads bought for them by their wives. But these tend to be rectangular - men need a triangular pad. And there are other products to keep men dry. 'For instance, a clamp (a cushioned clip that fits on the end of the penis to hold the urethra shut) can allow men to exercise for a couple of hours,' says Professor Fader. The proportion of men who will suffer bladder weakness at some stage . There are also sheaths and external bags. These cover the opening of the urethra to collect urine and can be worn inside clothes, strapped to the leg. 'These devices are available on prescription,' says Professor Fader. 'The problem is GPs often don't know this.' Another option is surgery: to fit an artificial sphincter to keep the urethra closed or a sling that repositions the urethra to take the pressure off the sphincter. Men taking part in the project will be able to try different devices. They will also be involved in designing new products, including a more comfortable clamp and an absorbent, washable pair of boxers to replace towelling nappies many rely on at night. And there will be training for health professionals to offer more personal support, including psychological therapies. Peter is helping the True NTH researchers. Meanwhile thanks to a successful operation to fit an artificial sphincter, he has regained almost total control of his bladder. 'I get the odd leak if I cough,' he says. 'But I can go out again. And I was able to stay at my son's house this Christmas without worrying.'

"North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said he is open to more talks with his South Korea counterpart. In somewhat of a New Year's resolution, the leader said he is open to the discussions or even a summit - a statement welcomed by Seoul, the capital of South Korea, which in turn urged the North to take concrete steps towards normalisation of relations. Kim's call for improving inter-Korea relations in his New Year speech comes as Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, faces heightened criticism over its human rights record. Scroll down for video.

This man is pictured watching the speech in Seoul Railway Station today . Condemnation: Kim's call for improving inter-Korea relations came as Pyongyang faces heightened criticism over its human rights record . There are also souring ties with Washington over allegations it was involved in the massive hacking attack on Sony Pictures linked to The Interview, a dark comedy that portrayed an assassination attempt on Kim. North Korea has denied involvement, but said the hack was a 'righteous deed' and suggested it might have been carried out by sympathisers or supporters abroad. 'We believe we can resume suspended senior-level talks and hold other talks on specific issues if South Korea sincerely has a position that it wants to improve North-South relations through a dialogue,' Kim said in the nationally televised address. 'And there is no reason not to hold the highest-level talks if the atmosphere and conditions are met.' Meeting such conditions has proven to be virtually impossible in the past. The two countries have not held a summit since 2007 and, despite Kim's remarks, the likelihood of one happening again soon is very low given the deep distrust that remains between the two countries. Some experts in the South, however, cautiously welcomed the possibility of increased talks at lower levels. 'Animosities between South and North Korea would deepen... if they fail to improve their political ties and ease military tension through a summit this year,' said Cheong Seong-chang from the private think-tank Sejong Institute. South Korean officials say they are open to any form of talks. Seoul is waiting for the North to respond to its earlier proposal to hold talks this month to discuss a range of issues needed to prepare for the unification and other issues of mutual concern. South Korea made the proposal earlier this week. Celebrations: North Koreans watch as fireworks explode over the The Juche Tower in Pyongyang to usher in the new year . Fireworks: North Koreans gather at Kim Il-sung Square to watch a fireworks display . 'If North Korea truly has a will to improve South-North relations through a dialogue, we hope (the North) quickly respond positively to our proposal for talks,' the South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement. Kim noted that this year is particularly significant because it marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. Both sides claim to hold reunification as a fundamental goal, but a vast gap remains over how that should be accomplished and under what form of government a unified Korea would be administered. On domestic policy, Kim indicated he will stick to the country's longstanding 'Military First' policy and suggested he would pursue science, technology and economic policies aimed at improving the impoverished nation's standard of living. But he also fell back to familiar accusations that the South and the United States are to blame for tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Kim said South Korea must abandon all plots to launch wars and try to work toward fostering peace, and that Washington must initiate a policy shift by abandoning its 'hostile policy' and 'reckless invasion plots' on the North. The 30-minute speech was the third Kim has delivered on New Year's Day, and the first after the end of the traditional three-year mourning of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. Some analysts believe that with the mourning period over, Kim will pursue policies that more closely reflect his own personal priorities. Anger: The Interview has angered Kim Jong-un, who is played by Randall Park (pictured) in the film . A South Korean activist said he will launch balloons carrying DVDs of Sony's The Interview toward North Korea to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator Kim Jong-un. The comedy depicting an assassination attempt on Kim is at the centre of tension between North Korea and the U.S., with Washington blaming Pyongyang for crippling hacking attacks on Sony Entertainment. Yesterday, activist Park Sang-hak said he will start dropping 100,000 DVDs and USB sticks with the movie by balloon in North Korea as early as late-January. Park, a North Korean defector, said he's partnering with the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation, which is financing the making of the DVDs and memory sticks of the movie with Korean subtitles. Park said foundation officials plan to visit South Korea around January 20 to hand over the DVDs and USBs, and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow. 'North Korea's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolisation of leader Kim breaks down,' Park said. If carried out, the move is expected to enrage North Korea, which expressed anger over the movie. In October, the country opened fire at giant balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets floated across the border by South Korean activists, triggering an exchange of gunfire with South Korean troops. But it is not clear how effective the plan will be, as only a small number of ordinary North Korean citizens are believed to own computers or DVD players. Owning a computer requires permission from the government and costs as much as three months' salary for the average worker, according to South Korean analysts. Many North Koreans may not risk watching the movie for fear of being caught. Not everyone supports sending balloons into the North, with liberals and border town residents in South Korea urging the activists to stop. North Korea has long demanded that South Korea stop the activists, but Seoul refuses, citing freedom of speech. Park said the balloon release will be done clandestinely, with the pace picking up in March when he expects the wind direction to become more favorable. Calls to the Human Rights Foundation on Wednesday were not immediately answered. The foundation says on its website that it works with North Korean defectors to use hydrogen balloons to send material across the border, as well as smuggling items through China and broadcasting radio transmissions to reach those who own illegal short wave radios.","The leader said a summit could be held with South Korea .

"Thanks to Tinder, it's never been so quick and easy to shop for a man, and now with fashion app Grabble you can shop for a new wardrobe with equal ease. The newly launched app works just like Tinder but rather potential dates popping up on  screens, users are tempted with lust-worthy fashion. Style hunters swipe right to 'grab' a potential fashion match and swipe left to reject items that don't tickle their fancy. Scroll down for video . New fashion app Grabble is to fashion what Tinder is to dating - a quick and easy way to find a match . Swipe right on Grabble to 'grab' a fashion match and swipe left to 'throw' or touch the 'grab' or 'throw' icons . No wonder Grabble has been the featured in the 'best new app' section in app stores in 34 countries, and over Black Friday was the most searched for app in the UK. It's been a hit with celebrity users too. Stephanie Pratt, Andy Jordan, Caggie Dunlop, Frankie Cocozza are all Grabble users, as is Ferne McCann, who appeared at the apps official launch last week. But be warned - it might not be quite so easy to swipe away potential fashion matches as it is to reject the frogs on Tinder. Once users grab an item it stays in the 'grabs on the go' folder until they decide to buy or discard it. For a more curated experience, users can also shop in the 'featured collections' section, as shown above . The best part? The clever little app will send alerts whenever  a grabbed item comes on sale. So how does the art of fashion match-making work? Users set preferences according to price range, brand and category of clothing. The app features products from 1,500 brands from ASOS, Topshop, Uniqlo and Zara to the likes of Net A Porter, Matches and Selfridges. Shoppers can also set the app to recognise their taste by choosing as many of the 23 styles that best describes their fashion groove. So whether users see themselves as 'Made In Shoreditch', 'Chelsea Girl' or 'Boho Babe' - they can tailor  potential fashion matches to suit. For a more curated experience, there's the 'featured collections' section, which is added to daily. Example collections include items from recent magazine issues, best bargains or picks for upcoming events. Just like Tinder, men are welcome too: David Beckham modelling (left) and a selection of male grabs (right) Founders Daniel Murray, 28, and Joel Freeman, 29, first launched Grabble as a desktop site but after seeing all their users trying to access it on their mobiles decided to abandon their website for an app in the mould of Tinder. 'We realised by displaying fashion products in this way, users could discover fashion on the go,' says Joel, himself a self-confessed Tinder fan. 'But instead of swiping right for awkward conversations, you can swipe right to shop.' Daniel adds: 'Because the app has that addictive nature we find our users 'snacking' on the app regularly for short bursts of inspiration. 'Users tend to save the products they like, only to check out later in the month in one big spree or when they get a sale alert.' With new products added to Grabble every hour, there's endless potential to fall in fashion love.","App works like Tinder but with fashion finds rather than potential dates .

"Gordon Ramsay is embroiled in a legal battle with a Tenerife restaurant critics claim is trading on his name four years after first complaining about the establishment. In 2010 the TV chef reportedly took legal action against Gordon Ransay's in the holiday resort of Puerto Colon. The restaurant, which serves full English breakfasts and 'the coldest pint in town', said at the time it had been paying Mr Ramsay to use his name. Scroll down for video . The TV chef complained in 2010 about the restaurant in Tenerife (pictured) which is called Gordon Ransay's . Four years later, the restaurant is still thriving despite Mr Ramsay's protestations, with customers leaving reviews for its service online as recently as in October. Giving evidence in a separate case at the High Court, the chef said: 'We get thousands of complaints about this restaurant called Gordon Ramsay in Tenerife selling a full English with extra bacon at 4.95 Euros.’ A spokesman for the star said his legal team continued to pursue action against the proprietors of the restaurant. 'Through our London based lawyers we have instructed‎ local lawyers who our pursuing the legal options available to us to protect our rights,' she told MailOnline. 'As this is an ‎ongoing legal matter I‎ cannot comment further at this time.' The TV chef said he had received 'thousands' of complaints about the restaurant.

"A smartphone that sells for a tenth of the cost of a new iPhone is to go on sale in Britain next month. Budget technology firm Wiko, which has taken the French market by storm, is introducing a range of phones that sell for as little as £60. The cheapest, the Wiko Ozzy, comes with a 3.5-inch screen, a 2MP megapixel camera and runs on Android Jelly Bean 4.2. Scroll down for video . Budget technology firm Wiko, which has taken the French market by storm, is introducing a range of phones that sell for as little as £60 in the UK next month. The cheapest, called Wiko Ozzy, pictured, comes with a 3.5-inch touchscreen, 2MP camera and runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean . Screen: 3.5-inch . Operating system: Android Jelly Bean 4.2 . Camera: 2MP rear-facing, VGA front-facing . Storage: 4GB with 32GB Micro SD card slot . Processor: Dual-core 1GhZ . Price: €70 - the equivalent of just under £60 . Available in five colours and is dual SIM . Available in five colours, it currently retails at €70 - the equivalent of just under £60. Britain has been slow to take advantage of plummeting technology costs which are making smartphones affordable across Africa and Asia. Budget firms in China and elsewhere are taking basic smartphone chips and circuits, putting a cheap case, screen and camera on them, and selling them online. Two years ago Wiko introduced the same idea to the France - and last year nearly 7 per cent of French first-time smartphone buyers bought a Wiko phone. Carolina Milanesi of consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel said smartphone technology has been cheap for several years, but Western nations including Britain are only just waking up to the potential. She said: ‘About seven years ago manufacturers in China started teaming up with chip makers. They took the standard workings of a smartphone and made huge numbers at low cost. ‘They then attach a screen, a case and a camera and take it to market at low cost. ‘So far they have been focusing on emerging markets, mainly Africa and South Asia, but now they are beginning to look closely at mature markets.’ The key, she said, is keeping costs low. Budget firms in China and elsewhere are taking basic smartphone chips and circuits, putting a cheap case, screen and camera on them, and selling them online. Two years ago Wiko introduced the same idea to France market - and last year nearly 7 per cent of French first-time smartphone buyers bought a Wiko phone, pictured . Although the Ozzy phone, pictured, comes with just 4GB storage, it has a 32GB MicroSD slot. In addition to the rear-facing camera, the phone also has a VGA camera on the front of the device . While giants such as Apple and Samsung spend millions on research and development, marketing and sales, most of the emerging budget firms sell their phones online. ‘The margins are very tight,’ she said. ‘These firms have to have the right strategy and that will usually involve online sales.’ A few years ago the latest smartphone was the most technologically advanced device anyone could own - and consumers were prepared to pay a premium for it. But now buyers have turned their attention to tablets and ‘wearable’ technologies such as smartwatches - and want to spend less on their phones. The Wiko will go up against the budget phone released by network operator EE last month, called EE Kestrel. EE's 4.5-inch branded 4G phone, manufactured by Huawei,  costs £99.99, runs on Android Jelly Bean 4.3, comes with a 5MP rear-facing camera and has a 1.2GhZ processor. It is also available for free on a two-year contract that costs £13.99 a month. Nokia recently unveiled a range of budget handsets in its Lumia range. The 630 (pictured) has the same screen size, camera and processing power as the EE Kestrel, but prices have not yet been announced. The 635 is almost identical to the 630, but crucially supports 4G LTE, . Another budget brand taking Europe by storm is Kazam, set up by former HTC employees. Its smallest model is the Trooper X3.5 which has a 3.5-inch screen, 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM and a 2MP  rear-facing camera. The camera on the front is 0.3MP. Like the Wiko Ozzy, the Trooper is dual-SIM and has 4GB of storage, with a 32GB MicroSD card slot. A UK release date for the Kazam range has not been announced but the phones can be bought from Amazon starting at £89. The plummeting cost of making phones means that buyers are getting more for their money. In 2012, 42 per cent of phones priced at less than £50 had a processor faster than 1 gigahertz - by last year 87 per cent did. The cheapest phones may become cheaper still. Non-profit firm Firefox announced in February it is developing a smartphones that it could sell for only £15. Dominic Sunnebo, global strategic insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said cheap phones may not have as big an impact on the British market as they have elsewhere.

Like the Ozzy, the Trooper is dual-SIM and has expandable storage. A UK release date for the Kazam range, pictured, hasn't been announced but prices on Amazon start at £89 . Most smartphone buyers tend to take out long contracts, he said, so the upfront cost is low. People rarely pay the full £500 to £700 for a top-of-the range iPhone, because the cost is absorbed into the £40 to £50 they pay in their monthly service charge. Sunnebo said: ‘This Wiko phone is the cheapest to hit the British market and it will undoubtedly do well. ‘But in France, where it has been very well received, there is a different situation. The French market does not tend to subsidise the upfront cost of a phone as much as in Britain. ‘So while the pay-as-you-go market in Britain will be affected by this range, the contract market is unlikely to be as affected.’","Wiko's Ozzy 'Crazy' phone retails at €70 - the equivalent of around £60 .

"I've wanted Rapunzel's hair from the age of five, and I want it just as much now, at the age of 27. Not just long hair, but endless tumbling waves that fall heavy over my shoulders and constantly get in the way with all their weighty glory. In the past, I've had extensions which always tended to look a bit straggly, and very obviously alien to the rest of my locks. And, I reasoned, if even the minted likes of Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears can't seem to get them right, then maybe no amount of money can buy that sort of hair. But one New York-based hair guru, Angelo David, claims to have mastered a 'couture' method so streamlined that Rapunzel hair really can be yours, and with not a single tell-tale sign of its fakery. Scroll down for video . Before and after: New York-based hair guru Angelo David claims to have mastered a 'couture' method so streamlined that Rapunzel hair really can be yours, and with not a single tell-tale sign of its fakery . With a stubborn dose of skepticism, I put my head of average-length hair in his hands and waited for a follicular miracle. Mr David has been in the business for more than 20 years, long before extensions really got popular, and is widely hailed these days as 'the Vera Wang of hair extensions.' He sources human locks from around the world and runs his own 'hair laboratory', where technicians match the color, the texture and the shape of every strand of hair to the samples he takes from his clients. Prices range from $500 to $4,000 and depend entirely on the type, color and amount of hair you want. Mine - 18 inches of premium European hair - are worth an eye-watering $3,600. Customized: Mr David (right) sources human locks from around the world and runs his own 'hair laboratory' which matches the extensions specifically to the client. Pictured, my 18 inches of 'premium European hair' Painstaking: The segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal 'micro-rings' bit-by-bit, layer-by-layer (pictured) Hidden: Mr David steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that I'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible (pictured) Ta-da! The process took a lengthy five hours to complete, after which I was treated to a 'shaping' trim and a blowout (pictured) First came my consultation, during which I explained what I wanted in forensic detail - 'Rapunzel hair... literally, literally, Rapunzel hair' - while he tossed my mane around and took sneaky snippings as he went. It's important, Mr David says, to take samples from the front, the back, the top and the underneath of the hair, because most of us have different textures in different areas.  I'd never noticed this before, but it is definitely true. Then we discussed the sort of wave I wanted, because apparently there are a plethora of those too. I opted for a 'loose S' variety. Finally, I was politely informed that my color was drab, and was whisked off to have it corrected by his colorist. It took a week for Mr David's lab team to prepare the hair, after which I was called in for my marathon application session. Volume: Mr David, a huge fan of 'voluptuous locks', ruffles and coils my hair as I seemingly ponder the meaning of human existence . Hair today, gone tomorrow: It's recommended I return within two to four months, depending on how I'm doing, to have the extensions removed . Options: Personally I prefer a reasonably natural finish (left) but if the urge ever does strike me, glossy ringlets can be mine too (right) The two ponytails Mr David presented me with were made up from hundreds of minute individual threads of hair, bonded at their 'roots'. The more of them they are, he says, the better they will blend in with my own hair. Next, after my hair was washed and dried thoroughly, it was time for the painstaking process of attaching someone else's locks - whomever they may be - to my own, which was always going to be a weird feeling. The segments were fused to tiny sections of my hair and secured with thin metal 'micro-rings' bit-by-bit, layer-by-layer. Mr David steered clear of the sections too close to my hair line so that I'd be able to tie my hair up without the rings being visible. It took five hours, but I was plied with a selection of beverages and kept comfortable throughout. Then and now: The extensions when I first had them done (left) and three months on, without styling (right) Once Mr David had finished, great hunks of thick hair reached my elbows, which felt heavenly but definitely looked wig-like. The final step, 'the shaping', he assured me, was the most important. Off he set in the manor of Edward Scissorhands, hacking into my extremely long hair so that it fell into subtle layers leaving tendrils scattered on the floor. True to his word, the finished result post-blowout - if a little coiffed and 'overdone' for my liking - was impressive. My hair was unfeasibly long and thick, and very much felt like my own. For two nights following the procedure, sleeping was excruciatingly painful; how it might feel to have hundreds of little goblins  yanking incessantly on small chunks of your hair. Entirely normal, I hear. Pitfalls: Lindsay Lohan (left and right) tends to have extensions that fail to blend in  with her own hair, particularly color-wise . On show: Britney Spears (left) has long been a wearer of blonde extensions, but often has them fitted too high-up and close to her hairline, as does Paris Hilton (center) and Amanda Bynes (right) Once the pain subsided, and after I'd washed my hair, I truly fell in love with the results. The extensions hang naturally, they're not poker straight nor artificially wavy, and they move with my own hair. I barely have to touch them with a styling implement to make them feel nice. In fact, I think they look best completely natural, which far from being high-maintenance like extensions I've had in the past, saves me a boatload of time and hassle. Mr David recommends I return within two to four months, depending on how I'm doing, to have them removed. Any longer and the hair grows too far out from the roots and gets tangled above the micro-rings. Getting it right: Sarah Jessica Parker's extensions match her natural hair perfectly (left) and Kate Beckinsale is rarely without hers, which are thick and luxurious (right) Faithful falsies: Alessandra Ambrosio  wouldn't dream of charging down the Victoria's Secret runway without her wavy extensions in (left), and Blake Lively has been a fan of hers for years (right) Great lengths: Keira Knightley once rather successfully lengthened her locks (left) from a previously short, boyish cut, while Rihanna often appears with sudden fountains of wavy hair (right) For between $350 and $450, you can have the extensions re-applied when the time comes. If you opt for this, the salon removes them, washes and freshens up your natural hair and then reapplies them exactly as before, using new micro-rings, as well as throwing a few new sections in for volume. This can be done between two and four times in total, due to shedding over time, meaning that the most you get out of them is nine to 12 months. These extensions may be far from cheap, or be quite long enough for a prince to clamber up them, but the feeling of having locks long enough to fall into my soup, flop onto my keyboard, and genuinely get in my way feels exactly as good as I always hoped it would.","New York stylist Angelo David has a 'hair laboratory' where he matches his extensions to his clients' locks in microscopic detail .

After seeing American convict Robert Pruett (right) on a BBC documentary in March this year, care worker Kate Hughes from Liverpool (left) found his prison address online and wrote to him the very same night . The senior care assistant, who lives with her mother, has already 'transported' Pruett to Australia, Italy and the Isle of Skye in the hope of providing him with some escapism from his life in prison. She has created  pictures of Pruett in front of sites including the Vatican in Rome, the Sydney Opera House and  the Liver Building in Liverpool. Miss Hughes said: 'If somebody had told me five years ago I would have been writing to a man on death row, I would have said,""'Yeah, whatever"". But times have changed for Miss Hughes, who now says she feels like the convicted murderer is a lifelong friend. The senior care assistant created superimposed pictures of Pruett at sites including the Vatican in Rome . Says Miss Hughes: 'I got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he'd always wanted to visit the Isle of Skye and I used an editing app to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island' 'I was so shocked about how much we have clicked. I feel like I've known him forever and he's told me he sees us as really good friends,' the Photoshop whiz explains. Miss Hughes, who says she prizes herself on being 'a good judge of character', had an inkling her mother would disapprove of the friendship, despite being convinced of her convicted murderer's innocence. 'Even though I knew he was innocent, I didn't say anything to my mum at first about writing to him.' Luckily for Miss Hughes, her mother was more understanding than she had imagined. 'She's been really supportive since I told her  - she can see he's not a bad person. I am lucky to have her support, but even if she was against it, it wouldn't affect my friendship with Robert. I am nearly 30, after all. 'Some of my friends do worry about me writing to someone who's in jail for murder, but I'm not in any danger.' A Photoshopped picture of Robert visiting Liverpool, where Miss Hughes herself is from . Pruett with his favourite band Radiohead: Says Miss Hughes: 'This was much harder to make as you have these rock stars and then a white-faced convict in the middle in his boiler suit' Says Miss Hughes of the man on death row: 'Robert isn't in a dark place any more. He is a really positive person and is quite happy in himself.' 'He loves every minute of life. He tries to love the now, tries to be as happy as he can be. He loves to have a laugh, so I always put silly stories or memories in my emails. 'In one, I told him about getting attacked by a spider that day - just daft things like that. Despite having virtually travelled the globe together, Miss Hughes and her convict have never met in the flesh, but the Liverpudlian is hoping that moment will come. 'He says he really wants to meet me and I can't wait to meet him. I think when we meet face to face, it'll be just the same as writing to each other. We've got loads to talk about.' Miss Hughes learnt of 34-year-old Pruett's criminal background, when she saw his story on BBC documentary Life And Death Row. Left: Pruett superimposed onto a London bus; Right: Miss Hughes in action writing to her pen pal . He was jailed in 1995 at the age of 16, convicted for the fatal stabbing of a neighbour in Harris County, Texas. Then four years into a 99-year sentence, Pruett was found guilty of murdering a prison guard who was repeatedly stabbed with a sharpened metal rod, and given the death sentence. Miss Hughes said: 'We never talk about his case, because when I write to him I want to take him out of that reality. 'We just chat like normal pen pals do about music, films, funny memories and places in the world we would love to see. 'The only difference is that he'll never get that chance to see them. At least with the pictures I make, he can imagine himself there. 'I got the idea to do the first picture after he wrote and mentioned he'd always wanted to visit the Isle of Skye and I used an editing app on my mobile phone to show him standing in front of a harbour on the island. 'He wrote back to say he loved it so in my next letter I attached a photo of him superimposed on top of a double-decker London bus, as he'd talked about visiting the city. 'I've done pictures of him with his favourite band Radiohead too, although that was much harder to make as you have these rock stars and then a white-faced convict in the middle in his boiler suit.' Miss Hughes is also campaigning for her pen pal to be retried after doubts were expressed over his convictions. Pruett, above, was jailed in 1995 at the age of 16, over the fatal stabbing of a neighbour in Harris County, Texas, then four years into a 99-year sentence he was convicted of murdering a prison guard . A collectiom of Pruett's letters written from his prison  in Texas to Miss Hughes in Liverpool . Pruett's father, who admitted killing the neighbour, testified to say his son did not take part in the murder and two fellow inmates who testified against Pruett over the death of the prison guard were given reduced sentences. His execution date was originally set for May last year at the Polunsky Unit prison. But, with the support of the Texas Innocence Project which fights for wrongfully convicted prisoners, he received a stay of execution so further DNA testing could be carried out. She said: 'After watching the BBC documentary, and doing my own research, it's clear there isn't a scrap of evidence against Robert. 'From the first moment, I just knew he wasn't guilty, so I took it upon myself to write to him and let him know.' Pruett (right) is serving 99 years in a Texan jail for two murders, but Miss Hughes (left) is convinced of her new friend's innocence . 'Now I've got to know him, I'm even more convinced that he didn't commit these crimes,' she says. 'I am very passionate about Robert's case. I haven't stopped thinking about it. If we could just get his sentence reduced or get him off death row, it would be a huge triumph. 'An innocent man is going to die and I want to make people realise that he has not done anything wrong. There is not even a pinhead of DNA against him. He just wants a retrial to prove he is innocent.' Pruett is currently compiling an online journal about his incarceration where entries are published for him via a friend in Switzerland. He writes: 'Being on death watch and knowing you could be soon executed is intense and there are ups and downs to it, but you don't have to be overwhelmed by it all. Staying present is the key.'","Kate Hughes, 29, from Liverpool, writes regularly to prisoner Robert Pruett .

"Michael Owen has prompted astonishment after tweeting a suggestive photograph of one of his dogs lying beside another’s genitals. The shocking picture, which the former England footballer posted to his three million followers on Tuesday evening, was accompanied with the caption: ‘I wonder if Mrs O will be so kind tonight’. Father-of-four Owen, 35, was referring to his wife Louise, 34, then posted a further photograph on Twitter of her sticking two fingers up to the camera, saying: ‘Oh well, it was worth asking.’ Scroll down for video . Twitter image: The shocking picture, which the former England footballer posted to his three million followers on Tuesday, was accompanied with the caption: 'I wonder if Mrs O will be so kind tonight' Not interested: Father-of-four Owen, 35, was referring to his wife Louise, 34, then posted a further photograph on Twitter of her sticking two fingers up to the camera, saying: 'Oh well, it was worth asking' The original tweet by Owen of his dogs, believed to be called Belle and Ronnie, has been retweeted 8,000 times since it was posted on Tuesday - and attracted bemusement on Twitter. Comedian James McNicholas said: 'The timeline of @themichaelowen this evening has made feel unwell.' And telecoms expert Dan Beasley said: 'Looks like Michael Owen had a banter injection.' Meanwhile, referring to his goal against Manchester City in 2009, a user posting under the name of 'United Religion' said: ‘That tweet and the City goal are the two greatest things you've ever done.’ Owen, who is now a football pundit for BT Sport and lives with his family in a multi-million pound mansion in North Wales, has attracted derision in the past for having a ‘boring’ broadcasting style. Couple: Owen - who retired as a footballer in 2013 - and his wife Louise, whom he has known since school . Married with four children: Michael and Louise Owen at a Unicef Gala Dinner in Manchester in 2009. The footballer played for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City . Famous moment: Referring to Owen's goal against Manchester City in 2009 (pictured), a user posting under the name of 'United Religion' said: ‘That tweet and the City goal are the two greatest things you've ever done.’ Last month MailOnline reported how Owen - who retired as a footballer in summer 2013 - was hit by critical messages after starring in a 'sexist' new car advert made on behalf of a car dealership. In the clip, he compares women to luxury cars and goes on to boast about the 'dozens' of Jaguars he owns. But the dealership behind the film, Alexanders Prestige, said it was a ‘fair comparison’. Owen - who became an international star following his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998 aged just 18 - played for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City. Owen met his wife more than 20 ago at Rector Drew Primary School, in Hawarden, Clwyd, North Wales. Later they both attended Hawarden High School where they became teenage sweethearts. They moved into their house in 2002, paying £1.6million for the 19th century Grade II-listed home.","Owen posted image and said: 'I wonder if Mrs O will be so kind tonight'

"Publishing giant HarperCollins has apologised for omitting Israel from an atlas and has vowed to destroy any remaining copies. A spokesman said the company 'regrets' the omission from the Collins Middle East Atlas and has removed it from sale. All remaining stock will be pulped. HarperCollins was criticised for not labelling the country on the map - bought by English-speaking schools in the majority-Muslim Gulf, while clearly marking Gaza and Jordan. Collins Bartholomew, the subsidiary of HarperCollins, had told The Tablet that including Israel would have been 'unacceptable' to their customers in the Gulf and the amendment incorporated 'local preferences'. But in a statement, a spokesperson told MailOnline: 'HarperCollins regrets the omission of the name Israel from their Collins Middle East Atlas. Scroll down for video.

Bishop Declan Lang, chairman of the Bishops' Conference Department of International Affairs, told The Tablet: 'The publication of this atlas will confirm Israel's belief that there exists a hostility towards their country from parts of the Arab world.

But the decision to omit Israel on the map has sparked anger on social media, with some Twitter users calling for the boycott of HarperCollins. Dr Jane Clements, director of the Council of Christians and Jews, told The Tablet: 'Maps can be a very powerful tool in terms of de-legitimising ""the other"" and can lead to confusion rather than clarity.

"Syrian President Bashar Assad saw in the New Year with a rare visit to a combat zone where he shared a meal with his troops - as sinister figures showed the death toll from the civil war  hit 76,000 in 2014 alone, including thousands of children. The extraordinary total made 2014 the deadliest so far in the nearly four-year war,according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which recorded the deaths of 76,021 people. Of the total, 17,790 were civilians, including 3,501 children. State TV footage showed Assad having dinner with soldiers and pro-government gunmen in the east Damascus district of Jobar last night. Heavy fighting in the strategic neighbourhood killed at least 25 Syrian soldiers and pro-regime militia on Wednesday before the visit, the observatory said. Scroll down for video .

Assad was shown sharing a meal of baked beans, boiled potatoes and tomatoes with soldiers and pro-government gunmen known as National Defense Forces. 'On New Year's Eve families gather but you decided to be here to protect your country,' Assad told the troops as sporadic shooting could be heard. 'I like to be with you on this occasion.' Assad described rebels who use underground tunnels as 'rats', adding 'we fight them above the ground'. The footage, aired today, showed Assad shaking hands and kissing troops, walking into fortifications and climbing onto a tank. Syrian troops have been fighting against rebels in Jobar since 2013 and according to state media,  government forces have been advancing in the area.

Rare visit: The last time Assad (left in both photos) visited the frontline was in August 2013 . Assad's visit came as rebels fired nearly two dozen mortar shells on Damascus, residents said. It was not clear if there were casualties. Assad has rarely made public appearances since the country's crisis began in 2011. The last time he visited the frontline was in August 2013, when he went to the former opposition bastion of Daraya outside of Damascus. The war began in March 2011 with peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's government, but quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war after a brutal regime crackdown. In addition to civilians, more than 15,000 rebel fighters were killed, as were nearly 17,000 militants from jihadist groups, including the Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. At least 22,627 government forces - both soldiers and members of pro-government militias - were killed, the Britain-based group said. Last year's figure compared with 73,447 in 2013, another 49,294 in 2012 and 7,841 in 2011. More than 200,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests that spiralled into a war after a government crackdown.

"Detroit police said graffiti of an angel pointing a gun at a police officer has left them 'hurt and dismayed' following a wave of violence directed at cops. The image was spray-painted on to the wall of a youth center in Detroit, Michigan, close to the police department's third precinct late last month, authorities said on Tuesday. It depicts a small figure with wings and a halo pointing a gun at a police officer with his hands raised in the air. The number 247 is sprayed next to the graffiti. Scroll down for video . A small figure with wings and a halo pointing a gun at a police officer with his hands raised was sprayed on the wall of a youth center in Detroit, Michigan . The director of the youth center where the graffiti was sprayed said that he found the image 'hurtful' Steve Dolunt, assistant Detroit police chief, told Fox: 'I don't believe looking at the painting that God would give an angel a gun to shoot a police officer. 'I think God gives angels to police officers to try to protect them.' The director of the youth center, Roger Simmons, said he was 'horrified' by the graffiti but that the perpetrator was likely caught on surveillance cameras. It has since been painted over. It is not clear when the image appeared on the wall but authorities believe that it was sprayed some time after the shooting deaths of two NYPD officers on December 20. Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley who then committed suicide. According to threats that Brinsley posted on social media prior to the shootings, he was seeking revenge for the cop killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Among the deranged messages was a vow to 'put wings on pigs'. Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in August. Several weeks earlier, Eric Garner, a father-of-six, died after being placed in a chokehold by an NYPD officer on Staten Island .

"Cybersecurity experts have given a detailed outline to the FBI about the hack attack against Sony Pictures, insisting it was not the work of North Korea but a group of current and former employees who shared a 'mutual hatred' for the company. While the FBI and Sony have announced they believe Pyongyang carried out the hack - claims that were denied by leader Kim Jong-un - independent security officials have been coming forward for the past week saying most of the evidence points to an inside job. Silicon Valley security firm Norse, which provides intelligence to companies to prevent their software from being hacked, has been investigating the compromise at Sony and shared their findings with the FBI on Tuesday, according to Gawker. Norse senior vice president Kurt Stammberger said the hack hinges on a woman he called 'Lena', who he says worked in a 'key technical' position for 10 years but was sent packing in May during a large sweep of lay-offs. Scroll down for video . Not Pyongyang: FBI agents have been briefed on new findings that indicate disgruntled former Sony staff and piracy-advocates were behind the hack in November this year and not North Korea . Stammberger would not reveal to Gawker how Norse came to such a conclusion. However he said Lena would have remained 'very well placed to know which servers to target' after leaving the company and 'where all the sensitive information in Sony was stored'. Lena - which may be an alias - then joined forces with other former employees and people in the hacking community to humiliate Sony. Stammberger said the people who hadn't worked for Sony 'were individuals that were connected with torrenting Sony movies and content online, were targeted by legal and law enforcement arms, and were irritated that basically they were caught'. 'We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history,' Stammberger told CBS News last week. However, consulting firm Taia Global said the results . of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected . hackers suggest they were more likely from Russia than North . Korea. 'I think the government acted prematurely in announcing . unequivocally that it was North Korea before the investigation . was complete,' said Mark Rasch, a former federal cybercrimes . prosecutor. An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse has found that it is likely a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack, and that North Korea is not responsible . The FBI maintains that the Sony hack was carried out by Pyongyang over the release of The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un . 'There are many theories about who did it and how . they did it. The government has to be pursuing all of them.' While U.S. officials investigate whether North Korea . enlisted help from outside contractors, the FBI stood by its . previous statement that Pyongyang was the prime author of the . attack against the Sony Corp unit. 'The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is . responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network . of Sony Pictures Entertainment,' the Federal Bureau of . Investigation said in a statement to Reuters. North Korea has denied that it was behind the Sony attack . and has vowed to hit back against any U.S. retaliation. The people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said . on Internet postings that they were incensed by the Sony . Pictures film 'The Interview,' a comedy about a fictional . assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Because of the hackers' threats, major U.S. cinema chains . refused to show the film. Last week, Sony struck deals with some . 320 independent theaters to distribute 'The Interview' and also . made the film available online. The hackers released the email caches of Sony executives, including Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal and its CEO Michael Lynton . The FBI said its determination that North Korea was behind . the hack was based on information from a variety of sources, . including intelligence sources, the U.S. Department of Homeland . Security, foreign partners and the private sector. 'There is no credible information to indicate that any other . individual is responsible for this cyber incident,' the agency . said. Kevin Mandia, whose security firm was hired by Sony to . investigate the attack, said the only way to know who the . culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected . machines back to the hackers' machines. Only the government and . Internet service providers have that kind of visibility, he . added. 'I don't have the data that they have to come up with that . conclusion,' Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye Inc, said. 'Every attack loops through numerous machines,' he said. 'You have to peel that onion all the way back. It isn't an easy . thing to do.' Mandia, who has supervised investigations into some of the . world's biggest cyberattacks, said the Sony case was . unprecedented. 'Nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely . destroy all your data, or try to anyway, and that's just . something that no one else has seen,' he said.","Cybersecurity experts think Sony hack was inside job .

"Devastated over the tragic death of 41-year-old Tom Palermo last Saturday, friends and neighbors are incensed about the 'slap on the wrist' $300 fine that allowed Episcopal bishop Heather Cook to get back behind the wheel and end up killing the beloved cyclist and fleeing the scene. Cook, the daughter of an admitted alcoholic, was three times over Maryland's drunk-driving limit when she was stopped with vomit running down her shirt as she drove for miles on a shredded tire in 2010. The cop who pulled her over even halted field sobriety tests because he was worried she would fall down and hurt herself DailyMail.com has learned. Crime, no punishment: Friends and neighbors of hit-and-run victim Tom Palermo are furious that Bishop Heather Cook, 58, was still able to drive an automobile after her serious DUI arrest four years ago . Too young: The victim was Tom Palermo, 41 - a father of two and Baltimore bicycle enthusiast who custom made bike frames as part of his one-man business . 'Judges in the United States are reluctant to take people's driving privileges away because our society is so car-dependent,' Greg Hinchliffe, executive director of the Baltimore cyclists' safety group Bikemore told DailyMail.com, 'It certainly seems she got a ridiculously small punishment. 'People who show they do not drive particularly well should not be behind the wheel.' Cook was let off with supervised probation and an $800 fine — with $500 of it suspended — despite her extreme intoxication. Defense attorney Zachary Groves told MailOnline that that punishment was at the very bottom of the scale for such a case. 'She must have had a good lawyer,' he said. 'If you blow three times over on a first offence, some judges would bang you up for a weekend or maybe two weekends.' Cook, who was promoted to Suffragan Bishop, the Episcopal Church's second-ranking position in Maryland two years after her arrest, was behind the wheel of the same green Subaru Forester on Saturday when she hit Palermo, a father of two young children, on his bicycle throwing him on to the hood of her car. She left him to die at the scene while she drove less than half a mile to her home in Baltimore's Elkridge Estates apartment complex. Twisted metal: Palermo's wrecked bike is pictured here. He was left dying in the street for a time before a fellow cyclist happened by and called 911 . Telltale signs: Initial reports indicated that Cook, whose badly damaged car is seen here, hit Palermo and fled the scene. It was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned. This is the same car she was driving when she was arrested for the DUI four years ago . She later returned to the scene of the crash only to drive away again. This time she was tracked to her gated complex by cyclist Moncure Lyon. She then returned a second time when she was questioned by police. Tom Palermo's funeral will be held in Towson, Maryland, on Saturday. Bikemore is organizing a memorial ride on New Year's Day that is expected to attract hundreds of bikers. Bikemore's Hinchliffe pointed out that Palermo was riding in a dedicated bike lane on a wide street in perfectly clear daylight. 'He shouldn't be hit from behind at high speed in those circumstances,' he said. Palermo's family say they are 'focusing on Tom' and do not want to comment on Cook's previous conviction. His funeral will be held in Towson, Maryland, on Saturday. Bikemore is organizing a memorial ride on New Year's Day that is expected to attract hundreds of bikers. Police refuse to say whether Cook, 58, was breathalyzed after Saturday's accident and say the investigation into the accident is still in its early stages. Detective Ruganzu Howard told DailyMail.com that crash investigators are carrying out 'detailed reconstruction' of the accident and forensic examination of the crash vehicle. Tributes: 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore,' his friends said. His funeral is Saturday . But cyclists are demanding that the full weight of the law is thrown at the bishop, who has been placed on leave by the church. A website, titled Charge Bishop Heather Cook With Homicide had gained more than 1,800 'likes' by Wednesday afternoon. One poster wrote: 'The State's Attorney in Caroline County has some SERIOUS explaining to do as to why she got a slap on the wrist for such a serious offense?? If she had done jail time for that DUI, or had been required to have an ignition lock installed in her vehicle, Tom might be alive today.' Cook was stopped at 2am on September 10, 2010 in the tiny town of Preston in Maryland's Caroline County. She was driving at 29 mph in a 50 mph zone along the shoulder of state Route 318. Her front passenger-side tire was completely shredded, according to the police report obtained by the Baltimore Brew. Sheriff's Deputy Justin Reibly, who stopped Cook, wrote in his report: 'As I approached the vehicle I detected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from within and the smell of burned rubber. I noted that the driver, who was alone, had vomit down the front of her shirt.' 'I investigated the burned rubber smell and found the front passenger side tire to be 'completely shredded from the rim. (A later search did not find the tire or any parts of it) It appeared that Cook had been riding on the rim for some distance,' Reibly added. Telltale signs: Initial reports indicated that Cook, whose badly damaged car is seen here, hit Palermo and fled the scene. It was later revealed she had indeed left the scene but later returned (her car is pictured here after she went back to speak to police who were still at the scene) Twisted metal: Palermo's wrecked bike is pictured here. He was left dying in the street for a time before a fellow cyclist happened by and called 911 . 'Tom was a passionate bicycle builder, a father, and a friend to many people who ride bicycles in Baltimore,' his friends sad . Reibly said he asked Cook, at that time a parish priest, to follow his finger with her eyes but she could not. 'Cook kept moving her head instead of following my finger with her eyes only, as directed,' he wrote in the report. When it came to the walk-and-turn test, Reibly wrote: 'Cook was very unstable and was only able to stay in that starting position for a fraction of a second before falling to her left, out of position. Due to Cook not being able to stand up straight without falling, she advised that she could not do the test and she discontinued it herself.' And things only got worse when he asked her to stand on one leg. 'When she raised that foot, she lost her balance and fell to her left,' the officer wrote. 'She dropped her foot to the ground prior to falling to catch herself. 'Cook’s extremely intoxicated condition precluded her from completing the field sobriety tests. I believed that if Cook continued the testing, she might possibly injure herself, by possibly falling, so I discontinued that test for her safety.' Reibly found two marijuana baggies and a silver pipe in open view in the car, along with a bottle of wine and a fifth of Jameson Irish whiskey. Cook told Reibly she smoked pot and drank as she drove home to Maryland from Canada . But despite the high level of alcohol in her blood Cook never even went to trial. Instead she was fined and given probation before judgment after pleading guilty. The Episcopal Diocese of Maryland says Cook revealed her conviction while she was being vetted for the bishop's job in 2012. Cook is one of six children of the Rev. Halsey Moon Cook, the former rector of Old St. Paul's Church in Baltimore, who died in 1989. He shocked his congregation in 1977 by admitting in a sermon that he was an alcoholic. Halsey Cook, then 49, went into a Minnesota rehab the following month. He told the Baltimore Sun at the time: 'I was embarrassed for anybody in Baltimore to know so I snuck off quietly 1,400 miles away.'

Authorities say they were called to the woman's house several times in the past for medical issues, but hadn't responded to her home in more than a year. Simmons' step-daughter who lives in Japan is allegedly the person who found the body in the woman's garage. The county coroner determined that Simmons died of natural causes. On Monday, local news stations photographed Simmons house with an overgrown lawn and boxes of fish oil vitamins, baby powder and vegetable oil unopened on her front step . Neighbor Jim Crane told The Southern Illinoisan that he sometimes mowed Simmons' lawn to keep it from sticking out in the neighborhood. He said it was easy to overlook the overgrown home because Simmons lived as a recluse, staying in her home with the lights out, ordering food my mail and throwing her trash in the backyard. Shocked: Neighbor Shannon Butler says she would have checked in on Simmons, but she wasn't close to the woman . The volunteer firefighter was on good terms with Simmons, describing her as a nice lady who became depressed after the death of her husband John in 2005. 'That's what led to her downfall,' Crane said. The couple allegedly met during the Vietnam War, when John was stationed in southeast Asia. It's also been reported that Simmons taught English as a second language at a university in Thailand. He says she was so torn up about his death that she visited him up to three times a week at Mound City National Cemetery, a 50 mile drive away. And the last time he talked to her, Crane said she expressed wanting to die so that she could join her husband. Neighbor Diana Kington, was friends with Simmons when she first moved into the neighborhood, but says they lost touch when Simmons started dealing with mental health issues. 'Lots of people were trying to figure out what happened with her,' Kington told WSIL. 'Honestly, she had money, she was very bright, I thought she was institutionalized or she had decided to leave the area and just abandoned the house.' Another neighbor, Shannon Butler, told KFVS she would have checked in on Simmons had the two been close. Simmons was buried Tuesday in a plot next to her husband at Mount City. Father Bob Flannery, who met Simmons at Saint Francis Xavier Church, said the funeral home didn't expect a large turnout for the service, but that 11 people showed up.","Sunantha Simmon' body was found by her step-daughter who was visiting from Japan .

"Indoors he is working around the clock to finish his latest album. But outdoors, it seems John Mayer wants to get as far away from the studio as possible. Just days after Christmas, the 37-year-old singer-songwriter uploaded a picture of his new, luxurious off-road vehicle to Instagram - a purchase believed to have set him back nearly $500,000. Scroll down for video . John Mayer posed alongside his $500,000 purchase, the EarthRoamer XV-LTS, just days after Christmas . In the image he is posing alongside his EarthRoamer XV-LTS, a vehicle owned by some of the wealthiest outdoor enthusiasts in America. With it he posted the message: 'I am a proud owner of this most formidable go-anywhere, live-anywhere vehicle. One year and many meetings in the making, she’s all mine. 'Completely hand built in Colorado by extremely talented and innovative men and women. Who knows where I’ll end up next.' The company who manufactures the vehicles, that are custom-built to the owner's requests,  insists they are not RVs and are instead XVs or 'Xpedition Vehicles.' Inside are a number of amenities that would make any adventurer feel at home, no matter what terrain they are taking on. There are various storage cabinets, a bathroom, shower, kitchenette, and seating for up to eight people including the driver. The luxury off-road vehicle costs between $300,000 and $600,000 and is owned by some of the richest off-road enthusiasts in the the United States . The bunk above the seating area comes with a king size bed while the kitchen is fitted out with an espresso machine, a sink, a stove and even a spice rack. Underneath is a F-550 sports four-wheel drive and a potent 6.7-liter Power Stroke diesel V8, producing 300 horsepower and 660 lb-ft of torque. The company's website adds: 'Adventurous people who appreciated good design, engineering and craftsmanship who were frustrated with the limitations and poor quality of traditional RVs immediately embraced the EarthRoamer XV-LT and sales grew rapidly.' The company insists that they do not manufacture RVs, but instead produce XVs or 'Xpedition vehicles' The 37-year-old singer-songwriter is currently working on his new album . Adventurer and nature photographer Bill Swails started the company back in 1998 with the aim of producing a vehicle where the comforts of an RV can be experienced on almost any terrain. Before Mayer revealed his new purchase, he had posted a number of images of his adventures around the country. The day before he uploaded a picture of road winding through a cactus-strewn desert sayting: 'Off to the next adventure...' While travelling he has also found time to work. On December 1 he posted: 'Heading back to LA with a head full of songs to write. It was good to get away from the process for a while.' Shortly after, he said: 'Record is half written, 12 songs, but six that won't come off the track listing. Production starts February. Putting the gang together now.' On Wednesday, it was alleged that Celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis had split from her husband of 11 years Todd Thompson amid unfounded claims that she had been having an affair with Mayer. The luxurious interior includes a small kitchen with an espresso machine, sink, stove and even a spice rack . There is enough room to fit eight people, including the driver, inside the EarthRoamer . The models start at $282,000 and depending on the owner's request can reach up to $500,000 . In the spacious kitchen area there is also a fridge and a number of storage units to fit vital camping supplies . Above the kitchen and seating area is a huge king size bed to make most adventurers feel at home .","Singer-songwriter uploaded image of his new purchase on Instagram .

"Jeb Bush has resigned all of his board memberships — both nonprofit and business — in a move that helps clear a path toward a 2016 presidential campaign. The former Florida governor stepped down from his remaining board memberships on Wednesday, an aide said. It's a continuation of a process that began earlier in the month when Bush announced plans to actively explore a White House bid. Spokesman Kristy Campbell called Bush's review of his business interests 'a natural next step as he turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy.' Separately, it also emerged that Bush and his wife, Columba, had made a $10,000 donation to a charity which is fundraising to help the families of the two police officers murdered in New York last month. On the verge:  Jeb Bush is officially exploring whether he could gain the Republican nomination to run for the White House in 2016 . Officers Ramos and Liu were gunned down at close range in their patrol car December 20 by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who then committed suicide. Tunnel to Towers Foundation is attempting to raise $800,000 to buy outright the family homes of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. It announced on its Facebook page that the Bushes had made the donation. Catherine Christman, spokeswoman for the charity, told Politico that the couple had made the gesture with 'no fanfare, no nothing'. It was later confirmed by Mr Bush's office. The donation comes at a time of tension between the NYPD and the New York mayor, the ultra-liberal Democrat Bill de Blasio, and the donation is likely to be interpreted as a gesture of support for the police more widely. Bush, the son of one president and brother of another, is seen as an early favorite of the Republican establishment as the next presidential primary season begins. He launched a series of private business ventures after leaving the Florida governor's mansion in 2007. Potential foes in both parties have already begun to pour through Bush's extensive private dealings in search of fodder for criticism. The Wednesday moves, first reported by The Washington Post, do not affect other business interests in which he is a partner. Those include his business consulting company, Jeb Bush and Associates, and Britton Hill Holdings, a Florida-based private equity and business advisory group. While some strategists have said Bush's private-equity work could open him to some of the same criticisms that dogged Mitt Romney, the GOP's last presidential nominee, Bush himself has said his business record would be an asset in a campaign. Discreet: Jeb and Columba Bush did not make any public announcement of their donation to help the fallen officers but confirmed it after it was announced by the charity . Under pressure: New York mayor Bill de Blasio has been at the center of controversy over policing and is now at odds with his own police department in the wake of the murder of two of its officers . Announcement: How the Bushes' donation became public knowledge. A spokeswoman for the charity said the couple had made it with 'no fanfare' He previously announced plans to step down from the board of Tenet Healthcare Corp. and leave his advisory role with British banking giant Barclays by the turn of the year. He severed ties to other business entities on Wednesday including the for-profit education company Academic Partnerships, Empower Software Solutions and CorMatrix Cardiovascular Inc. Earlier in the week Bush resigned from the board of timber company Rayonier Inc. Meanwhile, Bush's team also confirmed Wednesday that he had declined an invitation to speak at a political event organized by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, one of Congress' most strident immigration critics. An aide cited a scheduling conflict, although Bush is one of the few high-profile presidential contenders not attending the Iowa Freedom Summit in late January. Bush is one of the GOP's most vocal advocates for comprehensive immigration reform. King generally opposes such efforts.","Former Florida governor officially exploring whether to become third Bush to run for the White House .

"A father who was so ashamed of his huge beer belly he lost a whopping 10st has launched a new career - as a fitness instructor. Ryan Griffiths, 32, lived off junk food and sugary coffees, a diet that saw him  tip the scales at 22st. But after seeing a photograph of his bulky frame he decided to slim down. He stopped eating fast food, and began exercising three hours a day, six days a week, and by last January he had managed dropped down to 15st. Scroll down for video . Ryan weighed 22st when a picture of his huge belly (right) motivated him to make a change . Ryan stopped eating fast food and began exercising six days a week, dropping from 22st (left) to 12st (right) By last August he had lost a further 3st and now weighs 12st and has gone from a size 48in waist to a trim 28in. His dramatic weight loss has also meant he is no longer suffering from Type 2 diabetes which he was diagnosed with when he was 30. But it is not just Ryan's appearance and health that have been transformed by his weight loss. The father-of-two is about to quit his job as a mobile sales representative and launch his career as a personal fitness instructor after bosses at his gym were impressed by his transformation. Ryan used to live off a diet of McDonald's for breakfast and lunch, up to four sugary Costa coffees and dinners of frozen pizza, as well as smoking 15 to 20 cigarettes a day. He estimated that at this time he was consuming between 4,500 and 5,000 calories a day, twice the recommended daily intake for a man. Ryan used to live off a diet of McDonald's for breakfast and lunch, drinking  four sugary Costa coffees a day . Ryan, who lives with his wife Kate, 32, son Joseph, three, and three-month-old baby daughter, Jessica, in Northampton, said: 'Now I struggle to get into skinny jeans because I have been working out at the gym, whereas before it was because of being overweight. 'I have learned so much about health and diet through having my own personal trainer and through working towards my own fitness qualifications. 'It had got to the stage before when I had to think about the consequences for my family. I very much feel it has saved my life. 'The turning point for me was in the summer of 2013 when I saw a picture of myself with a huge beer gut. 'It convinced me to start losing weight and every time I didn't feel like going to the gym I'd look at it and it would make me even more determined. 'When I first started to lose a lot of weight, people would come and ask me about it, and as I learned more I really enjoyed telling other people the facts about exercise and keeping fit. Ryan is about to quit his job in mobile sales and launch a new career as a personal fitness instructor . 'It was around March that I decided that I wanted to look into becoming a fitness instructor myself. 'In all I think it will have cost about £1,100 to get the training and sit the practical and written exams for my Level Two and Level Three personal trainer qualifications. 'But the gym I am at has said they will give me a job, which is wonderful. 'Since losing all the weight I just feel so much more energetic and lively, and it's much more fun for playing with the kids too. 'And with the diabetes, the nurse said it was only the second time she had seen someone come off the medication through losing weight. 'For anyone trying to lose weight I would just say to set yourself achievable goals, don't try to get everything done at once. 'And it's important to remember than no food is off limits, you just have to monitor your calorie intake along with protein, carbs and fats. 'You can eat what you like, but once you reach your daily limit you just have to stop. 'So you can eat chocolate, or some pizza, but just be aware of how much you are eating and do it in moderation. 'I still have a takeaway pizza to myself once a week, but I take that into account when working out what else I can eat that day.' Ryan says he now feels so much more energetic and lively and wants to help others achieve similar results . Ryan's gruelling fitness regime sees him work out from 4am to 7am six days a week and now eats 3,000 calories a day to help him build up muscle. He passed his Level Two personal trainer qualification in October, and recently passed Level Three meaning his is qualified to work as a fitness instructor. He is now preparing to work with customers at his local Pure Gym in Northampton, where he works out six days a week. PureGym Manager, Darren Eele, said: 'It has been great to watch the transformation that Ryan has gone through since joining PureGym. 'His hard work and dedication can only be an inspiration to others, and it will be a pleasure to have Ryan as one of the team here at PureGym as one of our Personal Trainers.'","Ryan Griffiths, from Northampton, weighed 22st and had a 48in waist .

"The recently released final part of The Hobbit film trilogy is set to spark another season of 'set-jetting' for British tourists keen to holiday in areas where movies are shot. Following the success of the Lords of the Rings films, The Hobbit movies have proved a boon to tourism in New Zealand where all the films were made. For the period July 2013 to June 2014, a total of 13 per cent of all international holiday visitors to New Zealand said The Hobbit films were a factor in their choice of destination. Scroll down for video . With snow-splattered mountains and hills that stretch as far as the eye can see, fans of The Hobbit are set to explore New Zealand . The dark and imposing landscape from the final installment in The Hobbit trilogy can be found in New Zealand . Tourism New Zealand chief executive Kevin Bowler said: 'We have seen significant growth driven by beautiful backdrops and key aspects of New Zealand in the movies. 'While it is clear that improving economies and increased airline capacity are supporting tourism growth, the Hobbit factor has raised the profile of New Zealand.' The Hobbit is the latest in a series of blockbuster movies that have boosted tourism. Other films that led to increases in British and other international visitors have included Out of Africa and A Passage to India. In the UK, tourism chiefs have used film and TV series' locations as a lure for international tourists, with the Harry Potter films to the fore in this respect. Fans are eager to follow in Gandalf's footsteps and take a trip to see where the trilogy of Hobbit films were shot . Effects may well have been used to create eerie effects in The Hobbit films, but the New Zealand landscape off screen is just as enchanting . For those Britons preferring somewhere closer than New Zealand for a trip, Spain, the Portuguese Algarve, the Canary Islands, Malta and Egypt are among the most-popular winter-sun destinations, according to lowcostholidays. Kirker Holidays has seen a rise in European twin-centre trips, such as a combination of Florence and Rome, due to good rail connections. Another UK tour operator, Sunvil Traveller is predicting that this year's lifting of pension restrictions will lead to more over-55s taking long-haul trips. According to DialAFlight, river cruises, particularly on the Mekong in south east Asia and on the Amazon, will see growth this year. You'd definitely be hoping you wouldn't bump into these two on your trip to New Zealand to see where The Hobbit was filmed . New Zealand on a good day - the expanse of vast and untouched landscape was a big puller for directors of The Hobbit films . Travel agent Expedia said South East Asia had seen the biggest increase in demand for holidays last year and said that trend was set to continue. It picked out South and Central America, the Mediterranean and Northern Europe as particularly popular spots for this year as well. Online cruise guide Cruise Critic is predicting the Mediterranean will continue to be the top choice for UK cruisers. But it adds that some of the cruise destinations to watch in 2015 include Norway, Australia and the Elbe River, as well as a resurgence of the Caribbean. .","The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies completes thrilling trilogy that has taken the world by storm .

"The Idaho Court of Appeals has thrown out a black man's sex crime convictions, saying the prosecutor interjected race in closing arguments by quoting lyrics from the Confederate anthem 'Dixie'. All three judges agreed that Canyon County Deputy Prosecutor Erica Kallin erred in citing a song praising what the judges called 'pernicious racism' that might have influenced the jury. 'This prosecutor may not have intended to appeal to racial bias, but a prosecutor's mental state, however innocent, does not determine the message received by the jurors or their individual responses to it,' the judges wrote in the opinion. Scroll down for video . Canyon County Deputy Prosecutor Erica Kallin (pictured with Prosecutor Bryan Taylor after receiving an award in 2012) quoted lyrics from the Confederate anthem 'Dixie' im her closing arguments at the trial of a black pedophile, causing his convictions to be thrown out due to racism . 'An invocation of race by a prosecutor, even if subtle and oblique, may be violative of due process or equal protection.' In April 2013 James D. Kirk, then 45, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after the jury found him guilty of committing lewd conduct against a 17-year-old girl and sexually battering a 13-year-old girl. Both teenagers are white. Kallin began quoting 'Dixie' lyrics as a response to the defense's closing arguments that focused on the perceived weaknesses in the state's case, including the failure to gather physical evidence to help prove the girls' testimony. 'I always think of this one song. Some people know it. It's the Dixie song. Right? 'Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton. Good times not forgotten. Look away. Look away. Look away,'' Kallin said during the state's closing arguments. 'And isn't that really what you've kind of been asked to do? Look away from the two eyewitnesses. Look away from the two victims. Look away from the nurse and her medical opinion. Look away. Look away. Look away.' After Kirk was convicted, Eric Fredericksen - with the state appellate public defender's office - filed an appeal, saying that Kallin may have unfairly affected the verdict. In April 2013 James D. Kirk, then 45, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after the jury found him guilty of committing lewd conduct against a 17-year-old girl and sexually battering a 13-year-old girl . Idaho Deputy Attorney General Kenneth Jorgensen countered that Kallin's use of the lyrics was not a racial ploy. Ultimately, the three judges concluded that enough doubt had been raised as to whether Kirk's conviction had been tainted. 'Nothing in the record suggests that the jurors harbored any racial prejudice or that they were actually influenced by the prosecutor's recitation of 'Dixie,' but the risk of prejudice to a defendant is magnified where the case is as sensitive as this one, involving alleged sexual molestation of minors,' the judges wrote. Canyon County spokesman Joe Decker told the Idaho Statesman that the county will retry the case if the Idaho attorney general doesn't appeal the December 19 appeals court ruling.","Three judges agreed that Prosecutor Erica Kallin erred in citing a song praising what the judges called 'pernicious racism'

"A Utah mother-of-five who was diagnosed with terminal cancer while 26-weeks pregnant and refused treatment to save her baby died on New Year's Eve. Kathy Taylor, 34, died in her home about 4pm after being diagnosed with melanoma in late August, her husband Nathan wrote on her blog, Kathy's Miracle.

"The mother of a missing 14-month-old boy told police she abandoned him on a porch - then days later led police to his  his viciously beaten body that had been stuffed inside a backpack and dumped in an Ohio river, a court has heard. When Cameron Beckford was reported missing last Friday by his father, Dainesha Stevens, 24, claimed she left the toddler on a porch because she could no longer care for him. Five days later, she led police to the youngster's mangled body in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, authorities say. Stevens and her son were staying with  a childhood friend, Kurt Flood, at his home in Columbus, after she fled the home of the boy's father in Maryland two weeks ago. No one has yet been charged in the boy's death, though Stevens was called in front a judge after she was charged with failing to protect her son from child abuse. A court heard that Cameron was horrifically beaten between December 21 and 23 - a week before his body was found. Scroll down for video . Missing: Authorities continue to search for 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, who they warn may be already dead . Mother: Dainesha Stevens, pictured during a court appearance on Wednesday, admitted she and a male acquaintance left the boy, Cameron Beckford, on Friday night because they could no longer care for him . Stevens has now been charged with failing to protect her son 'by allowing an individual to violently spank him numerous times on several occasions.' Flood, also 24, is being held in the county jail on an unrelated misdemeanor and a probation violation stemming from a felony weapons charge. Stevens made up a story about leaving the boy on a porch and says that was her way of asking for help, said her attorney, Mark Collins. During a court appearance on Wednesday, he said: 'There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today.' Collins said Stevens came to the Columbus area December 15 after calling police in Maryland for help, then receiving a bus pass from the local protective services agency. Frederick police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure, however there were no details about what happened. 'I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,' he said. Frederick police previously said the father of Cameron and Steven's six-year-old daughter Cheyene, Shawn Beckford, called police on Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Collins said he didn't know the details of what happened in Maryland. Kurt Flood (left) let Stevens (recent mugshot right) stay at his house after she fled Germantown, Maryland, following a domestic abuse allegation . Stevens' attorney Mark Collins said during her first court appearance Wednesday that she lied about abandoning her son on a porch as a cry for help . The father of Stevens' two children, Cameron and Cheyenne, six, reported them missing after she had fled to Columbus, Ohio, mid-December . Stevens on Monday reported that Cheyenne had been taken to an unknown location by a friend, and investigators determined the toddler was missing while questioning the woman, police said. 'But I haven't seen her since Christmas Eve,' Stevens of Cheyenne in a 911 call obtained by Fox 28. 'And I've been trying to get her back from the people, and they won't tell me any information about her. They won't even try to bring her back to me.' Cheyenne later was found at a home on the city's west side and is in good condition, authorities said. She has been turned over to Franklin County Children Services. Stevens was staying with a male friend she knew as a teenager in Maryland, Collins said. That man is being held on misdemeanor warrants unrelated to the toddler's disappearance. 'It's our goal to keep that man in custody pending further investigation by the police,' said Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien. Stevens pointed police to the creek, Collins confirmed Wednesday without providing details. The 24-year-old mother led police to Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio, where Cameron's body was found stuffed in a back pack . A court heard on Wednesday that the child's body had been in the water for days . Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children. A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police said he's black with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle. A woman who answered the phone at a house believed to be the father's residence said he wasn't home. She said Beckford was her son. She apologetically declined to answer more questions and would not give her name. She also refused to open the door to the apartment, located in a densely populated neighborhood in the city, about 40 miles west of Baltimore. Criminal complaints obtained by Fox28 say three days before Christmas Cameron was 'violently spanked repeatedly' in a Columbus home - and his mother did not step in to save him. The complaints also said the spanking 'caused layers of skin to be removed from the child buttocks.' Court documents obtained by the station says Cameron's body was moved December 27 with Steven's permission for '[impairing] its availability as evidence.' She has been placed on suicide watch while in custody. Police are holding her and Flood in a bid to establish more about the investigation. Stevens fled Maryland to this home in Columbus, Ohio, where her childhood friend Kurt Flood was staying .","Dainesha Stevens, 24, has appeared in court after her son was found dead .

The television star, who also appeared in a host of other TV shows including Jonathan Creek, Emmerdale Farm, Casualty and The Professionals, was found dead at his north London home on Monday. His friend, actor Toby Hadoke, confirmed his death on Twitter today and said the cause had yet to be determined.

It was his first piece of writing since he was a newspaper reporter more than half a century earlier at the Bolton Evening News and the Manchester Guardian. Paying tribute to his friend, Mr Hadoke said: 'He was one of those superb understated but versatile actors that we don't seem to have any more. 'He never gave a bad performance. 'He was greatly admired by his peers. 'His sense of humour was combative but there wasn't any meanness in him.' Mr Hadoke announced Kay's death on Twitter earlier today, writing: 'It is worth great regret that I announce the sad death of the actor Bernard Kay who passed away over Christmas aged 86. RIP Bernard.' He later added: 'Admin done, so now can I just say that Bernard Kay was one of TV's finest ever character actors: always nuanced, understated & intelligent. (sic).' British horror novelist Mark Morris also paid tribute on Twitter, writing: “So sad to hear of the brilliant Bernard Kay’s death. Wouldn’t it be great if his lost Who episodes were found in 2015?” Kay, who grew up in Bolton, attended Manchester's Chetham's School before completing National Service and later attending the Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol.

"A new social hotspot is taking New York by storm this New Year's Day, offering up effective hangover cures to ailing revelers - from inside a bus. The suitably-named Hangover Bus is a mobile lounge in which sore-headed party-goers can seek sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, while also enjoying a vitamin-infused IV drip which promises to rid them of all their hangover symptoms. Created by New York-based company the Hangover Club, the bus, which will be stationed outside of popular nightspot Bounce Sporting Nightclub on West 21st Street until 7pm this evening, comes complete with a team of trained nurses who administer the drips and offer additional medical advice to anyone who needs it. Scroll down for video . Help is here: The Hangover Club's new mobile lounge is already proving to be one of New York's most popular destinations . A complete cure: Customers can choose from a concise menu of vitamin drips, all of which include painkillers and vitamin infusions . 'We like to call it the ""whoops!"" button,' Hangover Club nurse Lynnette Ayuso told the New York Village Voice. 'People do drink and unfortunately sometimes we go a little overboard and the aftermath is feeling very dehydrated... essentially, what your body needs is cellular hydration. 'The IV fluid is going directly into your bloodstream and replenishing the thirsty cells in your body.' The IV drips - which can also be infused with painkillers and anti-nausea medication at the nurses' discretion - don't come cheap, however. According to the New York Post, the drips, which take about 40 minutes, are being offered at a discount on the bus. The Classic, which includes hydration and nausea or pain medication, is priced at $129 (full price $175), the Super, which also includes a vitamin B booster, is $149 (full price $219) and the Mega, which contains a detox and vitamin C booster is a whopping $169 (full price &249). Drip life: Prior to launching the Hangover Bus, the company delivered custom IV drips to its clients at their homes . Anyone with a slightly smaller budget can also opt for a half-bag option, which costs $79. And it's not just IV drips that the bus is serving up. Customers are also given free access to Bounce Nightclub, where they can enjoy a selection of New Year's Day football, screenings of The Hangover and a variety of delicious hangover foods such as mac and cheese, Parmesan truffle fries and pigs-in-pretzels. Given that the bus can only fit 15 people inside at any one time - although it is equipped with enough IV drips to serve more than 200 hangover sufferers - the space of the nearby nightclub will no doubt come in handy. Prior to launching the Hangover Bus, the Hangover Club delivered custom IV drips to its clients at their homes. Following today's successful debut however, the company has announced that the Hangover Bus will be stationed at a different nightclub every Sunday in order to cater to the swathes of struggling revelers who are in need desperate need of its services.","The mobile lounge offers suffering revelers vitamin drips to help them recover from their hangovers .

"A 22-year-old man linked to the hacking group that claimed responsibility for a Christmas Day attack on Sony and Microsoft was arrested today by police investigating PayPal thefts. Vincent Omari has been linked to the Lizard Squad hacking group that took credit for attacks on Sony’s PlayStation Network and Microsoft’s Xbox Live gaming networks over Christmas. The man, from Twickenham, south-west London, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of fraud by false representation and Computer Misuse Act offences - and has since been bailed to March 10.

The man has been arrested by police investigating funds being stolen from PayPal accounts (file picture) Omari, who is a student of network security and ethical hacking, has said he is simply a spokesman for Lizard Squad - and denies having any part in the attack on Sony and Microsoft. A spokesman for the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit, speaking via Thames Valley Police, said the arrest was in connection with an ‘ongoing investigation in to cyber fraud offences’. These were said to have taken place between 2013 and August 2014, during which time alleged . Omani confirmed to MailOnline in an email tonight:‎ 'I'm on bail'. He added that he does not have a court date, contrary to reports in other publications. Sony said earlier this week that its PlayStation Network was back online after three days of disruptions, although it warned heavy traffic might continue to cause problems for customers. Problems: Sony said earlier this week that its PlayStation Network was back online after three days of disruptions, although it warned heavy traffic might continue to cause problems for customers . The Lizard Squad group - or someone claiming to speak for it - took credit for the disruptions. The Xbox service, which also went down on Christmas Day, was back online last Friday. The shutdown prompted angry parents to say that Christmas had been ruined for thousands of children who received the consoles as presents. The group disabled the Playstation and Xbox networks by flooding them with information, which means that normal users cannot gain access. But there is no evidence to link these episodes with a recent attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation blamed that attack on North Korea, which was furious about Sony's ‘The Interview’, a comedy about a plot to assassinate the country’s leader Kim Jong Un. By MARIO LEDWITH . Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as ‘vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious’. The group seeks to cause mayhem online ‘for a laugh’ and has called itself the ‘next generation Grinch’ after the children’s character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks. Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the ‘dark web’. Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause ‘havoc’. Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: ‘If they’re coming after you, you’re going to have a bad day.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vincent Omari, 22, linked to the Lizard Squad hacking organisation .

"A missing snowmobiler from Arizona who was lost in a freezing Utah canyon was rescuved Monday after being lost for nearly two days. Lawrence Orduno's snowmobile got stuck in a remote northern Utah canyon Saturday night and built a snow cave using pieces of his snowmobile to protect him from the freezing temperatures. Orduno tried for 30 minutes to dig his snowmobile out after he and a friend were separated while riding in the Franklin Basin area near logan. 'It was just too deep in the snow, standing straight up and down,' Orduno said. Lost: Lawrence Orduno, 48, sits in a vehicle after being checked by paramedics  in Logan Canyon, Utah, Monday, after being lost in the freezing canyon for nearly two days . Snow Cave: Orduno built a snow cave using pieces of his snowmobile to protect him from the freezing temperatures as he sat, stranded, in Logan Canyon . Orduno's friend made it back to the parking lot, but Orduno wasn't familiar with the area, and soon was lost in Logan Canyon as an icy storm rolled in, according to FOX. 'To be honest, we don't know if he would have made it one more night,' Lt. Doyle Peck told FOX. Search and rescue crews from Cache, Rich, Box Elder, and Franklin counties led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office combed the area for Orduno. Separated: Here, Courtney Wood, 27,  smiles after his friend  Orduno was found alive by search and rescue teams. Wood and Orduno got separated and Wood made it back to the parking lot . Around 10am Monday, one of the crews found Orduno in Cow Canyon miles from where he and his friend began their journey, according to a Facebook post by the Sheriff's Office. 'Mr. Orduno was cold and wet but in relatively good condition,' the post reads. 'Although he suffered mild frostbite to one of his toes, he is expected to make a full recovery.' The storm rolled in that Saturday night and, with dark quickly approaching, Orduno decided to hunker down for the night. Orduno accidently left his food behind in the truck that day, and thought he'd lost his cigarette lighter. Search: Here, members of the Cache County Search and Rescue team  go up Franklin Basin, in Logan Canyon looking for Orduno after searching all day Sunday . But as he shook out his pants to remove caked snow just before dark, the lighter appeared, caught in the bottom of his pant leg. He shaped the snow around him into a cave-like shelter and used the side covers from his snowmobile to help protect him from the wind, then collected wood and built a small fire. He crushed his two bottles of Gatorade that had frozen solid to free some ice and stay hydrated, but it wasn't much. Orduno is an avid snowmobiler who had been riding in the area before, and he went out with a 27-year-old friend while visiting his mother, who lives in the area. Rescued: Photographed, a snow cat brings Orduno back to Franklin Basin after rescuing him, Monday . Halted: Search and rescue crews from Cache, Rich, Box Elder, and Franklin counties led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office searched for Orduno all day Sunday but their search was halted by the blistering snow . Orduno said he got stuck in Boss Canyon, which is off the beaten path but just over a ridge from more popular snowmobiling areas. He heard a machine go by at one point, but he couldn't flag it down. Meanwhile, a search party led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office was combing the area for him, but the group was stymied by heavy snow. Orduno says he started to worry the second night and considered taking more desperate measures, including setting his machine on fire. But about 10 a.m. the next day, searchers taking a slightly different path spotted him. 'My story is really just another story of a guy out in the snow getting stuck,' he said. Orduno said he's grateful to the dozens of people who joined the search. 'I have no way of knowing all the people,' he said.  'I just want to tell them all thank you for all of their help.'","Lawrence Orduno, 48, was found Monday after being lost in a freezing northern Utah canyon for nearly two days .

The 49-year-old has swapped his job as a surf instructor in stunning Zancudo, Costa Rica, for frontline training in the war against terror group ISIS. The US volunteer told MailOnline: 'When ISIS was attacking the Yazidis and they had fled to the mountain, an Iraqi helicopter with a western journalist went to drop water. 'Women and children rushed in and started piling into the chopper. 'The cameraman filmed this one mother holding her 10 or 11-year-old son. He was dressed for school it seemed.

'I actually became physically ill and was crying uncontrollably. This has never happened to me before, and that was it. 'I knew I had to come, and never in the month before coming here did I have any doubt. For Parker it was a life-changing moment and in an instant he made the decision to leave behind his family, friends and even his beloved German shepherd dog, Gretchen, to go and fight. After travelling via Istanbul he arrived in the Kurdistan region of Iraq on October 28, but he did not inform those close to him until five days later, when he posted a statement on his Facebook page on November 2. Parker told MailOnline he waited before telling his family because he wanted to make sure he had made the right decision to join the battle. In the post he revealed he had moved to Rojava, a small Syrian town near the Turkish border, and had started training with Kurdish fighters. Parker wrote: 'The YPG is training me, until I am ready, then join the fight against Daesh (ISIS). 'The only way to try to explain this, is that I heard God's call. ‘The Kurds are the most amazing people, I’m so very blessed. ‘I’m not much for words except I love you all my friends, I’m in very good hands.’ Since then, Parker has been completing his military training and doing his best to learn the Kurdish language. He told MailOnline: 'I have been embedded with other foreigners and many Kurds speak some English. 'Most speak at least two languages, some know more.' Many years travelling the world and learning martial arts had given him a 'mental toughness,' he added. Parker (pictured) is a committed surfer who has vowed to surf the Black Sea when ISIS is defeated . Heis more used to beaches than the tough terrain of northern Syria where he is now in training to fight . Parker waited five days before announcing his decision to join the fight against ISIS on Facebook. Many of his friends and family have supported his decision to join the battle against the Islamist militants . He also insisted the YPG had been careful not to throw him straight into the fiercest fighting, but had been training him on the quiet parts of the frontline. He said: 'I am in good hands here. The experienced military guys go to where the real fighting is. 'Maybe I'll stay and live here afterwards. The Kurds are the most gracious, respectful people I have ever met. ‘We are family now. I am so honoured to be here.' But for all the excitement of his new life as a warrior, Parker did admit to missing his favourite pastime, surfing. He said: 'I will always surf’, adding he has sworn to take to the waves in the Black Sea when ISIS is defeated. Despite his apparently baffling decision, many friends and family members have expressed support for Parker’s choice on social media. 'I can't tell you how good it is to see you looking so strong and healthy,' one wrote. 'Your determination to make a difference just shows your heart and qualities. Your family and friends are so very proud of you.' 'You are our HERO,' wrote another. 'Stay Strong. Stay Healthy. Stay Humble. Duck when necessary.' Parker claims he is 'so very blessed' to be fighting . ISIS has developed a fearsome reputation both on and off the battlefield, particularly when dealing with foreigners. They have posted a series of videos showing the murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. But Parker says he will stay and fight until the group is pushed out of Kurdish land, something he estimated would take up to two years. Despite his apparently baffling decision, many friends and family members have expressed support for his choice on social media, where he has posted a number of photos of himself shooting a rifle, along with others of him relaxing at the Citadel in the Kurdish capital, Irbil. 'I can't tell you how good it is to see you looking so strong and healthy,' one wrote. 'Your determination to make a difference just shows your heart and qualities. Your family and friends are so very proud of you.' 'You are our HERO,' wrote another. 'Stay Strong. Stay Healthy. Stay Humble. Duck when necessary.' ISIS has developed a fearsome reputation both on and off the battlefield, particularly when dealing with foreigners. They have posted a series of videos showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. Nonetheless Parker was relaxed about his future, claiming he would stay until ISIS were pushed out of Kurdish land, something he estimated would take around one or two years. 'Maybe I'll stay and live here afterwards,' he said. 'The Kurds are the most gracious, respectful people I have ever met. We are family now. I am so honoured to be here.' They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion than a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria not for jihad, but to join the Kurds who are defending their communities against the advance of ISIS. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Canadian Gill Rosenberg is a high profile member of the Lions of Rojava. Her death was wrongly reported by ISIS militants recently . Jordan Matson, a former US soldier now with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. In August a hairdresser from south London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. Among the many Western fighters joining the Lions of Rojava in their campaign to defeat ISIS are Jamie Read from north Lanarkshire, Scotland (left) and James Hughes (right) from Reading in Berkshire . But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, including fellow British soldier duo James Hughes, a 26-year-old from Malvern, Worcestershire and Jamie Read, 24, from Carlisle. Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police who suspected he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. Fighters march under the black banner of Islamic State, which is locked in battle with the YPG . It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Surf instructor Dean Parker, 49, has joined the famous Lions of Rojava .

"Fast food chain Chick-fil-A is looking into a possible credit card breach at several restaurants, the company announced Wednesday. If true, almost 9,000 customer cards could be affected, according to one report. It has been reported that diners who used cards at stores in Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia as far back as last December  could be affected. The Georgia-based chain was tipped off to 'limited suspicious payment card activity' through its contacts in the payment industry, the company said on its website. The fast food giant said that it 'received the initial report [of the unusual activity] late on Friday, December 19.' Chick-fil-A also stated that is has reached out to federal authorities. Breach? Fast food restaurant Chick-fil-A is looking into a possible payment card breach at several restaurants, the company announced Wednesday (file photo) 'Chick-fil-A recently received reports of potential unusual activity involving payment cards used at a few of our restaurants,' the company said in a statement on its website. 'We take our obligation to protect customer information seriously, and we are working with leading IT security firms, law enforcement and our payment industry contacts to determine all of the facts.' The statement continued 'We want to assure our customers we are working hard to investigate these events and will share additional facts as we are able to do so. If the investigation reveals that a breach has occurred, customers will not be liable for any fraudulent charges to their accounts --- any fraudulent charges will be the responsibility of either Chick-fil-A or the bank that issued the card. If our customers are impacted, we will arrange for free identity protection services, including credit monitoring.' The possible breach was first reported in late December by the security news website Krebs on Security. The supposed breach may have gone on for slightly under ten months, the website reported. The website, which is run by journalist Brian Krebs, said that it 'first began hearing from banks about possible compromised payment systems at Chick-fil-A establishments in November, but the reports were spotty at best. Then, just before Christmas, one of the major credit card associations issued an alert to several financial institutions about a breach at an unnamed retailer that lasted between Dec. 2, 2013 and Sept. 30, 2014. 'One financial institution that received that alert said the bank had nearly 9,000 customer cards listed in that alert, and that the only common point-of-purchase were Chick-fil-A locations.' An unnamed source told the website most of the card fraud apparently took place at Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia restaurants, though others nationwide were affected. Chick-Fil-A says it has more than 1,850 restaurants in 41 states and the District of Columbia, and made upward of $5 billion in annual sales last year. If a breach took place, almost 9,000 customer cards from Chik-Fil-A locations could be affected, according to one report (file photo)","Fast food restaurant Chick-fil-A is looking into a possible payment card breach at several restaurants .

"A former Revlon employee is suing the cosmetic company claiming he was unjustly fired and the company's CEO made racist remarks. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Alan Meyers, 56, a former chief scientific officer at Revlon, claimed Revlon CEO and President Lorenzo Delpani made racist and offensive remarks against, Jews, blacks, and Americans, the New York Post reports. Delpani allegedly said he hates living among Americans, calling Americans 'small-minded' and 'dirty,' according to the court papers. The Italian-born Delpani allegedly said he couldn't wait to get back to a 'real' country. Lawsuit: Former Revlon scientist, Alan Meyers, 56, is suing the cosmetic company claiming he was unjustly fired and the company's CEO Lorenzo Delpani (photographed)  made racist remarks . Meyers also holds that he was discriminated against for his Jewish heritage. Meyers said that Delpani told him he was 'shocked'  that there weren't more Jews at the company, with Revlon's largest shareholder being Ron Perelman, a Jewish American. According to the suit, Delpani said that 'Jews stick together' and added that 'thankfully' Perelman 'is not like that anymore.' In the lawsuit, Meyers accused Delpani of making racist remarks toward blacks upon his return from a meeting in South Africa. Delpani allegedly said he could 'smell a black person when he entered the room,' according to Clutch Magazine. He also allegedly went on an 'anti-American' rant in which he said the U.S. is becoming like . ISIS,The Virginia Gazette reports. Event: (left to right) Ron Perelman, Olivia Wilde,  and  Delpani attend the 'Love Is On' campaign launch event with Olivia Wilde at Times Square in November . Fired: Meyers reportedly began working for the cosmetics company in 2010 and was fired last month . Meyers is Jewish and American-born. He claims Delpani has had it out for him since he expressed concerns about safety issues surrounding Revlon's acquisition of a Spanish beauty care company in 2013, the Gazette reports. Meyers claims Delpani accused him of raising 'ghost' safety problems at the recently acquired labs, resulting in slower production. Meyers said he repeatedly expressed his concerns to Delpani who urged him to keep quiet so the CEO could maintain 'plausible deniability' of the issues. The lawsuit says that Meyers was fired Dec. 10, after working for the company as a scientist for 4 years, when he complained about the issues and Delpani's treatment of him, according to the Post. Meyers spoke about an October incident, in the suit, when Delpani made the 56-year-old hold up a whiteboard for almost 30 minutes during a meeting, forcing him to act as a human easel. The ordeal is affecting Meyers health, he says. Meyers says he is experiencing chest pains due to stress from the situation which have forced him into the hospital. He is seeking unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, in the suit, the Post reports. 'Shocked:' Meyers claims that Delpani said he was 'shocked' more Jews didn't work for the company, with Revlon's largest shareholder being Ron Perelman, a Jewish American (photographed) Revlon struck back, vowing to 'aggressively fight these baseless claims and this frivolous action,' according to the Gazette.

"U.S. and Arab war planes launched 29 air strikes against Islamic State fighters and buildings across both Iraq and Syria overnight, according to military chiefs. Syrian targets included he Islamic State's defacto capital of Raqqa, and Kobane where Kurdish Peshmerga and YPG forces have been involved in street battles with extremists for months. The city of Dayr az Zawr, which contains 600,000 people and is the largest in Syria's east was also among the cities hit. In Iraq targets were hit around the town of Mosul, which contains an important dam, Fallujah, which is located just to the east of Baghdad, and Sinjar, which thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee after ISIS fighters took the town earlier this year. Scroll down for video . U.S.-led coalition warplanes hit 29 targets in Iraq and Syria yesterday destroying buildings, vehicles and units, including in the town of Kobane (pictured) where ISIS are still fighting Kurdish forces . In total 17 bombs were dropped over Syria and another 12 over Iraq, though the exact split between the target cities has not been announced. Chiefs of the Combined Joint Task Force said buildings, fighting positions and units were all hit during the bombing runs, but did not give information on exactly what was destroyed or how many casualties there were. ISIS has been engaged in street battles with Kurdish Peshmerga and YPG units in Kobane for months, as airstrikes attempt to weaken the opposition . The latest round of bombings against ISIS targets in the Middle east takes the number of strikes since Christmas above 100, as the U.S.-led coalition attempts to weaken the radical group. As well as key towns such as Raqqa and Kobane, strikes have also hit Al Asad, Al Qaim, Baiji, Kirkuk and Tal Afar in Iraq. As the bombing runs were carried out last night Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad went to deliver a New Year's message to troops in the east Damascus district of Jobar last night. State TV showed the despot having dinner with soldiers and pro-government gunmen during the rare appearance. The news came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced that the death toll from the four-year civil war topped 76,000 in the last year alone. An estimated 17,790 were civilians, including 3,501 children, making it the deadliest year of the war. Heavy fighting in the strategic neighbourhood killed at least 25 Syrian soldiers and pro-regime militia on Wednesday before the visit, the observatory said. Assad was shown sharing a meal of baked beans, boiled potatoes and tomatoes with soldiers and pro-government gunmen known as National Defense Forces. The fresh wave of bombings brings the number of coalition strikes since Christmas above 100, as forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad also hit targets in Damascus yesterday . A child is treated for head wounds at a medical centre in Damascus as Assad's forces launched strikes. More than 76,000 people died in the civil war last year . Last year was the deadliest of the four-year conflict in Syria, with 18,000 civilians killed after being caught in the fighting with 3,500 of those being children . 'On New Year's Eve families gather but you decided to be here to protect your country,' Assad told the troops as sporadic shooting could be heard. 'I like to be with you on this occasion.' Assad described rebels who use underground tunnels as 'rats', adding 'we fight them above the ground'. The footage, aired today, showed Assad shaking hands and kissing troops, walking into fortifications and climbing onto a tank. Syrian troops have been fighting against rebels in Jobar since 2013 and according to state media, government forces have been advancing in the area. Assad's visit came as rebels fired nearly two dozen mortar shells on Damascus, residents said. It was not clear if there were casualties. Assad has rarely made public appearances since the country's crisis began in 2011. Just hours after Assad's forces carried out bombing missions against residential neighbourhoods in Damascus he paid a visit to troops in the area to eat food with them . Shell-shocked residents of Damascus look up as debris falls from a building in the city following artillery attacks from Assad's forces yesterday . Smiles: Assad (right) enjoyed a midnight meal with soldiers and pro-government gunmen in Damascus . The last time he visited the frontline was in August 2013, when he went to the former opposition bastion of Daraya outside of Damascus. The war began in March 2011 with peaceful protests against President Bashar Assad's government, but quickly escalated into a full-blown civil war after a brutal regime crackdown. In addition to civilians, more than 15,000 rebel fighters were killed, as were nearly 17,000 militants from jihadist groups, including the Islamic State and Al-Nusra Front, Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. At least 22,627 government forces - both soldiers and members of pro-government militias - were killed, the Britain-based group said. Last year's figure compared with 73,447 in 2013, another 49,294 in 2012 and 7,841 in 2011. More than 200,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-regime protests that spiralled into a war after a government crackdown.

"After tackling Britain’s unhealthy school dinners, Jamie Oliver has turned his attention to a new scandal of ‘criminal’ proportions. The celebrity chef says thousands of tonnes of wonky fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year because supermarkets do not want to buy imperfect produce – and Britons do not want to eat it. During an investigation for a new TV show, Oliver said the amount of misshapen food cast aside was ‘bonkers’. Scroll down for video . Jamie with friend and farmer Jimmy Doherty, who star in Channel 4's Friday Night Feast tomorrow night, where they investigate the amount of misshapen fruit and veg being thrown away by supermarkets. They are pictured with actress Kate Hudson, who is set to appear in the first episode . Now, Asda has agreed to launch a trial selling ‘ugly’ vegetables at a discounted price to see if customers will bite. The new ‘Beautiful on the Inside’ range will be sold in-store for a third less than more attractive produce, in a bid to support farmers who might otherwise have to throw it away. The initiative was sparked by an investigation into food waste by Oliver and farmer Jimmy Doherty for Channel 4’s Friday Night Feast, which airs tomorrow night. The first programme shows farmers complaining that they cannot sell tonnes of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables because they are oddly-shaped. They asked Asda to carry out an in-store trial to see if customers would be willing to buy lumpy carrots and potatoes and knobbly apples and pears if they were cheaper. It will be launched on January 26, with the aim of rolling it out nationwide if it proves popular. The UK’s second largest supermarket said its own survey showed two-thirds of customers would be open to buying wonky produce while three-quarters would ‘definitely’ do so if it was cheaper. According to the Guardian, Oliver, 39, said: ‘If most Brits had half an idea of the amount going to waste, they’d be snapping up ugly veg by the trolley load. Thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year by supermarkets as they believe their customers do not want to buy imperfect produce . ‘There’s no difference whatsoever in taste or nutritional value. ‘This is perfectly good food that could and should be eaten by humans. ‘When half a million people in the UK are relying on food banks, this waste isn’t just bonkers – it’s bordering on criminal.’ It is the latest crusade for the Essex-born chef who, a decade ago, launched his campaign against high-calorie school meals. For his Jamie's School Dinners series in 2005, he visited a school in south-east London, and insisted it scrap Turkey Twizzlers and chips in favour of healthy foods such as fish and broccoli. This led to the wider Feed Me Better campaign, which prompting new Government guidance on school dinners nationwide. In 2009, the European Commission scrapped controversial rules which prevented misshapen produce being sold in Europe. Under the bizarre EU rules, bananas had to be ‘free of abnormal curvature’ and at least 14cm in length, while Class A cucumbers had to be ‘practically straight’. The draconian law meant up to a fifth of all fruit and vegetables produced was being rejected by shops because they failed to meet the required standards. Supermarket chain Asda claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce such as unusual shaped carrots, left, and misshapen peppers, right . When it was axed six years ago, the EU's then-agriculture commissioner called it ‘a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot’. But despite the changes, imperfect fruit and vegetables remains a rarity on the shelves of Britain’s major supermarkets – something farmers blame on the retailers. Now Asda claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce. Ian Harrison, of Asda, said: ‘Even if fruit and veg have some knobbles and blemishes, this doesn’t affect the quality or taste – a carrot is still a carrot. ‘Customers are simply looking for great-tasting, fresh produce at a value price. ‘Our growers are savvy and already use a large percentage of this wonky crop for further processing, for things like ready meals and juicing, but we saw an opportunity to extend this even more.’ In tonight’s programme, which starts at 8pm, Oliver and Doherty will meet farmers Olly and Kevin Hammond, who have been growing carrots and parsnips in Norfolk for more than 50 years. Doherty said: ‘Anything that doesn’t make the grade gets chucked. It’s a massive waste for farmers. ‘Where ‘A’ grade carrots sell for £800 a tonne, they practically give the ugly ones away for animal feed for just £10.'","Celebrity chef says good produce is being thrown away as it is 'wonky'

"While there was plenty to admire from our favourite male celebrities in 2014, even our most esteemed hunks managed to let us down. From scalp landing strips and a gratuitous display of pectoral cleavage to slinging on a bedspread and calling it a scarf, A-list men provided much to look at - if not to applaud. Now a national survey reveals the very worst crimes against fashion committed by some of the biggest names in music, acting, and reality TV. Robert Pattinson's bizarre 'rat tail' hair do . This bizarre haircut was the clear winner of The Biggest Fashion Fail of 2014. The 28-year-old actor gave the world the first glimpse of his very unusual new 'do as he and girlfriend FKA Twigs headed back to their hotel in New York in November. Instead of the tousled vampire locks he is known for, Robert instead sported a monkish tonsure. Scroll down for video . Heartthrob Rob Pattinson showed off 2014's most bizarre haircut: a monk's tonsure with a lone landing strip . Rob, here with co-star Kristen Stewart in Twilight, is better known for his tousled  floppy locks . But there at the base of his skull was a rectangular patch of close-cropped hair. Was it punk? Was it fashion-forward? No one knows, but perhaps the edgy style is influenced by his out-there new girlfriend. FKA Twigs - whose real name Tahliah Barnett - is known for her envelope-pushing look both on and off stage. However it is doubtful that Rob's legions of loyal fans, who came to love him as floppy haired Edward in the Twilight saga, are as happy at his makeover. Oliver Tezcan, founder and CEO of  menswear fashion website TheIdleman.com, which conducted the survey,  said: 'When Robert Pattinson first showed off the ""landing strip"" haircut many people took to Twitter to speculate if he'd done it because he had lost a bet. 'Others thought it looked like an exclamation mark without the dot, or a goatee on the wrong side of this face – but like just our survey the unanimous verdict was that this was a huge fashion fail.' Kanye West's Fashion Week moob display . While you have to give the rapper and designer credit for his courage and adventurous fashion sense, he often gets it wrong. While there were many options for his ultimate style fail of 2014, the one voted for by Brits was his fine display of 'man boobs' or 'moobs' during Paris Fashion Week. Kanye's Lavin show look contained many aspects including moobs, head stripes and knee-less jeans . The rapper appeared with wife Kim Kardashian at the front row of the Lanvin show in September. She wore a tuxedo jacket with nothing on underneath so Kanye made sure they matched by unbuttoning his navy shirt to the navel. The result? It was difficult to decide who had better cleavage . Justin Bieber's  leopard-print trousers and studded hat . The 18-year-old was seen sporting a pair of bright purple leopard-print trousers, a black jumper and a bright yellow hat complete with metal studs. The teen crooner was snapped wearing this inexplicable outfit as he left the swanky Langham Hotel in London after a night of partying which saw him visit several nightclubs across the Capital before being joined by two young ladies at his hotel at 4.30am. Justin sported a pair of bright purple leopard print trousers and bright yellow hat complete with metal studs . After such escapades, it is perhaps plausible that Beiber rolled out of bed and headed to his car still in his nightwear and donned the unusual hat as a means to conceal his bed hair. Over the course of 2014 Justin has done his best to shed his clean-cut image with drugs, arrests and a monkey-related scandal all ensuring the Baby singer didn't stay out of the spotlight for long. Alongside this transformation has come a change in his fashion, with Justin opting for a much more urban feel to his wardrobe. However this look may be taking his new found edginess just a tad too far. Bobby Norris's one-legged 'Schlong Thong' When TOWIE star Bobby Norris walked out into the Marbella June sunshine wearing his barely-there man pants, the whole world gaped in awe. How does it stay up? Is this legal in public? What would Borat say? Pictures of the asymmetric 'swimsuit' went viral, with celebrities such as Paris Hilton and David Walliams even tweeting about the daring summer look. Bobby wore the one legged 'man sling' while on holiday with the TOWIE cast in Marbella . There is almost nothing good to say about Bobby's decision to wear a red sling in lieu of swimming trunks, an option that provided the least possible amount of cloth cover without making him liable for prosecution for exposing himself in public. Explaining his one legged budgie-smuggler Bobby said that it avoided 'unsightly white bits' while tanning. He even appeared on ITV's This Morning to try and sell his very own range of the tiny swimwear. Oliver Tezcan said clearly Bobby was trying to shock with his particularly revealing choice of swimwear. Proudlock's all-tartan suit . Known for his long hair and lothario ways on E4's Made In Chelsea, Oliver Proudlock, who goes mainly by his surname, usually wears a casual combination of tight trousers and T-shirt. Proudlock was joined by his stylish co-star Rosie Fortescue at a John Rocha fashion show in February . However clearly feeling he had to smarten up for the  John Rocha autumn/winter 2014 catwalk show in February, Proudlock opted for head-to-toe tartan. He may have thought he looked jazzy, but the overall appearance was closer to picnic blanket than high fashion.

Mark wore a shocking pink velour tracksuit for a trip to Newcastle in May . Mark Wright's pink velour tracksuit . Another popular fashion fail was Essex boy Mark Wright's fuchsia all-in-one outfit. It was a rare style mistake from Strictly Come Dancing finalist and reality TV star Mark as the usually dapper 27-year-old wore a shocking pink velour tracksuit for a trip to Newcastle in May. To make matters worse he teamed the sportswear with a pair of bright white trainers, allowing for a glimpse of ankle between the elasticated trousers and shoes. Engaged to the stylish Michelle Keegan, Mark generally fares well in the style stakes, which makes this faux pas all the more upsetting. Usher and Lenny Kravitz's outlandish accessories . How did two of the most fashionable and desired men in the music business manage to get it so wrong. Wearing perfectly normal outfits, both R&B star Usher and rock star Lenny Kravitz suceeded in landing themselves on the worst fashion fail list through their accessories alone. Despite being indoors - and in Los Angeles - Usher plonked a giant fur raccoon hat on his head for the BET awards show. As well as being totally out of place when not worn by a mountaineer up a snowy peak, the presence of a furry tail hanging down the singer's neck was nothing short of creepy. Similarly, Lenny managed to ruin his normal get-up of shirt, jumper, jacket and jeans with a massive scarf. More blanket than winter warmer, the knitted monstrosity looked in danger of suffocating the rocker as he walked. Long enough to comfortably cover a sofa, the brown scarf hung down nearly to the singer's waist and even Lenny's legendary swag couldn't make it look good. Usher (left) and Lenny Kravitz (right) prove that accessories can ruin an outfit even on the best looking men . Pharrell Williams' cropped tux . Musician Pharrell Williams made it on to the list with his black tie shorts look which he wore to the Oscars. A true gentleman's classic, the tuxedo is not to be messed with, and while the Happy singer can pull off many wacky looks (most famously of course his Mountie hat), the cropped tux trousers he wore to the Oscars led many to question if there had been an accident at the dry-cleaners. Standing at a modest 5ft 7in, the knee-length leg-wear did nothing to lengthen the star, who looked positively diminutive next to his statuesque wife Helen Lasichanh. Pharrell Williams may have written Happy, the song of 2014, but his cropped tuxedo  failed to win fans .","Twilight star's shaved head and rat tail voted top fashion crime of 2014 .

"Too young: Garrett Gagne was hit and killed Thursday morning after celebrating New Year's Eve with friends in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A police officer hit the 22-year-old with his car while he was allegedly lying in the street . A police officer responding to an emergency call early New Year's Day ran over and apparently killed a college lacrosse player who was lying in a road, authorities said. Police said they don't know why Garrett Gagne was in the road or what his condition was before he was struck at 4am in Chatham, Massachusetts. The officer, who has not yet been identified, immediately stopped and called for help when he realized he had hit Gagne, police said Thursday. State and local police are investigating. Gagne, 22, was a senior government major and lacrosse player for St. Lawrence University. Police said he was from Longmeadow in western Massachusetts and was in Chatham, on Cape Cod, to celebrate New Year's Eve with friends. A preliminary investigation has revealed that Gagne suffered head trauma from being hit by a car while he was in the road. Chatham Police Chief Mark Pawlina said his investigators will be looking into whether the officer was speeding at the time, and how the young man ended up lying in the road in a rural area. 'We do know that there were some indications that there was some celebration going on and some alcohol involved, but to what extent we don’t know yet,' he told the Boston Herald. 'That’s something detectives are trying to determine. ... Everything will be thoroughly investigated.' Gagne's death has deeply troubled his department. Stand-out athlete: Authorities don't know why Gagne was lying in the street when he was hit, and are investigating whether alcohol may have contributed to the tragic accident. Gagne pictured above playing lacrosse for St Lawrence University in a number 28 jersey . 'The officer is very distraught and very upset over this, which is to be expected,' Pawlina said. The officer's identity is due to be released within 24 hours and Pawlina said he 'was not a rookie' but also not a veteran. While police said that Gagne's friends could not be immediately reached after the incident, they spoke to the Boston Herald hours later when they set up a makeshift memorial at the scene. 'Everyone loved him,' 24-year-old Dave Honey of Boston, a friend and former lacross teammate told the paper. 'We're all from Chatham and we all were with him last night. We are still in shock.' However, Honey would not go into detail into what happened at the New Year's celebrations Gagne attended. Loved: Gagne (far left) was a senior at St Lawrence, and the Canton, New York school plans to hold a memorial for the fallen student when classes resume. Pictured above with friends in a shot posted to Facebook . St Lawrence University, in Canton, New York, set up a memorial website to Gagne on Thursday. In a statement, St. Lawrence President William Fox said the school will hold a tribute for him when classes resume. Fox wrote in the statement: 'When Mike Mahoney, Garrett's lacrosse coach, contacted me this morning, he told me, ""Garrett was close to all of us on the team — a leader, mentor, and friend. His smile and enthusiasm were contagious. He could light up the field and sidelines with his personality. This sudden and shocking loss touches every one of us who knew him as one of our best.""' Gagne played in every game last season, and contributed several goals for the team, according to online statistics. At Longmeadow High School, Gagne captained both the lacrosse and ski racing teams and was honored for his academics, according to Fox's statement. He was also a two-time Massachusetts state champion in ski racing.","St Lawrence University lacrosse player Garrett Gagne was celebrating New Year's Eve in Cape Cod with friends when he was killed Thursday morning .

The stars of TV's poshest show - and a host of top trainers -  joined forces for the E4 show’s first official fitness programme, MIC:FIT. FEMAIL caught up with the cast to find out the secrets they swear by for staying in shape. Ollie Proudlock, Binky Felstead, Spencer Matthews and Lucy Watson are hoping to help kick-start your 2015 fitness regime and promise that their plan 'isn't about losing weight, but about turning fat into muscle'. Scroll down for video . From left to right, Binky Felstead, Spencer Matthews, Ollie Proudlock and Lucy Watson have joined forces with the UK's top trainers to create their very own fitness DVD, MIC: FIT and reveal their workout secrets . The DVD, which promises to reveal the cast members' secrets to 'looking hot with a hectic lifestyle and how they keep fit when not partying in Chelsea', was a Christmas bestseller. So why did these four cast members make the cut to showcase their athletic prowess? 'We all love our fitness and go to the gym a lot, so we thought it would be fun,' explains Binky. The programme features four high-energy 20-minute workouts, one from each of the cast members.

First up is Binky Felstead, who shares her favourite Tabata Wake Up Call Workout - a four-minute intense routine she promises is  fun while it burns lots of calories. 'I used to be a gymphobic,' she said. 'But now I love working out and prefer having a personal trainer so I can get it out of the way first thing in the morning.' Meanwhile, Spencer pretends he’s not in pain while working up an energising sweat with a 20-minute High Intensity Interval Training routine, also known as HIIT. This routine is designed to work on the abs, arms and legs by alternating periods of short, intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods. Judging from his delighted grin in the campaign shots, he abs-solutely loves it - but that's not what his castmates say. 'Spencer 100 per cent found doing the DVD the hardest because he wasn't in the best shape but he's reached that now,' they said.

It focuses on getting all the right bits toned before you put on that bikini or beachwear - something the actress-turned-model knows all about. And then there's hipster Proudlock, who introduces a special yoga and Pilates-inspired workout called the Chelsea Morning Power Stretch. It not only works on the core but also helps the boyd recover from the more strenuous routines, he said. 'It's really good for those who want to stretch out their muscles,' he said.

So what's on the agenda for 2015? 'I need to pass my driving test, it's my third time,' admitted Binky. Charitable Proudlock wants to rescue a dog, take up singing lessons, hang out with his family more and be 'more decisive', while Lucy wants to prioritise her friends and family over work. The trio also have big plans to develop their personal brands. Proudlock will be adding a womenswear range to his Serge DeNimes line, Binky wants to add skincare and perfume to her Binky London cosmetics range and Lucy plans to develop her jewellery collection further.

"Ex-wrestler Mark Schultz has attacked Bennett Miller, director of the movie 'Foxcatcher,' for the way he is portrayed in the movie, which shows his and his murdered brother Dave's relationship with millionaire John du Pont. A furious Schultz called Miller 'scum' and claimed to hate him in a series of tweets posted on Wednesday - angry that the film suggests he and convicted murderer du Pont may have had a love affair. The angry former wrestler's  comments come as a U-turn from previous enthusiastic public statements of support for the movie which is expected to feature strongly among contenders for the upcoming Academy Awards. Scroll down for video . Hitting out: Mark Schultz, right, posted a series of tweets against 'Foxcatcher' director Bennett Miller, right, this week on social media. The two are seen here at the Cannes Film Festival in May . Adapation: Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz in the movie, and Steve Carell plays his benefactor John du Pont. Schultz  described his anger on Facebook over a 'Foxcatcher' scene that suggested he and du Pont were engaged in a sexual relationship . Schultz took to Twitter to rant and rave about Miller on Wednesday. Most of the tweets were written in all capital letters. The tweets have since been deleted, though they were seen and reprinted by Entertainment Weekly. Schultz wrote 'YOU CROSSED THE LINE MILLER. WE'RE DONE. YOU'RE CAREER IS OVER. YOU THINK I CAN'T DO IT. WATCH ME.' 'YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SIT BACK AND WATCH YOU DESTROY MY NAME AND REPUTATION I SWEAT BLOOD FOR. YOU AINT' SEEN NOTHING YET DUDE.' 'I BUILT THIS HOUSE AND I'LL TEAR IT DOWN. YOU THINK I CAN'T TAKE YOU DOWN COZ UR A DIRECTOR. WATCH ME BENNETT' 'I CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF THINGS BUT I DON'T TOLERATE DISRESPECT. WE'RE DONE BENNETT. 'Everything I've ever said positive about the movie I take back. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it.' 'I HATE BENNETT MILLER.' 'I HATE EVERYTHING THAT SCUM TOUCHES. EVERYTHING!!!' Killer: John du Pont, seen in a 1992 file photo, was convicted of third-degree murder and died behind bars in 2010 . 'Foxcatcher' also depicts the real life 1996 murder of Schultz' brother and fellow wrestler Dave Schultz, who is played by Mark Ruffalo. Channing Tatum portrays Mark Schultz. The Olympian brothers'  benefactor John du Pont - portrayed by Steve Carell in the film - was convicted of third-degree murder and died behind bars in 2010. Mark Schultz earlier praised 'Foxcatcher' in a November interview with MailOnline. 'It's a beautiful movie,' he said at the time. 'The last time I saw it, I kind of let the past go. The movie is not based on my book – it's based on the darkest parts of my life story.' Indeed, Entertainment Weekly also made the point that Schultz said his representation on the big screen was inaccurate with the December 21 tweet '#Foxcatcher couldn't have portrayed me more inaccurately if they tried.' Shooting: The movie is based on the real life 1996 murder of Dave Schultz, seen in this file photo with John du Pont . However, that same day he tweeted ''Wrestling is extremely hard. It's the hardest sport,' said 'Foxcatcher' director Bennett Miller. How can you not love Bennett Miller.' Schultz also posted a lengthy message on his Facebook page on Tuesday, in which he described his anger over a 'Foxcatcher' scene that suggested he and du Pont were engaged in a sexual relationship, EW noted. 'The personalities and relationships between the characters in the film are primarily fiction and somewhat insulting,' Schultz wrote on Facebook. 'Leaving the audience with a feeling that somehow there could have been a sexual relationship between duPont and I is a sickening and insulting lie. 'I told Bennett Miller to cut that scene out and he said it was to give the audience the feeling that duPont was encroaching on your privacy and personal space. I wasn't explicit so I didn't have a problem with it. Then after reading 3 or 4 reviews interpreting it sexually, and jeopardizing my legacy, they need to have a press conference to clear the air, or I will.' On Thursday, Schultz posted a link on his Twitter account to a Facebook post for the page 'Mark Schultz: Olympic Wrestling Champion'. 'My story and my life are real,' the post said. 'I am a real human being. While I may have tweeted out of anger, I in no way regret standing up for myself, nor do I regret calling out the only other man who has had decision making power concerning my image and legacy these past years. 'I apologize for the harshness of my language, but I am firm in where I stand. I will gladly go to any lengths to protect and safeguard the integrity and truth of my story, my life, my character and my legacy. If that's not worth fighting over while I'm still alive, I don't know what is.' Representatives for Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Publicists for the film at Sony Pictures Classics also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Press: Schultz is portrayed by Channing Tatum (far right) in the movie 'Foxcatcher.'

"The Huntsman family may be looking to craft themselves into the next American political dynasty, after the Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons. Former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman's 28-year-old pundit daughter Abby shied away from questions about a political future, but says she has not ruled out running for office. 'Never say never, right?' Huntsman told the Salt Lake Tribune on December 31. 'My dad has always raised us to serve. You've seen that with my brothers going in the military. … If there was an opportunity that made sense somewhere, where I felt like I had the right message to move it in the right direction and to help out, of course you take that seriously.' Preparing for office: Abby Huntsman refused to confirm nor deny that she would like to pursue a career in politics like her father in the future . Following in dad's footsteps? Abby Huntsman (left), daughter of former presidential candidate Jon Huntsman (right), says she hasn't ruled out running for public office . Bringing sex appeal to D.C. one day? Abby  (left) with her sisters Elizabeth and Mary Anne became one of the stars of her father's own short lived presidential campaign for the 2012 elections . Huntsman first came to public attention in 2011, when her father stepped down as President Obama's ambassador to China to start his own run at the White House. Abby and two of her sisters were their father's secret weapon in the campaign, tweeting candid thoughts about the candidate, which made him more relatable. However, Huntsman's popularity never went over 5 per cent and he lost the GOP nomination to Mitt Romney. Abby is currently a co-host on MSNBC show The Cycle, where she offers a more Republican perspective on the liberal network show. If she were to run for office, Abby says it would probably be back in her home state of Utah. Political family: Abby (second right) supported her father's failed 2012 run at the White House by starting a Twitter campaign with her sisters Elizabeth (left) and Mary Anne (second left). Pictured above as her father announces an end to his campaign with mother Mary Kaye (third left) and sister Gracie Mei (right, who was adopted from China) However, her more moderate Republicanism could prove difficult in securing public office in the conservative state. Abby believes that politics in the state are changing and cites former Democratic Gov Scott Matheson and former Democratic Utah congressman Jim Matheson as examples of the right-leaning state, sometimes voting for candidates on the left. 'Utah has also changed a lot. You look at even Salt Lake City — the demographics are changing. I think we'll see in years to come that it's not going to necessarily be a hot spot for the tea party.' So far during her tenure on The Cycle, Abby has been the only panelist with a conservative point of view, but she finds herself agreeing with her co-hosts on a lot of issues. Abby adds that she considers herself a free thinker and never wanted to be another party talking head. The Republican viewpoint: Abby is currently a panelist on MSNBC show The Cycle where she offers a conservative point of view on the afternoon news show . She says the 'next generation of young Republications' is 'more like Republicans of probably 20 years ago. Socially, we aren't where the tea party is at all. We are a lot more compassionate when it comes to gay rights and immigration, because we've grown up in a different world.' While he may be biased, her father has given her a glowing review of her journalist integrity, telling the Tribune: 'She's not an advocacy journalist, which is what you see a lot of today. She's an old-school journalist. She wants to get the story right, wants to convey to the listening audience the passion, the emotion, the politics of the moment without the proverbial political spin.' But it still may be a bit early to be starting an political-action committees for young Abby, who says right now she's just 'trying to get the best that I can at what I'm doing'.","Abby Huntsman is the second oldest of Huntsman's seven children .

"The new year is expected to bring rising chicken egg prices across the U.S. as California starts requiring farmers to house hens in cages with enough space to move around and stretch their wings. The new standard backed by animal rights advocates has drawn ire nationwide because farmers in Iowa, Ohio and other states who sell eggs in California have to abide by the same requirements. To comply, farmers have to put fewer hens into each cage or invest in revamped henhouses, passing along the expense to consumers shopping at grocery stores. California is the nation's largest consumer of eggs and imports about one-third of its supply. Caged chickens lay eggs in a chicken house built decades ago at an egg farm in San Diego, California . Jim Dean, president and CEO of Centrum Valley Farms in Iowa and Ohio, said one of his buildings that holds 1.5 million hens is now about half full to meet California's standards, and another building may have to be completely overhauled. Farmers like him in cold climates will have to install heaters to replace warmth formerly generated by the chickens living close together. Dean said that's something people in sunny California didn't consider. 'You're talking about millions upon millions of dollars,' he said. 'It's not anything that's cheap or that can be modified easily, not in the Midwest.' California voters in 2008 approved the law backed by animal rights advocates to get egg-laying hens out of cramped cages and put them by Jan. 1, 2015, in larger enclosures that give them room to stretch, turn around and flap their wings. State legislators followed with the companion piece in 2010 requiring the out-of-state compliance. In anticipation, egg prices have already risen, said Dave Heylen of the California Grocers Association, adding that the holiday season, cold weather across the country and increased exports to Mexico and Canada also contributed to a year-end price spike. He said he expected that supplies would remain adequate to meet demand. A farm worker collects eggs in an old-fashioned chicken house at an egg farm in California . Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at the University of California, Davis, said prices initially could rise dramatically this year but he expects them to eventually settle anywhere from 10 and 40 percent higher in California and return to their normal price elsewhere in the country. If farmers cut back the number of chickens so they can comply with California's cage law, Sumner said that could reduce the number of eggs available. 'When there's that much uncertainty, I'm thinking there may be some disruption in the market,' he said. Farmer Frank Hilliker had take a loan of $200,000 to comply with the new requirement, and is in the process of converting to a cage-free system . Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, said he believes the costs to consumers will be minimal and worth it for the welfare of chickens, which provide enough eggs for each person to consume on average 250 a year. For decades, he said, farmers have crammed six to eight chickens in small cages without room to move. 'This is the last bastion of cage confinement in industrial ag,' said Pacelle, whose organization led the reforms. Starbucks in December said it will eliminate the sale of eggs from caged hens, he said, following the lead of Burger King and Whole Foods. The California Department of Food and Agriculture, independent of the voter initiative, implemented rules that give chickens 70 percent more room, which Pacelle said is better but not enough. Low-income people who rely on eggs as an economical source of protein may be hurt the worst by California's cage law, says a report this week by the Egg Industry Center at Iowa State University. Anticipating a 15 percent increase, the cost of a dozen eggs could rise by 27 cents, and a family of four could pay $15.93 more a year, the report says. California has prevailed in lawsuits, including six from major egg-producing states that argued the state is dictating market prices in other states in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Appeals are pending. Ken Klippen of the National Association of Egg Farmers said California's egg law, in addition to driving up the cost at the grocery store and putting pressure on egg supplies, will result in more injuries to chickens because housing them in larger pens means they are more likely to run, breaking a leg or wing. 'You're not going to help the chicken,' he said. 'You're not helping consumers.'","The new standard is backed by animal rights advocates but has has drawn ire from farmers in other states who must to comply to sell in California .
Added cost of rehousing chickens will contribute to higher prices at the grocery stores .

Prices will rise 'dramatically' at first, but then settled at 10 to 40percent higher than before ."
"The tequila sure looks real, so do the beer taps. Inside the hospital at the National Institutes of Health, researchers are testing a possible new treatment to help heavy drinkers cut back - using a replica of a fully stocked bar. The idea: Sitting in the dimly lit bar-laboratory should cue the volunteers' brains to crave a drink, and help determine if an experimental pill counters that urge. True, there's no skunky bar odor; these bottles are filled with colored water. The real alcohol is locked in the hospital pharmacy, ready to send over for the extra temptation of smell - and to test how safe the drug is if people drink anyway. Dr. George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, left, and NIAAA scientist Dr. Lorenzo Leggio pose in a research laboratory designed as a bar inside the National Institutes of Healthís hospital in Bethesda, Maryland . 'The goal is to create almost a real-world environment, but to control it very strictly,' said lead researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, who is testing how a hormone named ghrelin that sparks people's appetite for food also affects their desire for alcohol, and if blocking it helps. Amid all the yearly resolutions to quit, alcohol use disorders affect about 17 million Americans, and only a small fraction receives treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all therapy, and the NIH is spurring a hunt for new medications that target the brain's addiction cycle in different ways - and to find out which options work best in which drinkers. 'Alcoholics come in many forms,' explained Dr. George Koob, director of NIH's National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which has published new online guides, explaining who's at risk and what can help. What's the limit? NIAAA says 'low-risk' drinking means no more than four drinks in any single day and no more than 14 in a week for men, and no more than three drinks a day and seven a week for women. Genes play a role in who's vulnerable to crossing the line into alcohol abuse. So do environmental factors, such as getting used to drinking a certain amount, not to mention how your own brain's circuitry adapts. Treatment can range from inpatient rehab and 12-step programs to behavioral therapy and the few medications available today. Koob, who specializes in the neurobiology of alcohol, says it usually takes a combination and ultimately, 'you have to change your life.' Yet a recent review for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that less than a third of people who need treatment get it, and of those, less than 10 percent receive medications. Three drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol abuse. One, naltrexone, blocks alcohol's feel-good sensation by targeting receptors in the brain's reward system - if people harbor a particular gene. The anti-craving pill acamprosate appears to calm stress-related brain chemicals in certain people. The older Antabuse works differently, triggering nausea and other aversive symptoms if people drink while taking it. Sitting in the dimly lit bar-laboratory should cue the volunteers' brains to crave a drink, and help determine if the experimental pill counters that urge (file picture) Recent research suggests a handful of drugs used for other disorders also show promise: . -Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute found the epilepsy drug gabapentin reduced relapses in drinkers who'd recently quit, and improved cravings, mood and sleep by targeting an emotion-related brain chemical. -A study by NIAAA and five medical centers found the anti-smoking drug Chantix may help alcohol addiction, too, by reducing heavy drinkers' cravings. -And University of Pennsylvania researchers found the epilepsy drug topiramate helped heavy drinkers cut back, if they have a particular gene variation mostly found in people of European descent. Back in NIH's bar lab, one of about a dozen versions around the country, the focus is on ghrelin, the hormone produced in the stomach that controls appetite via receptors in the brain. It turns out there's overlap between receptors that fuel overeating and alcohol craving in the brain's reward system, explained NIAAA's Leggio. In a study published this fall, his team gave 45 heavy-drinking volunteers different doses of ghrelin, and their urge to drink rose along with the extra hormone. Now Leggio is testing whether blocking ghrelin's action also blocks those cravings, using an experimental Pfizer drug originally developed for diabetes but never sold. The main goal of this first-step study is to ensure mixing alcohol with the drug is safe. But researchers also measure cravings as volunteers, hooked to a blood pressure monitor in the tiny bar-lab, smell a favorite drink. Initial safety results are expected this spring. 'Our hope is that down the line, we might be able to do a simple blood test that tells if you will be a naltrexone person, an acamprosate person, a ghrelin person,' Koob said.","Researchers at the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism hope bar will cue volunteers' crave to drink .

The body of Hayati Lutfiah, the first victim of the AirAsia crash to be identified, is handed over to weeping relatives at Surabaya police hospital where the plane initially took off . The body, previously known as B001, was identified by fingerprints, a necklace with her initials on it, surgical scars described by the family, and an identification card found on the corpse . A relative weeps as the first victim of the AirAsia crash to be identified is handed over. Search teams have warned this morning that it could take a week to recover the plane's black box recorder . Police said body B001 was identified  by surgical scars, fingerprints, a necklace containing her initials, and a red name badge pinned to her uniform. Hayati Lutfiah Hamid, 47, was a school teacher who was travelling to Singapore for a family holiday with her daughter, husband and mother-in-law according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Search teams recovered a further eight bodies, bringing the total to 16, after they resumed operations following bad weather which has so far hampered efforts. Crews have been unable to investigate an object resting 100-165ft below the sea which is believed to be the remains of the Airbus A320-200, as officials have warned it could be a week before the plane's black box recorder can be recovered. A specialist black box search team from France is en route to help with the recovery. France's BEA crash investigation agency helps with any air crash involving an Airbus  because the company is based in France.

After a Muslim cleric had said a prayer over Ms Hamid's body, the casket was immediately taken to a village and lowered into a muddy grave, as Islamic traditions require bodies to be buried quickly. An imam said a simple prayer as about 150 people gathered in the drizzling rain, and red flowers were sprinkled over the mound of wet dirt with a small white tombstone. So far 16 bodies have been found from Flight 8501 out of the 162 passengers and crew that were on board when the plane disappeared from radar. The aircraft disappeared on Sunday while on route between Surabaya to Singapore shortly after the pilot radioed to report stormy conditions. Workers began finding wreckage on Tuesday, with 16 bodies pulled from the water near Borneo Island, including one wearing a life jacket and two others reported to be holding hands. A minesweeper boat and private survey ship have since located a large object beneath the waves which officials believe to be the plane, though no 'pings' from its black boxes have be detected so far. The remains of Hayati Lutfiah were handed over today (left) as rescue workers returned to the sea of Indonesia to search for more bodies. So far 16 victims have been recovered (right) Dive teams have promised an 'all out effort' to find more bodies today after rough seas and dire weather halted earlier efforts to investigate potential wreckage on the seabed . It is the middle of Indonesia's rainy season, so strong winds, heavy rains, and rough seas have so far prevented anyone from descending to inspect the object. Officials said that divers would not be sent underwater until there was a confirmed target. Indonesia air force spokesman Rear Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto said his men are 'focusing on finding the body of the plane,' adding: 'There was something like a dark shadow once seen from a plane, but it cannot yet be proven as wreckage.' Frogman commander Lieutenant Edi Tirkayasa said the weather was making the operation especially difficult. Search teams have identified an object resting 100-165ft under the sea, which they believe to be the wreckage of the Airbust A320-200, but divers have been unable to inspect it because of dire weather conditions . Investigators are still not clear what caused the plane to crash, and say that it could be a week before the black box recorder, which contains essential data and recordings from the cockpit, is found . The bodies were found floating in the sea near Borneo Island, and included an air stewardess dressed in uniform, one person wearing a life jacket, and another pair reported to be holding hands . He said: 'What is most difficult is finding the location where the plane fell - checking whether the aircraft is really there. 'This is very difficult even with sophisticated equipment. With weather like this, who knows? We are still hopeful and optimistic that they'll find it. They must.' It is still unclear what brought the plane down about halfway into its two-hour flight, though investigators are working on a theory that the plane stalled as it climbed steeply to avoid a storm. During the pilot's last radio call he sough permission to climb above rough weather but was denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the plane vanished without issuing a distress call. The bodies are being taken to Surabaya (pictured), where the AirAsia flight originally took off, where many of the families have gathered and religious services are being held . Officials say it is likely that there are scores of bodies still trapped in the wreckage of the plane, but say they have not confirmed where the plane is and will not send divers in until they have a target . The cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, or black boxes, hold data that will help investigators determine the cause of the crash. Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas in Australia said there's a good chance the plane hit the water largely intact, and that many passengers remain inside it. He added that bodies recovered so far would have come out with a breach in the fuselage. 'But most passengers still should have had their seat belts on, particularly as the plane was going into weather. The captain would have still had the seat belt sign on.' Items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit door, an inflatable slide, children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food. Bodies removed from the water are being sent to Pangkalan Bun, a town near to Borneo Island, before being transported to Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, where Flight 8501 took off. Many family members have remained at the Surabaya airport since getting word that the plane disappeared. Dive teams are on standby to search any wreckage for more bodies, but say it is extremely difficult to identify where exactly on the seabed the plane is, even with sophisticated equipment . The crash happened in the midst of Indonesia's rainy season, meaning strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rains are making search efforts especially difficult . Workers have also recovered several items that they believe are from the plane, including a life jacket, emergency exit door, and emergency slide (pictured) Other items found adrift in the ocean include children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food . 'Help us, God, to move forward, even though we are surrounded by darkness,' the Rev. Philip Mantofa of Mawar Sharon Church about 100 relatives gathered in an airport waiting room Wednesday. About 40 members of Mantofa's church died in the crash. 'Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this. Our God is not evil.' Officials have not announced the identities of the 16 bodies recovered. Relatives have given blood for DNA tests and submitted photos of their loved ones, along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier. Indonesia is using a minesweeper craft and a private search vessel which have identified a large 'shadow' on the seabed which investigators believe to be the wreckage . While search teams have identified a large object they believe could be the wreckage, they say they have yet to pick up any 'pings' coming from the black box recorder . Richard Shears . The AirAsia jet which plunged into the Java Sea rose up as fast as a fighter jet and then dropped almost vertically into the sea as if being thrust down by a giant hand, crash experts agreed today. Their conclusion is that the Airbus 320-200 was in the grip of weather so freakishly extreme that there was nothing the pilots could do to save the jet and all 162 people on board. The plane behaved in ways 'bordering on the edge of logic,' Indonesian aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said after examining figures leaked from the official air crash investigation team. He said the jet climbed at a speed that would have been impossible for the pilot to have achieved - and then plunged straight down 'like a piece of metal being thrown down. 'It's really hard to comprehend…the way it goes down is bordering on the edge of logic.' Australian aviation expert, Peter Marosszeky, from the University of NSW, told the Sydney Morning Herald that, in contrast, he was baffled by the extremely low speed of the descent - as low as 61 knots - which would suggest the plane was heading almost straight down, explaining why it has been found in water just 10km from its last point of radar contact. Both experts are in agreement that the jet went down almost vertically - and they also concluded that a freak weather pattern that placed the aircraft under extraordinary forces was to blame for its plight.","First funeral for victim of AirAsia flight 8501 is held in Surabaya, Indonesia .

"A 66-year-old Wall Street veteran has won the lottery, after two decades of gambling just to make a point. Robert Fagenson placed second in the New York State Lotto drawn on December 27, matching five of the six numbers and the bonus number to take home a check for $65,243. He told the New York Post that he has been playing twice a week for more than two decades, with numbers connected to his wife's birthday, their anniversary and the birthdays of his two daughters.

'I was just wondering if the system really worked,' Fagenson told the Post. 'Now I know it actually works.' While Fagenson spent an estimated $5,800 on the lottery in the 20 years he has been playing, it does seem to have been a worthy investment - so he plans to continue. In the end, $65,000  likely doesn't make much of a dent on Fagenson's overall fortune, since it's approximately the amount he donated to a Long Island-based animal charity in 2011, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Native New Yorker graduated from Syracuse University in 1970 with a degree in Transportation Sciences & Finance. He went on to spend most of his career on the New York Stock Exchange, where he was once governor of the trading floor and served on the board of directors.

"Not again? Not again, says LeBron James. The 30-year-old NBA star has shot down rumors of leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat, calling the speculation 'outlandish'. Eyebrows were raised on Christmas Day when LeBron was caught on camera talking to former Heat teammate Dwayne Wade after the Cavaliers lost to Miami. It was LeBron's first game since against the Heat since leaving his former team, and he said to his friend that 'if things aren't better this year, we're gonna reunite again and do some bigger and better things, all right?'.

James was caught on camera talking to former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade following the Cavaliers’ Christmas Day loss in Miami . But on Wednesday he was forced to acknowledge the video after it started swirling around the internet. 'I've seen that video too,' James told The New York Post. 'I don't know exactly what I said, but I know it had nothing to do about basketball. 'I wouldn't say that on Christmas, in front of cameras. 'That (conversation) had nothing to do with me leaving here. 'I didn't go to college, but I'm not stupid. If I would have said something, I would have said it the (previous) night to D-Wade. 'I'm here now and I'm here to build something in the future.' However, Cleveland.com are reporting that James  'won't hesitate to make the appropriate business decision if it means bolting'. James spurned his home-region Cavaliers for the Heat in 2010. But after winning his long-sought after first NBA titles with Miami, he returned to Cleveland vowing to bring the city a major sports title, something not seen there since the NFL's Cleveland Browns in 1964. 'The schedule came out after I had decided to come back,' he said . 'The NBA knew something. 'They knew that I was going to go home or stay in Miami, so they knew I would have to play my home team or my old teammates.' James, who ranks second in NBA scoring with 25.2 points a game and fifth in assists with 7.8 a contest, has sparked the Cavaliers to a 16-10 record, fifth in the Eastern Conference. The Heat, who brought in Luol Deng to try and ease the sting of losing James, are 13-15, seventh in the East. Miami fans could greet James with boos when he takes to the court, or cheers to acknowledge his success with the Heat. Flashback: In this July 9, 2010, file photo, Miami Heat players (from left) Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James acknowledge the cheers during a fan event at the American Airlines Arena in Miami . Either way, James is looking ahead not back. 'I live in the present,' James said. 'Yesterday is over with. The future is unknown.' Miami's remaining 'Big Three' members are holding their own, with guard Dwyane Wade scoring 22.8 points a game and forward Chris Bosh averaging 21.6.

"A Georgia police chief who bizarrely called 911 to report that he'd 'accidentally' shot his wife 'twice' on at 4 am on New Years Eve is placed on administrative leave as an investigation reveals he shot her just once. At a Thursday afternoon press conference, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities identified the shooter as local Police Chief William McCollom, 57, and the victim as his 58-year-old wife Margaret who is now fighting for her life. As of now police have not announced as to whether or not they suspect the police chief of criminal activity but have said he is fully cooperating with law enforcement. Scroll down for video . What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom (right) shot his wife inside their home early New Year's Day. His wife Margaret (left) was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center . Scene: McCollom allegedly called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife . 'We have no leanings one way or the other at this point because we just don’t know,' Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said. “As soon as all the facts are known they’ll turn over a file to our office, and we’ll review to see if in fact there’s been any criminal activity.' Margaret McCollom has not been interviewed as of yet. 'He's very, very well-liked,' Mark Brown, of the Peachtree City Police Department, told CBS. 'The department is hurting. We're very concerned for his wife and the chief. We're just trying to make sure everything is done correctly as far as the investigation goes.' The incident happened just after 4am, when officers received a call from the chief, saying he accidentally shot his wife twice at their home on Autumn Leaf using his service handgun, a Glock 17 9mm. Investigators say the woman was shot in the home's bedroom. It was initially reported that the chief shot her two times, according to the 911 recording, but authorities now say she was shot just once. Margaret was flown by helicopter to Atlanta Medical Center, where she was still listed in critical condition Thursday afternoon. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations is taking over the case, and will file a report on the shooting to the District Attorney's office which will decide whether to press charges. GBI Director Sherry Lang said the police chief is being fully cooperative with the investigation. Meanwhile, McCollom has since been placed on paid administrative leave by the City Manager, pending an internal review. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard said  McCollom has not been arrested or charged with any crime. He had only officially been in the position for two months, but took over as interim police chief in July when the previous chief stepped down.

Sean MacPherson and Dumitrita  Tudorache, nicknamed Doyna, put their relationship on the line every day during their high risk circus act with the Circus of Horrors.

It was while Sean was working for the Chinese State Circus in 2008 that he met his long-term girlfriend Dumitrita, who had travelled to England to work as a dancer in the show. But they didn't take up the terrifying feat until Sean - who by then had retired from circus acts - was approached by a close friend who runs the famous Circus of Horrors in 2011.

The pair say that being a couple is beneficial to their act and that they enjoy the adrenaline rush it gives . Doyna, 28, originally from Romania, said: 'When Sean first asked me to do this act with him it didn't take much convincing. 'But that's probably because he didn't really give me much choice. 'We have been doing it for three years now and it definitely keeps our relationship interesting. 'At the start of our relationship we used to argue before we went out on stage, and I used to worry about having him throw knives at me. 'But I have never really worried about him hitting me with the knives, I have a lot of trust in him and he has been doing this act for a very long time. 'He has told me before that he is more careful doing the act with me than he has been in the past.

"Rescuers have reached a second ship containing hundreds of migrants which was found drifting towards Italy in stormy seas with no crew on board having been abandoned by the smugglers. An Icelandic coast guard ship, part of a new European patrol force to aid migrants at sea, made contact with the stricken vessel Ezadeen – thought to have 450 migrants on board – and has brought it under tow. It comes as nearly 1,000 migrants were saved earlier this week when the coastguard boarded another ship sailing without a crew and stopped it from crashing into the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Rescue: The Ezadeen, thought to have 450 migrants on board, is brought under tow by an Icelandic coast guard vessel working for the EU after it was abandoned by smugglers . Conditions: After several hours of struggling in rough seas, rescue teams managed to secure the Ezadeen for towing toward the southern Calabrian region . Children and pregnant women were among the migrants, most of whom were believed to be Syrian, said Marini. Italian Coast Guard Cmdr. Filippo Marini said that after several hours of struggling in rough seas, rescue teams managed to secure the Ezadeen for towing toward the southern Calabrian region. The Sierra-Leone-flagged cargo ship apparently set sail from Turkey, he said. The exact port of the Ezadeen's arrival will depend on sea conditions, authorities aid. Earlier on Friday, Marini said that a migrant had called for help saying: 'we're without crew, we're heading toward the Italian coast and we have no one to steer.' The Ezadeen is the second cargo ship full of migrants to be abandoned while still sailing this week. Days earlier, the Italian Coast Guard in a daring attempt, lowered officials onto another, Moldovan-flagged cargo vessel so they could take control of the ship, which was only a few miles from crashing into the Italian coast. More than 170,000 migrants were intercepted or needed rescue by Italian navy, coast guard and air force patrols last year. This apparently new technique by smugglers of abandoning a ship after setting it on a crash course complicates rescue efforts, Marini told Italian state radio, `'but the important thing is there are lives to be saved.' The cargo ship Ezadeen– thought to have 450 migrants on board – was apparently abandoned in rough seas by smugglers in the Mediterranean. The Italian Air Force has launched a rescue operation . The new high-seas drama came two days after Italian sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly Syrian migrants was abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from Turkey . The Italian Air Force was last night called in and sent a helicopter from an air base in southern Italy to help the 60 metre long Ezadeen, a ship sailing under the flag of Sierra Leone, which was spotted 40 miles off the south eastern top of Italy. It was hoped the coastguard could be lowered down to secure the ship and doctors could also come aboard. Prior to losing power, the ship had been moving at seven knots and had been spotted by a coastguard plane 80 miles offshore shortly after nightfall. The new high-seas drama comes just two days after Italian sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly Syrian migrants which had been heading for the rocks of Italy's southeastern shore on autopilot, having been abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from Turkey. In that incident, the Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M cargo ship got to within five miles - or 45 minutes sailing time - of a disaster before six navy officers were lowered on to the ship by helicopter and succeeded in bringing it under control. The vessel's human cargo included 60 children and two pregnant women, one of whom gave birth on board, according to the Italian Red Cross. Many of the migrants on the ship were treated for hypothermia and broken limbs. Italy has rescued more than 170,000  in the last 14 months - hundreds have died trying to make the crossing . The migrant boat dramas have come as Italy grapples with the aftermath of the Norman Atlantic ferry disaster in which at least 13 people died following an onboard fire that erupted before dawn on Sunday in waters off Albania. They also come after a record year for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia attempting to reach Europe by sea. More than 170,000 people have been rescued by Italy in the last 14 months and hundreds, possibly thousands, have died trying to make the crossing. They are almost invariably under the control of ruthless traffickers who earn thousands of dollars for every person they put to sea from Libya and other departure points in North Africa. Increasingly the traffickers get their human cargoes to Europe by putting them out to sea and then abandoning the boats.","Icelandic coast guard ship working for EU reaches stricken vessel .

The used water will then be recycled and used to keep Melbourne's gardens looking green. This time Slide.Melbourne is organising the event and claims Melbourne's Lansdowne Street will be transformed into 'the longest city street slide anywhere in the world' (similar to Perth one pictured above) The Melbourne slide will take place on February 15 between the hours of 10am and 6pm . But it is also asking participants to do their bit as well. 'Imagine if on the day you slide with us, you promise to only have a two-minute shower,' Slide.Melbourne's website said. 'If you promise to do that then you and Slide.Melbourne could actually save over 100,000 litres of water.' For a $40 and a 'small booking fee', sliders can get the most bang out of their buck for two hours. Slide.Melbourne said ticket holders could fit in at least three slides in their session.

"This tangled mass of fur may resemble some sort of monster  but it is in fact a dog that was neglected for a year after his master died and the new owners refused to care for him. The faithful pet was given food and water, and allowed access to the balcony so he didn't make a mess inside the house, but was otherwise left uncared for. When animal workers were finally called they found him covered in a mass of hair, encrusted with faeces and soaked in urine, which was so heavy it meant he could barely move or breathe. Neglect: This bobtail dog was left in an apartment in Russia for a year with just enough food and water to survive but his owners otherwise refused to care for him . Out from under: It took six workers more than three hours to remove the matted coat of fur from the animal after they were called to get rid of him . Abuse: The animal was covered in hair which was encrusted with faeces, soaked in urine and so heavy he could barely breathe . Russian pensioner Gore Zhdanov, 79, owned the dog until he passed away in the city of Novosibirsk 12 months ago, leaving all of his possessions, including the bobtail dog, to his relatives. But there were disputes over how to divide the inheritance, and while the arguments raged it was decided to keep the dog in the flat to help guard the valuables. The new family did just enough to keep the dog alive, but otherwise refused to care for him. The abuse went on for months until they came to an agreement to sell the home and the pet, and when animal workers went to collect the pet, this is the shocking sight they were greeted with. Disgrace: The faithful pet had been owned by Russian pensioner Gore Zhdanov, but passed to his relatives along with his flat after he died aged 79 . Dispute: The new owners began arguing over the inheritance and so left the dog in the flat for a year with only food and water. This is the sight that greeted animal workers when they were called to remove him . Beyond belief: While this may resemble a hairy monster or a huge piece of pocket fluff it is in fact a dog who was neglected for more than a year . The canine was covered in a mass of stinking hair which had faeces and urine soaked into it, which was almost too heavy for him to move or breathe. It took six workers three hours to remove all of the fur and expose the animal underneath, who was covered with abscesses and sores. Despite the terrifying neglect the bobtail is expected to recover. The callous previous owners were so neglectful they did not even know the pet's name, so rescuers renamed him Cocos. Dog worker Vitaly Kornilova said: 'He could barely walk, and was in a pitiful state. Relatives called us to take him away because they decided they wanted to sell the flat now that the inheritance paperwork been completed. On the mend: The previous owners did not even know the animal's name, so rescuers renamed him Cococs. He is now expected to make a full recovery . Back to health: A local expert in bobtail dogs is now looking after Cocos and is feeding him a special diet of vitamins in order to aid his recovery . Whole new dog: Cocos relaxes in his new home after having several pounds of hair removed after he was left alone for a year without being groomed . 'They said they had kept the dog to guard the flat against vandals but now wanted to get rid of it. 'Six people spent three hours trimming Cocos fur, filling four 100 liter bags with dog hair. After that, Cocos' teeth were thoroughly cleaned.' Cocos now lives with Elena Rivvo, a local expert in bobtails, who has put him on a special diet of vitamins in order to help him back to full strength.

"Great Scott - is it that time already? 2015 has finally come around, and for movie buffs everywhere, there is but one pressing question - how many predictions did Back To The Future II get right about this year? In the 1989 sci-fi comedy classic, Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) and sidekick 'Doc' Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel through time to the futuristic year of 2015. Scroll down for video . While we might not all be jetting about on hoverboards like Marty (sadly), the futuristic contraption is far closer to becoming a reality in 2015 than it was in the 1980s . While hoverboards aren't yet clogging up the skies Hendo Hover are hoping to bring them to the masses with support from skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. The technology, while not quite ready for retail, uses magnetic fields to let users literally ride on air . And remarkably, there were incidences where the film's futuristic predictions were eerily accurate. In the movie, Marty McFly of 2015 speaks to his colleagues on a video call - a fairly spot-on representation of how we chat using Skype or FaceTime. The characters also answered calls with glasses - similar to how computerized eye-wear Google glass works. The film also sees a dehydrated pizza growing into a meal-sized dish after 12 seconds on the 'hydrator plate' - this could be seen as an early form of the microwave meal. Self-lacing shoes EXIST: A Canadian Kickstarter campaign created Powerlace, the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer's foot. And Nike in 2011 created mock-ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity. For 2015, the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves . 3D movies (such as the film's prediction of a Jaws 19) have now become a reality along with holograms. HITS . Wearable technology . 3D films . Video-call communication . Microwave-style meals . MISSES . Hoverboards . Flying cars . Self-tying shoe laces . Time travel . Dominance of fax machines . While the movie was spot on with many of its predictions, not quite everything from Back To The Future II has come to pass. Flying cars have not hit the mainstream in the new millennium. Great strides have been made by company Terrafugia and a Slovakian firm also unveiled a prototype several months ago, the Aeromobil 3.0, which they believe could travel more than 430 miles in one trip. But it will be a long time before flying cars are commonplace. And  hoverboards are not yet clogging up the skies - although Hendo Hover are hoping to bring them to the masses with support from skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. So far, no one has mastered the art of time travel quite like Doc and his flying Delorean time machine either. Back To The Future II creators were remarkably accurate when they showed Marty McFly of 2015 video-calling with a colleague - much like Skype or FaceTime . A family speak to each other via Skype - similar to the method of communication used in the film . Nor are there automatically-drying clothes - although there is a range of clothing materials now being used which speed up the evaporation process. The film also sees Marty McFly donning a pair of self-lacing sneakers. While these haven't made it to the common market just yet, there are hints the time-saving footwear could really be on the horizon. Eerily accurate: In one scene round the dinner table, the characters answer phone calls with glasses, similar to how Google Glass works . Spot on: 3D movies (such as the film's prediction of a Jaws 19) have also become a reality along with holograms . In 2011, Nike created mock-ups of the cinematic shoes to be auctioned for charity. For 2015, the company has said it intends to create a version that actually lace themselves. A Canadian Kickstarter campaign also created Powerlace, the athletic shoes that automatically tighten to the wearer's foot. The film placed far too much emphasis on fax machines, which it imagined would be dominant in 2015 - but with the prevalence of the email, the devices have taken a back seat. The movie also failed to predict the invention of smartphones and tablets - arguably the most important technological breakthrough of the millennium. The official date that McFly and Doc landed in the future was October 21, 2015 - and for super-fans, a specially-created clock will let them countdown the minutes until the big day.

"Finding the cheapest train ticket for your journey in Britain is often a demanding task, and can take hours of research if you’re really determined to calculate the best deal. But a new tool called Tickety Split aims to help passengers by working out if it is cheaper to buy multiple tickets for different parts of the same journey - without necessarily having to change train. 'Ticket splitting' is legal - and all you have to do is take the same journey with two cheaper tickets instead of one more expensive one, without having to break the journey at the middle station. Scroll down for video . Any more fares? A new tool called Tickety Split aims to help passengers by working out whether it is cheaper for them to buy multiple tickets for different parts of the same journey - without having to change train . On the rails: Ticket splitting is perfectly legal - and all you have to do is take the same journey with two cheaper tickets instead of one more expensive one, without breaking your journey at the middle station . A mobile app was first launched by Money Saving Expert in 2012 - but only for tickets bought on the day of travel. Now, a desktop version has been launched which also works for advance tickets. The tool currently works for single tickets using just one split, and allows users five searches a day. Money Saving Expert tells users to watch out if they need to change trains, and says splits are not always identical for the same service. The train must call at all stations you buy tickets to or from. For example, a London-Durham anytime return  is £301. But researchers found if you buy singles from London-York and York-Durham in both directions, it could be £82 - a huge saving of £219. Choices: You can book split tickets online or just ask for them at station kiosks - rather than using machines . Days gone by: Passengers' tickets are checked at London Waterloo before they board trains for Ascot in 1948 . The practice is completely within the train operating companies' terms and conditions, but is not advertised by rail firms – the emphasis is on the user to work out how to find the best deal. You can book split tickets online or just ask for them at station kiosks - rather than using machines. And you can buy tickets for anywhere at any train station. Martin Lewis, founder and editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, told MailOnline: 'Train fares and logic go together like marshmallows and tomato soup. Yet there’s a way to work the system and it’s totally legal. 'Our TicketySplit web tool takes on the ridiculous train ticket pricing anomaly that means buying two separate tickets sometimes costs less. And it can save some regular travellers thousands of pounds. 'We first tested the water with an app that does walk-on fares, then the really tough nut to crack, as there are so many variables, was to do it for advance tickets. 'The tool proves that when you ask for the ""cheapest day return"" rail companies are simply not giving it you, their information cannot be trusted and people have to fend for themselves. 'So ensure you do it yourself, just tell the tool when and where you're travelling and it crunches thousands of advance and walk-on ticket combos to check if you can split and save. If so, you can buy them with just a few clicks.' Mike Hewitson, Passenger Focus head of policy, told MailOnline: 'Our most recent passenger survey showed that just 45 per cent of them felt they had got value for money on their ticket. 'Some passengers tell us that they can sometimes find better deals by ""splitting"" tickets, so they will welcome the extra choice the different split-ticket finders provide.' The consumer group added that the RailEasy website also offers a split-ticket fare finder tool. How it works: Step-by-step guide to how money is saved on train tickets . Looking at purchasing a ticket seven days in advance for Birmingham-Plymouth, an anytime return bought on the day is £234. The first direct Birmingham-Plymouth service is the 07:12-10:47, for which an advance single costs £111.90. However, if you split this ticket at Taunton, you can save £33.90. This is done by buying advance singles from Birmingham-Taunton (£68.70) and Tauton-Plymouth (£9.30), totalling £78. That is £33.90 less than the £111.90 - and you can stay on the train. How to save £33.90 without getting off the train: This graphic shows how splitting an advance single from Birmingham to Plymouth - which was originally £111.90 - at Taunton gives a new, lower price of £78 . On the way back, the last direct Plymouth-Birmingham service is the 18:25, arriving at 22:03, for which an advance ticket costs £53. But by splitting this ticket at Taunton again, you save £8.40. To do this you need to by buying advance singles from Plymouth-Taunton (£9.30) and Taunton-Birmingham (£35.30), totalling £44.60. This is £8.40 less than the £53. So, overall, you will now buy four advance tickets - from Birmingham-Taunton (£68.70), Taunton-Plymouth (£9.30), Plymouth-Taunton (£9.30) and Taunton-Birmingham (£35.30) - totalling £122.60. That is a saving of £42.30 on the original price of Birmingham-Plymouth and Plymouth-Birmingham advance singles - and a whopping £111.40 less than the original anytime return price. * This research was carried out on December 1, 2014 .","Tickety Split relaunched by Money Saving Expert to help cut train costs .

Technical problems interrupted the live broadcast on occasion and, as in the previous year, some jokes were missing their mark.

"The Labour-run NHS in Wales is lagging behind England on almost every measure, according to a shocking new report. The first comparative study between the two healthcare regimes reveals that patients in Wales are waiting far longer for vital tests and life-saving treatment than those in England, where the NHS is run by the Coalition government. They are also likely to have to wait longer for an ambulance in an emergency and will be seen more slowly if they need to attend A&E. Astonishingly, the target for treating cancer cases referred by GPs in Wales has not been met since the middle of 2008. The study, produced by the respected House of Commons Library, is a devastating blow to Ed Miliband’s claim that only Labour can be trusted to run the NHS. The report is a devastating blow to Ed Miliband, pictured left, who claimed that only Labour can be trusted to run the NHS. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, pictured right, said the report 'confirmed our worst fears' It confirms the findings of a Daily Mail investigation last year which sparked clashes in the Commons between David Cameron and Mr Miliband. Yet last night, Labour was still rejecting criticism of its handling of the Welsh NHS, saying it was ‘misleading’ for the Commons Library to make comparisons between the health services in England and Wales. The report found that ambulance response times to life-threatening emergencies in Wales have worsened, despite a fall in the number of calls. And the number of patients waiting more than the four-hour target time for A&E treatment is double that in England. The stark gap in performance between the NHS in England and Wales is likely to be a key election issue. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said the report ‘confirms our worst fears and lays bare the devastating consequences of Labour cuts to the Welsh NHS’. He added: ‘Despite the best efforts of dedicated staff, Welsh NHS performance is significantly poorer than in England, where the health budget has been protected in recent years. ‘On almost every measure Welsh patients receive an inferior service when compared to patients across the border, and having run the Welsh NHS since 1999, Labour must take full responsibility for their appalling management of the health service. ‘Ed Miliband seeks to portray himself as the saviour of the NHS in England. But in truth, the Welsh experience of a Labour-run health service has shown that they simply cannot be trusted anywhere near it.’ Health campaigner Gareth Williams, of the ABMU Victim Support Group, described the report’s findings as ‘depressing, but not at all surprising’. Patients in Wales are likely to have to wait longer for an ambulance in an emergency and will be seen more slowly if they need to attend A&E (file [picture) Mr Williams, whose mother died following ‘unacceptable treatment’ at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in 2012, said Wales was becoming a ‘second-class nation’ in terms of healthcare. ‘The Welsh Government is in abject denial about the scale of the crisis in the NHS in Wales,’ he added. The Commons Library report raises real concerns about the level of service offered to patients in Wales. England and Wales have different hospital waiting list targets, but the report notes that ‘referral to treatment waiting times in Wales are typically longer than in England’. In August, a third of patients receiving hospital treatment in Wales had waited more than 18 weeks, compared with just 6 per cent in England. Last year just 60 per cent of Category A 999 calls received a response within eight minutes – below the 65 per cent target. In England, the figure was 74.8 per cent. The Labour-run government in Cardiff repeatedly dismissed the Daily Mail’s exposé of serious problems in the Welsh NHS as ‘political smears’. We began our campaign in October: . OCTOBER 20, 2014: The Mail published the first of a series of articles about the problems in the Welsh NHS. The Welsh Government claimed the allegations were ‘spurious’ and rejected calls – made by the British Medical Association and politicians from across the spectrum – for an independent inquiry. Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones admitted he had not read the Mail’s reports before dismissing our investigation out of hand and suggesting the issues raised had ‘been dealt with already’. He added: ‘To suggest that the NHS in Wales is somehow in every way in a more difficult state than in England is quite simply wrong.’ The Welsh Government released a 2,447-word statement claiming there were ten inaccuracies in our coverage, but the Mail replied with a point-by-point refutation, quoting official statistics and statements. OCTOBER 21: After the Mail published its second round of stories, Mr Jones told the Welsh Assembly that ‘the vast majority of people get the best care most of the time’ in the Welsh NHS. He accused the Mail and the Department of Health of turning Wales’s health service into a ‘political football’. OCTOBER 22: The Mail published further articles exposing the scandal of Welsh NHS patients having to wait so long for operations that some were dying before they could be treated. The Welsh Government issued another lengthy statement, this time 1,006 words long, which accused us of ‘quoting selectively’ from reports. OCTOBER 24: The Mail focused on how Welsh cancer patients were being denied life-saving but expensive new treatments that are made available to sufferers in England through the Government’s Cancer Drugs Fund. The Welsh Government rejected calls for it to introduce a similar fund, quoting claims that the NHS in England was funding medication that had ‘no impact on survival’ and may not improve quality of life. The report also highlights funding cuts that belie Mr Miliband’s claims that Labour will always support the NHS. While health spending in England has been protected from cuts since the election, funding in Wales has fallen in real terms. Spending on health in Wales fell from £6.3billion at the time of the election to £6billion in 2012/3 in real terms. A spokesman for the Welsh Government said it was ‘misleading’ to make comparisons between the NHS in England and Wales. He said: ‘The report refers to a range of NHS performance data comparing England and Wales, even though numerous authoritative independent sources caution against such comparisons because of the differences in the way NHS performance is measured in England and in Wales. The Welsh Government dealt extensively with the misrepresentation of the Welsh NHS in the Daily Mail recently.’ Cancer treatment goals not met since mid-2008 . Targets for treating cancer patients referred by their GPs have not been met in Wales for more than six years, according to the report. The Welsh NHS says 95 per cent of patients diagnosed with cancer by their GP should start ‘definitive treatment’ within 62 days, but the Commons Library study says that ‘was last met in mid-2008’. Last September, just 85 per cent of patients started the so-called ‘urgent route’ to treatment on time. Ironically, those bypassing the ‘urgent route’ and going straight to hospital were likely to be treated far more quickly. The ‘non-urgent route’ target of treating 98 per cent of patients within 31 days is being met. The Welsh NHS says 95 per cent of patients diagnosed with cancer by their GP should start ‘definitive treatment’ within 62 days, but the Commons Library study says that ‘was last met in mid-2008’ (file picture) Today’s report also highlights other areas where patients in Wales wait much longer than those in England on average. In October, 93 per cent of patients waiting for hospital treatment in England had been on the waiting list for fewer than 18 weeks, compared with 72 per cent in Wales. Of those treated in August, 94 per cent in England had waited fewer than 18 weeks, compared with 66 per cent in Wales. For CT scans, 100 per cent of patients in England are tested within six weeks, compared to just 82 per cent tested within eight weeks in Wales. For non-obstetric ultrasound tests, 99 per cent of patients in England are tested within six weeks, compared with 70 per cent tested within eight weeks in Wales. On A&E services, England and Wales have the same target that 95 per cent of patients should have to wait less than four hours. In 2013/14, 13 per cent of patients attending A&E in Wales waited more than four hours – double the level in England. In Rhyl and Swansea, almost a fifth of patients waited more than four hours.","House of Commons Library carry out first comparative study of healthcare .

"A 'gentle giant' father-of-six lost his battle with lung cancer - just hours before his wedding. Steven Logan, of Baildon, West Yorkshire, was diagnosed with the disease in July and he and his partner of 15-years Kate Rodgers, had planned to marry in the coming spring. After initially showing early signs of recovery - thanks to intensive chemotherapy - the 47-year-old's health began to decline in November after the disease spread to his liver. Father-of-six Steven Logan (pictured with daughter Macey Jayne) lost his battle with lung cancer - just hours before his wedding . Mr Logan and his partner of 15-years Kate Rodgers (pictured), had planned to marry in the coming spring . As his health deteriorated, his distraught partner, 32, tried to bring forward their wedding so they could be married at their home. But tragically, he died just hours before a registrar was due to arrive. Ms Rodgers, who described her 20-stone bricklayer fiance as a 'gentle giant', said: 'I'd sorted it with the registrar who was happy to come out and marry us the next day. 'I had to go and pick up the licences in the morning, but Steven was so ill, struggling with his breath, that I couldn't leave him and he died at lunchtime. 'He had always managed to get himself up and into a chair, but that morning we were just together in bed and he faded away. 'Typically his last words to me were making sure our children got their Christmas presents okay. 'We told them what was wrong, but that daddy was always going to get better - and he really believed that too. 'Now they know he's in heaven - the brightest star in the sky is what we call him. And they even have a telescope to look for that brightest star.' The couple have two sons Billy, aged nine, Jack, six, and daughter Macey-Jayne, four, while Mr Logan also had three grown-up children from a previous marriage and four grandchildren. Now the youngsters write short letters to their father which are then set alight. Steven Logan and his partner Kate Rodgers are pictured right and left with children Billy, Macey Jayne and Jack . Ms Rodgers explained: 'The smoke goes up, so they know he can read them in heaven. 'Steven wasn't the kind to admit being poorly, but when he did go to the doctors they gave huge doses of chemotherapy at Bradford Royal Infirmary. But they could not stop the cancer spreading to his liver. 'Steven was a strong, fit man who worked hard and loved country walking, but he was also a smoker and it does get you.' When news of his illness broke, friends and family rallied round to organise fundraising events to pay for the couple's planned spring wedding. Mr Logan's friend, Maria Crump, said: 'We organised a couple of nights out to raise money and also people had promised to donate a wedding cake, hire cars and even a double decker bus for the big day. 'But sadly now any money raised will be going to pay for Steven's funeral on January 9 at Nab Wood Cemetery.' Ms Rodgers added: 'Steven was a great big man, but so kind and gentle - any more laid back and he'd have been asleep. 'He would do anything for people, but the main thing in his life was being a family man who loved nothing more than spending time with his kids and grandchildren. 'In the last few month he had reunions with family members he'd not seen for ages and that was so important to him. 'Now I've got to keep going strong for our children. 'We'd meant to get married many times over the years. We never got round to it and now it's too late. 'One more day and we'd have made it, but now I'm planning Steven's funeral. 'But I will still take his name and I will have his ashes made into a wedding ring I'll wear forever.'","Steven Logan, 47, had been diagnosed with lung cancer in July last year .

"Kirsty Walters, 29, was released from prison five months early because of a 'clerical error' by staff . Police are trying to find a female burglar who was released from prison five months early because of administrative blunders by officials. Kirsty Walters was locked up for 876 days after she broke into a string of properties in Darwen in Lancashire. But she was released five months early in October from New Hall Prison in Wakefield because of what police have described as a 'clerical error.' The Ministry of Justice has been accused of 'incompetency' in allowing the 29-year-old to be released before the end of her sentence. She was due to be released in March 2015. Walters, of no fixed address, is described as being white, 5ft 1ins tall, of medium build, with long blonde or dyed red hair and green eyes. She has pierced ears and bellybutton and spoke with a gruff local accent. Graham Jones, MP for Hyndburn, said: 'This shows incompetency from the Ministry of Justice in signing off this release. 'It is also a rather bizarre story and I would take the view that having committed the crime, Walters must complete her sentence.' A police spokesman said Walters 'was released due to a clerical error.' He said she has previous convictions for burglary and has been recalled to prison where she targeted insecure properties in Darwen. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'Releases in error are very rare but regrettable occurrences. 'The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10 but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent. 'We are formally investigating this incident and it is now a matter for the police.' Walters was not due to be released from New Hall prison in Wakefield until March but left prison in October . Last year figures released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a number of parliamentary questions revealed 148 inmates had been released in error since May 2010 from jails in England and Wales. At the time Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Victims will be insulted that criminals are allowed to waltz out of jail so easily, and continue to live their lives scot free.'","Kirsty Walters was jailed for 876 days for breaking into buildings in Darwen .

"Thousands of revellers partied the night away oblivious to the fact that there were guardian angels watching over them to ensure their new year celebrations ran smoothly. About 60 dedicated volunteers patrolled Sydney streets offering water, lollipops and even pairs of thongs for those with tired feet from dancing the night away in high heels. What seems like a simple gesture is all part of a much bigger plan so that no parent has to endure the eternal heartache that Ralph and Kathy Kelly have for the past two and half years after tragically losing their son to a senseless act. Scroll down for video . About 60 dedicated volunteers patrolled Sydney streets offering water, lollipops and even pairs of thongs for those with tired feet from dancing the night away in high heels . Thomas Kelly was king hit on his first night out in Kings Cross in July 2012 . His parents Kathy and Ralph Kelly started a foundation in his honour to curb anti-social behaviour . At just 18-years-old, Thomas went out with his girlfriend and mates for his first night out in Sydney's Kings Cross when he was king hit in an unprovoked attack and killed by a complete stranger. His parents started a foundation in his honour, and in conjunction with the Salvation Army, volunteers hit the streets every Friday and Saturday night wearing Thomas' initials which stand for Take Kare - the last words Ralph and Kathy ever said to their son. A dedicated safe space is also provided for those who may have overindulged and are in need of a much-needed rest. Salvation Army lead organiser Nathan Brown said party-goers can charge their phones, drink water, use the angel's phones to contact family or friends to pick them up. 'They are feeling smashed, got sore feet and probably feeling a bit groggy in the head, so if we can help them feel a bit more comfortable or help get them home in the right direction I think it's the small stuff but hopefully that's intervening before things go to a really bad place,' he told A Current Affair. 'This is a brilliant project and I applaud Ralph for his determination in seeing it set up,' Mr Brown said. 'I think that Thomas would be blown away by the support this program is receiving and the volunteers who turn up to help serve and wear Thomas's name on their chest which is an honour for us - and I really hope we are doing him proud.' The safe space, which is also rolling out in Melbourne and Brisbane aswell, is funded by the NSW Governement and Sydney Council but there is only enough funding for a three-month trial. 'If it saves one persons' life it's definitely a service worth doing,'Ralph said. 'Most parents probably will have no idea that their parents were saves last night or the night before - it's really about making sure our kids get home safely. 'We are looking for an organisation to partner with us to fund this program to help our youth in the city and other areas around Sydney.' Sydney's designated safe space needs more funding to keep going after the three month trial . Thomas (pictured left in surveillance footage) with his friends on his first and last night out in Kings Cross . There has been no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at St Vincent's hospital in 2014 since the part of the new licensing restrictions which were introduced in February . His wife, Kathy, said her job is done if no other families have to suffer the way hers has  from a single cowardly punch. 'Life will never be the same - we miss Thomas deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do,' she said. Cass, 18, who is only just of legal age and doesn't drink much, volunteered to help patrol the streets on Wednesday night. 'It is a big task but I find because I'm so young I'm able to relate to people who are my age and kind of be like that mother hen,' she said. The foundation  successfully lobbied the NSW government to increase licensing restrictions across the heart of Sydney now they are turning to the federal government to curb alcohol advertising. 'We have seen no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at St Vincent's hospital for 2014 and that has to be a good thing and that's a part of the new laws that were introduced in February this year,' Ralph told ACA. 'Life will never be the same - we miss Thomas deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do,' says his mother Kathy . Salvation Army lead organiser Nathan Brown said party-goers can charge their phones, drink water, use the angel's phones to contact family or friends to pick them up from the safe space . But this doesn't mean that alcohol-fuelled violence is not still prevalent among young people. 'It's very sad we see it keep happening over and over again and I think that often makes you feel like throwing your arms up in the air and saying ""we've tried what more can we do?"" but we have to keep trying,' Kathy insists. The foundation is also working on changing the justice system to put the victim's rights ahead of the offenders. Thomas' killer was initially sentenced to just five years jail for manslaughter which was doubled to ten years following an appeal. 'There's this terrible injustice going on in this state as we have seen on multiple occasions and that really has to stop,' Ralph said. 'We can not let these offenders roam our streets and be let off time and time again.' If you are interested in helping to fund the program contact the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation .

"This is the hair-raising moment a fearless Brazilian puts three tarantulas in his mouth without even flinching. Daredevil Arteval Duarte scooped the spiders off the ground calmly placed them in his mouth in a revolting yet oddly fascinating stunt caught on camera. Arteval performed the stunt to bring attention to harmful deforestation in the Amazon and the threat it poses to native species and villagers. Arteval Duarte holds one of the tarantulas in his mouth while fumbling with the other two in his hands . The daredevil holds all three of the spiders as they wriggle about with their legs dangling out of his mouth . He has been nicknamed the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ thanks to similar antics involving snakes he has found in the wild. Recorded in the state of Para in northern Brazil, the footage shows Arteval handling two of the venomous spiders, including one that digs its retractable claws into his skin. He appears to be stacking them on top of each other when he reaches down and grabs a third as it attempts to scurry away. One of the arachnids gets loose as he tries to add the third to the tarantula sandwich, so he calmly shoves it into his mouth. The fearless Brazilian allows the spiders to crawl out on their own after holding them for a few moments . Arteval Duarte performed the stunt to bring attention to harmful deforestation in the Brazil's Amazon . He fumbles with the other two before tilting his head back and placing them into his mouth alongside their friend.

"A Florida man has hacked off his mother's head with an ax on New Year's Eve then dragged her body out to the garbage because she nagged him to do chores, police say. Christian Gomez, 23, confessed to beheading his mother Maria Suarez-Cassagne after a fight when she asked him to move boxes in the garage. Mario Gomez called 911 on about 7.30pm Wednesday and told dispatchers that his brother Christian had killed their mother and cut off her head, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. Deputies found Suarez-Cassagne's body outside the Oldsmar, Florida, home, near some garbage cans, according to the sheriff's office. Christian Gomez was angry before the killing over his mother's wish he do some chores with boxes, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told The Tampa Bay Times.

"Afghan army mortar rounds killed at least 20 civilians and wounded another 41 including women and children at a wedding in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, officials said today. General Mahmoud, deputy Commander of the Afghan military in the province, said artillery was fired from three directions at a village in Sangin district where the wedding was held last night. The rounds were fired during fierce fighting between army units and Taliban militia, though it is not clear whether the wedding was deliberately targeted. Scroll down for video . Army chiefs say they are investigating after mortar rounds fired from three different locations during fighting with Taliban forces landed on a wedding party, killing at least 20 and wounding 41 . Among the injured were women and children as a relative of the bride said his house had been hit and nine of his children were missing . A young girl wounded after army mortar rounds were fired at a family wedding party in the early hours of this morning is brought to a hospital in Lashkar Gah . General Mahmoud said: 'What we know so far is that our soldiers fired mortar rounds from three outposts but we do not know whether it was intentional. 'We have launched our investigation and will punish those who did this.' One of the bride's relatives told ABC Australia that an explosive shell hit his house, and that nine of his children were missing. Gul Pasha Bakhtiar, deputy provincial police chief, said 26 civilians, including women and children, were killed and 41 wounded by mortar shells fired from the army side. At least 3,188 Afghan civilians were killed in fighting with Taliban insurgents in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants, the United Nations said in a report last week. The numbers are embarrassing for U.S. and NATO commanders as they end their combat role in the country after 13 years, declaring mission complete and handing control of security back to the Afghan forces. The rounds were fired during fighting between Taliban militants and the military. An army spokesman said those responsible for firing would be punished . The wounded were taken to nearby Lashkar Gah hospital to be treated (pictured). The UN reported that 3,188 civilians died in fighting last year, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants . Maluk Khan, the brother of the bride, said there were hundreds of guests, including many women and children, when the mortar shells started landing. 'In minutes, our happy moments turned into a bloodbath,' Khan told Reuters from a hospital in Lashkar Gah where he and other relatives brought the wounded. For the first time, ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces became the main cause of civilian deaths in 2014. In previous years, IEDs, or roadside bombs, killed the most. Civilian deaths over the year to the end of November were up 19 percent over the same period last year and had already surpassed the previous high set in 2011, when 3,133 civilians were killed. Sangin witnessed one of the deadliest battles between Afghan security forces and Taliban last year. The deaths happened in a village in Sangin, a part of Afghanistan's fraught souther province of Helmand .","Another 41 wounded including women and children after explosives hit .

"A West Bromwich street has a new sign to properly honour Robert Edwin Phillips, a First World War Victoria Cross medal winner, after officials got his name wrong . His heroism in World War One was honoured with a Victoria Cross and earned his name a place in the military history books. Robert Phillips, then 21, risked his life dashing across open ground under heavy fire to rescue his wounded commanding officer, who also won the VC that same day, during a fierce battle with the Turks in Mesopotamia, now modern day Iraq, in 1917. But despite being his home town West Bromwich’s only winner of Britain’s highest award for gallantry, bungling officials got his name wrong when a new road was named after him in 2000 - by putting up a sign reading Edwin Phillips Drive. His great nephew Derek Pinches spotted the error - Edwin was his middle name but he was always known as Robert or Bob - when he visited the West Midlands town for the unveiling of a commemorative blue plaque at his brave relative’s childhood home nearby eight years ago. He contacted a local historian who branded the mix-up ‘shameful’ and a campaign was launched for a new, correct sign. A battle of a different sort then followed – as residents objected to the ‘inconvenience’ of having to re-register their details with utility companies and banks if the road name was changed. After renewed pressure to see Captain Phillips’ memory properly honoured in the centenary year of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, a new, larger sign will finally be officially unveiled today - but the road will still be called Edwin Phillips Drive. In smaller writing below, however, an explanatory panel adds: ‘Commemorating West Bromwich-born Capt. Robert Edwin Phillips V.C., 1895-1968. Awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War.’ Yesterday Dr Pinches, 70, a retired chartered electrical engineer, of Stafford, said: ‘I was a bit disturbed when I saw the old sign for the first time. But I’m more than happy now - the new sign is unusual, you don’t normally see one with an explanation underneath.’ Local historian John Price, who led the campaign backed by local MPs, said: ‘It was shameful they got his name wrong. Naming a road after someone is meant to be an honour, but that was more of a dishonour. Scroll down for video . ‘A lot of residents didn’t even know why their road was called what it was, but how could they when his name was wrong? It was my idea to add the panel. It’s terrific a compromise has been reached.’ Captain Phillips was serving with the 13th Battalion Royal Warwickshire Regiment when he won his VC. At the time he was a lieutenant. He survived the war, married twice, had three children and worked for the Inland Revenue. He had moved to Lostwithiel, Cornwall, by the time of his death aged 73 in 1968. After renewed pressure to see Captain Phillips’ memory properly honoured in the centenary year of the outbreak of the 1914-18 war, a new, larger sign will finally be officially unveiled today - but the road will still be called Edwin Phillips Drive . After the idea of changing the road’s name was proposed, 85 per cent of the street’s residents opposed it when surveyed. Jocyceline Stephenson, 71, a retired nurse who has lived in the road since the houses were built in 2000, said: ‘It would’ve caused so much trouble, with insurance, utilities, everything having to change, and so many people you would have to get in touch with. ‘You’d have all the problems of moving house, without actually going anywhere. ‘If they’d suggested it when we first came here maybe it would have been a bit different. But after 14 years it’s a bit much. None of us knew who Edwin Phillips was when we came here, which is no surprise if that wasn’t his real name. ‘I’m happy with the new sign. It explains who he was, and we keep our address.’ Street names can be suggested by the developer of a new street, but are ultimately chosen by councillors in the relevant ward, who take it in turns, in West Bromwich. Sandwell Council claim they have no idea how the mistake was made in the first place or who originally put forward the name Edwin Phillips Drive. A well-placed source said: ‘We have no records on it or why ‘Edwin Phillips’ was chosen, but it must have been after Captain Phillips. ‘The positive thing is that if it had been called Robert Phillips Drive from day one most people still wouldn’t have known who he was or why he’s important. Now everyone can see.’","Robert Phillips, then 21, risked his life to save his comrades in WWI .

Fourteen dogs have been adopted since the programme started last July. Jan Trantham, from Atlanta, and her husband, Will, adopted a two-year-old Shih Tzu named Jackson after falling in love with the dog when they checked in. She said: ‘Every time we went somewhere, one of us would say, “Let's go back to the hotel and see Jackson.” ‘I couldn't stop thinking about this dog.’ It is believed to be one of the first hotels in the world where guests can adopt an animal during their stay . Caren Ferris of Amherst, Massachusetts, and her husband, John, adopted a four-year-old terrier mix named Ginger after filling out paperwork and paying $175 in fees (approximately £110). They met the dog, wearing an ‘Adopt Me’ vest, as they were sat in the hotel bar. Caren said: ‘I got up to leave and told her goodbye. She sat up, looked me in the eye and kissed me on the lips. ‘So I called the shelter, thinking maybe we should adopt the dog.’ Caren Ferris and her husband, John (pictured), adopted Ginger after encountering the dog at the hotel . But it’s not that easy to take one of the dogs home. Charlie’s Angels has strict adoption standards, including a home visit. The programme has been such a hit that the hotel and pet rescue organisation hope it will become permanent and spread to other locations within the pet-friendly Aloft chain. Located in a mountain tourist mecca the hotel allows guests' pets to stay for free and hosts only one adoptable dog at a time. There are reserved spaces for the dogs, including the reception desk and roof, but they are not allowed to stay in guests’ rooms. The unique adoption programme is run by the hotel and Charlie’s Angels Animal Rescue . However they can go with guests to the restaurant or bar if they’re on a lead. Christine Kavanagh, Aloft’s director of sales, said: ‘We feel like we are saving lives. ‘The guests love it. It shows up on guest reviews and consumer surveys.’ She added: ‘We have a little playpen by the front desk. At times, there's a crowd around the pen because the dog is a conversation starter. ‘Our hotel draws people together so they can mix and mingle and maybe adopt a dog.’","Aloft hotel in North Carolina has partnered with animal rescue organisation .

"Three men have died as police warn of a batch of ecstasy described as red, triangular pills with a Superman logo printed on them (pictured) Three men have died and another was fighting for his life last night after taking drugs from a suspected rogue batch of ecstasy embossed with the Superman logo. Two New Year revellers lost their lives within hours of each other yesterday after swallowing the angular red pills stamped with the superhero’s ‘S’ symbol. Another man who is believed to have taken the same type of pill collapsed and died on Christmas Eve. A fourth man was last night in hospital in a critical condition. After the incidents – which all occurred in or near Ipswich – detectives appealed for clubbers who still had any of the tablets to hand them in. Police also asked for help to identify the dealer selling the drug.Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: ‘Taking drugs is linked to a great deal of harm and risk and it is not uncommon for people to suffer injury and even death from taking them. ‘But it’s pretty unusual to have so many tragic incidents in such a short space of time.’ Emergency services were called to a semi-detached house in Rendlesham, Suffolk, at 7.10am yesterday. Paramedics treated a seriously ill man but he died at the two-bedroom property on a new-build estate. Neighbours said a young couple in their 20s moved into the rented house around three months ago. A man was pronounced dead at a home in Chestnut Close in Rendlesham. The home involved was on the left hand side of the semi-detached property . Police believe the men, who were all in their twenties, may have been involved with the drug after emergency services were called to three addresses across Ipswich in the space of one week . A man was pronounced dead at Provan Court, Ipswich (pictured) shortly after 7am yesterday morning . A resident, who asked not to be named, described seeing an ambulance and a police car outside the property. ‘They were coming and going in and out of the house,’ he said. ‘It is all very sad. Normally this close is very quiet. There are a lot of semi-retired people here.’ In a second 999 call yesterday at 9.40am, emergency staff were told that a man was ill in a ground-floor flat in Ipswich on another new-build estate. He died at the two-bedroom property despite the efforts of paramedics. An air ambulance flew to the scene and a second man was taken to hospital, where he remained last night. Neighbours said an Eastern European man believed to be the boyfriend of the woman living there had moved in about six months ago. Ecstasy is considered pure when made with a strong concentration of the chemical MDMA. PMA, or PMMA, has a similar effect, but is much more poisonous. The effects of PMA, which include heightened intensity of emotions and alertness, take longer to set in than those of MDMA. As such drug-takers are more likely to double their dosage under the mistaken impression the substance is having no effect on them. According to Frank, a drug counselling organisation, a quarter of a tablet containing PMA is enough to kill. It can cause body temperatures to soar to fatal levels, bring on muscle spasms and sees blood pressure increase. No one was at the flat last night. A neighbour said: ‘I looked out of my window at about 10am and saw two ambulances and a paramedic car along with a police car. ‘The air ambulance landed behind the flats. The young lady who lives in the flat came out in a distraught state. ‘She sat in a police car with an officer and then some friends came to pick her up. It is just such an awful tragedy.’ The man who died on Christmas Eve was also from Ipswich. Emergency services were called to his address at around 5.30pm. A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said the two men who died yesterday both suffered cardiac arrests. Similar shaped pills have been sold in the Netherlands where the authorities said they had a ‘very high dose of the dangerous substance PMA’. The effects are delayed, leading many users to assume the pills are weak and take more. Life-threatening symptoms can occur hours later, including increased heart rate and very high body temperature. The charity DrugScope warned there had been an increase in ecstasy-related deaths in the past five years. A spokesman said: ‘You can’t tell the dosage or content of a pill just by looking at it.’ In 2013 a batch of ecstasy pills with a Rolex symbol emblazoned on them circulated around Scotland. They were found to contain a lethal dosage of PMA, with several club-goers dying after taking the drug .","Two men died at separate addresses in Ipswich yesterday morning .

"Like many youngsters, Ellie Clark loves messing around on a piano. At four, she has already mastered Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, her favourite nursery rhyme, an achievement of which her parents are understandably proud. But what makes Ellie’s musical ability all the more impressive is that she can’t see the keys – because she is blind. Scroll down for video . Ellie Clark, aged four, who despite being registered as blind, has learned to play the piano and her favourite nursery rhyme 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' At just seven months old she was diagnosed with Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, a condition which means her retina doesn’t process light. However her parents Kate and Chris were determined that the disability was not going to hinder her development, and introduced her to the piano as a toddler. ‘When we got the piano she was a natural,’ said Mr Clark, 31, who works as a systems analyst. ‘It gave her a way to communicate. As well as learning to play the piano, Ellie is also learning how to read and write in braille and already knows the alphabet . Her parents Kate and Chris were determined that the disability was not going to hinder her development . 'Social interaction is very difficult for a visually impaired child but this gives her something she can relate to.’ Ellie enjoyed playing around with the piano but when formal lessons began a year ago she was more hesitant. ‘It was a couple of months before Ellie gave it a go,’ said Mrs Clark, 30, who gave birth to their second daughter, Kiera May, last month. ‘At first she would just listen or sing along. She has come so far in a year – she has absolutely perfect pitch.’ Ellie plays in the garden with her father in the family home in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire. She was diagnosed with a retina disorder at the age of seven months . Mrs Clark, who works for charity Blind Children UK, said Ellie now gathers the family round the piano so she can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. ‘It is definitely something that has helped her confidence,’ she said at the family home in Sawtry, Cambridgeshire. ‘And the structure of lessons will help her with school work in the future.’ Ellie has also been learning Braille for the past six months and already knows the alphabet. Her parents are also taking lessons so they can help her through her education. LCA is a degenerative condition, though it is hoped gene therapy could help those affected in future.","Ellie Clark diagnosed with Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis aged 7 months .

"A passenger aboard AirAsia Flight 8501 became the first victim of the crash to be returned to her family today, one of many painful reunions to come, as search crews struggled against wind and heavy rain to find more than 150 people still missing. Police said body B001 was identified as Hayati Lutfiah Hamid by surgical scars, fingerprints, a necklace containing her initials, and a red name badge pinned to her uniform. Her body, in a dark casket topped with flowers, was handed over to her family at a brief ceremony at a police hospital in Surabaya. A family member cried as she put both hands on the coffin. Search teams have recovered two more bodies this morning, bringing the total to nine, after they resumed operations following bad weather which has so far hampered efforts. Crews have been unable to investigate an object resting 100-165ft below the sea which is believed to be the remains of the Airbus A320-200, as officials have warned it could be a week before the plane's black box recorder can be recovered. Scroll down for video . The body of Hayati Lutfiah, the first victim of the AirAsia crash to be identified, is handed over to weeping relatives at Surabaya police hospital where the plane initially took off . The body, previously known as B001, was identified by fingerprints, a necklace with her initials on it, surgical scars described by the family, and an identification card found on the corpse . A relative weeps as the first victim of the AirAsia crash to be identified is handed over. Search teams have warned this morning that it could take a week to recover the plane's black box recorder . After a Muslim cleric had said a prayer over Ms Hamid's body, the casket was immediately taken to a village and lowered into a muddy grave, as Islamic traditions require bodies to be buried quickly. An imam said a simple prayer as about 150 people gathered in the drizzling rain, and red flowers were sprinkled over the mound of wet dirt with a small white tombstone. So far nine bodies have been found from Flight 8501 out of the 162 passengers and crew that were on board when the plane disappeared from radar. The aircraft disappeared on Sunday while on route between Surabaya to Singapore shortly after the pilot radioed to report stormy conditions. Workers began finding wreckage on Tuesday, with nine bodies pulled from the water near Borneo Island, including one wearing a life jacket and two others reported to be holding hands. A minesweeper boat and private survey ship have since located a large object beneath the waves which officials believe to be the plane, though no 'pings' from its black boxes have be detected so far. The remains of Hayati Lutfiah were handed over today (left) as rescue workers returned to the sea of Indonesia to search for more bodies. So far nine victims have been recovered (right) Dive teams have promised an 'all out effort' to find more bodies today after rough seas and dire weather halted earlier efforts to investigate potential wreckage on the seabed . It is the middle of Indonesia's rainy season, so strong winds, heavy rains, and rough seas have so far prevented anyone from descending to inspect the object. Officials said that divers would not be sent underwater until there was a confirmed target. Indonesia air force spokesman Rear Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto said his men are 'focusing on finding the body of the plane,' adding: 'There was something like a dark shadow once seen from a plane, but it cannot yet be proven as wreckage.' Frogman commander Lieutenant Edi Tirkayasa said the weather was making the operation especially difficult. Search teams have identified an object resting 100-165ft under the sea, which they believe to be the wreckage of the Airbust A320-200, but divers have been unable to inspect it because of dire weather conditions . Investigators are still not clear what caused the plane to crash, and say that it could be a week before the black box recorder, which contains essential data and recordings from the cockpit, is found . The bodies were found floating in the sea near Borneo Island, and included an air stewardess dressed in uniform, one person wearing a life jacket, and another pair reported to be holding hands . He said: 'What is most difficult is finding the location where the plane fell - checking whether the aircraft is really there. 'This is very difficult even with sophisticated equipment. With weather like this, who knows? We are still hopeful and optimistic that they'll find it. They must.' It is still unclear what brought the plane down about halfway into its two-hour flight, though investigators are working on a theory that the plane stalled as it climbed steeply to avoid a storm. During the pilot's last radio call he sough permission to climb above rough weather but was denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the plane vanished without issuing a distress call. The bodies are being taken to Surabaya (pictured), where the AirAsia flight originally took off, where many of the families have gathered and religious services are being held . Officials say it is likely that there are scores of bodies still trapped in the wreckage of the plane, but say they have not confirmed where the plane is and will not send divers in until they have a target . The cockpit-voice and flight-data recorders, or black boxes, hold data that will help investigators determine the cause of the crash. Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas in Australia said there's a good chance the plane hit the water largely intact, and that many passengers remain inside it. He added that bodies recovered so far would have come out with a breach in the fuselage. 'But most passengers still should have had their seat belts on, particularly as the plane was going into weather. The captain would have still had the seat belt sign on.' Items recovered so far include a life jacket, an emergency exit door, an inflatable slide, children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food. Bodies removed from the water are being sent to Pangkalan Bun, a town near to Borneo Island, before being transported to Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, where Flight 8501 took off. Many family members have remained at the Surabaya airport since getting word that the plane disappeared. Dive teams are on standby to search any wreckage for more bodies, but say it is extremely difficult to identify where exactly on the seabed the plane is, even with sophisticated equipment . The crash happened in the midst of Indonesia's rainy season, meaning strong winds, rough seas, and heavy rains are making search efforts especially difficult . Workers have also recovered several items that they believe are from the plane, including a life jacket, emergency exit door, and emergency slide (pictured) Other items found adrift in the ocean include children's shoes, a blue suitcase and backpacks filled with food . 'Help us, God, to move forward, even though we are surrounded by darkness,' the Rev. Philip Mantofa of Mawar Sharon Church about 100 relatives gathered in an airport waiting room Wednesday. About 40 members of Mantofa's church died in the crash. 'Some things do not make sense to us, but God is bigger than all this. Our God is not evil.' Officials have not announced the identities of the nine bodies recovered. Relatives have given blood for DNA tests and submitted photos of their loved ones, along with identifying information such as tattoos or birthmarks that could help make the process easier. Indonesia is using a minesweeper craft and a private search vessel which have identified a large 'shadow' on the seabed which investigators believe to be the wreckage . While search teams have identified a large object they believe could be the wreckage, they say they have yet to pick up any 'pings' coming from the black box recorder . Richard Shears . The AirAsia jet which plunged into the Java Sea rose up as fast as a fighter jet and then dropped almost vertically into the sea as if being thrust down by a giant hand, crash experts agreed today. Their conclusion is that the Airbus 320-200 was in the grip of weather so freakishly extreme that there was nothing the pilots could do to save the jet and all 162 people on board. The plane behaved in ways 'bordering on the edge of logic,' Indonesian aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said after examining figures leaked from the official air crash investigation team. He said the jet climbed at a speed that would have been impossible for the pilot to have achieved - and then plunged straight down 'like a piece of metal being thrown down. 'It's really hard to comprehend…the way it goes down is bordering on the edge of logic.' Australian aviation expert, Peter Marosszeky, from the University of NSW, told the Sydney Morning Herald that, in contrast, he was baffled by the extremely low speed of the descent - as low as 61 knots - which would suggest the plane was heading almost straight down, explaining why it has been found in water just 10km from its last point of radar contact. Both experts are in agreement that the jet went down almost vertically - and they also concluded that a freak weather pattern that placed the aircraft under extraordinary forces was to blame for its plight.","First victim of AirAsia Flight 8501 has been identified by medical teams .

"A wealthy black woman was addicted to drugs when she shot a white doctor dead in a crime that rocked a Deep South town more than 60 years ago, a new documentary has claimed. In August 1952, Ruby McCollum walked through the 'colored entrance' of Clifford Leeroy Adam's surgery in Live Oak, Florida, and gunned him down. During her murder trial she claimed that the doctor forced her into a long sexual relationship that resulted in an unwanted child. More than 60 years after the slaying, it has been claimed that the relationship was consensual and McCollum killed Dr Adams because she lost her mind through drug addition. However it is unclear as to whether she injected the substance herself or Adams administered it so he could take advantage of her. Scroll down for video . Ruby McCollum walked into Clifford Leeroy Adams' Live Oak, Florida surgery, and shot him dead in August 1952. She told the court at her murder trial that she killed him because he had forced her into a long sexual relationship which resulted in an unwanted child . An all-white, all-male jury sentenced McCollum to death for the crime, but she avoided the death penalty by way of insanity. It stirred racial tensions in Jim Crow-era Suwannee County, at a time when robed Ku Klux Klansmen regularly marched and lynchings were common. Prosecutors told the all-white, all-male jury that McCollum shot the doctor after an argument over a $116 bill. Yet she was the wife of a prominent businessman who ran a gambling outfit, and she was carrying around $1,800 in her purse on the day she shot him. She testified that Adams, the son of a powerful political family who was known around town for caring for the poor, had forced her into a long sexual relationship that resulted in an unwanted child, and that she shot him in self-defense. The case is the focus of a new documentary titled 'You Belong To Me,' which compiles a decade of research and interviews with family members, reopening old wounds in this small Southern town nestled amid farm country. An all-white, all-male jury sentenced McCollum (pictured walking to court in 1952) to death for her crime. However she avoided the death penalty after a judge ruled that she was insane . 'Both families were negatively affected by this tragedy. A doctor and a wealthy powerful couple in town were gone in a flash,' said Eric Musgrove, a local historian and court clerk who give talks on the case to schools and other groups. McCollum was found guilty and sentenced to death at her first trial but later avoided execution by winning an insanity plea. She was eventually moved to a state mental hospital, and then freed in 1974 after the state's high court found her legally insane. She died in 1992. The sordid tale of sex, race and violence has inspired others to tell McCollum's story, with different conclusions about her motivations. William Bradford Huie's book 'The Crime of Ruby McCollum' inspired the new documentary. In his telling, McCollum's relationship with Adams was consensual, and she became a drug addict and killed him after losing her mind. McCollum had been receiving injections of some kind of intoxicating substance from Adams, but it was unclear whether she sought them out or he used the drugs to take advantage of her. Alonzo Philmore, left, Harry Campbell, center, and Suwannee County NAACP president Leslie White stand in front of their church in Live Oak, Florida. Philmore believes there is still racial friction between 'old folks' living in the community that was once frequented by Klu Klux Klann marches and lynchings . Huie's conclusion didn't seem right to the documentary's producer Jude Hagin, a Florida film commissioner who discovered Huie's book 14 years ago. Family members told Hagin and the film's researchers that McCollum was well-educated and prosperous and that the family believed the doctor had used drugs to control her. 'I could not wrap my head around the story, that a woman of Ruby McCollum's stature ... would see anything that could be a good future for her to have a sexual relationship with a white doctor,' Hagin said. 'I wanted to get family members on both sides to tell their side of the story,' Hagin said. Trial transcripts from 1952 show that Ruby told jurors that she felt pressure to do what Adams told her to do, though the jury was told to disregard much of her testimony after the judge allowed dozens of objections from prosecutors. 'I was just so worried, I had to either yield or maybe die, I suppose that was what would happen,' Ruby McCollum testified, according to trial transcripts. The film's researchers also found that Adams had a dark side that jurors never saw. In Live Oak, he was a respected doctor who helped the poor — but records show he forged letters of recommendations to get into medical school. Also, McCollum testified that Adams had a friend deliver the baby they had together and that she never received a birth certificate. He needed to hide the baby because it was around the time he was running for state senate. Suwannee County court clerk and local historian Eric Musgrove stands in front of the county courthouse in Live Oak, Florida. The story behind Rugby McCollum has continued to stir racial tensions in the community for more than 60 years . Sam McCollum Jr., one of McCollum's children, told the filmmakers that a white doctor in the Jim Crow-era South was akin to a 'God in the community.' In the black community, the McCollum case was spoken of only in whispers, said Tameka Hobbs, a history professor at Florida Memorial University who grew up in Live Oak. 'With Ruby there was so much shame in the black community because of the sexual liaison, they really did not want to talk about it,' Hobbs said. 'You Belong to Me' doesn't give viewers a definitive conclusion, but it sheds new light on the case and has sparked new discussions about race. Musgrove, the local historian, is receiving more requests for presentations on the case. Hagin hopes the documentary helps inspire funding for a feature film, which actor James Brolin has signed on to direct, should they get the money. Live Oak today is a much different town than the one where Adams was slain, but the ornate 1904 courthouse where the McCollum trial took place is still the largest building around. And issues of race still make headlines. The Southern Poverty Law Center in 2012 filed a federal civil rights complaint after a study found black children in Suwannee County and four other Florida school districts were punished or arrested at a higher rate than other students. Some in Live Oak's black community say that the case is still something older generations won't talk about but that they see hope in new generations. 'Younger kids here do have better relationships with whites today,' said Alonzo Philmore, former president of the NAACP's local chapter. 'But with older folks there's still a great divide.'","Ruby McCollum gunned down Clifford Leeroy Adams in August, 1952 .

"It's not unusual for companies to take advantage of Sydney's New Year's Eve revellers by charging inflated prices - but one Uber customer has been hit with a massive $213 fare for a ride home that should cost just $50. Uber, the app-based car service, has come under fire for charging  more than three times the normal fare for a ride home on New Year's Eve, and customer Jade Wilkes was shocked when she woke up on January 1st to discover she had fallen victim to the ridiculous price hike. Ms Wilkes booked a 14 kilometre ride from Sydney's CBD to Coogee, a ride which would normally cost around $50 in Uber's luxury 'Black' vehicle, only a quarter of the $213 she was charged in the early hours of January 1st. Scroll down for video . Jade Wilkes was charged $213 for a 14-kilometre ride home from Sydney's CBD to Coogee on New Years . The app, which connects people with available drivers in their area, warned Ms Wilkes that the fare would be calculated at 3.1 times the normal rate, reportedThe Sydney Morning Herald. She accepted the fare multiple with Uber Black at 2am after entering her starting point, and despite the company's promise of 'no surprises', claims not provided with an estimated price. 'The [surge pricing notice] just came up without my having to enter a destination, so I didn't have a fare estimate,' Ms Wilkes said. She said that the app, which requires a credit card on file for cashless payment, only provided her with a receipt at the end of the trip, totaling a hefty $213. Katie, a spokesperson for Uber, said that a fare estimate was always available in the app, regardless of whether there was a 'surge' in action or not. 'A splash screen comes up when surge is on, and customers have to accept the number and type it back in,' Kate said. 'You can definitely get the fare estimate, there are multiple ways to acknowledge and confirm the fare,' she said. Kate said that surge was a tool to encourage more drivers to the area, and that as soon as demand for vehicles and supply evened out, surge would disappear and pricing would return to normal. Ms Wilkes said that the email she received stated that 'the normal fare was $68.90, but I made the same journey for $35 in a taxi today,' she said. Labeling the fare for the 23-minute journey 'ridiculous', Ms Wilkes contacted the driver of the car only to be told that any issues with the fare had to be taken up with the company. The car service warned people there would be a price surge over New Years Eve . Uber emailed customers to notify them that there would be an expected surge of 3.1 . Ms Wilkes sent an email to the company, but so far has reportedly not achieved a resolution. Uber previously came under fire for offering inflated rates for lifts home from Sydney's CBD during the Martin Place siege, with customers reporting fares of more than $100. With police calls to evacuate the area, demand for Uber outstripped its supply of cars, kicking in an automatic price surge to attract more cars to the area. During the early stages of the siege, Uber's fares reportedly jumped fourfold, and the company later apologised in a statement. 'The events of last week in Sydney were upsetting for the whole community and we are truly sorry for any concern that our process may have added.' The company said it wanted to help get as many people as possible out of the CBD, but it communicated its intentions poorly, leading to misunderstanding about its motives. 'We didn't stop surge pricing immediately,' Uber said in its statement. 'This was the wrong decision.' But the company later reversed course, offering free rides out of the city centre and refunds to those hit by higher prices. 'It's unfortunate that the perception is that Uber did something against the interests of the public,' Uber said. 'We certainly did not intend to.' The company, which launched in Sydney in 2012, warned potential customers of peak periods over New Years Eve, recommending split fares and car shares for revelers to get home safely without breaking the bank. The company's website encourages customers to be aware of their estimated fare before accepting rides, stating that 'Surprises aren’t for everyone. That’s why we’ll always notify you in BIG, BOLD print if surge pricing is in effect and ask you to manually type in the higher multiple before you can request a ride.' 'Enter your drop off location and tap “Fare Quote” to get an estimate of the cost of your ride.' However, Ms Wilkes said she never received the estimate, and would have rethought her travel options had she known how much her trip would cost.

The company's website encourages customers to be aware of their estimated fare before accepting rides, stating that 'Surprises aren’t for everyone' Ms Wilkes said she never received the estimate, and would have rethought her travel options had she known how much her trip would cost . 'I told them that I wasn't given a cost estimate when I got in, and I never would have gotten into the car if I'd known it would be that much. I would have taken a taxi. I mean, that's basically the cost of a flight,' she said. Ms Wilkes was one of thousands who were expected to participate in ride-sharing over New Years Eve, despite Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian reminding Sydneysiders that the activity is illegal. 'Here in NSW we have been very clear that it is illegal for drivers to participate in what we call 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX,' Ms Berejiklian told The Sydney Morning Herald. The service allows for unaccredited drivers to offers rides, flouting strict laws in NSW against drivers in unlicensed vehicles offering transport. 11% of Sydney's population is thought to have participated in the scheme, sparking thousands of dollars in fines and nearly a dozen court attendance notices to UberX drivers. 'This is a complex issue and cities all around the world are grappling with it as we speak,' said Ms Berejiklian. Uber has been contacted for comment.","Jade Wilkes ordered ride on New Year's Eve using app-based service Uber .

"With its rolling hills and stone bridge over a picturesque stream it seems like the perfect reason for a day trip to the Welsh countryside. Only visitors taking up the trip to the Brecon Beacons, advertised by Britain's national tourism board, would be disappointed as the image used is actually of the Lake District - more than 200 miles away. The bungle was discovered on the Visit Britain website where a photograph of Skiddaw from Ashness Bridge in Keswick was used to advertise trips from Cardiff to the Brecon Beacons national park. Visit Britain, the national tourism board, has been using a picture of the Lake District - 250 miles away - to promote tours to the Brecon Beacons on a website advert aimed at day trips for American visitors . It has led to criticism of the large tourism board, responsible for promoting British trips worldwide, for a poor knowledge of geography. Anyone taking up the $79 day trip would have found themselves at least a five hour drive away from the actual scene. The photograph was used to promote the day trip for visitors from America. The description read: 'Tour stops include: Brecon Beacons National Park - see the stunning lakes, waterfalls and peaks of this world-famous site.' The National Trust describes Ashness Bridge as 'the most photographed packhorse bridge in the Lake District'. Greg Stephenson, Cumbria Tourism's PR Manager, said: 'It's flattering that VisitBritain have used Surprise View, Ashness Bridge, to portray the Welsh countryside, after all the Lake District's offering is the best in the world. The image of Ashness Bridge in Keswick is an iconic and popular image used of the Lake District park . The actual Brecon Beacons park differs widely from the image used in the Visit Britain ad of Keswick . 'I know historically the two areas were closely tied. Perhaps we should reunite and create a greater Cumbria to assist our friends in London, especially as they don't seem to know their geography.' Hotelier Jonathan Denby, president of the Lakes Hospitality Association, added: 'This is what happens when you have a Welshman in charge of Cumbria Tourism - congratulations to Ian for getting into the psyche of Welsh tourism.' A spokesman for VisitBritain described it as a 'glitch' with how photographs had been tagged, which meant it had appeared as a Brecon Beacons image. It has now been replaced, he said.","Visit Britain is the national tourism board promoting trips to UK worldwide .

"Armed raiders burst in to a pizza delivery shop demanding cash – and escaped with a safe which contained only 99p. The masked men sneaked in to the shop, which is a part of a delivery-only chain, and threatened staff. The workers were left shaken, but unharmed, by the raid. Armed raiders targeted The Fat Pizza in the Charfleets Industrial Estate in Canvey Island, Essex, pictured . The owner, who did not wish to be named, was in the shop at the time. He said: ‘There was a couple of them armed with knives and an adjustable spanner. ‘They just wanted money and got away with the safe.’ He has increased security since the break-in on December 23, and only reopened The Fat Pizza on the Charfleets Industrial Estate, Canvey Island, Essex, earlier this week. An Essex Police spokesman said that they were searching for two men who may have been seen loitering in the area and who left the scene in a dark vehicle. Late last year, a prolific jewellery thief who snatched nearly a quarter of a million pounds worth of valuables from London shops was caught after leaving behind his mobile phone with a selfie as a screensaver at the scene of a crime. Mechanic Germain Ibrahim Fofana, 27, who blew the money gambling in casinos, received five-and-a-half years imprisonment for a total of forty-five offences.

He also pleaded guilty to burgling Baden Powell House hostel in Queensgate, South Kensington on January 7; February 20 and April 10. He stole luggage, cameras, an iPod, and an Apple Mac worth at least £1,580. Fofana had asked for another twenty-six similar theft offences to be taken into consideration, plus five burglaries from London hostels and one burglary of a hotel.","Raiders targeted a The Fat Pizza restaurant in an Essex industrial estate .

"Home ownership in Britain is set to fall below France for the first time after the boom in buy-to-let lending in the last decade. More and more Britons have been pushed into the rental sector, allowing our continental neighbours to catch up, according to latest figures. The fall in UK home ownership was worsened by the 2008 financial crisis and has undone much of the work by Margaret Thatcher towards her dream of a property-owning democracy. New research has found that the level of home ownership in Britain has dropped by five percent in a decade . Home ownership figures were last this low in Britain back in 1988 with much new stock bought by landlords . The figures from the EU’s official statistics bureau Eurostat show that home ownership in Britain was 64.6 per cent in 2013 compared to 70 per cent in 2005. The latest rate is only marginally above France’s 64.3 per cent while the EU average is 70 per cent. Romania tops the table with 95.6 per cent of homes being owner-occupied. On current trajectories, Britain will have fallen behind France in 2014 for the first time since Eurostat started compiling the figures in 1995. Home ownership was last this low in 1988, said separate data from the Department for Communities and Local Government. The vast majority of new housing since 2000 has been bought by landlords, it added. Some 2.5million homes built from 2000-2012 went to the private rented sector with only 400,000 bought by occupiers. The dramatic changes in the housing market have also been attributed to tougher mortgage standards making it harder for owner-occupiers to borrow. Many buy-to-let borrowers qualify for interest-only loans and can offset interest against tax. Of the 2.6million additional homes in the private rented sector since 1996, 1.4million have been financed by buy-to-let loans, said the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. It has forecast that in two decades, if trends continue, most Britons will be renting for the first time since the early 1970s. Tory MP Mark Garnier, who is a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘If people have given up on the aspiration of owning their own property, that is a big deal. Prices have got outside of people’s reach.’ Kate Barker, a former Bank of England rate-setter, said landlords tend to have larger deposits or other properties from which to draw funds. ‘If you come from a family that hasn’t got a history of home ownership, it’s getting harder to get on the ladder,’ she warned.","EU figures show home ownership levels are at their lowest since 1988 .

"Tony Blair attracted the ‘wrong people’ to support Labour, a key ally of Ed Miliband claimed last night. In an extraordinary intervention, Neal Lawson said the record election victories won by New Labour were ‘too big’, and had forced the party to pander to the middle classes while in government in order to keep their support. Mr Lawson, a former adviser to Gordon Brown, is chairman of Labour’s Compass group, which backed Mr Miliband in the leadership battle with his Blairite brother David. Scroll down for video . Neal Lawson has said that Tony Blair, pictured in 1997, attracted the 'wrong people' to support Labour, saying their record election victories were 'too big' Attacking New Labour on the Guardian newspaper website, Mr Lawson argued Mr Blair’s approach had squeezed Labour voters’ needs and fuelled Ukip’s growth. His remarks came as the same website yesterday published an article by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in which he claimed that Labour was again in the ‘centre ground’ of British politics. In Mr Lawson’s open letter to Mr Blair he said the ‘problem’ was epitomised by the defeat of Tory Michael Portillo in 1997. ‘Oh, how we cheered later that morning,’ he said. ‘But in hindsight the wrong people were voting Labour. The tent was too big and you spent the next ten years trying to keep the wrong people in it – the very rich, for example. What meaningful project includes everyone?’ The comments follow a warning from Mr Blair that Labour was on course to lose the election because Ed  Miliband, pictured, had dragged his party too far left . Mr Lawson said Labour’s 1997 majority was’ too big’, adding: ‘You remark, almost with pride, that the population hasn’t shifted to the Left – well, what exactly was your job as a political leader supposed to be about then? ‘Had you not been so disdainful about anything remotely old Labour there would probably be much less support for Ukip now.’ The comments follow a warning from Mr Blair that Labour was on course to lose the election because Mr Miliband had dragged his party too far Left. Mr Blair later withdrew his remarks, saying he had been misinterpreted. Mr Lawson’s diatribe came under immediate attack. Former minister John Spellar joked that Mr Lawson sometimes appeared to be ‘an agent sent to discredit the Left’. And former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said: ‘Here’s my prediction for 2015 – the wrong people voting Labour will not be a problem for Ed Miliband.’ In his claim to the ‘centre ground’, Mr Balls said it was now the Tories who were adopting an ‘extreme and ideological’ approach by pledging to clear Britain’s deficit through cuts, rather than tax rises. Vowing to also cut the deficit, he said: ‘Last month’s Autumn Statement was the day Chancellor George Osborne ceded the political centre ground to Labour.’","Miliband ally Neal Lawson said New Labour victories were 'too big'

"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo kicked off his second term on Thursday, saying he is governing in 'troubled times' and that education, the economy and rebuilding public trust in law enforcement would top his agenda over the next four years. He lauded his first term as a success, saying the state now has a record 7.6 million jobs, a $5 billion budget surplus, effective and smart gun control laws, marriage equality and expanded healthcare that reaches 1.5 million people. 'Even with all we have done our task is far from complete,' Cuomo said in his inaugural address at the newly opened 1 World Trade Center in Manhattan, built after the twin towers of New York's original World Trade Center were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks.

He did not mention Garner by name, but said public trust in law enforcement needs to be rebuilt 'both in perception and reality.' The city has been beset by protests since the grand jury decision in November. Weeks later, a gunman vowing to avenge Garner's death killed two NYPD officers sitting in their patrol car.

"Slowly but surely, this is the moment that brave cerebal palsy sufferer Imogen Kelly took her first steps. The four-year-old was unable to unaided walk  before she underwent a life-changing operation which will hopefully see her able to walk by herself. Little Imogen was one of just 120 youngsters aged between three and nine chosen for the procedure as part of a pioneering NHS trial. The Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy involved surgeons snipping damaged nerves in her spine. Imogen Kelly, four, who suffers from cerebal palsy, takes her first steps after undergoing a life changing operation . Just weeks after the operation, Imogen has started getting around with the support of crutches and has delighted her family and doctors with her strong progress. Her mother Sarah Rogers, 24, said the operation has already proved life-changing and is like a dream come true. Imogen can now wear normal shoes for the first time and has come off painkillers and muscle-relaxing drugs. A £30,000 fund originally collected by generous locals for the Imogen's Wish appeal to fund the surgery privately is now being used to pay for the intense physiotherapy she will need to give her the best chance of thriving. Imogen was born prematurely and the cerebral palsy affects the left side of her body. She could previously take steps with the help of a walker, but her family wanted to give her every opportunity to live a full life and walk completely unaided. Little Imogen was one of just 120 youngsters aged between three and nine chosen for the Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure as part of a pioneering NHS trial . Little Imogen, pictured with her mother Sarah, who said the described the difference in her daughter as 'amazing' Imogen's mother said the future is now bright for her daughter and with extensive physiotherapy she will reach her goal . Mrs Kelly, of Horden, Co Durham, said: 'She's a little star. The difference in her is amazing, just after a matter weeks. 'At the minute she describes her legs as being new and like jelly but is working hard at physio to build up the muscle to prepare her for independent walking. 'She can now also wear shoes that fit her feet, instantly becoming flat after surgery and this is a first for Imogen and she is so pleased.' Imogen was chosen to undergo the operation after passing a series of tests. The NHS had said it was putting a halt to carrying out the procedure on a routine basis last year, before then agreeing to run a trial. Imogen's family had already started to raise cash so it could be done privately, with the funds now freed to support her recovery. Sarah added: 'She herself wants to thank everyone who's helped raise funds and helped her to reach her dream. 'The future is very bright for Imogen and we all as a family feel very grateful and blessed for the opportunity she has been given.

Pictured left is a tribute being shared by family and friends and right is an image of him and a friend . Train tracks: This is the crossing where the tragic incident occurred, costing the 18-year-old his life . Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast . Perhaps most tragically, his Facebook profile is filled with pictures of him cuddling a baby girl, with a collage featuring the caption: 'Daddy's lil gurl'. A devastated relative wrote on Facebook: 'It warms my heart knowing a piece of you has been left with us through your babies.' '(And) to know they have an angel called Dad to watch over them (and) guide them throughout their journey of life'. An angry group of people, which police said included Mr Simon's father, attacked emergency services workers who arrived at the morbid scene to try and save his life. Paramedics who were first to the scene to try and revive the injured teen were pushed, verbally abused and blocked. Members of the crowd hurled rocks at the ambulance and police said the father smashed the vehicle's windscreen. The crowd also hurled rocks at the train driver and the first police officers on the scene, who were forced to take cover inside the driver's cabin and call for reinforcements.

"Plans for a seven-day NHS are 'not realistic' and would require more funding, a leading doctors have warned. The proposal to make NHS hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services, including elective operations and diagnostic tests, seven days a week was first announced in 2013 by NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh. He suggested hospital trusts could be contractually obliged to do so and face fines for breaches. But Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, said offering services on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week. Plans to make hospitals offer a full range of healthcare services seven days a week are 'not realistic' and would require more funding, the British Medical Union (BMA) has warned . This would amount to a 'diversion of services' rather than an expansion, he said. Dr Porter, speaking to the Guardian, said: 'It's not realistic to carry on doing what we are doing at the moment and then add a new service on top of it within existing resources. More money is vital. 'If the decision (by a hospital) is taken to put half a dozen outpatient clinics on a Sunday afternoon then they have to be taken from somewhere else - that is, they won't be on on a particular day during the week. 'That's the inescapable reality of doing this within existing resources, but politicians' vision doesn't go into that sort of detail.' The criticism was made following the BMA's submission to the Doctors and Dentists Review Body, which advises the Government on doctors' pay. Writing in its submission, the BMA warned: 'Ill-thought-through implementation could threaten both the standard of service patients receive and the viability of the service. 'We believe that pursuing an ill-informed seven-day service model would be at best wasteful for the NHS – and at worst threaten patient safety.' In July last year, Sir Bruce said making the NHS provide seven-day services was his 'number one priority'. His review came after statistics showed there was a higher mortality rate at weekends - as high as 11 per cent on a Saturday and 16 per cent on a Sunday, according to an analysis of more than 14 million hospital admissions in 2009/10. BMA chairman Dr Mark Porter (pictured) said putting on services on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to them being cancelled during the week, leading to a 'diversion' rather than an expansion of services . The changes could cost around £1 billion to implement with routine surgery for minor conditions, such as hernias, as well as blood tests, X-rays, ultrasounds and MRI scans to be carried out at weekends. Speaking in December 2013, Sir Bruce, said: 'It seems strange in many ways that we should start to wind down on a Friday afternoon and warm up on a Sunday while operating theatres are empty, outpatient clinics echo, expensive diagnostic kit isn't being used and in the meantime people are waiting for diagnosis and treatment.' Last year David Cameron also promised that everyone would have access to a family doctor seven days a week by the end of the decade. He wants GPs to open for up to 12 hours every day by 2020 to relieve pressure on accident and emergency units, which are becoming overwhelmed due to dissatisfaction with out-of-hours GP services. But the BMA have warned the plans will waste resources and threaten the quality of care during the week.","Government proposed to make hospitals offer seven-day healthcare .

"A notorious British paedophile accused of molesting boys as young as eight in the Philippines may face extradition over child sex offences in the UK in the 1970s. Douglas Slade, 73 – a founder of the reviled child sex advocacy group Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – is on police bail after being repeatedly arrested for abusing boys from an elementary school opposite his home in Angeles City in the Philippines. Wealthy Slade, who has boasted of bribing prosecutors and victims' families, boasted of paying his way out of trouble in the corrupt, poverty-racked Southeast Asian country which is a magnet for paedophiles and sex tourists, our investigation in December found. Now, Mail Online has discovered that Slade faces possible extradition to the UK as detectives in Bristol investigate him for historical child sex offences linked to a nationwide paedophile network before he left Britain for the Philippines in 1985. It comes as an alleged former victim of Slade contacted MailOnline to describe how he was molested at the age of 14. Vile: Douglas Slade was warned he faced 40 years in jail over child abuse but boasted that he would pay to get case dropped. An alleged victim has told MailOnline he was introduced to Slade by former racing car driver Christopher Skeaping, who was jailed in 2009 for sex attacks on a boy aged 12 in the late 1980s . Extradition: Mail Online has discovered that Slade faces possible extradition to the UK as detectives in Bristol investigate him for historical child sex offences linked to a nationwide paedophile network, PIE, before he left Britain for the Philippines in 1985 . Peeping Tom: Douglas Slade has built a house with a view directly into the primary school opposite and neighbours claim he is paying children £2 for 'sex acts' Slade, who lived in the Knowle West district of Bristol in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is suspected of abusing numerous underage boys passed between PIE members who tracked down youths for illegal sex. He is currently under investigation by Bristol CID as part of its Operation Bluestone inquiry into historical sex abuse cases, according to correspondence seen by MailOnline. The cases date to the 1960s and 1970s and include one case in Ireland. Separately, a former victim allegedly abused by Slade and other PIE members, who is not part of the current UK investigation, has contacted MailOnline to describe how he was molested by Slade and then passed between paedophiles from 1979 when he was 14. Now 50, Neil (not his real name) said he was introduced to Slade by another prominent PIE member, former racing car driver Christopher Skeaping, who was jailed in 2009 for sex attacks on a boy aged 12 in the late 1980s. Skeaping lured boys to his West London home where, it is claimed, he introduced Neil to Slade who invited him on a number of occasions to his home in Bristol before passing him on to other paedophiles, including an elderly jeweller and a nightclub owner in the city. At that time, Slade lived in Bristol between stints working as a recruitment agent for construction companies in Dubai, travelling to countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to find young men to work on building projects. Before moving to the country, Slade would go on holiday to the Philippines with other paedophiles to pick up young boys for sex, the victim claimed, while one of the boys he lured to his Bristol home was only 12, said Neil. Neil told Mail Online: 'When I read your article about Slade in the Philippines, I found it abhorrent to think that all these years on this person is still getting away with the molestation of children. 'I can understand how children in a poor country like the Philippines fall victim to Slade. I was a poor kid from London and at first I just felt someone was being nice to me for a change. I only realised later how wrong and corrupt it was. Predator: Paedophile Douglas Slade was confronted by MailOnline about the charges he faced but claimed he was being set up and claimed 'someone wants me out of the country'. Now he could face extradition under an investigation by Bristol detectives . Douglas Slade and former racing car driver Christopher Skeaping, right, who was jailed in 2009 for sex attacks on a boy aged 12 in the late 1980s, were exposed as members of PIE by the Sunday People in 1975 . Hiding: Douglas Slade, 73, has been accused by neighbours of paying young boys for 'sex acts', and is said to spend time on his balcony gazing into the primary school opposite, where he also donates money despite facing repeated accusations of molesting children . Campaigner: Father Shay Cullen is fighting to have Douglas Slade brought to trial over previous allegations that have now been dropped after Slade boasted of paying his way out of court. Father Cullen trains child welfare volunteers at the Preda Foundation in Subic Bay, the Philippines . 'There is a moral compass adults should have and they should not take away the innocence of a child in terms of their sexuality. Adults are there to protect children not to use them for their own gratification.' Neil came from a poor home near Skeaping's house in West London and described how Skeaping and fellow PIE founder Slade allegedly groomed him and other young boys for sex. 'I was introduced to Chris Skeaping by a school friend,' he said. 'His house in Hounslow was like a youth club. There were always lads of my age there. You could run wild. He didn't mind. I started going round there because it was a place to hang out. 'Skeaping drove a huge BMW 1100 and had big American cars. For kids of 13, 14 and 15, those are exciting things. Douglas Slade turned up at his home one day. I was a very quiet child and he just picked up on me and I ended up going to Bristol several times. 'Apart from the sexual side of it, Slade was actually very nice to me. He made me feel special. He was doing nice things for me and it all seemed quite a good thing. I suppose if that's what grooming is, I was being groomed.' It was on his third visit to Bristol that his relationship with Slade took a sinister turn. 'He started introducing me to people and I was used (sexually) by these people,' said Neil, naming an elderly jeweller and a nightclub and joke shop owner from the city. Bribe: Douglas Slade has been faced with charges before but boasted that he would pay to have them dropped. He is currently on bail for child abuse and under investigation for possessing child porn, police say . No shame: When confronted by MailOnline Douglas Slade said 'There have been five cases (against me) in four years. They've all been dismissed. Somebody is trying to f***ing get rid of me' Justice: Douglas Slade's case is being monitored in the Philippines by Catholic missionary and anti-paedophile campaigner Father Shay Cullen, who runs the Preda Foundation (above) to help the victims of child sex abuse and trafficking . Neil now plans to go to police with his testimony. 'I was affected by what happened to me for some years, but I got over it by being positive and coming to terms with it,' he said. 'Other victims might not be able to cope with what happened. 'If there is anything I can do to prevent this continuing, that is what I want to do. It is outrageous that these things are continuing to happen when they shouldn't.' Slade was exposed as a paedophilia advocate along with Skeaping in 1975 and was caught by a national newspaper telling fellow deviants: 'If you want to have sex with children don't bottle it up – do it.' A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police declined to give details about the investigation or to say if he expected an application to be made for Slade's extradition from the Philippines, saying: 'We are unable to comment at this time.' An extradition treaty between Britain and the Philippines which can be applied retrospectively has been agreed and is currently in the process of being ratified in Manila, depriving criminals of a well-used bolthole in the Far East. Slade's case is being monitored in the Philippines by Catholic missionary and anti-paedophile campaigner Father Shay Cullen who runs the Preda Foundation to help the victims of child sex abuse and trafficking. Father Cullen helped bring Slade to court in 1995 when he faced up to 40 years in jail for abusing boys at his previous home in Angeles City before charges were dropped. Slade was caught boasting on camera at that time how prosecutors and families could be bribed. Neighbours told Mail Online this month that boys as young as eight were still going regularly going into Slade's home since his release on bail for molesting and taking nude pictures of boys from the school opposite his home. Standing guard: The entrance to Douglas Slade's imposing house in Angeles City is watched by a domestic staff member but the 73-year-old is said to invite young boys in and offer them money . 'The boys sit on his doorstep after school,' said Angelica Alcantara, 17. 'He comes out and picks the ones he wants and they go inside. He pays them to pose naked for pictures and to do other things for him. Afterwards he gives them 150 pesos (£2) and sends them home.' Defiant Slade shouted 'You're an evil b*****d' at a Mail Online reporter from his balcony overlooking Amsic Elementary School when confronted a fortnight ago over his numerous arrests and claims he abuses pupils as young as eight for £2 a time. Lawyers for the Preda Foundation, which has successfully pursued foreign paedophiles to their home countries in the past, are already preparing to take action against Slade on behalf of his victims in the Philippines if he returns to the UK. 'The children's parents have signed papers to say they will be represented by Preda in any action to find justice and compensation for the victims of Slade,' said Father Shay at his foundation's headquarters in Subic Bay where he has run a mission for nearly 40 years. 'Slade has been able to bribe his way out of trouble in the past because he is very rich,' he said. 'He has a long history.'

"Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to overturn a judge's decision to not move his upcoming trial out of state. The appeal was filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hours after U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole denied the change-of-venue request and a motion seeking a nine-month delay in the start of the trial. The defense is now asking O'Toole to postpone jury selection, scheduled to begin Monday, pending the outcome of the appeal. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges connected to the April 2013 explosions at the marathon finish line, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Denied: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was denied a change of venue for his upcoming trial in Boston . The defense lawyers, in their appeal to the higher court, again argued Tsarnaev couldn't receive a fair trial in the Boston federal courthouse a couple of miles from where the bombing occurred. Prosecutors, they said, were likely to depict the crimes as having affected not only those killed and injured but nearly the entire greater Boston community. 'Thus, every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses,' the defense attorneys wrote. As an alternative to ordering the trial moved, the lawyers suggested the appeals court order O'Toole to hold a hearing on ""disputed issues of fact"" and reconsider the previous change-of-venue motions. O'Toole said in his ruling earlier Wednesday he would provide a detailed explanation for it later. In rejecting Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, O'Toole said defense lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point an impartial jury couldn't be chosen in Boston. The defense has compared the coverage to that in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose trial was moved to Denver. McVeigh was convicted and put to death for the bombing, which killed 168 people. In Wednesday's appeals court filing, Tsarnaev's lawyers noted The Associated Press recently named the aftermath of the marathon bombing the top Massachusetts news story of 2014 and Gov.-elect Charlie Baker, in response to a question posed by The Boston Globe in October, said Tsarnaev was the living person he despised the most. Tragedy: Medical workers aid injured people at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon following an explosion in Boston for which Tsarnaev is allegedly responsible . Prosecutors say Tsarnaev, 21, and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted and detonated two pressure cooker bombs. Tamerlan died following a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in suburban Watertown. Also Wednesday, O'Toole issued a decorum order, prohibiting courtroom spectators from wearing clothing, buttons or other items ""that carry any message or symbol addressing the issues related to this case that may be or become visible to the jury."" The ban includes law enforcement uniforms and badges, except for those worn by on-duty U.S. marshals or court security officers. Defense lawyers said in motions seeking a trial delay the prosecution has not handed over everything they have requested, including information they believe may show Tsarnaev was under his brother's influence. The defense also wanted more time to review information regarding Stephen Silva, who recently pleaded guilty to having possessed the gun prosecutors said the bombing suspects used to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer. In a court filing opposing the request for a delay, prosecutors rejected complaints by Tsarnaev's lawyers about their ability to digest the volume of material provided by the government. Prosecutors said much of that information was demanded by the defense and voluntarily turned over by the government 'in the spirit of openness.'

"New Year's Day may only seem good for a bleary-eyed lunch with the in-laws. But it seems a deluge of shoppers are hauling themselves out of bed - and returning those Christmas rejects. Today will see more presents exchanged than any other, claims a report by business analysts, and the number could hit a record high thanks to the rise of online shopping. With a string of shopping centres up and down Britain opening as late as 9pm, the day has been dubbed Boomerang Thursday by the analysts. Ready to hit the shops... again? A report claims today will see a peak of gift returns - despite a public holiday . Some 29million unwanted presents are being returned from online shops alone this year with an expected value of £600million, estimates the report by LCP Consulting. The firm, which advises businesses on their supply chains, said past figures suggest 15 per cent of all online presents are returned - and around 200million were set to be delivered over Christmas. Despite the public holiday - and for people who work long hours, because of it - the report claimed many Christmas presents will be returned today. Many returns of goods originally ordered online will happen in person, it added, thanks to quicker refunds and the added lure of the sales. The firm's founder Alan Braithwaite, a visiting professor at Cranfield University in Bedford, said some departments faced having more than half of all their sales returned. That could pose a challenge for small independent shops which rely on Christmas income, and prompt long till queues at big-name chains which have an online ordering arm. Of shops opening on New Year's Day, he said: 'I think the retailers want to maximise the available time to persuade customers to spend their money, especially those without much free time. 'Some retailers such as John Lewis are still not opening, but those in a less strong position will be concerned not to lose the opportunity. Scramble: Shoppers on Black Friday in Wembley, north London. The trend is among several promoting impulse buys which analysts say can lead to a higher number of gifts being returned in the cold light of day . 'The most-returned items will be high fashion - trendy things given as gifts, and people may have bought one or two because they weren't sure what would fit, so one has to be returned.' His colleague Phil Streatfield claimed the massive number of refunds and returns creates 'more pressure than ever for retailers to be slicker in managing their refund process'. He added: 'This will be a critical factor for future success, and become part of a new and increasingly complex battleground.' The firm claimed 600,000 orders from Cyber Monday will have required redelivering, many of them before Christmas Day. It estimated the average gift as costing £20. Major shopping centres will be opening long hours today, despite New Year's Day historically being quiet. London's two sprawling Westfield malls will be open from 10am to 9pm, while shops at the Trafford Centre in Manchester - Britain's largest - are open until 6pm. The huge Bluewater mall in Greenhithe, Kent, will be open until 7pm while the Liverpool One centre will be open until 6pm. Shops in London's Oxford Street - still recovering from the capital's excesses last night - will be open until 7pm. Not everyone has succumbed to the pressures of consumerism. Gateshead's MetroCentre, the second-largest shopping centre in the country, will be almost completely closed today. And with a YouGov poll showing we spent £604 per household on gifts, perhaps some people just can't bear the thought of hitting the shops again. Especially with that hangover.","Experts claim presents worth £600m are being returned after Christmas .

"The New Year’s Honours list is packed with celebrities, top dignitaries and household names. But one you might not have heard of is Chris Bates, who has been awarded an MBE for his services to the world’s most remote inhabited island. The 66-year-old has been recognised for his work as the UK representative of Tristan da Cunha, a tiny island in the South Atlantic with a population of 267. Chris Bates, who has been awarded an MBE for his services to the world’s most remote inhabited island, Tristan da Cunha . The 66-year-old has been recognised for his work as the UK representative of Tristan da Cunha, a tiny island in the South Atlantic with a population of 267 . Lying midway between Africa and South America, the island is a British overseas territory and can only be reached by a week-long boat journey from Cape Town. Mr Bates, a former journalist, first heard of the island while working as a press officer in 1995. He took up his role as ‘voice of the people’ seven years ago. He carried out his duties from his home in Birmingham, often arranging for items such as bus stop signs and gravestones to be delivered to the remote outpost. 'The great advantage Tristan has got is that it is so different to anywhere else on the planet and has a unique philosophy and way of life,' he said. 'There is nowhere as remote so it grabs people's attention and if you're dealing with a Government minister it catches their interest. 'I have travelled back and forwards to London three times a week to various meetings and it's effectively been a full-time job. Lying midway between Africa and South America, the island is a British overseas territory and can only be reached by a week-long boat journey from Cape Town . Mr Bates, a former journalist, first heard of the island while working as a press officer in 1995 . Tristan da Cunha is the name of the main island in a remote group of volcanic islands with the same name in the South Atlantic Ocean . 'I'm supposed to be retired and when I started I asked my wife if I could do it because I was meant to be a house husband. 'I've met everyone in the Cabinet including the Prime Minister and most of the other Government ministers over the years. 'I often took things like bus stops signs, wrapped in brown paper, down to the Post Office to send over to the island. 'The requests were as varied as supplying dog whistles for shepherds, souvenir badges, silk ties and police badges.' He also represented the island at state events in London and at conferences around the world. Status: British overseas territory, dependency of St Helena . Population: 267 . Area: 98 sq km . Capital: Edinburgh of the Seven Seas . Language: English . Religion: Christian . Monetary unit: British Pound . Economy: Subsistence farming, fishing, stamps and coins . Time zone: GMT (same as UK) Mr Bates, who lives with his wife Julie, 53, stepped down from the role this week, but the island’s administrator Alex Mitham said he leaves Tristan da Cunha ‘in a stronger position on the world stage’. Tristan da Cunha is the name of the main island in a remote group of volcanic islands with the same name in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is the most remote inhabited island in the world - lying 1,243 miles (2,000km) from the nearest inhabited land Saint Helena and 1,491 miles (2,400km) from the nearest continental land South Africa. Tristan da Cunha - known by locals as Tristan - has a north to south length of just seven miles (11.3km) and has an area of 37.8 square miles (98 sq km) The island is part of the British overseas territory which includes Saint Helena and Ascension thousands of miles to its north. At one time Tristan was on the main trading route between Europe and the Indian Ocean, but the small community living there is now extremely isolated. It was discovered in 1506 but remained uninhabited until it was used by US whalers in the late 1700s. The British navy stationed a garrison there during Napoleon's exile on St Helena and, when it was withdrawn, three men stayed behind and became the founders of the present settlement.

"A woman has had an aggressive cancerous tumour removed after the dog she rescued from a life of misery sniffed out an aggressive tumour in the nick of time. Josie Conlan, 46, had no idea she had a cancerous lump in her breast until her two-year-old border collie Ted began to repeatedly cry, paw and nuzzle at her chest - and she now credits him with saving her life. The mother-of-four from Stockton-on-Tees wondered what was wrong, and when she put her hand to her chest she realised she had a lump. Scroll down for video . Josie says her rescue dog Ted alerting her to the tumour, which was fast growing, likely saved her life . Josie's prognosis is now good after having surgery as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy . She visited her GP and was diagnosed with cancer but has now had the tumour, which she was told was advanced at grade three, removed. She has also been given the welcome news that the disease has not spread to her lymph nodes. In the two weeks before she was operated on the lump had grown by an incredible five millimetres and Josie believes that if it wasn't for Ted she could have been dead by summer. She said: 'When I got the results from the hospital and was told the cancer had not spread the relief I felt was incredible and it is all down to Ted. 'It was also at this point that I was told that the tumour I had was particularly aggressive and had been growing very quickly. If I'd left it any later before going to the doctor the consequences do not bear thinking about. 'I have had Ted for about a year and he was quite a timid dog when I first got him but we soon became very close. He had been badly abused and the bond we formed was incredibly close. Despite rescuing Ted from being abused, Josie says she now feels she owes him a debt for saving her . 'I feel as though it is fate that we found each other. I saved him, then he saved me. 'He is not normally very affectionate, and would never usually paw me in such a way. That is why I knew something was wrong.' The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast. Most breast lumps (90 per cent) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should see your GP if you notice any of the following: . Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. Source: NHS . Josie, a mother-of-four and grandmother-of-two, bought Ted after seeing him for sale online, but when she turned up at his home she realised there was something wrong. Ted's owners barely spoke to her and bundled the animal into her car straight away before Josie took him to the vets. She was told that Ted had suffered a blow to the head and that it was highly likely he had been kept in a very small cage. His muscles had wasted away and he was barely able to walk. But after some tender loving care from Josie Ted made a dramatic recovery. Josie added: 'We are very close. I have had other dogs, but never formed as strong a bond with them as I have done with Ted. He saved my life.' Josie, who lives with her delivery driver husband Brian, 47, had the lump removed mid-December 2014 and last week learned that the cancer had not spread. She suffers from benign breast disease which causes regular lumps, which are harmless and never usually worry her. Stay-at-home-mum Josie now wants to let other people know that they should take notice of dogs if they start to draw attention to a certain area of their owners' body. Josie, mother to Hannah, 26, James, 24, Lewis, 21, and Megan, 14, said: 'I think a lot of people would probably just push a dog away if it started clawing at their chest, but dog owners should take notice, because Ted really did save my life.' She faces 18 weeks of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiotherapy to ensure the cancer does not return, but her prognosis is good.","Jose Conlan, 46, from Stockton-on-Tees' dog scratched at her breast .

"Criticism: Matthew Taylor, chairman of the Social Integration Commission, said that the increase in faith and free schools is stifling diversity . The rise in Muslim faith schools is breeding social and racial segregation in Britain, a leading equality campaigner said today. Matthew Taylor, chairman of the Social Integration Commission, said that the increase in faith and free schools is stifling diversity and stopping children from different races and backgrounds mixing. He was particularly critical of Muslim faith schools because they have the least diversity. It came after 2014 saw a string of schools criticised over 'Trojan horse' plots by religious extremists and failures to protect students from radical material and influences. A report in July found there was a ‘coordinated’ campaign to introduce ‘an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos’ into some of the city’s schools. In total 21 schools investigated by Ofsted and several were found to be failing students and put into special measures. Mr Taylor, a former adviser to  Tony Blair when he was prime minister, singled out Muslim faith schools as the least diverse in their intake and called for the Government to take action. He accused the Government of a 'certain amount of carelessness' over its schools policy, in particularly that 'we have more schools and more faith schools and more free schools'. He told the Independent: 'It's more by negligence than anything; I don't think that the Government has deliberately promoted segregation but I think sometimes it pursues policies which are anti-integration and it isn't sufficiently aware of that. 'Britain's becoming more diverse and if we don't think about this and we're not willing to act on it, the danger is we will become more separate ... there will be far too many places which feel like they're just for the well-off and far too many places which feel like they're just for the poor; there'll be far too many schools which feel like they're just for one minority group of for just one social class.' Probe: Oldknow Academy in Birmingham was one of 21 schools investigated over the alleged Trojan Horse plot to introduce ‘an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos’ into some of the city’s schools . 'If you were in the Department for Education and said, ""A lot of these schools are not terribly integrated places"", you'd have been brushed aside and told, ""Well that's not actually a priority and that's not the important thing - the important thing is that we have got more of these institutions"". The latest figures for the number of government-approved free schools across the UK was 331, accounting for 175,000 pupils, as of June 2014. In October plans for a voluntary code of conduct for faith schools were shelved by the Government. This was despite even though it had been recommended by the cross-government task force on tackling extremism and radicalisation in order to prevent children being exposed to 'intolerant or extremist views' in religious 'supplementary schools' providing lessons outside mainstream education. A DfE spokesman said: 'Our plan for education is designed to ensure every child of whatever background leaves school prepared for life in modern Britain. Ensuring they are well rounded young people, ready to play their full part in our society is a key part of that. 'The best schools already have strategies in place to ensure their pupils are well integrated and this government's policies are helping too. We have strengthened guidance to ensure all schools actively promote fundamental British values and that these are woven throughout the curriculum. 'Faith schools are an important part of our diverse education system and are popular with parents. We have made sure that all new faith academies and free schools can only prioritise half of their places according to the faith, while two thirds of new free schools have been created in some of the most deprived areas of the country'.","Matthew Taylor says faith schools causing social and racial segregation .

"Actor Colin Firth, who said he was ‘still processing’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in his new film Kingsman: The Secret Service . He made his name playing calm, civilised gentlemen in films such as Love Actually. So movie-goers may be shocked at the graphic violence in Colin Firth’s latest film. The actor, told Empire magazine he was ‘still processing’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in Kingsman: The Secret Service. He called for ‘legitimate discussions’ on whether film-makers should be encouraging audiences to enjoy violence. Campaigners called his remarks ‘very encouraging’ but urged him to refuse roles in such films in future. In Kingsman, rated 15 and due for release on January 29, Firth plays a spy training a homeless youngster to be a secret agent. Kingsman also stars Sir Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson and is released on January 29 with a 15 rating. It is the latest film from Matthew Vaughn, the husband on supermodel Claudia Schiffer and the director behind the films Layer Cake and Kick-Ass, which both drew attention because of their controversial content. This latest project sees super-spy Harry Hart, played by Firth, take a rough street kid under his wing and train him to be a lethal secret agent. But father-of-three Firth said: ‘I’m still processing my response. I did think, “I don’t know what I’m getting into now.” And there will be arguments, legitimate discussions, about whether it’s healthy to enjoy anything with violence. 'Particularly when you’re dared to enjoy it. I still don’t have the answers on what’s supposed to be good and bad. But I was exhilarated as well.’ His comments have been welcomed by campaigners against on-screen violence, who have called on filmmakers to take note of Firth’s concerns. Pippa Smith, co-founder of the Safermedia campaign, said: ‘I think it’s very encouraging that an actor of his standing does question this level of violence. I rather hope that at some point someone will say “I’m not going to act in this film because of the levels of violence and I shouldn’t be promoting this sort of violence”, but I’m very encouraged to hear what he’s said. ‘It’s made him worried and concerned obviously and he’s quite right to be concerned that viewers are almost expected to enjoy this sort of violence, otherwise why would they have it in the first place? Teaching role: Firth plays secret agent Harry Hart who recruits street kid Eggy, played by Taron Egerton, for a spy organisation's ultra-competitive training program . ‘I think the people who ought to be listening to him are people like the government, like the British Board of Film Classification that classifies films, the people who produce the films, they are who I would consider as the target audience [for his comments]. I don’t know if the lad on the street will care what Colin Firth says.’ However, she is also not convinced that the film’s 15 rating will protect children from being exposed to Kingsman’s violent scenes and dismissed the claim that its tongue-in-cheek tone will lessen its impact. She added: ‘There is so much violence in the media and it glorifies it for young people, the other thing of course is that it’s not going to be just 15 year olds and up who are going to see the film, once it’s in circulation young kids always see them, it’s just not healthy.’ ‘The bottom line is violence is violence. I know a lot of people say if it’s funny it’s not as important but quite frankly, any high level of violence, whatever justification they might try and put forward to it, I don’t think there is any real justification for it.’ Firth made his name playing calm, civilised gentlemen in films such as Love Actually and The King's Speech, pictured . This is not the first time an actor has publicly voiced concern over the level of violence in a film they have starred in. In 2013, Jim Carrey criticised Kick Ass 2, which was produced by Kingsman’s director Matthew Vaughn. Carrey, who played a masked vigilante in the comedy superhero film, said he could no longer support the project following the Sandy Hook school shooting which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. He posted on Twitter: ‘I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence.’ And added: ‘My apologies to others involve with the film. I am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart.’ Twentieth Century Fox, who are distributing the film, did not respond to requests for comment.","Colin Firth filmed graphic, violent gun battle scenes for his latest movie .

"Children as young as three are being branded racists, homophobes and bigots over playground taunts. Thousands of pupils are being reported for so-called hate crimes after using innocuous words such as ‘Chinese boy’, ‘Somalian’ or ‘gay’. Teachers also log insults like ‘doughnut’ and ‘fat bucket of KFC’. Even calling a pupil a ‘girl’ can be classified as abuse. Scroll down for video . Children as young as three are being branded racists, homophobes and bigots over playground taunts (file picture) Schools file the incidents for local education authorities. The details are also passed to Ofsted inspectors who are required to assess how teachers deal with bullying. Records of a child’s ‘prejudice-related’ behaviour can be passed to their next school, potentially casting a shadow over their secondary education. Alleged offences by more than 4,000 pupils were logged in just 13 council areas – meaning the national total may stretch into the tens of thousands. Civil liberties campaigners warned the practice could have serious consequences for any children labelled as bigots. Josie Appleton, of the Manifesto Club, a civil liberties group, said: ‘Particularly worrying is the expansion of incident recording and reporting to ever-greater categories of prejudice, which seem limited only by the strange imagination of education officials. ‘One primary school pupil calling another a girl suddenly becomes a sign of gender image prejudice, subjected to recording requirements more thorough than accompanying most burglaries. A reality check is urgently required.’ The reporting of racist incidents in schools became recommended practice for local education authorities across the country under Labour. The Coalition government made clear that schools were no longer under obligation to submit these reports to LEAs and should exercise their own judgment in deciding whether to record. Thousands of pupils are being reported for so-called hate crimes after using innocuous words such as ‘Chinese boy’, ‘Somalian’ or ‘gay’ (file picture) However, data published by the Manifesto Club – and gained under the Freedom of Information Act – shows that reporting and recording has continued and in some cases has been expanded. The 30 LEAs who recorded the most abuse under Labour were surveyed and 13 continue to collect racist incident reports from schools and six have expanded their recording to include a broader range of ‘prejudice-related’ bullying. The majority say they ask, recommend or encourage schools to keep their own records. In 2012-13 – the latest available statistics – 4,348 incidents were reported to the 13 LEAs. Of the 1,909 incidents where the age of children involved was specified, over half were in primary schools and astonishingly, four were in nursery schools. In one case, at a Brighton school nursery, a child aged three or four was the subject of an incident report and given counselling. Looking at pictures of people with different eye colours he had said ‘yuk not black’ and discarded all the black faces. ‘Children in the playground had been calling her son “Chinese boy”. A child in Year Two (ages 6/7), Brighton . ‘Xxx was heard calling xxx “black” and “chocolate bar”. A Year Three child (ages 7/8), Brighton . ‘Xxx called xxx an African rat, and xxx a rat. Xxx said “I know I shouldn’t have called it her because I’m black as well”.’ Birmingham . Xxx called the supply teacher Jimmy Savile. He told him to go back to Australia, he’s an Australian faggot and a pikey. Xxx then said to xxx he’s Savile and he rapes babies.’ Brighton . ‘Xxx was asked by xxx why we wear sun cream. He replied “Muslims and Catholics wear sun cream so we don’t look like xxx”.’ Brighton . ‘Xxx called xxx a monkey. Xxx responded by saying xxx was fat.’ Brighton . ‘Xxx called xxx “Egyptian bitch”.’ Birmingham . ‘There was an argument in the lunch hall which resulted in xxx apparently calling xxx “fat” and xxx “gay”.’ Year Five (age 9/10) Brighton . ‘Xxx was called “doughnut”, “fat bucket of KFC”, “fat custard cream” repeatedly.’ Girl victim aged 9/10, Brighton . ‘Xxx called them both retards.’ Brighton . In a primary school in the same city, a group of Year Two children (ages six/seven) were hauled in before their headteacher after a mother had complained they had called her son ‘Chinese boy’ at playtime because they did not know his name. A spokesman for Brighton and Hove City Council said: ‘We ask schools to record and share details of bullying by type, without identifying the children or young people involved. ‘This helps tackle bullying in the most appropriate way and to develop assemblies or programmes about specific issues if required. ‘Recording types and rates of bullying and prejudiced-based incidents is good practice for schools and is data that Ofsted is interested in.’ Adrian Hart, who analysed the data for the Manifesto Club, said it was ‘highly likely that thousands of incidents are being logged by schools across the country, regardless of whether their LEAs are requiring them to submit data or not’. Of the 13 Brighton primary schools he surveyed, five said they would attach incidents of prejudice-related bullying to the child’s reports submitted to the next school. Birmingham City Council has stopped asking schools to submit the data, but some schools are continuing to collect it internally. Adrian Hart is the author of That's Racist! How The Regulation of Speech and Thought Divides Us All.","Alleged offences by some 4,000 pupils were logged in just 13 council areas .

"British musicians claimed all of the top 10 best-selling albums of 2014, squeezing American artists out of the chart for the first time. Ed Sheeran led the list of the acts, with his most recent album, X, selling 1.7million times online and in stores. Sales were remarkably higher than in 2013 when no single act sold more than 1million albums. Ed Sheeran (left) and Sam Smith (right) topped the chart of the highest selling albums of 2014. It was the first year in memory British musicians claimed all 10 of the best-selling records . Sam Smith sold the second highest number of albums (1.25million) with his In the Lonely Hour this year, followed by George Ezra, Paolo Nutini and Coldplay. One Direction, who topped last year's list after selling 685,000 copies of Midnight Memories, were seventh this year with their album Four. Olly Murs, Pink Floyd and Take That finished off the top 10, with Paloma Faith the only woman to appear in the list at number six. For the first time this year physical albums accounted for less than half of the total sales, with online transactions making up 51 per cent of the figures. Streaming music has also become more popular, with subscriptions to websites such as Spotify and Deezer contributing £14.8bmillion to the industry. Paloma Faith was the only female artist to be included in the top 10. George Ezra sold the third highest number of albums with his Wanted On Voyage . One Direction topped last year's list of the highest selling albums, but was seventh in the 2014 chart . While CD sales decreased by eight per cent, the revival of the vinyl disc saw the largest number of records sold in one year since 1995. 1. Ed Sheeran - x . 2. Sam Smith - In The Lonely Hour . 3. George Ezra - Wanted On Voyage . 4. Paolo Nutini - Caustic Love . 5. Coldplay - Ghost Stories . 6. Paloma Faith - A Perfect Contradiction . 7. One Direction - Four . 8.

The Frozen soundtrack was the second highest selling album by various artists, with more than 900,000 records purchased. Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, said: 'The remarkable success of British artists in 2014 is exciting news for the future. 'Our record labels are backing home-grown talent like Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and George Ezra, who in turn are catching fire around the world.' Tony Wadsworth, the outgoing chairman of the BPI, added: 'The UK recorded music industry invests in a truly global business, as labels continue to find, develop, support and succeed with world class artists making world-class music.'

"A man has died in an axe and knife attack outside a village pub barely an hour after he saw in the new year. Police said 'major disorder' erupted around the Kings Arms in Tamerton Foliot on the outskirts of Plymouth, Devon, at around 1.30am today. A group clashed on the tiny village green leaving a 27-year-old man dead, and two more people in hospital with knife wounds. He has been named locally as Tanis Bhandari, a builder. Probe: A murder investigation is under way after an axe and knife attack outside the Kings Arms pub in Tamerton Foliot near Plymouth, Devon, killed a 27-year-old man at around 1.30am today . Peaceful: Councillor Jonny Morris said the pub was a 'nice' place where trouble among punters was rare . Two further men from Plymouth - aged 20 and 21 - were arrested on suspicion of murder and are in police custody awaiting questioning. Officers, who have launched a murder investigation, recovered an axe from the scene and are asking residents to check their gardens for any discarded weapons. Police said worried revellers called them to the pub after a man was seen carrying an axe and a knife. Further calls were then made reporting 'disorder', and when officers arrived they discovered the 27 year-old with fatal injuries. He was taken to nearby Derriford Hospital by ambulance but pronounced dead on arrival. Much of the village was cordoned off for several hours following the violence. Inquiry: Police said they found an axe at the scene but are still looking for possible further weapons . One neighbour of the pub said: 'The place was swarming with officers who appeared to be searching in a line' Residents returning to their homes from New Year's Eve celebrations elsewhere found themselves escorted to their front doors by police. One said: 'The police stopped us at each point on the way back into the village. By the time we had come back the incident was over. 'I was quite glad we weren't out in the village. It's a very close community and everyone says hello to each other and stops to chat. It's a big shock.' Another said: 'The place was swarming with officers who appeared to be searching in a line.' Another added: 'The road was all blocked. We had to walk part of the way home.' Councillor Jonny Morris said the pub was a 'nice' place where trouble was very rare. He said: 'It it not the sort of thing that happens in Tamerton Foliot - it is a very nice sort of area. 'The Kings Arms is a nice pub I often have a lunch in. It is not the sort of place you would think this would happen. It is very sad.' Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell said: 'We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or who was in the Tamerton Foilot area between 1am and 2am this morning to contact the police. 'We have established a cordon at Station Road to assist with scene investigation and our officers will be active in the area throughout the day conducting enquiries.' Quiet: The village of Tamerton Foliot where the attack happened is on the outskirts of Plymouth in Devon . A cordon remained around large parts of the village today while police investigated the incident . A police spokesman added: 'An axe has been found but the knife has yet to be located. 'We are asking local residents to keep an eye out for anything discarded in their bins or gardens that seems suspicious and to call police if anything is found, without touching it.' Two men with knife injuries are still being treated in Derriford Hospital. The two arrested men are being held at the city's Charles Cross police station. A cordon remains in place at the scene.

"Players and staff at a Premier League football club have lost £30,000 to fraudsters in a scam, it was claimed today. Footballer Andy Carroll and manager Sam Allardyce were among West Ham United FC employees who allegedly fell prey to the scam  at the club's training ground in Chadwell Heath, Essex. The con artist was offering cut-price Fortnum & Mason hampers and Harrods champagne last month - and the pair paid £11,000 but never saw the goods delivered, according to reports. Victims: Footballer Andy Carroll (left) and manager Sam Allardyce (right) were among West Ham United FC employees who allegedly fell prey to the scam . Location: The con artist visited West Ham's training ground (pictured) in Chadwell Heath, Essex, last month . The fraudster took £30,000 in total from players and staff and also targeted Championship team Norwich City, where he conned players out of £5,000, reported The Sun journalist Mike Sullivan. A source told the newspaper: ‘He was offering top quality champagnes and hampers from Harrods and Fortnum & Mason at ridiculously cheap prices. ‘The conman told them he had some good contacts in these firms and assured them it was all legal and above board. They were told stuff would be delivered in a short while.’ Metropolitan Police officers were informed on Christmas Eve and have now begun an investigation.

Couple: Carroll, who earns in the region of £85,000 a week at West Ham, with his fiancée Billi Mucklow . Related case: The fraudster also targeted Championship team Norwich City (whose ground Carrow Road is pictured), where he conned players out of £5,000, according to reports . A spokesman for the London force told MailOnline today: ‘Officers from Newham are investigating an allegation of fraud which occurred on Friday, December 12.' She added: ‘It was reported to police on December 24 and inquiries are continuing. There have been no arrests.’ Nobody at Norwich City was available for comment today, while a Norfolk Constabulary employee said the force could not comment. A West Ham spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment this morning. But today, Carroll took to Twitter just after midday to tell his 280,000 followers: 'My money is safe'. England international Carroll, who earns in the region of £85,000 a week at West Ham, announced on Christmas Day that his fiancée Billi Mucklow was pregnant with their first child. Allardyce, 60, took over West Ham in June 2011 - while the club paid £17million for Carroll, 25, from Liverpool in June 2013, following a loan spell.

"A headteacher has launched a crackdown on anti-social behaviour by ordering parents to stop swearing and smoking outside the school gates. Liz Mulcahy, head of Felmore Primary in Basildon, Essex says local people near to the school had complained about parents congregating at the gates and using bad language. And in a school newsletter sent to parents before the Christmas break, Mrs Mulcahy advised those coming to collect children to be considerate of local residents. Parents whose children go to Felmore Primary School in Basildon, pictured, have been ordered to stop swearing and smoking at the school gates . She wrote: 'We have had complaints made from members of our local community about parents gathering around the school gates in the morning and at home tim. 'The complaints are about blocking the pavements, having to walk through cigarette smoke and also the use of bad language. 'Please be considerate of local residents - it is a community school and we are part of that community. Thank you.' Not only have parents also been told to stop smoking and swearing, they have also been asked to keep the pavements clear as pedestrians have been forced into the road to pass groups.

Keith Bobbin, borough councillor for Pitsea North West said there had also been problems in the past with parents parking in the road and blocking access to a nearby sheltered housing complex. He added: 'There is a problem around there and it really needs to be patrolled by community police at the time when they are going in and out of school. 'It is a dangerous little area because it is a busy road. 'They had been blocking visitors going into the elderly people's home.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a New Year's message to U.S. President Barack Obama that Moscow is looking for equality in bilateral relations next year. The Kremlin on Wednesday published several dozen New Year's messages addressed to heads of states and international organizations such as the Olympic Committee and FIFA. Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and said that it should serve as a reminder of 'the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability.' Scroll down for video . Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in a New Year's message to U.S. President Barack Obama that Moscow is looking for equality in bilateral relations next year . Moscow is anxious for the relations to advance but only as long as there is 'equality and mutual respect.' Conspicuously absent from the list of the recipients of New Year's messages was Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. He also used his New Year's speech to hail his country's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula as an achievement that will 'forever remain a landmark in the national history.' Putin's comment in his pre-recorded annual address on Wednesday already has been broadcast in Russia's far eastern regions, where the holiday was celebrated hours ahead of Moscow, given the time difference. Putin reminded Obama of the upcoming 70th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and said that it should serve as a reminder of 'the responsibility that Russia and the United States bear for maintaining peace and international stability' After Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president was driven from power in February, Moscow sent troops to overtake Crimea, home to a Russian naval base. Those forces blocked Ukrainian military garrisons and set the stage for a hastily called referendum on Crimea joining Russia, which Ukraine and the West rejected as illegal. The West has imposed crippling sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and Moscow's support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting between the government troops and the rebels has killed more than 4,700 since April. Under the combined blow of the sanctions and slumping oil prices, the Russian ruble has lost about half its value this year and the national economy has drifted into recession. Putin has promised that the economy will rebound in two years, but he has failed to offer a specific plan for easing Russia's heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues. A man with a sticker reading ""Putin"" on his mouth takes part in an opposition rally in Moscow, in October . A woman holds a portrait of Russia's President Vladimir Putin during celebrations on the main square of the Crimean city of Simferopol in March . In his speech, Putin praised Crimea's 'return home,' a view widely backed by many Russians who saw Ukraine's control over the Black Sea region a historic injustice. Crimea only became part of Ukraine when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to his native land in 1954. That mattered little until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine. Experts have warned that Putin's popularity, which soared after the annexation of Crimea, could fizzle quickly amid his nation's economic downturn.

"The chief executive of the NSPCC has called for all child abuse images to be removed from the internet in five years to ensure the 'dark corners' of the internet do not slide into being acceptable. Peter Wanless said while the task may be huge it was important to act now to avoid it being seen as a part of life to view child abuse images on the internet. He said all of us as a society should feel guilty while images of children being abused still exist on the internet and said he would like to see them all wiped from the web. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, has called for all child abuse images to be removed from the internet in five years to ensure online child sexual exploitation does not come an acceptable part of society . Dozens of child abuse images exist on the internet, with four in every five featuring a child under the age of 11 being abused - some tortured or raped by an adult. Mr Wanless told the Daily Mirror: 'Do we want to blindly slide into a situation where, a few years down the line, there are endless pictures in existence and so many offenders viewing them that it becomes an almost acceptable part of the downside of life, like burglary or fraud? 'Is that the kind of tainted legacy we want to pass on? It may take time to achieve but we have to commit now.' He said he wanted police, councils and the government to work together to tackle the issue - months after the children's charity warned that forces were struggling to cope with the number of child sexual abuse images being discovered online. In 2013 almost 5,000 computers were seized by just over a third of the 43 forces in England and Wales. But most forces have just six officers available to analyse often hundreds, or even thousands, of images. There were 2,393 arrests for possessing, downloading, distributing child abuse images in 2013-14, according to data from 30 police forces and charities have warned that with the increased popularity of the internet the problem is a growing one. Mr Wanless said as a society we should feel guilty that child sex abuse images still exist on the internet . It is a crime that is also becoming more difficult to detect with criminals using sophisticated techniques to hide their identities and encrypt images online and share them. Last month David Cameron told a child abuse summit that online child sexual exploitation exists on an almost industrial scale throughout the world. He announced new laws to stop adults sending children sexual images. He also said a new joint specialist unit run by the National Crime Agency and GCHQ will aim to target offenders who do this to hide images on the 'dark net.' He said the same efforts would be made to tackle these criminals as is made to detect terrorists and international criminals. Mr Wanless said it was important to remember that the images were not just random pictures, but crimes had to have taken place for them to be created. He added: 'Any society that allows such an evil scenario to play out uninterrupted must surely be demeaned and every one of us should feel at least a little guilty while it persists.'","Peter Wanless wants all online child sex abuse images removed in 5 years .

"A devoted pet owner has spent £300 on saving the life of his goldfish after it became constipated. The man, who has not been named, took the fish to a veterinary practice in North Walsham, Norfolk, after noticing it was struggling to eliminate waste. He had hoped it would be a simple procedure but was told by staff at the Toll Barn Veterinary Centre that the delicate surgery required to save his pet would cost £300. The company boss initially turned down the treatment but changed his mind 10 minutes later and went back to give the go-ahead. Scroll down for video . The pet owner, who has not been named, took his goldfish (pictured) to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham, Norfolk, and paid £300 for it to have a special operation after noticing it had become constipated . Vet Faye Bethell, 29, put anaesthetising agent into the fish's water before using tiny instruments to remove two lumps from its body. The three-inch pet went on to make a full recovery after the 50-minute operation . Vet Faye Bethell, 29, was then tasked with carefully administering anaesthetic before using tiny instruments to remove a lump close to the fish's backside. A second lump was removed from his dorsal fin before the fish was returned to water and handed back to his grateful owner. Ms Bethell said the three-inch fish made a full recovery after the 50-minute operation and said it would have died if it was left untreated. She said: 'I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp. Vet Faye Bethell, 29 (pictured), carried out the delicate £300 operation on the constipated goldfish . 'The actual surgery is quite straightforward but administering the anaesthetic is quite complicated. 'The issue was the fish couldn't poo and it would have eventually become toxic and it would have died. 'There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets - but that was an expensive little goldfish.' The delicate procedure involved introducing a carefully-measured anaesthetising agent into the fish's water. It was then removed from its tank and placed on a waterproof drape before anaesthetic water was put into its mouth via a tube and bubbled over its gills. Ms Bethell then used a miniature heart-rate monitor to check that the fish was properly 'under' before using a mini scalpel to remove the lumps. She then sewed each cut with three stitches before using a special 'glue' to cover and waterproof the fish's scales before it was gradually re-awakened. Goldfish can live up to 10 years and this ailing pet was two years and 10 months old at the time of its operation. The Toll Barn practice opened a year ago and specialises in exotic animals as well as the more usual pets. Ms Bethell revealed that in the past year she has carried out a string of bizarre operations including the removal of a 12g skin tumour from a two-inch long hognose snake. She has also successfully taken out a stone from the 5mm-wide ureter of a guinea pig and last week castrated a skunk. Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich (pictured) - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George to remove a cancer tumour . The 10-year-old goldfish had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim . During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was cut out (pictured) It is not the first time a goldfish has undergone a traumatic operation to save its life. Earlier this year, Melbourne veterinarian Dr. Tristan Rich - head of exotics and wildlife medicine at Lort Smith Animal Hospital - performed micro-surgery on a goldfish called George. The 10-year-old pet had a large tumour on his head, making it difficult for him to breathe and swim. He was also unable to eat properly, and the tumour was affecting his ability to see. His owners had been monitoring the growth of the tumour which was sprouting from his head, and decided to opt for the surgery which cost $200 (£105). During the 'fiddly' operation, the tumour - which had stretched down to the fish's skull - was delicately cut out.","Man spent £300 on operation save his goldfish after it became constipated .

"A rail commuter whose trains were delayed more than 60 times last year has claimed back more than £1,000 in compensation. Tom Burridge makes the 50 minute journey from Colchester to London every day for work, spending £5,800 a year on a season ticket. Every time the 31-year-old was delayed in 2014, he made a claim with Greater Anglia who duly awarded him vouchers for future travel. Tom Burridge, 31, was awarded more than £1,000 in rail vouchers after claiming compensation for delayed services throughout 2014 . Over the course of the year he gathered £1,090 in compensation by using the company's Delay Repay scheme. 'Any time I have a delay I have a point of making a claim,' Mr Burridge, an IT project manager said. 'Season tickets are expensive so anything I can do to off-set it the better. 'It does make a difference. It's worth doing. 'I'm probably an extreme example because I travel more than the average person.' After saving up his vouchers for months, Mr Burridge has put them towards his season ticket for the new year. 'I knew it was going to take a few minutes so I made a point of going in when there wasn't going to be a massive queue of people,' he added. 'I think there was a sharp intake of breath from the man when I handed over this wedge of vouchers. Mr Burridge saved up dozens of compensation vouchers to put towards the cost of his annual season ticket . 'There are a lot of people who aren't aware you can do this. This is money you're entitled to.' A spokesman for Greater Anglia said a 'number of problems' had contributed to the company's poor performance over in recent months. All train services operating in the UK adhere to a Passenger's Charter. Below, different companies' criteria for making a compensation claim . Greater Anglia . 30 to 59 minutes: Compensation to the value of 50 per cent of the ticket . For more than an hour: Full value will be given in compensation . East Coast and Virgin . 30 minutes to an hour: 50 per cent of the ticket value . 60 to 119 minutes: Compensation to the full value of single ticket and full value of relevant portion of return ticket (inbound or outbound) More than 119 minutes: Full compensation of the value of single and return tickets . South West . More than an hour:  Full value of single tickets, half the value of return tickets . 'Under the terms of our Passenger's Charter, passengers can claim compensation for any delay. 'We are working closely with Network Rail to do all we can to improve service performance.' Network Rail added services had not been 'good enough' and that Mr Burridge was doing 'the right thing' by claiming compensation. 'Clearly, performance on the line from Colchester has not been good enough in recent months,' a spokesman said. 'This passenger is doing the right thing in claiming for his disrupted journeys and we can only apologise that the service has not been as reliable as it should be.' It comes after hundreds were left stranded in the days after Christmas when overrunning engineering works closed King's Cross station in London, cancelling scores of services. Passengers who had spent hundreds securing seats in First Class carriages for cross-country journeys were forced to cram into the aisles and vestibules of already sold-out trains to get home as a result of the disruption. East Coast, which was the worst affected by the chaos, is inviting passengers to look into its refund scheme. The disruption, branded 'totally unacceptable' by the transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin, is being investigated by the Office of Rail Regulation. Widespread disruption on train lines closed King's Cross station in central London last week, with hundreds of passengers left stranded across the country . Railway season ticket prices have risen by as much as £1,900 in just four years. Commuters on dozens of routes have faced increases of up to 30 per cent since 2010, according to Labour Party research. Over this time an annual ticket between Birmingham and London with Virgin Trains has gone from £8,028 to £9,916 – a surge of £1,888. Routes between Chester and Manchester and between New Pudsey and Leeds have risen 30 per cent in price from 2010. Michael Dugher, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron is presiding over a rip-off railway in Britain. He has failed to stand up for working people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and has allowed the train companies to hit passengers with massive fare rises.’ A separate report from rail unions found that a typical British worker would spend 17 per cent of their monthly wage on a season ticket. The equivalent figure for Germany is 9 per cent, France 12 per cent and Spain and Italy both 6 per cent. UK season ticket prices are rising by up to 2.5 per cent from today.","Tom Burridge was delayed more than 60 times throughout 2014 .

"Company boss Mike Waterton, 43, posted pictures of a luxury holiday just days after his firm was wound-up still owing workers their wages . The boss of a company that went bust days before Christmas was branded ‘heartless’ yesterday after he allegedly took a luxury  holiday while his ex-employees went unpaid. Mike Waterton, 43, put photos on his website appearing to show him in Cancun, Mexico, less than a week after his temping agency was wound up. He claimed this morning that the photos were actually taken by a friend who was on holiday in Mexico. Former staff say they were still owed hundreds of pounds after the business in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, closed without warning on December 11. Five days later, Mr Waterton, who is also an author and motivational speaker, posted pictures apparently showing him in a pool at the CasaMagna Marriott resort – his face obscured by his book 50 Grades Of Pay: How To Earn More Money. Another photo showed two cocktails on a beachside table. The hotel charges in Cancun up to £960 a night for its most luxurious rooms overlooking the sea. Mateusz Matczak, 20, a former employee of TempNetwork, told a local newspaper: ‘I was owed £470. My mum didn’t get paid either – we worked together and live together so we didn’t have money for anything. 'We had to borrow money from friends … The agency sent a message saying they were “sorry for this situation and we will try to help you find another agency”. Many of the workers are from Poland and had to cancel trips home due to unpaid wages. Another worker, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I was meant to be going to Poland for Christmas, but when TempNetwork closed down I was owed nearly £800. ‘I had to cancel the holiday because I didn’t have enough money to even get a taxi to the airport. This man is in Mexico while all his workers are owed their wages – he is a heartless and friendless man who knows no shame.’ Author: A photo posted by Mr Waterton, showing his book, taken in the pool of the luxury hotel in Mexico . Agatka Wszeborowska, 27, who also worked for TempNetwork, said she is owed £1,200 by the firm, adding: ‘We are all in a very bad situation and he’s going for a holiday like nothing happened. ‘A lot of people are really angry and he’s writing books about how to be a millionaire.’ A Citizens’ Advice Bureau spokesman said: ‘It’s a difficult situation for employees when an employer becomes insolvent. Hopefully we will be able to help the m to recover any money they are owed.’ Mr Waterton was unavailable for comment when his local newspaper, The Kent and Sussex Courier, reported the row. But today he claimed on his blog that he had not visited Mexico and the photos were taken by a friend and were posted on his website to promote his book. He added: 'In no way, shape or form was this intended to offend anyone and I apologise for any offence taken. I was in the UK during this time sorting out business.' He also wrote: 'The sudden and quick demise of Temp Network is regrettable. Despite our best intentions, we were unable to reach an agreement with in which we could keep trading. 'Even with the prospect of putting over 100 people out of work just before Christmas, our hands were tied.'

"Boys as young as seven and eight have been questioned by police on suspicion of rape, shocking figures reveal. They were among almost 1,000 children under ten accused of serious crimes in Manchester over the past three years but never prosecuted because of their age. In North Wales two boys aged nine were also accused of the same offence over the past 24 months. Boys as young as seven and eight have been questioned by police on suspicion of rape, shocking figures reveal (stock picture) A rape claim was also registered last year involving a six-year-old boy, although it is believed to have been carried out more than 40 years ago. Data released by police under freedom of information laws reveals that in Manchester the boy of seven was accused of raping a girl under 13. The eight-year-old was suspected of raping a girl under 16. In other cases, a girl of nine was accused of carrying a knife or blade at school, while a six-year-old boy was suspected of possessing cannabis. Thirty-one children in North Wales were suspected of causing actual bodily harm, the youngest being a girl of just six in 2012. They were among almost 1,000 children under ten accused of serious crimes in Manchester over the past three years but never prosecuted because of their age (picture posed by models) Children under ten are considered too young to be held criminally responsible for any wrongdoing. Des Mannion of NSPCC Wales said pornography was ‘warping young people’s views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour’. ‘Prevention has to be the key and that means recognising warning signs early and taking swift action,’ he added. ‘For very young children we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way. ‘It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they’ve seen.’","Data released by police under freedom of information laws reveals that in Manchester the boy of seven was accused of raping a girl under 13 .

"The city of Cleveland is hoping to hand over the investigation of a 12-year-old boy's fatal shooting by police to an outside agency, as well as future investigations of all deadly use-of-force cases. Michael McGrath, the city's safety director and its former police chief, has been in talks with Cuyahoga County officials for the sheriff's office to handle the inquiry, city spokesman Dan Ball told the Northeast Ohio Media Group on Thursday. 'We would like a different, outside agency to handle all deadly use of force cases,' Ball said. For now, a Cleveland police deadly force investigation team is collecting evidence and conducting interviews related to the November 22 shooting. Under review: The investigation into the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police officer could soon be handed over to an outside agency . 'The best way to do it is to have external eyes look at anything regarding use of force cases,' Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said. The move follows a damning report from the U.S. Department of Justice, which lambasted the city for the way the department f trains officers in using deadly force, investigates uses of deadly force and disciplines officers for using force. Rice was carrying an airsoft gun that shoots nonlethal plastic pellets when a rookie officer shot him in a Cleveland playground. His mother, Samaria Rice, said her son was shot before he could respond to orders after the police pulled up next to him on a Cleveland playground and a rookie officer fired within two seconds. Rice said she wants the officer charged with murder and she called on authorities to make sure young officers don't 'ignore the training.' Samaria Rice has said her son Tamir, 12, was shot before he could respond to orders after the police pulled up next to him on a Cleveland playground and a rookie officer fired within two seconds last month. Rice said that when she tried to get close to her bleeding son, officers 'pushed me back, telling me to chill out or they were going to put me in the police car' Police say officers were responding to a call November 22 about someone possibly carrying a gun. Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic pellets. They say Tamir didn't respond to commands to raise his hands before Officer Timothy Loehmann fired his weapon. They also meant to stop the patrol car farther from Tamir but the vehicle slid on the grass, the Cleveland police union has said. in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Rice she found out later that Tamir was handed the fake weapon by a girl at the playground. She said police also put Tamir's 14-year-old sister in handcuffs as she rushed to help her mortally wounded brother that day. Rice's attorney, Benjamin Crump, told AP interview that the two officers could have defused the situation - by talking to the boy from a distance instead of pulling up next to him on the grass and firing. An internal Cleveland police investigation is underway and the results will be turned over to the local prosecutor, who will present them to a grand jury. The fatal encounter was caught on surveillance video. Clutching Crump's hand, the teary-eyed mother said on Monday she knew exactly where her son had gone before the shooting. Police say officers were responding to a call November 22 about someone possibly carrying a gun - but Tamir had an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic pellets . After she made lunch for him, he went to a recreation center across the street from their home then to the playground that is steps away from his school. His 14-year-old sister was with him, their mother said, 'and I told them to stick together and be safe.' The sister had gone to the bathroom when she heard a shot. Meanwhile, just after 3 p.m. that day, the mother heard a knock on her door. 'Two little boys came and knocked on my door and said, 'The police just shot your son twice in the stomach,'' she recalled Monday. When she got to the scene, following her 16-year-old son, she saw him being held against the police car, with officers surrounding him while Tamir lay on the ground, she said. Tamir's sister was in the back of the cruiser, their mother said. Rice said that when she tried to get close to her bleeding son, officers 'pushed me back, telling me to chill out or they were going to put me in the police car.' Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home on December 3 . Rice, who is black, said she long ago had 'The Talk' with her children - as black parents call warnings to their children to comply with police or risk danger. 'My kids already know that they are supposed to cooperate with authority, period,' she said. She said her son was talented in sports and the arts and was loved in their community as someone who helped others. 'All lives matter, I don't see any color. I see boys,' she said.","Tamir Rice, 12, was shot dead by police in Cleveland on November 22 .

"Parenting classes for men are to be launched after a survey showed Britain’s 16-year-olds are now more likely to own a smartphone than have a father living at home. Iain Duncan Smith says today that radical steps are needed to reverse the collapse in the two-parent family, which means that a million children are growing up without the influence of a father. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Government is planning to offer classes in parenting, tailored only for men, to rival the traditional ante-natal sessions attended by most pregnant women. Parenting classes for men are to be launched after a survey showed Britain’s 16-year-olds are now more likely to own a smartphone than have a father living at home . Pilot projects will begin this year in areas with high rates of family breakdown, including Cheshire and Merseyside, the North East, London, East England and the Midlands. Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘It is not only the bond between a mother and her child which makes a real difference to a child’s life, it is the bond between a father and his child too. ‘The problem of absent fathers is far too common – with households left worse off and, more importantly, children left without the positive involvement of two parents in their life.’ Research by the think-tank Mr Duncan Smith set up, the Centre for Social Justice, has found that 62 per cent of teenagers sitting their GCSEs own a smartphone, compared with only 57 per cent who are still living with both parents. ‘This is a shocking reality – and I believe it cannot but have a negative impact on our society,’ he said. ‘As a society, we must do more to nurture loving family relationships and encourage parental attachment. Government has a role to play too. That is why we are introducing relationship support for fathers, and families as a whole. If we are serious about promoting a strong society, then we also have to be serious about seeking to support and strengthen families.’ Iain Duncan Smith says today that radical steps are needed to reverse the collapse in the two-parent family, which means that a million children are growing up without the influence of a father . The CSJ warns that without concerted Government action, by 2020 nearly half of all children taking their GCSEs – 48 per cent – will come from broken homes. Mr Duncan Smith, the Cabinet’s staunchest champion of marriage, said many single-parent families do an ‘exceptionally good job’ of bringing up children. But he said there was clear evidence that divorce ‘does harm to children – affecting everything from school work to eating habits, as well as their relationship with mum and dad’. He believes classes teaching about the importance of fatherhood should become the norm. An expert panel of charities and organisations which have already drawn up new advice on parenting, which is being added to ante-natal classes, will design the scheme. The Department for Work and Pensions is proposing ‘men-only sessions’ and ensuring supporting material is not ‘mother-centric’. Sessions will be designed to prepare fathers for the likely impact having a baby will have on their relationship, help them to develop relationship and communication skills, to recognise potential flashpoints and where to go for further support.","Pilot projects will begin in areas with high rates of family breakdown .

"The number of victims coming forward with allegations of historical child abuse could reach ‘many tens of thousands’, an MP has warned. John Mann said the state ‘can't deal with’ the volume of claims that are being made. The Labour MP for Bassetlaw suggested a national institute needed to be created to handle the complaints. John Mann, MP, has said the state will not be able to cope with the number of people coming forward with historic child sex abuse claims while Theresa May, right, is still considering the make-up of the body . A Government inquiry has been set-up to investigate historic child abuse following claims of a VIP paedophile ring operating in Westminster in the 1980s. But it has been mired in uncertainty with two candidates for chair - former judge Baroness Butler-Sloss and ex-Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf - having to stand aside over their establishment links. Mr Mann said there had been too much emphasis on individuals. ‘It's not just about who chairs an inquiry, it's about what the remit of an inquiry should be, who else should be sat on that inquiry, who should be advising it,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘As an example, one of the things that survivors' groups are calling for in the discussions I've had with them is for government to set up a national institute to take forward this work on what you do with all these people coming forward. ‘Probably, it's going to be many tens of thousands of people across the country. The state can't deal with the numbers of people coming forward. ‘The police and social services cannot cope with the volume that's there, even now. And we're hardly at the beginning of people coming forward.’ Mr Mann, who has given a dossier of allegations of historical abuse to Scotland Yard, added: ‘I'm getting vast numbers of people, including my constituents, coming forward making allegations. 'Many of those people came forward in the past and weren't listened to or weren't believed. ‘And that's a key part of the problem. 'What do you do with people making allegations against people, and nothing was done in the past, when the people they're making allegations against in some cases are dead?’ The historic child abuse inquiry panel has started work but still has no-one to lead it. Home Secretary Theresa May, who set up the inquiry, is still considering its format and has told the current panel it might be disbanded.

"The first wife of Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs has died aged 75, just a year after the criminal husband with whom she went into hiding in Australia also passed away. Charmian Brent was 17 when she met Biggs, then 27 and already a petty criminal, on a commuter train in 1957 - and her school headmaster father forbade her from seeing him. His advice was well-founded. Six years later Biggs would become the most notorious figure in the 1963 raid which stole £2.6million of banknotes from a Glasgow to London mail train. Scroll down for video . Death: Charmian Brent (left) was 17 when she met Biggs (right), then 27 and already a petty criminal, on a commuter train in 1957. The pair are pictured together two years before their 1976 divorce . Fugitives: Biggs (left in 1992) and his wife (right) fled to Australia where they lived together for three years . Despite insisting the first she knew of his crime was when he came home with a six-figure share of the loot, Mrs Biggs stuck by her husband. When he fled to Australia on a false passport after breaking out of prison - stopping on the way in Paris for £40,000 of plastic surgery - she waited until he had settled and then joined him. They lived together in Perth and Melbourne for three years under false names and had a third child. Having run a boarding house when he arrived in Australia under the name Terry King, Biggs took a job as a foreman carpenter at a Melbourne airport in the name of Cooke. But in 1969, Interpol were tipped off and Biggs fled to Brazil. Despite everything, Charmian remained on good terms with her husband after their 1976 divorce - triggered by him fathering a son with another woman in his new country. Audacious: The raiders escaped with £2.6million but left the train's driver with permanent injuries . Couple: Ronnie Biggs was ten years Charmian's senior when the met on a commuter train in 1957 . If it was a love match, it was also a marriage of convenience. Once Biggs' new lover Raimunda de Castro was pregnant, he became immune from extradition as the father of a Brazilian child. When the robber died in December 2013 - 12 years after he finally returned to Britain and jail amid ailing health - his Brazilian-born son revealed his first wife would receive a third of his ashes. In the robber's typically unrepentant style, another third of the ashes were to be spread over the scene of the crime at Bridego Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire. Charmian was allowed to stay in Australia with their children, later revealing her husband had spent all his loot, a lot of it in 'bribes and hush money'. After their 1976 divorce she sold her story to an Australian media group for a reported £40,000, the first of many such deals. She was also paid an undisclosed consultancy fee for the ITV series Mrs Biggs in 2012, which chronicled her relationship with one of Britain's most notorious criminals. Controversial: The former Mrs Biggs, pictured in 1996, sold her story about her life with him several times . Dramatised: Payments included a consultant's fee for the ITV drama Mrs Biggs, made in 2012 (pictured) The payouts sparked an outcry and left a particularly bitter taste in the mouth of the Jack Mills' widow. He was the train driver who stopped to investigate rail signals which Biggs' gang had fixed, and was knocked out by an iron bar forcing him to give up work. He died seven years later. Following an outcry over Charmian Biggs 'cashing in' on her husband's crime the Daily Mail sponsored a fund to help Mills's family, raising more than £34,000 by the time of his death. Gesture: Biggs a few months before his death at the funeral of the robbery's mastermind Bruce Reynolds . The former Mrs Biggs insisted she was publicity-shy, and swore in an interview more than a decade ago that she would say her final public words about her ex-husband's crime. 'I was never that way inclined,' she said at the time. 'I was horrified that Ron had endangered our future happiness and the happiness of two little children by participating in it. 'But once it had happened, I tried to do the right thing by him.' In one of her last interviews in 2012, the former Mrs Biggs - who reverted to her maiden name of Brent - said the train robber had 'abandoned' her two sons to focus on his Brazilian child, Michael. Yet she still admitted she would 'probably do it all over again' if she was given the chance. And she never truly found love again in the four decades after her divorce. 'Once you’ve been through that, you don’t lay yourself open to it again,' she told Radio Times. 'You don’t put your fate in somebody else’s hands ever again. He was a hard act to follow.' The last time she met up with Biggs was in Britain in 2009, the year he was controversially granted compassionate release on health grounds. He had suffered several strokes and could only communicate using a letter board. 'He saw that I had tears in my eyes,' she said. 'He pointed at himself and then his little board and spelt out the words ""love"" and then pointed at me. Ms Brent died at Melbourne's Epworth Hospital on December 11. She is survived by  two sons and four grandchildren. The country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed 35 miles from its London destination in August 1963. A 17-strong gang launched the raid on the overnight service from Glasgow at the Bridego Railway Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire in the early hours of August 8 in what has been dubbed the 'crime of the century'. Led by the charismatic Bruce Reynolds, the group of criminals pulled off the notorious heist, making off with £2.6million - the equivalent of £40million today. The train was stopped at a set of fixed signals which the gang had switched, leading driver Jack Mills to go and investigate. He was knocked out by an iron bar wielded by an unknown member of the gang, forcing him to give up work, and he died seven years later. Following an outcry over Charmian Biggs cashing in on her husband's crime, the Daily Mail sponsored a fund to help Mills's family, raising more than £34,000 by the time of his death. The bulk of the huge haul has never been recovered. The gang shared out the proceeds at isolated Leatherslade Farm - Biggs taking around £148,000 - but thereafter things started to go badly wrong, with nearly all the gang members being rounded up by the police. In fact, the Leatherslade Farm hide-out was a huge mistake on the part of the gang. The police were telling reporters that they were looking for an isolated farm which had just changed hands and which was 25 miles from the scene of the crime. Leatherslade met every one of these requirements. When the gang became aware that the police were hot on their scent, they quit the farm hurriedly, leaving behind scores of tell-tale fingerprints. Most of the ringleaders were quickly rounded up, and 11 of the robbers got jail sentences ranging from 14 to 30 years.","Charmian Brent was just 17 when she met petty criminal Biggs, then 27 .

"More people were killed by crocodiles in the Northern Territory in 2014 than any other year since records began, and there will be more deaths, a wildlife ranger says. Saltwater crocodiles killed four Territorians last year, which is almost one-fifth of the total 21 people killed since 1974. This also comes as a significant number of saltwater crocodiles were captured by the Northern Territory's Parks and Wildlife Commission. Saltwater crocodiles killed four Territorians last year, which is almost one-fifth of the total 21 people killed since 1974. Albino croc Michael Jackson maul Tran Van Lanh, 57, to death in August . In 2014, the NT crocodile management team removed 287 saltwater crocodiles from the territory's waterways, up from 226 in 2013. Wildlife ranger Tom Nichols said last year's number was close to toppling the most number of crocodiles ever caught, which is 318 in 2012. 2014's numbers meant more than five saltwater crocodiles were removed from the Top End's waterways every week. Mr Nichols told AAP last year's number of crocodile deaths were concerning. This also comes as a significant number of saltwater crocodiles were captured by the Northern Territory's Parks and Wildlife Commission . 'This is the highest number of fatalities in one year since it's been recorded,' he said. January . June . August . Most of those deaths were due to negligence in crocodile-infested waters, Mr Nichols said, and it was possible residents were becoming complacent, with more people out on the waterways, and high crocodile numbers. 'We're trying to get the CrocWise message across as best as possible, but unfortunately we will get another [death], we just don't know when,' he said. 'Stay away from the water, don't put your hands near the water, use hooks or nets to retrieve fish from the water. 'When you're fishing from the banks stay five metres back from the water's edge, don't have your camp close to the water.' Three-quarters of last year's saltwater crocodiles were trapped in Darwin Harbour, with two over four metres long. The largest crocodile caught in 2014 was 4.75m long at Daly River - south of Darwin - on December 16. But Mr Nichols hosed down speculation about a cull, saying it was a decision to be made by the federal government, which listed saltwater crocodiles as a protected species in 1971. It could negatively impact the NT crocodile industry, which is worth about $20 million per year, he said, and could lull people into a false sense of security.","Four Territorians killed last year - almost one-fifth of people killed ever .
There was also a record number of saltwater crocodiles captured in NT .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been advised to give up cycling or face an accident by his recently retired doctor. Dr Graeme Killer, who was also the former personal physician to the likes of Prime Ministers Paul Keating, John Howard and Kevin Rudd, told The Australian: ‘One day he’ll come off.’ Dr Killer made the stern warning after retiring on Christmas Eve. He explained how his medical career, which has included serving for 23 years in the Royal Australia Airforce (RAAF) including overseas postings to Malaysia during the Vietnam War, has left him convinced that cycling is a dangerous sport not suited for Prime Ministers. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott, seen here returning from a morning bicycle ride in Sydney, has been warned to quit cycling . Dr Killer made the stern warning to Tony Abbott after retiring as the Prime Minister's docter on Christmas Eve . Dr Killer’s son, a keen cyclist, suffered an accident that left him needing a shoulder replacement after someone opened a car door into him. However, one of Mr Abbott’s cycling friends told 3AW the PM faces ‘as many risks from kangaroos as we do from cars’ when they cycle around Canberra together. Rejecting calls for Abbott to get off his bike, Stephen Hodge, Government Relations Manager for the Cycling Promotion Fund, added: ‘But in big cities like Melbourne you have to be careful.’ Mr Hodge said Mr Abbott had asked for his advice on the safety of cycling before. Mr Abbott, seen here in action during an early morning bike ride  outside Parliament House in Canberra, has been advised to give up cycling over safety fears .

But when it came to cricket, the PM said his only ability on the field was sledging. Speaking at Kirribilli House in Sydney on Thursday, the PM revealed: ‘I couldn't bat, I couldn't bowl, I couldn't field, but I could sledge, and I think I held my place in the team on this basis.’ Mr Abbott was talking about his time as the captain of Oxford’s Middle Common Room team at Queen’s College, as tensions between the Australian and Indian cricket teams boiled over this week.","Dr Graeme Killer sent out a stern warning to the PM after recently retiring .

"A little-used airport which is 70 miles from the capital has been renamed London Ashford ahead of work to transform it into a busy passenger hub . Construction work on a 965ft extension of the runway at Lydd airport in Kent, which once handled more passengers a year than Gatwick, will begin this year and will eventually lead to a new terminal being built. This month pre-qualified contractors will be invited to submit offers for the runway work at Lydd. The planned new terminal at Lydd Airport (pictured), which has the official name of London Ashford Aiport . The £25 million development at Lydd will enable the airport to handle aircraft up to the size of Boeing 737s or Airbus A319s. At present, the runway is only long enough to cope with smaller aircraft on short flights, with Lydd Air running services to Le Touquet in France. The start of the runway extension ends years of uncertainty for the Kent airport. A long planning process finally ended in April 2013 when the Government gave the go-ahead for the runway extension and the terminal. The £25 million development at Lydd will enable the airport to handle aircraft up to the size of Boeing 737s . The development had been subject to a public inquiry which lasted from February to September 2011. Plans had been submitted as early as the year 2000 and were agreed in 2010 by Shepway District Council before the decision was taken to hold a public inquiry. Lydd Aiport's chief executive Charles Buchanan . Lydd opened in 1954 and for a time there were daily servies to Le Touquet and Ostend. In 1958 a total of nearly 223,000 passengers passed through Lydd - nearly 37,000 more than at Gatwick. By the 1960s Lydd had become an internationally-recognised airport with film stars such as Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart regularly flying in and out. But the expansion of Gatwick cast a shadow over Lydd and its influence waned. Now the airport's chief executive Charles Buchanan is looking forward to showcasing Lydd's plans at international aviation events this year. He said: 'We look forward to spreading the word about our ambitious investment plans with airlines, tour operators and other travel businesses attending these events. 'These events attract high-level decision-makers and buyers from across the travel and aviation industries worldwide and provide an excellent platform for us to explore new business opportunities. 'London Ashford Airport is the perfect base for airline operators. 'Our runway extension will enable regional jet aircraft to fly a full payload of passengers to a wider range of destinations across Europe. 'We are also providing much-needed additional airport capacity in the south east of England. 'We offer easy access to the motorway network, just 20 minutes to Ashford which also has a high-speed rail link that gets you into central London in just 38 minutes.'

"Revellers were forced to wait until to 12.04am to celebrate the New Year in Manchester city centre after a tram delayed the firework display. More than 15,000 people who had crammed into the city's Piccadilly Gardens to see in 2015 were told it had been delayed after the Metrolink tram pulled into the 'fallout zone'. Organisers said the display could not go ahead until the train had been moved, because it was in the catchment area of where debris could fall and therefore not safe. Scroll down for video . Organisers told the 15,000-strong crowd that the New Year firework display could not go ahead until the train had been moved, because it was in the catchment area of where debris could fall and therefore was not safe . The crowd in Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens were forced to wait until the tram was moved out of the way . The event host could be heard over the microphone telling the patient crowd that there was 'just a small hitch' after the display failed to start at midnight. Families had gathered in the city centre square from 10pm to watch the display but couldn't start their celebrations until the tram issue was resolved at 12.04am. Over the microphone, the event host told the crowd: 'Just a small hitch, we're just waiting for a tram to pull out. 'Get out of the way of the fireworks, Mr Tram. 'As soon as the tram goes out the fireworks will go off. 'We going to give you 10 seconds to get out of Piccadilly Mr Tram.' The crowd then counted down from 10 to 1 before cheering, yet they were forced to wait in the cold for several more minutes before the issue was rectified. The host later joked: 'You're all welcome to come next year, but there's no trams coming.' At 12.04am when the tram had finally been moved from the station, he told the crowd: 'Right, countdown. This is for real now,' before the fireworks erupted over the night sky. Organisers said the Metrolink tram (like the one pictured) pulled into the 'fallout zone' and the display had to be put on hold until it had been moved because it could be caught by debris and was therefore not safe . The display was eventually given the go-ahead at 12.04am, meaning the crowd had to wait four minutes . The event host could be heard over the microphone telling the  crowd that there was 'just a small hitch' after the display failed to start at midnight. It went ahead at 12.04am after the tram was moved from the station . Patrick Karney, Manchester council's city centre spokesman, said the delay 'added to the excitement'. He told Manchester Evening News: 'It was a fabulous Manchester crowd, the biggest we've ever had for a firework display. 'The tram delay added extra excitement and suspense to the occasion. I'll leave it to the transport authority to check what happened.' It is not known why the tram pulled into the Piccadilly station, but it is thought the drivers were warned about the firework display prior to the New Year event. Manchester police said the event, which was funded by the owners of the city's big wheel, was a peaceful affair with just two arrests in the vicinity - one for being drunk and disorderly and another for breach of the peace. One of Britain's remotest communities will not celebrate the New Year until nearly two weeks after the rest of the country - because it still adheres to an ancient calendar for the festivity. Foula in Shetland is still to even celebrate Christmas. It marks Christmas and New Year according to the feast days of the old Julian calendar - Yule on January 6 and Newerday on January 13. The community of just over 30 on the tiny Shetland island has a strong Norse tradition of folklore, music and special festivities. Its inhabitants were the last to speak Norn, a form of old Norse which died out around 1800. Islanders, including six children, will gather in one house to celebrate Christmas where they will exchange gifts and greetings. Remote Foula, in Shetland (pictured), which has just over 30 residents, marks Christmas and New Year according to the feast days of the ancient Julian calendar - Yule on January 6 and Newerday on January 13 . Jim Gear, 71, who was born on the island, said: 'Islanders have celebrated these days every since the Georgian Calendar. 'We have carried this long for a long time - it is part of our tradition. 'We are not unique - other parts of the world still celebrate the old calendar. When New Year comes we will visit each others' houses.' The island is three-and-a-half miles long by two-and-a-half miles wide. At one point, Foula - which lies 15 miles west of mainland Shetland and 100 miles north of mainland Scotland, on the same latitude as southern Greenland - sustained 287 people. Foula got running water in 1982 and full electricity by 1984, supplied by a diesel generator. It currently has a renewable energy system - mainly photo voltaic - backed up by diesel. The isle is so remote and prone to the weather that attempts by the last Church of Scotland minister, the Rev. Tom Macintyre, to reach it for one Christmas service had to be abandoned after three attempts. Foula - meaning 'bird island' in old Norse - was the location for the film The Edge of the World. The RMS Oceanic was wrecked on the nearby Shaalds of Foula.","Revellers forced to wait four minutes after tram delayed firework display .

"Dane Kowalski, 27, left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin . The best friend of a 27-year-old man who has been missing for 20 days, is so desperate to find his mate that he has offered $25,000 in reward money from his own pocket for any information. There has been no trace of Dane Kowalski, 27, since he left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin where he planned to meet up with some local friends. Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then [December 12]; his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' There has been no trace of the 27-year-old since that day: His phone and bank accounts remaining untouched . The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. Now, his friends and family are considering hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. Four of the much-loved man's friends returned home two days ago after driving from Melbourne to Darwin, handing out missing posters and looking for signs of their missing friend. They flew back to Darwin on New Year's Day to continue their search. 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said. Desperate: Mr Kowalski's friends and family have launched a widespread search in which they have retraced his footsteps from Victoria to Darwin and handed out hundreds of missing posters . 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said . One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Mr Kowalski's family that the young man may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken. It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records, but to no avail. Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him. 'Even if people just put one flyer up on the back of their car windscreen – that's incredible and everything is appreciated,' Ms Taylor said. 'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's ok. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home.

"Two IRA terrorists involved in a foiled bomb attack on an Army barracks have been arrested on suspicion of money-laundering in Spain. Leonard ‘Bap’ Hardy and his wife Donna Maguire, who tried to blow up the base at Osnabruck, Germany, in 1989, were held in a police station in Malaga earlier this week. A Spanish man was also held over the alleged scam. Leonard ‘Bap’ Hardy (left) and his wife Donna Maguire (right), who tried to blow up the base at Osnabruck, Germany, in 1989, were held in a police station in Malaga earlier this week . The couple, from Dundalk, County Louth, who have four children, were yesterday waiting to hear whether they would be released without charge or have their detention extended, according to the Sun newspaper. Local police were unable to give any further information. In 2006, Hardy, now 53, was sentenced to six years in jail by a court in Celle, Germany, for his part in the Osnabruck plot, in which he ‘intended to kill as many British soldiers as possible’. But he walked free because the offence took place before 1998’s Good Friday Agreement, which saw those convicted of IRA terror offences released from prison. In the plot, five bombs containing 330lb of Semtex were planted at Quebec barracks, at the Osnabruck base . Four others involved in the bombing – including Maguire, now 57 – were convicted of attempted murder in 1995. Maguire, a former convent girl once described as the most dangerous woman in Europe, received a nine-year sentence for spying on British military bases in Germany with intent to sabotage. But she was also freed immediately because she had spent almost six years on remand. In the plot, five bombs containing 330lb of Semtex were planted at Quebec barracks, at the Osnabruck base. They were discovered at the last minute when a civilian employee surprised two attackers. One bomb exploded, causing extensive damage but no casualties. Hardy also avoided jail last July after settling a £280,000 tax bill and pleading guilty to eight counts of failing to file tax returns. He paid a fine of £6,500.

"A mother and son died in a fire on New Year’s Eve despite friends’ frantic efforts to save them. Neighbours smashed down the door and even ventured inside to try to help Doreen Nicholl, 86, and her 61-year-old son John. But the former dinner lady and her son were killed as the blaze engulfed their home. The victims have been named as John Nicholl, left, and his mother Doreen who died in the tragic blaze . Neighbours tried in vain to arrest two people, in their 80s and 60s, from a fatal house fire in Deptford . An 18-year-old man broke down the door at 9.20pm, while others turned hoses on the flames. Judith Hickson, 64, rushed inside in her pyjamas to the front room where her close friend Mrs Nicholl slept. But another neighbour pulled Mrs Hickson back outside, fearing the house in Deptford, south-east London, would blow up. Mrs Nicholl, a grandmother of four, had lost her husband, Jim, to cancer four years earlier. John had moved in to take care of her. Mrs Hickson, who had an angina attack after the fire, said: ‘I just needed to get to her, I knew exactly where she would be sleeping so I ran inside, but the smoke was too much. Once I was in the corridor, I couldn’t see a thing, it was all orange. ‘David, who lives opposite, had been in and came out spluttering and coughing, but I thought if I could get to her, I could get her out. Then a neighbour grabbed me and pulled me outside, saying the house could blow up. Doreen was an amazing lady, everyone on the street adored her.’ Clare McKevitt, 34, who lives two doors down, used her garden hose to fight the fire. She said: ‘Windows were smashing and there was smoke everywhere.’ Police are investigating how the blaze started. Fire station manager Lee Sparks said: ‘Crews wearing breathing apparatus worked quickly to control the fire and search the house. Sadly, they found two people who had died.’ Firefighters were called to the property in Ashmead Road in Lewisham at about 9.45pm on New Year's Eve . The ground floor of the house was damaged by the blaze and firefighters found the two bodies inside it .

"Sick and injured patients were forced to wait in ambulances for up to four-and-a-half hours outside hospitals as accident and emergency departments struggled on New Year's Eve. In Cardiff a dozen ambulances were stuck outside the city's hospital waiting to offload sick patients on the busiest day of the year because of a lack of emergency beds. 13 ambulances were seen queuing outside the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital  yesterday and people had to be treated on trolleys in a corridor as bosses declared a 'major incident'. Some patients had to be assessed by doctors in the back of an ambulance. At Harlow's Princess Alexandra Hospital they were only open to the seriously ill or badly injured while in Bristol people were urged to 'act responsibly' and expect to 'wait a long time' if they turned up but were not an emergency. Waiting time: In Cardiff a dozen ambulances were stuck outside the city's hospital waiting to offload sick patients on the busiest day of the year . Earlier this year health bosses in Southampton issued a 'black alert' for hospitals because there were no empty beds. It came as it emerged almost 15,000 people across Britain had to wait outside accident and emergency for more than 30 minutes in the first two weeks of December, the latest figures. In 2013 the equivalent figure was less than 10,000. Earlier this month waiting times in A&E departments hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours. Relatives described corridors resembling 'military field hospitals' with patients lining up on chairs or trolleys because there were no beds available. New Year's Eve is traditionally the busiest day of the year for accident and emergency departments. London Ambulance Service faced huge demand during the night, and tweeted: 'It's been an incredibly busy night. During peak times we were taking around 450 calls an hour.' West Midlands Ambulance Service, which covers Birmingham as well as five other counties, said between 8pm on New Year's Eve and 4am on New Year's Day, handlers responded to 1,436 999 calls. Today frustrated paramedics said they were 'fighting a losing battle against the system' after the ambulances were seen queued up outside the University Hospital of Wales  just hours before they faced what a health board boss billed 'their busiest night of the year'. Staff at the Welsh Ambulance Service, which has come under fire for failing to hit Welsh Government emergency response times, warned they will never reach expected targets due to a lack of emergency beds. 'Major incident': Problems with a lack of beds meant that patients could not be moved into Norfolk and Norwich Hospital yesterday . One paramedic in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (UHB) area, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'If there are no beds in the hospital how can we be expected to offload patients? 'We need to look at changing the whole system again. The paramedic said the situation was getting worse and has now become a year-round problem. 'It's all about crisis management,' he said. 'We are doing the job to the best of our ability. The problems stop and start with the hospital itself.' South Wales resident Jonathan Davies said his 81-year-old father waited four-and-a-half hours in an ambulance before being admitted onto the emergency ward at the hospital in Heath. The pensioner was suffering abdominal pains and an ambulance was called at 11.40am but Jonathan claimed his father was not seen until well after 4pm. Speaking from the University Hospital of Wales, he said: 'The ambulance service have their hands tied because they cannot get patients into A&E. It's having a knock-on effect. 'It's an awful situation for my father but thankfully the morphine eased the pain.' Denise Burke, from the Act on Ambulances campaign, spent the day with ambulance crews in north Norfolk yesterday and found 13 ambulances queuing outside a Norwich hospital. She said a further eight people were treated on trollies because of a lack of beds in A&E. She tweeted: '50 mins after arriving we can now offload patient from ambulance, beggars belief! Now space in corridor for trolley!' On another occasion she said: 'We were waiting for about three quarters of an hour to hand one patient over'.","Patients had to wait for up to four-and-a-half hours in an ambulance .

"Ana Rita Teixeira Ferras, 26, was jailed after she set up sham weddings between women from the EU and men from Africa so they could stay in the UK . A woman who set up sham weddings between European women and African migrants so they could stay in Britain has been jailed. Ana Rita Teixeira Ferras, 26, set up at least three fake marriage in 2012 between women from the EU and men from west Africa. She even took part in a scam herself and married a man in 2007 and helped produce false payslips to be used by those who had had sham marriages when they made applications to the Home Office to stay in the country. Ferras even fled back to her home country of Portugal when police caught up with her at her home in Highbrook, Northamptonshire, and was only brought back to the UK after a European Arrest Warrant was issued. During a hearing at at Northampton Crown Court Ferras admitted four counts of facilitating a breach of immigration law. She was jailed for four years and three months. Several accomplices in the ring have previously been convicted for their part of the scheme as part of a Home Office investigation called Operation Marco. Jessica Nunes, 21, from Corby, Northamptonshire, was handed a 12 month suspended sentence in April 2013. Nunes, a student, married a man called Oluwasegun Omoniyi, also a student in another fake wedding. He too was jailed for 44 weeks for his part in the plot after pleading guilty to attempting to obtain leave to remain in the UK by deception. Samantha McDonald, 26, from Corby, was handed a 14 month suspended sentence in November 2013 after pleading guilty to one count of facilitating a breach of immigration law. Speaking after Ferras's conviction, Andy Radcliffe, Home Office Criminal Investigations Officer, said: 'Ferris thought she could abuse and manipulate the immigration system to her own criminal ends. 'She was wrong and is now behind bars. 'The use of the European Arrest Warrant was vital to being able to return Ferris to the UK and bring this investigation to a successful conclusion. Ferras was jailed for four years and three months after at a hearing at Northampton Crown Court she pleaded guilty to four charges of facilitating a breach of immigration law for organising sham marriages . 'Thanks to this, and the dedication and meticulous hard work of the Home Office Criminal Investigation team she has now been brought to justice.' Last month ringleaders of a different sham marriage gang which arranged fake weddings for foreign men who wanted to gain British citizenship were jailed. Ibrahim Mahter, 29, and Abdulgani Makrani, 66, organised at least seven fake marriages for men from Pakistan and India, offering women up to £8,000 to take a foreign husband. Mahter was jailed for four years and Makrani for three and a half years after they were convicted of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law, between November 2005 and October 2012.","Ana Rita Teixeira Ferras, 26, set up a string of fake weddings in 2012 .

Military chiefs must stand up to politicians and stop passively accepting plans or Britain will lose more wars, a former Major General has warned. Christopher Elliott highlights infighting and a fear to question senior officials, as key factors in the defeats suffered by Britain in the last decade. The former Major General's critique of the military's handling of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq is contained in a new book High Command, based on interviews with military figures and those in the Ministry of Defence over two years. His interviews expose a dysfunctional leadership within the army and are published ahead of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war. 'At the moment the UK is bound to fall in its face unless someone makes an honest appreciation of what they want [armed] forces for,' he told The Times. The book also highlights major decisions often being taken by two senior politicians with the MOD tasked with making plans fit rather than questioning them. 'The result of all this was that the MoD became absorbed with making plans work, instead of pausing sufficiently to probe whether the plans themselves were workable,' Mr Elliott wrote. Oxford University Press describes High Command: British Military Leadership in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, as 'a scathing indictment of the military's decisions in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Elliott's book explores the reasons behind the failures in the military campaigns, citing a lack of ownership and involvement in key decisions by senior Army figures. He quotes Lord West of Spithead, head of the Navy at the time, as saying he found out about things 'after they had been decided and I often didn't know where a decision had been made.' The warnings are contained in Mr Elliott's book High Command, composed of interviews and research . The book also exposes infighting, with naval officers admitting to jealousy over the amount of publicity soldiers in Afghanistan received because of the scale of deaths. Major General Christopher Elliott CBE retired from the army in 2002, having held a number of senior appointments in the Ministry of Defence, including Director of Military Operations, Commander 6, Armoured Brigade, Director of the Higher Command and Staff Course.","Former Major General Christopher Elliott wrote book about army failures .

"EU bureaucrats want new percolators to switch off automatically within five minutes of brewing . They've already banned powerful vacuum cleaners and outlawed traditional lightbulbs. Now Brussels has come up with a new way to force us to save energy – and it will be particularly hard to swallow for coffee lovers. EU bureaucrats want our new percolators to switch off automatically within five minutes of brewing. New measures came into effect yesterday which demand that everything from computer modems to ‘smart’ televisions must have the ability to go into standby mode if no task is performed for several minutes. Although coffee machines bought at Christmas are likely to be exempt from the ruling, new ones must meet the stringent EU energy regulations. As with vacuum cleaners, it is understood shops can still sell the old models while stocks last. But it could prompt another retail frenzy as people rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes. The European Commission says the changes will save consumers money on their electricity bills and be better for the environment, but critics say it will leave people with cold coffee. The new rules state that drip filter coffee machines that have insulated jugs to keep the drink warm must power down their heated plate or element five minutes after brewing. Those with non-insulated jugs must go on standby within 40 minutes of use. Espresso machines should turn off after half an hour. It is the latest in a string of controversial energy-saving changes brought in by the EU. Traditional lightbulbs have already been axed and Europe barred powerful vacuum cleaners in September – which sparked a stampede to buy high-power models in the UK. The EU is also expected to impose limits on high-power hairdryers, irons, kettles, toasters and even lawn mowers. The latest diktat will fuel claims that consumer choice is being restricted, even though analysis by the New Economics Foundation found the new rules on coffee machines alone could save consumers a total of £46million a year in energy by 2020. Other experts suggested that any coffee brewed for longer than 40 minutes would be undrinkable anyway. Marylyn Haines Evans, of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, said: ‘With a better-designed appliance you can enjoy a coffee without the bitter taste of wasting energy or adding unnecessarily to the climate problem.’ The ruling could prompt a retail frenzy as coffee drinkers rush to snap up percolators that do not go on standby after several minutes . From yesterday, new devices connected to the internet 24 hours a day such as modems, routers and smart TVs and printers must also go into standby mode when not in use. Eurocrats say all the changes would save an average household about £32 a year. Monique Goyens, of the European Consumer Organisation, said: ‘Improving the energy consumption levels of everyday consumer products is the right approach to contribute some relief to consumers from increasing energy bills.’ The changes to vacuum cleaners prompted public outcry in what was later dubbed ‘Hoovergate’. The directive banned vacuum cleaners of more than 1,600 watts in an attempt to reduce energy consumption and this will be further reduced to 900 watts by 2017. To help homeowners beat the EU ban, The Mail teamed up with Hoover to offer readers an exclusive discount on several top vacuums.","Newly made coffee machines must meet stringent EU energy regulations .

Although this was the longest stint that Harley had slept rough outside the mint - it is not stopping him from striving for the quadrella next year - which is made possible due to Australia's time zone. 'It's the longest I've ever stayed so it was a bit more of a challenge,' he told the ABC. 'But there was some talk on Facebook that people were planning to get here on Boxing Day, so I decided I'd get here on Christmas.' His fascination with coins started when his mother showed him some of her own collection from when she was a child. 'Then we came to the mint and I saw some silver sets with holographic designs and I fell in love with it,' he told the ABC. 'I just see that at the end of it there's going to be a chance to build for my future. 'I won't be letting go of the coin anytime soon.'

"Federal prosecutors plan to use declassified documents recovered during the 2011 raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound during the trial of Abid Naseer, pictured,  in Brooklyn Federal Court . The trial of British a man who allegedly planned terrorist attacks on UK and American targets is to consider documents seized from the hideout of Osama bin Laden. Abid Naseer, 28, is to go on trial next month accused of plotting with other Al Qaeda operatives to blow up subway lines in Manhattan during rush hour around the eighth anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. US officials plan to use the secret documents which were seized when the terrorist leader was shot dead after US Navy Seals stormed his compound in Pakistan in 2011, as part of prosecution evidence. Naseer, from Manchester, is also facing charges in the US related to terror attacks on shoppers at the Trafford and Arndale centres in Manchester in 2009, and a further plot against trargets in Norway. His alleged planned attack in Manchester was referred to in coded messages intercepted by MI5 as ‘the wedding’ and was to have taken place when the stores were at their busiest. Pakistani national Naseer was arrested with 12 others in April 2009 after UK police uncovered the alleged plot. But all were released without charge because of lack of evidence. Naseer was extradited to the US in January 2013 following a two-year legal fight after officials linked him to three men suspected of the subway bombing plot. A British judge ruled that he could not be sent back to Pakistan as he might face torture but he would get a fair trial in the US. Details of the bin Laden documents, which were seized from his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, were revealed during a pre-trial hearing at Brooklyn federal court. It will the first time any material from the dead terror leader’s hideout have been used in a US terror trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zainab Ahmad told a court the US Government plan to declassify the documents for use in the trial. Naseer will defend himself during his trial next month at Brooklyn Federal Court, pictured . U.S. Federal authorities are using documents seized during the raid on Osama Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound on May 1, 2011 by U.S. Navy Seals who captured and killed the Al Qaeda leader . The U.S. attorney prosecuting the case said the government plans to declassify documents recovered during the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound . Naseer, who is defending himself, refused to study the Bin Laden document on Wednesday when given the opportunity. US authorities allege Medunjanin and his former high school friends Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay travelled to Pakistan in 2008 to seek terror training from Al Qaeda. Zazi and Ahmeddzay have pleaded guilty and awaiting sentencing and Menunjanin is serving a life sentence. Naseer faces life if found guilty.

"Police figures reveal a huge rise in the number of sexual abuse reports received from hospital patients, with 1,600 attacks recorded in the last three years. Data from 38 out of 45 police forces across the UK reveals a 50 per cent increase in reports of sexual violence in NHS hospitals, private clinics and health centres since 2011. The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian, show there were a total of 1,615 alleged attacks, which included 157 reports of rape. A small number reportedly relate to historic assaults which occurred before 2011. Data from 38 out of 45 police forces across the UK, released under a Freedom of Information, reveals a 50 per cent increase in reports of sexual violence in NHS hospitals, private clinics and health centres since 2011 . Data from Metropolitan Police showed the force received 17 reports of rapes and 124 reports of other sexual offences, accounting for 20 per cent of all reports, with mental health patients being particularly vulnerable. One victim, a mental health patient, described psychiatric hospitals as a 'playground for predators', and said she was raped up to 60 times by a member of staff. The woman, who was groomed with gifts from the senior staff member, said she only built up the courage to speak out about the abuse after she was released from Little Brook Hospital in Dartford, Kent. Remaining anonymous, she told the BBC earlier this year how she was admitted to the hospital after a breakdown. She said: 'At times I was on a very heavy amount of Valium, not to where I was unconscious, but the sedative combined with my already defeated self, I was like putty. He would pull the covers back, do what he had to do and leave, all very quickly. I didn't move.' She said she couldn't 'believe how it could have been so frequent and not picked up on.' She eventually received £100,000 compensation and her attacker received a suspended jail sentence. At the time, Kent and Medway NHS Trust said it was unable to comment because the offences occurred under the previous regime. Doctor Myles Bradbury, 41, (pictured) was jailed for 22 years earlier this month after sexually abusing desperately ill boys in his care at a specialist unit . Another victim told how she was groomed by her mental health support officer for five months, but he resigned before a police investigation concluded and authorities were unable to take action against him. Earlier this year, Doctor Myles Bradbury, 41, admitted sexually abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care at a specialist unit. The court heard how  the disgraced doctor targeted the boys – all of whom were 'really poorly' and vulnerable – in his private consulting room. He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a 'legitimate examination'. Bradbury, from Herringswell, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, was suspended from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last November after a victim's parents raised concerns with staff. He was jailed for 22 years at Cambridge Crown Court earlier this month, after pleading guilty to 25 offences against boys aged 10 to 16, including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images. Luciana Berger, shadow minister for public health, said the new figures were worrying and demanded that ministers order an immediate review of security. She told the Guardian's Martin Williams: 'A zero-tolerance approach to sexual abuse must be pursued in the NHS. 'All victims should feel safe to come forward and every incident properly dealt with by the police, courts and health service, to ensure every perpetrator is brought to justice.' Mind, a mental health charity, said it was 'completely unacceptable that sexual abuse was so prevalent within mental health units'. In a statement, Nat Miles, senior policy and campaigns officer, said: 'Many people told us they are often seen as vulnerable and therefore an easy target by perpetrators, and are more easily discredited and less likely to be taken seriously if they report a crime. 'Too often, crimes on wards are dealt with internally and not reported to police. It's vital that frontline staff are adequately trained, so crimes are taken seriously, and dealt with quickly and appropriately.' An NHS England spokesman said: 'It is of course essential that both NHS and independent hospitals do everything to ensure that patients are safe and feel safe in their premises, and where concerns arise the police must be able to bring to bear the full force of the law.'","Total of 1,615 sex abuse reports received by UK police forces since 2011 .

"He insists it would never cross his mind to use his wife to boost his own popularity. So it must have been someone else’s idea for Miriam Clegg to pose for a glamorous fashion shoot to accompany a cosy interview she and husband Nick gave to a glossy magazine. The couple shared how they first met and fell in love, with the Deputy Prime Minister apparently becoming quite tearful as he told the tale. Details about their home life and marriage also emerged in their first joint interview. Scroll down for video . He insists it would never cross his mind to use his wife to boost his own popularity.So it must have been someone else’s idea for Miriam Clegg to pose for a glamorous fashion shoot to accompany a cosy interview she and husband Nick gave to a glossy magazine . But despite using the occasion to show off his wife and talk about their relationship, the Lib Dem leader told Red magazine he would never try to use her for publicity. ‘We’re husband and wife,’ he said. ‘I don’t think of Miriam as some sort of PR seesaw. It would literally never occur to me.’ According to the magazine, Mr Clegg welled up as he told how he fell in love at first sight when he and Miriam were students in Bruges. ‘It was total thunderbolt stuff,’ he said before Spanish-born Mrs Clegg, a successful lawyer who uses her maiden name Gonzalez Durantez professionally, interrupted to say: ‘Oh no, this is going to get embarrassing.’ Mr Clegg went on: ‘(Miriam was wearing) this dark green velvet thing. And you had what I thought were these quite funny sort of brogue-y shoes on. And I was this pimply Brit, trying to impress her…’ The couple are pictured in their Christmas card. the Lib Dem leader told Red magazine he would never try to use her for publicity . He explained that at first their language of love was pidgin French, as he didn’t speak Spanish and her English was ‘not very strong’. When asked what attracted them to each other, Mrs Clegg claimed the interview had become ‘too embarrassing’. But Mr Clegg continued: ‘Everything that is obvious about Miriam – intelligence, humour, beauty, the lot.’ She said: ‘I just couldn’t believe that he liked me.’ The couple, who have three sons and recently celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary by seeing Verdi’s Rigoletto at the Royal Opera House, told how they have stayed together. Mrs Clegg said: ‘I think the secret is laughing a lot and having big arguments. If you can get over that before you go to bed, that’s fine.’ Asked who is more even-tempered, Mr Clegg hesitated then pointed at himself and said: ‘Miriam is truly Spanish.’ It has previously emerged that the couple share the housework, although Mrs Clegg has said she has banned her husband from the kitchen on ‘health and safety grounds’. When that came up again in this interview, Mr Clegg said: ‘Did you say that?’ She laughed and said: ‘I said it in a Spanish magazine. I hoped you hadn’t read that.’ Mrs Clegg said she is flattered by the attention she has received since being in the public eye. ‘I’m 46, so I am not in a position to reject any compliments,’ she said. ‘I have days when I think I look good and days I look terrible. And in both cases it’s me.’ She claimed she does not spend a fortune on clothes and shops a lot online and on eBay. During the 2010 election, Mrs Clegg spent less time on the campaign trail than either Sarah Brown or Samantha Cameron but has since appeared with her husband, including a trip to a school. At party conferences, however, she has shown her independence by shunning the convention of a leader’s wife embracing her husband on stage after his speech.","Lib Dem leader reveals details about home and marriage to Red magazine .

"Britons blew away their New Year hangovers by enjoying a dip in the seas and rivers as temperatures soared to near record levels yesterday, but forecasters warned chillier climes would return today with wintry rain in the north.

"Pastor Philip Mantofa lost 41 members of his church onboard the doomed AirAsia flight . A heartbreaking 41 members of the same church were onboard AirAsia flight QZ8501 when it crashed into the Java Sea on Sunday. A quarter of the 162 passengers and crew who died were from Mawar Sharon Church in the Indonesian city of Surabaya. The Christian church's Pastor Philip Mantofa has revealed that the members of his congregation were mostly travelling to Singapore on holiday. 'Some things do not make sense to us but God is bigger than all this,' Pastor  Mantofa said during a prayer service at Surabaya airport. 'God is not evil ... help us God to move forward even though we are surrounded by darkness.' The pastor, who has over 500,000 fans on his Facebook page, posted a collection of photos from the airport on Tuesday. 'Please pray with me for the families of the passengers of flight QZ8501. My heart goes out to them,' he wrote. On Instagram he said: 'My heart bleeds for flight QZ8501 and our beloved church members in it.'

"At least 20 Australians believed to have fought with Islamic State terrorists in Syria have been able to return to Australia without legal penalty because they left before the government sought to ban the practice, it has been reported. The government's strengthened counter terrorism laws ban Australians travelling to designated regions where militant groups operate, but they do not give authorities the power to act against people who travelled before the legislation was passed, the Daily Telegraph reports. The report said more than 20 Australians are believed to have returned to Australia after fighting in Syria, and that they were being monitored by security agencies. A legal loophole in the national counter terrorism laws could mean Australian’s involved with the Islamic State overseas are allowed back into the country without consequence . The report comes after revelations that a number of IS fighters who have returned from overseas conflicts are living in Queensland. A senior Police Commissioner has warned that the experience these fighters have gained from the conflict in makes them a major concern for Australian authorities, reports Courier Mail. When asked about the number of extremists living in Australia, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said 'I can't confirm the number because it can change in a heartbeat – and the risk can change in a heartbeat. Today it (the number) might be five. Tomorrow it might be 10,'. 'Obviously you don't go off fighting in foreign lands – not as a member of the Australian Defence Force – and come back and think you are not going to be on our radar,' Mr Stewart said. It comes after after revelations that Islamic State fighters who have returned from the conflict in Iraq and Syria are living in Queensland, but are being 'closely monitored' by officials . Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart would not confirm the number of extremists living in Australia . 'And that's because of the experiences that they have, and the skill set that they pick up by being involved in fighting elsewhere.' It is believed that 12 Queenslanders are among the 70 identified Australians fighting in Iraq and Syria. Some of them are hiding in Syria, fearing if they come back to Australia they will be prosecuted by severe new anti-terror laws that could see them jailed for up to 25 years. In December, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced the government's first 'no-go zone' in Syria under the Foreign Fighters Bill, where Australian's could face 10 years in jail for travelling to without good reason . In December, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced the government's first 'no-go zone' under the Foreign Fighters Bill, the province of Al-Raqqa (Ar-Raqqa) in Syria, some 160 kilometres east of Aleppo. She told parliament that she was looking at declaring more parts of the region, where Islamic State is active, as terror zones and said any Australians currently in the Al-Raqqa province without legitimate purpose should leave immediately. Under the legislation, any Australian found to have travelled to a declared region without good reason can face up to 10 years jail for the offence. Only those who provide proof on humanitarian or family grounds will be granted permission.","The government's strengthened counter terrorism laws ban Australians travelling to designated regions where militant groups operate .

"Dr Richard Smith said researchers should stop spending billions on trying to find a cure for cancer . A former editor of the British Medical Journal has claimed that we should ‘stop wasting billions trying to cure cancer’ – because it is the best way to die. Dr Richard Smith says it may be a ‘romantic view’, but cancer gives people a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones, which is denied to many who die from other conditions. Indeed, he argues that the country is wasting billions trying to cure cancer because curing people of the disease means they are likely to die of worse things, such as dementia. But cancer specialists and charities disputed his incendiary comments. They said many cancer patients suffered terribly and would not agree that it was ‘the best way to die’. They also accused the doctor of being ‘nihilistic’ about a disease which ‘takes far too many people far too young’. Dr Smith, 62, who was editor of the BMJ for 13 years until 2004 and is now chairman of the board of directors of medical smartphone app Patients Know Best, airs his views on the nature of dying in a BMJ blog. Leaving aside suicide, he says there are four ways to die: sudden death; the long, slow death of dementia; the up and down death of organ failure and death from cancer where you ‘go down usually in weeks’. He says most people tell him they would prefer a sudden death, but he thinks that is very hard on the families of the deceased. ‘The long, slow death from dementia may be the most awful as you are slowly erased, but then again when death comes it may be just a light kiss,’ he says. ‘Death from organ failure – respiratory, cardiac, or kidney – will have you far too much in hospital and in the hands of doctors. ‘So death from cancer is the best... You can say goodbye, reflect on your life, leave last messages, perhaps visit special places for a last time, listen to favourite pieces of music, read loved poems, and prepare, according to your beliefs, to meet your maker or enjoy eternal oblivion. ‘This is, I recognise, a romantic view of dying, but it is achievable with love, morphine, and whisky. But stay away from overambitious oncologists, and let’s stop wasting billions trying to cure cancer, potentially leaving us to die a much more horrible death.’ Scroll down for Video . Dr Smith advised patients to 'stay away from overambitious oncologists' if they are diagnosed with cancer (file image) Dr Smith’s observations were made in the context of discussing the filmmaker Luis Bunuel’s fear of overtreatment in his dying days, leading to a ‘horrible medical death’. He died of pancreatic cancer – at the age of 83. But Dr Smith was strongly criticised for his remarks. Professor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said: ‘Of course we are all going to die, but cancer takes far too many people far too young. ‘It’s only by being ambitious in our research that we can give people a measure of choice, and the more we know about cancer the more we can give people options. ‘My patients are very clear about when they do and when they don’t want treatment, and they would much prefer me to be ambitious than nihilistic.’ Professor Jonathan Waxman, a leading oncologist at Imperial College, London specialising in prostate cancer, said he hoped Dr Smith would never need his services, adding that doctors ‘don’t want anyone to have a horrible death whatever the cause’. He said: ‘I can’t agree we’re wasting money on cancer research as that would be saying it wasn’t worthwhile to make the investment that’s led to a massive improvement in survival rates. Deaths from breast cancer have gone down from 17,500 just 25 years ago to 11,700 – this is a fabulous development.’ Ali Stunt, founder and chief executive of the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action, was diagnosed with the disease in 2007 and successfully treated. She said that in the late stages of pancreatic cancer patients face severe problems such as weight loss and pain. ‘There will be many, patients and relatives alike, who will not agree that it is the “best way to die”,’ she said. ‘We should be encouraging further investment into cancer research. After all, one in three of us will get a cancer of some kind in our lifetime.’ Dr Mick Peake, Clinical Lead of the National Cancer Intelligence Network said: 'I’m not sure, from a philosophical point of view, why Dr Smith feels cancer is any different from other diseases, for many of which medical science has discovered effective treatments. 'If he had been blogging a hundred years ago would he have said tuberculosis was a ""preferred"" death and berated those ""overambitious TB doctors""? 'Childhood leukaemia is an excellent example of where slow, systematic research and clinical trials over many years have resulted in the large majority of children who develop leukaemia now living normal or near-normal lives. 'Overambitious oncologists certainly played a major role in that and many other success stories.' Owen Sharp, Prostate Cancer UK’s chief executive added: 'Research is not all about trying to find a cure for cancer, much of it is about finding ways to help people live longer and better with the disease. 'Everyone’s experience is different and to suggest that dying of cancer is the same for everyone is a ridiculous over-simplification. 'There is no ‘best’ disease to die from and what really matters is the quality of life people are helped to enjoy, right up to the end, and that means research into prevention, early diagnosis, better treatment and end-of-life care is a top priority.'","Dr Richard Smith said disease was the best way to die in a blog post .

"A woman who lost her leg after the Boston Marathon bombings said goodbye to 2014 by walking for the first time. Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left limb amputated in November as 17 operations and 19 months of physio failed to get her back on her feet. Finally, on Wednesday, the beaming mother-of-one, from Katy, Texas, shared a video on Facebook of her first steps. She plans to run the Boston Marathon in April 2015. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Incredible: Rebekah DiMartino took her first steps on a prosthetic leg leg night 20 months after the bombings . Ecstatic: The mother-of-one screamed with excitement as she walked with her son, left, and mother, right . 'I am standing! Ahh!!' Ms DiMartino screamed in the hallway of OPA Prosthetics in Bellaire as KHOU filmed the momentous event. 'This is me walking, I have not walked in so long!' Ms DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270. All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection. New chapter: She underwent surgery to amputate the leg in November after 17 failed operations . Plans: Seven-year-old Noah said he is excited that his mom can now run races with him . Present: Ms DiMartino's mother has embroidered this sleeve for the prosthetic leg for this year's marathon . Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. 'The day that I made the decision to chop it off is the best thing I have ever done for myself, because I was letting go of what was holding me back,' she told KHOU. 'You don't realize how many little blessings are in your life that you don't really even pay attention to because they're just expected.' Decision: Ms DiMartino shocked many when she jokingly said goodbye to her left leg in November . Struggle: Here she is pictured with now-husband Pete at a Red Sox game months after the incident . Family: Ms DiMartino, Noah and Pete are looking forward to a 2015 of progress and milestones . Sharing the video of her first steps on Facebook, Ms DiMartino wrote: 'So look what I did today... Happy New Year!!! 2014 has GOT TO GO!!!!!' Her mother has now embroidered a special pink and black prosthetic leg that reads 'blessed', ready for April's marathon. And her son Noah said he is 'just excited that she gets to run races with me and play with me now'. Ms DiMartino added that she will not be paying any attention to the upcoming trial of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as she works to rebuild her life. 'It doesn't matter what happens, it's not my judgment to make and it also doesn't change anything that's happened to me.'","Rebekah DiMartino, 27, walked for the first time on prosthetic leg .

"Thousands of immigrants conned their way into Britain by pretending to be skilled workers - when they actually came to do menial jobs such as working in kebab shops. Immigrants were able to get visas for supposedly skilled jobs thanks to the connivance of rogue employers. One created a post for a migrant of ‘sales and business development manager’ - for a small high street kebab shop. Scroll down for video . One kebab shop said it needed a sales development manager (file picture) Other ruses included fast food shops recruiting ‘press and PR managers’ and a newsagent and off-licence saying it needed a full-time HR manager when it only had three staff. Officials are now in the process of rounding up and deporting thousands of foreign workers. Ministers say they were able to exploit ‘incompetence’ in a supposedly tough points-based system introduced by the previous government in 2008. The so-called Tier Two of Labour’s immigration system allowed people from outside the EU to get a visa only if they had been offered a ‘skilled’ job in the UK that could not be filled by a British or EU worker. Employers were required to obtain approval from the Home Office to sponsor migrants, but checks were far from thorough, only looking to see whether the business was trading. Employers and migrants could therefore work together to cheat the system, with employers sometimes receiving payments worth thousands of pounds. The rules have since been tightened; officials now scrutinise the roles the migrants are supposedly coming to fill, the business’s turnover and tax arrangements, and, crucially, how many people it employs. Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire has criticised Labour for their open door immigration policy and the ‘incompetence of the UK Border Agency in administering it’ The rate of visas refused under the new rules has rocketed from less than 2 per cent to 37 per cent, suggesting abuse of the old regime was rampant - with potentially tens of thousands slipping through the net. Checks have now been carried out on historic files and up to 2,500 migrants who conned their way into the country are in the process of being sent home. Last night Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire criticised Labour for their open door immigration policy and the ‘incompetence of the UK Border Agency in administering it’. He added: ‘Our reforms are cracking down on abuse... We are building an immigration system that works for British nationals and legitimate migrants and is tough on those who flout the rules.’ In October, two men were jailed for fronting a scam immigration sponsorship firm called Techsense, which claimed it was recruiting management level migrants for IT jobs, when, in fact, they were working in fast food restaurants and supermarkets. A newsagent and off-licence created a post of full-time HR manager… for its three staff . Fast-food shops recruited press and PR managers . A high street kebab shop employed a ‘sales and business development manager’ A newsagent claimed it needed a £30,000 per annum sales manager . Petrol stations sought full-time business development managers . A fishmonger advertised for a second general manager’s post for its total staff of six . The judge criticised the now-defunct UK Border Agency for granting the Pakistani-run business a sponsor licence in 2008 and for its failure to monitor the firm afterwards. The UKBA gave 117 certificates of sponsorship to Techsense over three years. Of those, 50 led to visas and it was estimated more than 120 family members were granted additional visas. Rashid Ghauri and Ali Junejo, who ran the scam, netted at least £500,000 by selling the work permits for £3,500-£4,500 each. Under Labour, there was also widespread abuse of the separate Highly Skilled Migrant Programme, which later became Tier One of the points system. This route was supposed to allow the brightest migrants to come to the UK to look for a job even if they had no advance offer. At least 30 per cent of Tier One migrants were later found to work in low-skilled roles such as stacking shelves, driving taxis or working as security guards. Others did not have a job at all.","Thousands made their way into Britain by pretending to be skilled workers .

"A 75-year-old man has had a seven-inch turn signal removed from his arm after it became embedded during a horrific car crash - 51 years ago. Former real estate agent Arthur Lampitt from Granite City, Illinois, slammed his Ford Thunderbird head-on into a truck as he was driving to a property viewing in 1963 - breaking his hip in the process. The father-of-three's arm was only scratched on the surface and it wasn't until he walked through a metal detector a decade ago that he discovered a piece of metal the size of a pencil was still in there. Arthur Lampitt from Granite City, Illinois, went under the knife at the City Place Plastic Surgery Center in Illinois on New Year's Eve to remove a turn signal that was embedded in his arm during a car crash in 1963. His wife Betty was shocked when a doctor handed the object over to her in a waiting room . Mr Lampitt did not know he had the seven-inch metal object embedded in his arm until he walked through a metal detector a decade ago . Following an X-Ray doctors said it could stay in his arm because it wasn't causing any pain and hadn't been infected. However, according to the St. Louis Dispatch, when he was lifting concrete blocks for an apartment he is renovating, it started to hurt. He therefore went under the knife at the City Place Plastic Surgery Center in St. Louis on Wednesday with his wife Betty at his side . After a 45-minute operation, Dr. Timothy Lang walked into the waiting room and handed the metal object to Betty, to which she replied: 'Oh my God.' She told the paper: 'My husband can do just about anything. He's a pretty smart guy. Low key. Doesn't boast. 'Everything was fine until it started to get bigger. The arm started bulging,' she added. Dr Lang said: We see all kinds of foreign objects like nails or pellets, but usually not this large, usually not a turn signal from a 1963 T-Bird . Initially the married couple, who met on a blind date after the crash, thought the foreign object may have been a medical instrument unwittingly left in his arm during surgery following the crash. However when a friend showed them pictures of the mangled Thunderbird, Mr Lampitt realized that the indicator from the left side of the steering column was missing. Mr Lampitt had never noticed the lever because he had suffered more severe injuries in the crash and his arm had healed over. Mrs Lampitt, however, is now pleased that the mystery has been solved. She told the paper: 'You know what it's like with a child. You know it's in your womb, but it's not until the miraculous birth occurs that you feel the reality of it.' When asked what he would do with the lever, Mr Lampitt simply said: 'We'll figure something out.' Mr Lampitt broke his hip when his Ford Thunderbird hit the truck head on. The accident was perceived to be so bad that some of the local papers said it was fatal . Initially the Arthur and Betty thought the foreign object could have been a medical instrument unwittingly left in their during surgery following the accident. But then they noticed that the left turn signal was missing . The severity of the other injuries Mr Lampitt suffered in the crash meant he did not feel the lever in his arm for decades .","Arthur Lampitt wrecked his Ford Thunderbird in Illinois in 1963 .

"Concerns: Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the only thing that would bury his party would be if they were linked to a 'racist age', it emerged today . Nigel Farage believes the only thing that would 'bury' Ukip is if the public link his party to a 'racist age', new documents revealed today. The firebrand politician spoke out after a councillor was accused of publishing an offensive post on Facebook calling for 'free-loading', 'benefit-grabbing', 'illegal immigrants' to 'go home'. Minutes from a UKIP meeting in 2013 to discuss the suspension of Chris Pain  reveal how Mr Farage said that comments like that would help sink the party. He said: 'The one thing that is able to bury the Party if (sic) they can link us with a racist age', according to the Daily Telegraph. Mr Farage added the comments showed a 'grave error of judgement', although Mr Pain always said the post was put up by a hacker and police dropped an investigation against him because of a lack of evidence to prosecute. The comments reveal that Mr Farage and the party leadership feared being linked to any type of racism, as the Tories and Labour continue to suggest UKIP is old fashioned and out of touch. In a piece for the Mail on Sunday last week Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s first elected MP, said: ‘Dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive, but absurd.’ He said the party must be ‘inclusive’ and have no truck with candidates who insult people’s ‘heritage or background’. UKIP has been stung by a series of race rows. Last week the UKIP leadership  moved to distance the party from remarks made by one of its councillors who claimed an 'overload' of immigrants had turned Britain into a racist country. Message: Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s first elected MP, pictured with Mr Farage, said this week that: ‘Dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive, but absurd' and said the party must be 'inclusive' Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with. But Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans later rejected the suggestion, saying that Mr Shonk didn't express himself 'as well as he could'. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Shonk said: 'When I've done leaflets every shopkeeper, whether they are Asian or English born, they're concerned about the influx. 'It hasn't been staggered, it's just overload. We haven't got the care homes, we haven't got the houses for our own.' Earlier this month Kerry Smith quit as Ukip's candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments. In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.

"Tapes of the man responsible for the Martin Place terror plot delivering religious rants, saying 'Society should behave in an Islamic manner', have been unearthed. In 2009, the self-styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16-hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in Martin Place's Lindt Cafe in Sydney's CBD last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city's western suburbs. The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne. Scroll down for video . Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children . The footage, translated by a Farsi translator for The Daily Telegraph, slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes, saying: 'your intelligence service is not working properly'. He believed governments who were 'not aware that there [was] criminal activity happening in your country' then officials should resign from their positions as they were 'incompetent'. At times, Monis became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message. Showing his level of paranoia, the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist Muslims lay within their community. Monis believed moderate Muslims would spell the death of extremists. Canvassing what he thought was the virtues of Sharia law, he pushed the case for Australia to take on more of the Islamic culture. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16 . 'The core of an Islamic society is justice, social justice. Society should behave in an Islamic manner and there should be justice,' he said. In the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies, Monis warned about keeping an eye on 'friends' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror. 'An enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy. An ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you, you would socialise with them and associate with them, but one day like a bear, they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him,' he said. Monis went on to say people should fear the ones who declared 'Islam is in jeopardy'. Adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of Monis over the past couple of weeks following the siege, friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party Hezbollah Australia and funded a Campsie warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall. Mamdouh Habib (pictured), who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, said he knew Man Haron Monis 'very well' and insisted that the Sydney siege gunman was 'not violent' Refugee advocate Jamal Daoud told News Corp he did not know where Monis' money was sourced and the terrorist was 'mysterious'. Mr Daoud added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the Muslim community - Sunni and Shia, saying 'He knew a lot about everybody, they knew nothing about him'. The advocate said Monis worshiped at different mosques around Sydney, which included Granville's Nabi Akram Islamic Centre, in Sydney's west - a location where these religious rants were given. The way Monis spoke was described as 'slow' and 'low-pitched'. Mr Daoud said the gunman was a 'very good listener' who 'wasn't stupid, he's intelligent'. It comes after former failed politician and Guantánamo Bay detainee, who previously employed gunman Monis, claimed he could have convinced the 50-year-old to end the Sydney siege without resorting to violence. His offer was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed (pictured). All of these are believed to have been rejected . Mamdouh Habib, who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, told Fairfax he knew him 'very well' and insisted that Monis was 'not violent'. Despite this show of support, Monis will be buried in an undisclosed location in Melbourne after the Sydney Muslim community reportedly refused to bury him. The wrongly accused former Guantánamo Bay detainee, who was tortured after being arrested in Pakistan under the false pretences he had knowledge of the September 11 attacks, claimed Monis was only seeking attention. Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children. He insistently told Fairfax he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State. His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. All of these are believed to have been rejected. Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and will be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to the Telegraph. It follows claims from the Muslim community no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended. An Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia .","Footage of the mastermind behind the Martin Place siege has surfaced .

"Flames ripped through a small Wyoming town Tuesday night destroying four buildings containing more than 12 businesses, officials say. The small, picturesque town of Dubois in Wyoming was ravaged by a fire that ripped through a line of businesses as firefighters fought below-zero temperatures that froze their hoses and other equipment. 'It was horrendous for them. They were, as usual, heroes,' Mayor Twila Blakeman said, crediting the firefighters with keeping the fire from spreading. Flames: Flames ripped through the small, northwestern Wyoming town of Dubois destroying several businesses . Destroyed: Four buildings containing more than 12 businesses were destroyed in the fire that blazed through the night . The fire was reported at about 8.30pm Tuesday and ,CBS 5 reports that firefighters fought the flames through the night, getting the fire under control at about 4am Wednesday. Temperatures plunged to 25 degrees below zero, NBC reports, and residents of the historic town of 1,000 came together, helping business owners salvage what they could from the buildings. One destroyed building reportedly contained about 10 businesses. A fly fishing shop and a gallery were also burned. Battle: About 50 firefighters battled the blaze through the night, subduing the flames at around 4am Wednesday morning . Temperatures: Firefighters fought through temperatures of 25 degrees below zero as the blistering cold froze their equipment . One witness, Kate Wilshire, 45, the co-owner of a Turtle Ranch outside of the town, said that firefighters were covered in ice as the water from their hoses froze. 'It was a struggle for firefighters because their equipment was freezing up,' she said.

"Home ownership in Britain is set to fall below France for the first time after the boom in buy-to-let lending in the last decade. More and more Britons have been pushed into the rental sector, allowing our continental neighbours to catch up, according to latest figures. The fall in UK home ownership was worsened by the 2008 financial crisis and has undone much of the work by Margaret Thatcher towards her dream of a property-owning democracy. New figures show that home ownership in Britain was 64.6 per cent in 2013 - only marginally above France’s rate of 64.3 per cent (shown on graph). On current trajectories, Britain will have fallen behind France in 2014 . The figures from the EU’s official statistics bureau Eurostat show that home ownership in Britain was 64.6 per cent in 2013 compared to 70 per cent in 2005. The latest rate is only marginally above France’s 64.3 per cent while the EU average is 70 per cent. Romania tops the table with 95.6 per cent of homes being owner-occupied. On current trajectories, Britain will have fallen behind France in 2014 for the first time since Eurostat started compiling the figures in 1995. Home ownership was last this low in 1988, said separate data from the Department for Communities and Local Government. The vast majority of new housing since 2000 has been bought by landlords, it added. Some 2.5million homes built from 2000-2012 went to the private rented sector with only 400,000 bought by occupiers. The dramatic changes in the housing market have also been attributed to tougher mortgage standards making it harder for owner-occupiers to borrow. Many buy-to-let borrowers qualify for interest-only loans and can offset interest against tax. Of the 2.6million additional homes in the private rented sector since 1996, 1.4million have been financed by buy-to-let loans, said the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. The proportion of owner-occupied homes in France (pictured) has caught up as more Britons are pushed into the rental sector. The vast majority of new housing in the UK since 2000 has been bought by landlords . It has forecast that in two decades, if trends continue, most Britons will be renting for the first time since the early 1970s. Tory MP Mark Garnier, who is a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘If people have given up on the aspiration of owning their own property, that is a big deal. Prices have got outside of people’s reach.’ Kate Barker, a former Bank of England rate-setter, said landlords tend to have larger deposits or other properties from which to draw funds. ‘If you come from a family that hasn’t got a history of home ownership, it’s getting harder to get on the ladder,’ she warned.","Home ownership levels in UK to fall behind France for first time since 1988 .

"As the new year rolls in, taking stock of the one just past can prompt the age-old resolutions, 'eat healthier' and 'make better choices'. While taking steps towards these goals is often easier said than done, figuring out what the new superfoods of 2015 is easy, thanks to food writer and 'wellness warrior' Lee Holmes. You don't need to love yoga, kale, or chia seeds to embrace the superfoods list- so forget kale and quinoa, Holmes said this year is all about mindful eating, artisan food shopping, and approaching nourishment sustainably. Taking stock of the year just past can prompt the age-old resolutions, 'eat healthier' and 'make better choices' 'There are so many faddy diets, but come January it’s a great time to take stock and set yourself some personal goals or positive changes,' Holmes said. 'For me, I’m focusing on adding more vegetables to my meal times. In season vegetables are at their best and relatively inexpensive,' she said. 'At the same time adding more fibre, folic acid, vitamins C and E, potassium, magnesium and eating a diet with plant based options can help to lower LDL cholesterol levels.’ Holmes, a yoga teacher, wholefoods chef, and bestselling author, is passionate about bringing vegetables back to where they belong- front and centre on the dinner table. Her approach to food is not just a list of what to eat, but how to go about sourcing nourishment for your body in the most sustainable way possible. Figuring out what the new superfoods of 2015 is easy, thanks to food writer and 'wellness warrior' Lee Holmes . 'There are so many faddy diets, but come January it’s a great time to take stock and set yourself some personal goals or positive changes,' Holmes said . Fermented foods . 'Fermented foods are full of healthy enzymes, minerals and live cultures that create a flourishing internal environment and help balance gut microflora, all contributing to good digestion, protection from toxic pollutants and a strong immune system,' said Holmes. Fermentation has been practiced by many cultures long before the advent of industrialisation and unnatural processing of our foods. So, while not a new concept, fermented foods help the body draw nutrients from food. 'Adding a culture or salt to foods enables the production of Lactobacillus bacterial cultures (probiotics), which preserve the food through the production of lactic acid,' said Holmes. 'Some of the types of fermented and cultured foods you can include in your diet are kombucha, fermented drinks, kefir yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, cultured vegetables, and pickled vegetables and relishes,' she said. Artisan Food Shopping . Holmes predicts that there will be a significant swing back towards artisan food shopping this year. 'Major supermarkets will be implementing more of their own personalized butcheries, bakeries and old school artisan products into stores as well as local foods and native ingredients,' Holmes said. Watch out for kakadu plums and Margaret river cheese. Incaberries! A South American 'super fruit', these berries have high levels of vitamins, including 'phosphorous, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B12 and protein,' said Holmes. 'They are great as a snack and have high levels of bio-flavoniods,' she advises. Holmes predicts that there will be a significant swing back towards artisan food shopping this year . Healthy intermittent fasting . 'Fasting is a psychological panacea to rigorous diets, built upon the foundation of a restricted calorie approach,' Holmes explains. Some of the food people tend to eat on fasting days are actually what Holmes calls 'low calorie nightmares', such as puddings, meringues, bakes and cakes. 'Fasting can be even healthier with the right food choices, to increase longevity and keep disease at bay,' she said. 'People will begin to choose nutrient rich fresh options to fast and learn that low fat is not healthy!' Holmes, a yoga teacher, wholefoods chef, and bestselling author, is passionate about bringing vegetables back to where they belong- front and centre on the dinner table . Foraging Foods, local and sustainable . While 'meat and two veg' may no longer be the accepted eating framework for a majority of Australians, there has been a revived interest in eating foods that are more basic. 'The typical diet today consists of fast foods and processed foods, pesticide-laden and GM produce, with chemicals, preservatives and additives,' said Holmes. For 2015, she predicts that 'we will see an even bigger return to seasonal eating and locally produced foods and also foraging foods such as wild mushrooms, berries and herbs such as dandelion.' Mindful eating . As a new year starts, Holmes predicts that people will become more interested in eating mindfully and holistically. She anticipates people looking towards 'whole food nutritional principals and nourishing themselves with healthy comfort food, hearty home cooked, highly nutritious recipes that heal and nourish with every mouthful.' 'Eating out will involve a community minded communal table approach with slow cooking being a highlight and shared plates and sides of fermented foods,' Holmes said. 'Meals that will help people flourish and feel nourished and encourage communication.' Holmes's new vegetarian cookbook Supercharged Food: Eat Clean, Green, and Vegetarian is available now from Murdoch Books.","New year, new resolutions- eat healthier and make better choices can be hard goals to put into motion .

"United Airlines has apologized to a New Jersey mother who said the company 'humiliated' her by not allowing her disabled three-year-old daughter to sit on her lap during a flight -- even though the child is physically unable to sit up on her own. Elit Kirschenbaum said her flight from the Dominican Republic was delayed for nearly an hour in the Dec. 30 incident as a flight attendant insisted her daughter Ivy, a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, be placed in a seat on her own. The family, aware of federal safety regulations that children over two years old need their own seat, had bought an economy seat for Ivy but kept her with them in business class due to her condition. Outrage: The Kirschenbaum family were on their way back from a Christmas holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, when a United Airline flight attendant said Ivy, 3, (back right) had to sit in her own seat as she is over 2 . 'Humiliating': Mother-of-four Elit Kirschenbaum said the hour-long ordeal was humiliating for her family . Kirschenbaum wrote in a Tumblr post that three flight attendants walked by her with the three-year-old on her lap and made no comment. However, moments before the New Jersey-bound flight took off, a fourth flight attendant confronted Kirschenbaum about the seating arrangement. Describing the situation in a Facebook post, Kirschenbaum wrote that she thoroughly explained to the flight attendant that her daughter was unable to sit independently but the woman 'insisted on creating a scene.' 'The remaining 3 flight attendants pleaded our case, in fact one was in tears, but this one attendant dug her heels in and wouldn't budge,' Kirschenbaum wrote. 'All of my children were sobbing, my niece was sobbing, other passengers were getting involved yet this woman still displayed zero compassion.' She wrote on Tumblr that her husband pleaded with the flight attended with no success and ultimately approached the pilot asking for help. Ivy: Ivy (right) is a stroke survivor with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, the most disabling form of spastic cerebral palsy . 'Offending: In a Jan. 1 tweet, Kirschenbaum wrote that the airline apologized to her and her family on behalf of the 'offending flight attendant' 'Behaved Poorly:' Kirschenbaum said the airline stated that the flight attendant 'behaved poorly' in the situation . Eventually, the airline allowed Ivy to lie across her parents' laps, strapped in, during take-off and landing. The rest of the flight was spent sat on their laps. However, Kirschenbaum said she was 'humiliated in front of a full flight of passengers,' and, demanding an apology from the airline, enlisted the support of the public on Twitter with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy. 'I don't want free flights and I'm not interested in contacting a lawyer as some people have suggested I should,' she said. 'I just want the airline to apologize.' She added on Facebook: 'United needs to be aware and held accountable for how they treat people with disabilities and their families.' Compensation: After the incident, Kirschenbaum said that she did not want compensation from the airline, but an apology . Hashtag: The mother-of-four took to Twitter to enlist public support with the hashtag #UnitedWithIvy . A spokeswoman for United told ABC News: 'The parents, who were ticketed in first class, wanted to hold the child in their lap rather than have the child take the seat they'd purchased for her in economy. 'Federal safety regulations require any child over the age of two to have his or her own seat, and flight attendants are required by law to enforce that safety rule. 'As we did in this case, we will always try to work with customers on seating arrangements in the event of any special needs.' Many spoke out on Twitter about the airline's treatment of little Ivy and her family. In a statement posted one day after the incident, airline officials wrote 'We at United are sorry that the Kirschenbaums encountered difficulties with their seating while traveling with their 3-year-old daughter.' 'Rather Cold:' The incident even caught the attention of CNN's Jake Tapper who wrote on Twitter that the airline's initial statement to the Kirschenbaum family seemed 'rather cold' Intentions: The family reportedly purchased an economy ticket for little Ivy (right) intending to keep the child with them in business class . The incident even caught the attention of CNN's Jake Tapper who wrote on Twitter that the airline's initial statement to the Kirschenbaum family seemed 'rather cold.' After drawing public criticism, with Kirshenbaum's encounter being reported on multiple news sites, the airline apologized. In a Jan. 1 tweet, Kirschenbaum wrote that the airline apologized to her and her family on behalf of the airline and the 'offending flight attendant.' The airline contacted Kirschenbaum by phone, FOX Insider reports, and Kirschenbaum said they stated that the flight attendant 'behaved poorly.'","United Airlines apologized to Elit Kirschenbaum and her family for trying to force her to put her disabled daughter Ivy, 3, into her own seat .

"Deal: George Osborne is prepared to sell the Government¿s shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history . George Osborne is prepared to sell the Government’s shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in British history. Senior Tory sources yesterday said that Labour had spent too much money on the 2008 bailouts, which injected £66billion of public funds into the failing banks. They spoke after fresh reports the Chancellor is gearing up to sell an 82 per cent shareholding in RBS and a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds. The Daily Mail first revealed in February that Mr Osborne wants to offload the shares before the 2015 election – and that he is examining the possibility of giving the shares away. That would mean acknowledging taxpayers would not get all their money back, since the share prices of the two banks currently mean the deficit on paper is £24billion. Several Treasury ministers believe a big privatisation would show the Coalition is drawing a line under the financial crisis and would boost confidence in the economy. They hope that selling off – or giving away – the shares would kickstart trading in RBS and Lloyds shares and drive up the price, allowing them to get more money back. But a minister close to the Chancellor told the Financial Times it was ‘unrealistic’ to expect the RBS share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future and the Government may have to sell while the shares were ‘under water’. Insiders say Mr Osborne is prepared to make the argument that it would be better to get some money back and move on, rather than wait around with the bank shares on the public balance sheet with little prospect of ever getting taxpayers’ money back. A senior Tory source told the Mail: ‘It is true Labour hugely overpaid for the original recapitalisation.’ For sale: The Chancellor is gearing up to sell off a 39 per cent stake in Lloyds . Bleak outlook: The Chancellor told the Financial Times it was ¿unrealistic¿ to expect the RBS share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future . It was reported earlier this week that Mr Osborne’s team hope former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in June. That will make it easier to argue that the Government should sell its shares under the break-even mark. Ripped off: Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in June . But Mr Darling has criticised the attempt to point the finger of blame at Labour, saying that in April 2010 – just before the last election – RBS shares were trading above the price the Treasury paid. ‘I’ve not the slightest doubt all of this is a rather obvious attempt to blame the last Labour government for whatever they do,’ he said. ‘The share price we see today is largely of their own making.’ But there have also been rumours that the cross-party commission on banking standards, led by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, might recommend splitting RBS into a ‘good’ high street bank, with a ‘bad’ bank taking on its toxic loans. The Archbishop of Canterbury, who is a member of the commission, has said he would like to see RBS broken up into a series of regional banks. Sources at RBS said any sell-off was a decision for the Government but bank bosses were not adverse to moves that hasten a return to the private sector. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘This is all speculation. We will sell our stakes when it is in the taxpayers’ interest to do so.’","Chancellor to sell off 82 per cent of RBS and 39 per cent of Lloyds .

"Oklahoma City police have filed additional charges against a 49-year-old woman who stands accused of brutally abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressed up as her alter ego - a witch called 'Nelda' as it's revealed her boyfriend allegedly taped it. Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was arrested in October on child abuse charges after taking her unnamed granddaughter to the hospital, saying she 'could not control' the girl anymore. Doctors reported that the girl was malnourished, and had bruises, burns and cuts all over her body. Accused of torturing children: Police say that Geneva Robinson (left) abused her two 7-year-old grandchildren as her boyfriend Joshua Granger (right) taped it . The home: Geneva Robinson and Joshua Granger are accused of executing the abuse in this home . Police say that they have identified another victim, Robinson's 7-year-old grandson, and have also pressed charges against Robinson's boyfriend Joshua Granger who allegedly taped the abuse. Granger's abusive alter-ego was allegedly referred to as 'Crew Crow.' WWLP reports that Robinson is accused of using scissors to cut the boy's fingers as punishment because he 'cut the hair of a doll.' Court documents say cell phone video shows Robinson abusing the children, grabbing one by the hair and face and dragging a child across the living room floor. Robsinson's granddaughter told a Department of Human Services worker that her grandmother regularly dressed up as a witch wearing a green mask, hat and robe, to abuse her. She says Robinson would take her to the garage and make her sleep there on a pair on pants because 'she was in trouble'. Robinson allegedly used a dog leash to hang the girl from the garage ceiling by the armpits, telling her 'the creatures in the attic were going to come get her'. Koco reports that  after being arrested initially, Robinson told police, 'When I am Nelda, all I will say is all good girls and boys are in bed at night. Nelda's ghosts and goblins come out to get boys and girls in bed.' The report also says Robinson burned her and hit her with an orange and black whip, and threatened to cut her with a knife. When police searched Robinson's house, where she lives with three other children, authorities found the dog leashes and whip in the garage and the witch costume in the woman's bedroom. The face of evil: Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma stands accused of physically abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter and her grandson while dressing up as her alter ego - a witch named 'Nelda' Another child who lives there said Robinson picked on the 7-year-old, making her eat different food and sometimes alone in the garage. All four children who live with Robinson have been placed in the protection of DHS. An adult who also lives in the home, and wished not to be named, allegedly told police that Robinson also abused him as Nelda, and that she kicked him in the genitals on a regular basis. 'It’s not true at all,' Joshua said, adding that the children who live there are troubled.

"Three Al-Jazeera English journalists serving lengthy prison sentences in Egypt will face a retrial. The appeals court in Cairo will now decide the fate of Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, Australian journalist Peter Greste and Egyptian Baher Mohamed. However, they were not granted bail at the short hearing at the Court of Cassation today. The men have been held since December 2013. Scroll down for video. Retrial: Egyptian Baher Mohamed (left), Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy (centre) and Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) pictured at an earlier hearing . 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial . Their arrests came after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member. The three journalists did not attend the brief hearing that began around 9am local time, but defence lawyers said they believed a retrial for the men would be held within a month. Defence attorney Mostafa Nagy said: 'They will not be released until they appear before the new chamber, which will decide whether to release them or not.' Speaking after the hearing, Lois Greste, Peter Greste's mother, said  the verdict was 'not as good as we hoped'. Adel Fahmy said he had hoped his brother, Mohamed Fahmy, would be freed today. 'I hoped for more today' he added. Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, told Sky News the families were disappointed they had not been released ahead of the retrial. She said her fianceé was in poor health with hepatitis B, but in 'high spirits'. 'He's just a journalist who was doing his job,'she told Sky News today. 'Faulty accusations': Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, said there is no evidence of any wrongdoing . 'Disappointed': Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, outside the Egyptian court . 'They were accused of being members of the Muslim Brotherhood, fabricating news and harming national security, and calling for a civil war in Egypt. 'All these accusations are faulty and there is no evidence whatsoever - we don't understand why they are in prison.' Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste were sentenced to seven years in prison at their initial trial, while Baher Mohamed got 10 years - three more because he was found with a spent bullet casing. Rights groups dismissed the trial as a sham and foreign countries, including the U.S., expressed  concern over the journalists' detention. Authorities accused Qatar-based Al-Jazeera of acting as a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood. The station denied the accusations and said the journalists were doing their job. At trial, prosecutors offered no evidence backing accusations the three falsified footage to foment unrest. Family: Adel Fahmy, the brother of Mohamed Fahmy, speaks to journalists as he leaves the high court . Treatment: Wafa Bassiouni (pictured), the mother of Mohamed Fahmy, leaves Al Salam International Hospital, where he is receiving medical treatment . High court: Egyptian security forces stand guard in front of the court during the journalists' hearing . Instead, they showed edited news reports by the journalists, including Islamist protests and interviews with politicians. Imprisonment: Presiding Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata handing down the sentences to the journalists last year . Other footage submitted as evidence had nothing to do with the case, including a report on a veterinary hospital and Peter Greste's past reports out of Africa. Egyptian authorities offered no immediate comment on the ruling. The Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest appeal tribunal, only reviews the lower court's proceedings, not the case itself. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi also has the power to pardon or deport the foreigners under a new law, whether or not the court grants the appeal. That would allow Peter Greste to go home and Mohamed Fahmy to go to Canada if he drops his Egyptian nationality. Baher Mohamed's case would remain uncertain as he holds only Egyptian citizenship. A recent thaw in relations between Qatar and Egypt has seen Al-Jazeera shut down its Egyptian affiliate, which dedicated much of its coverage to Islamist protests since Morsi's overthrow. Last month, El-Sissi said  a presidential pardon for the three was being 'examined' and would be granted only if it was 'appropriate for Egyptian national security'.","The appeals court in Cairo today decided the trio would face a retrial .

"A baby boy suffered severe brain damage after midwives failed to notice that he was dangerously jaundiced after his birth. Khan Gold, now 19 months, was born perfectly healthy and allowed home the following day. Over the next four days he was seen five times by three midwives, who told his parents, Ed and Laura-Faye Gold, that his jaundice was nothing to worry about. Baby Khan Gold, who is now 19 months pictured with his mother Laura Faye and his father Ed. He was born perfectly healthy but suffered severe brain damage after developing jaundice after birth . In fact, his level of bilirubin – a noxious substance that turns the skin yellow and can damage the brain – was soaring. Not until Mrs Gold, 32, called her local hospital to say her son was arching his back as if in pain did anyone suggest bringing him in. He was finally put in intensive care and given a transfusion. But by then, the bilirubin had caused a rare form of brain damage known as kernicterus. It means doctors are uncertain whether Khan will ever walk or talk, and he is likely to need 24-hour care all his life. Now, his devastated family are speaking about their ordeal for the first time to warn other parents of the dangers. Last night Mr Gold, 41, an electrician, said: ‘We feel so disappointed, so let down and heartbroken. Khan was born a healthy baby boy and, although he had a bit of jaundice, we were reassured by the midwives at each visit. ‘The midwives didn’t seem to know this could happen. We feel a sense of loss, loss because my wife gave birth to a healthy child who was taken from us at five days old.’ The substance bilirubin, which causes jaundice, had caused Khan to suffer from a rare form of brain damage known as kernicterus . Mrs Gold, a florist, gave birth to Khan, her fifth child, at Exeter Hospital last year and midwives suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice . Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, is caused by excess bilirubin. The chemical is produced as red blood cells break down, and is normally removed from the blood by the liver. Because newborns’ livers are not fully developed, six out of ten will suffer jaundice to some extent. Mrs Gold, a florist, gave birth to Khan, her fifth child, at Exeter Hospital on April 15, 2013. He was seen by three midwives at home in Luppitt, near Honiton, and they suggested taking him out in the sunshine to help his jaundice. But by the evening of April 20, the jaundice had spread. Khan had problems feeding and was arching his back and neck unnaturally. The Golds rang the local hospital. Doctors did a blood test, but then told the couple they would have to drive Khan and his blood sample to Exeter Hospital in their own car. Doctors are uncertain whether Khan will ever walk or talk, and he is likely to need 24-hour care all his life . On arrival, Mr Gold said, countless tests were carried out until a senior consultant was called in – and quickly realised jaundice was to blame. Khan had a transfusion to replace half the blood in his body and spent a week under special lights that break down bilirubin. Then, the consultant told them to prepare for a serious brain injury. Jaundice is the condition which refers to a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by a build-up of bilirubin the blood and tissues of the body. Bilirubin is a waste product that's produced when red blood cells break down. It is transported in the bloodstream to the liver . Jaundice can also be a side effect of liver damage, cirrohsis, gallstones, tumours, malaria and sickle cell anaemia. Newborn babies are often born with the symptoms of jaundice, but usually in the young it resolves itself without treatment. Maintaining a healthy weight and managing alcohol intake can reduce the risk of developing the condition. Source: NHS Choices . ‘Our world dropped away, we were just devastated,’ Mr Gold added. Bosses at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust wrote to the family in September, apologising for the ‘failures’ that caused Khan’s brain damage. The Golds are seeking compensation, expected to run into seven figures. ‘No amount will ever compensate for what happened, but we want to make sure Khan is looked after when we are gone,’ Mr Gold said. He added: ‘It’s very difficult for us to see other families with their children running around, knowing Khan is unlikely to ever play with his siblings in that way. ‘We just want to warn other parents about the risks and ensure the hospital makes whatever changes are necessary to prevent this from happening to any other child.’ Their lawyer Eddie Jones, of JMW Solicitors, said: ‘The lack of appreciation of the danger Khan was in would suggest there are training issues at the hospital trust that need to be addressed urgently.’ In a letter to the family, Angela Pedder, chief executive of the trust, admitted Khan did not ‘receive the treatment he should have done’, adding: ‘I would like to offer my sincere apology and deep regret for those failures.’ Trust spokesman Jeff Chinnock said: ‘Lessons have been learned to ensure the risk of this happening again is minimised.’","Staff told Ed and Laura-Faye Gold that baby Khan's jaundice was normal .

"A harbor patrolman and an unidentified man are dead after storm winds broke boats loose from moorings at Santa Catalina Island off the Southern California mainland.

"It's fair to say that footballers and their Wags are not known for their good taste. But even by their standards, the home of West Ham’s Andy Carroll and his fiancee Billi Mucklow, formerly of ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, takes interior decoration to previously unknown levels. Fans yesterday mocked the £85,000-a-week, pony-tailed footballer after he and Miss Mucklow, 26, posted pictures of their new Essex mansion, which has been dubbed Carroll Castle, on social media. Scroll down for video . 'Classy': Billi Mucklow and Andy Carroll's interior decor choices didn't go down well with fans when the former TOWIE star posted a series of pictures of their new house . Disco time: 'Lets PARTY! #CarrollCastle', Miss Mucklow captioned the picture of their families around the dining table on Christmas Day . 'Billutifuls': The footballer surprised his fiancée with her very own home beauty salon, revealed on the former reality star's Instagram page . The couple, who announced on Christmas Day that they are expecting their first child, were photographed on a massive fuchsia pink sofa in a room covered with zebra print wallpaper and matching cushions. They were holding mugs with their initials printed on them, and a tiny dog was perched on Carroll’s lap. The pink theme continues throughout the house – there’s also a neon pink beauty salon which Carroll, 25, installed for his wife-to-be as her Christmas present, complete with a Snow White mirror with the words ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall’ written in pink lights. Posing in a pink dressing gown and a pair of M&S pyjamas with her hair in rollers, Miss Mucklow gushed her approval of the beauty salon: ‘Biggest shock of my life, secret key led to a secret room in my new house! My very own salon called “Billutifuls” I’m one lucky girl.’ Another snap posted by Miss Mucklow of a family get-together over Christmas included neon pink and purple disco lights projected on to the ceiling of the mansion’s dining room. The couple were clearly keen to make sure their visitors were comfortable – a picture of their sweeping staircase included a row of his-and-hers white and black guest slippers. One image shows the couple lying on their bed with their flowing locks spread out beneath them, taken from their reflection in the mirrored ceiling above. Carroll captioned the snap: ‘Good morning from our new home!! #crazyhair #dirtymirror.’ Miss Mucklow, who quit The Only Way Is Essex to run a Bikram yoga studio, started dating Carroll in the summer of 2013 but they kept their relationship under wraps until February 2014. Relaxing in style: The couple reclined in one of the bedrooms in their new home to pose for a selfie underneath a mirrored ceiling . Your palace awaits: A sweeping staircase with shaggy, silver carpet leads into the couple's foyer where dozens of white and black slippers were lined up for guests .

While many of her 160,000 Instagram followers seemed impressed with her new home, calling her a ‘lucky cow’ – apparently as a compliment – Carroll’s were less enamoured. One fan despaired: ‘Bruv, why did you let her have a pink sofa? That’s the worst room I’ve ever seen.’ Others agreed it was ‘naff’, with one commenting: ‘Footballer, Essex, Reality TV person. Really was never going to be a bastion of taste was it? ‘If they’d kept it to themselves, then that’s their choice.

"The US is still trying to apologize to Brazil for spying on a number of the country's senior officials. So it was no surprise smooth operator Joe Biden took time out of his schedule to see President Dilma Rousseff being sworn-in for a second term. Beaming throughout his historic visit on New Year's Day, the Vice President looked delighted to reunite with the Latin American leader. After the ceremony in Brasilia he bounded up to her, clutching her hands, laughing raucously and whispering in her ear. Scroll down for video . Charmer: Vice President Joe Biden was seen whispering in the ear of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff . All smiles: The 72-year-old flashed a grin at the cameras as Rousseff, 67, laughed along . Rousseff, 67, chuckled along - though she appeared to strike a serious tone at one point, holding her finger up to a solemn-faced Biden as she spoke. Biden, 72, is the highest ranking official to attend a presidential inauguration in Brazil since 1990. He has been the key intermediary between Obama's office and Rousseff's since Edward Snowden exposed the NSA's snooping on Brazil. Documents leaked by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden revealed that Rousseff's personal phone calls and emails, and those of other Brazilians, had been spied on by secret US eavesdropping programs used to monitor the Internet. The revelations froze relations between Brazil and the United States. Historic: Biden is the most senior US figure to attend the Brazilian ceremony since 1990 . Stern words? There were times when Rousseff appeared keen to make some serious comments . Repairing the relationship? The union was a positive sign for their countries' relationship after the 2013 expose . Tensions: Rousseff publicly condemned the US after Edward Snowden exposed NSA tapping of her phone . Outraged, Rousseff canceled a rare state visit to Washington and demanded an apology from President Barack Obama. The United States has publicly regretted the incident but has so far stopped short of issuing a formal apology. In July 2014, Rousseff eased tensions by saying she understood the Obama administration was not directly responsible for the spying. 'I do not believe the responsibility for the spying habits lay with the Obama administration. I think this was a process that began after September 11,' Rousseff said on CNN, in reference to the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington that led the United States to tighten security measures and step up surveillance of the Internet to identify terrorist threats. Having a ball: Biden, who has visited Brazil twice since the revelation, smiled with Argentina's Amado Boudou . Promises: He has vowed to ensure a closer relationship with Rousseff's administration from now on . Being sworn-in, Rousseff turned her attention to domestic issues. She vowed to restrain government spending and curb inflation to pull Brazil out of a four-year slump. Tackling corruption is also at the top of Rousseff's priority list after she was tied to a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras. She said: 'We have lifted 36 million people from extreme poverty. 'It is time to pursue new goals. Brazilians want high-quality health and education services, security and that corruption be tackled. 'The Brazilian people have understood this is a long-term process. I have been re-elected to carry out the big changes Brazil needs.'","Biden is most senior US figure to attend Brazil inauguration since 1990 .

"Jasmine Whitbread promoting M&S clothes with Dame Helen Mirren during the Britain's Leading ladies fashion campaign . Fresh demands to curb the salaries of fat cat charity bosses were made yesterday after it emerged that Save the Children is paying its top employee £234,000 a year. The individual, believed to be chief executive Jasmine Whitbread, is among 20 employees earning more than £100,000 at the charity’s international body. Another nine are on six-figure salaries at the charity’s UK arm. Former City executive Miss Whitbread recently starred alongside actress Dame Helen Mirren and artist Tracey Emin in Marks & Spencer’s ‘Britain’s leading ladies’ fashion advert campaign. That huge pay packet is considerably more than the £142,500 a year paid to David Cameron, whose wife Samantha is an ambassador for Save the Children. But it is surpassed by the salary of the highest paid employee at Marie Stopes International, who earns more than £290,000 a year. A second employee at the birth control charity is paid more than £200,000 and in total 11 people are on six-figure salaries. Charities are not required to detail by name how much their top executives are paid, and many express the sums in bands, disguising the true figures. Neither Save the Children, which boasts of being ‘committed to being fully transparent to children, our donors, supporters and the public at large’, nor Marie Stopes will reveal the identities of their high-earners. MPs condemned both the pay rates and the secrecy. Priti Patel, a member of the Commons public administration select committee, said: ‘Taxpayers and individual donors who bankroll these charities will be shocked to see the size of these colossal fat cat salaries. ‘They deserve to know how decisions are made about salaries and who is paid them. The culture of secrecy that exists in some charities must come to an end.’ Charlie Elphicke MP said: ‘Think charity and you think volunteers rattling their collecting tins, vocation, compassion. You don’t think mega-salaries. It’s unacceptable and it has got to change. Charities should be open and transparent.’ Anger erupted last year after an investigation into Britain’s 14 leading foreign aid charities, which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee and receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers, revealed spiralling pay rates. David Cameron who earns £142,500 a year and his wife Samantha - who is an ambassador for Save the Children . The number of executives receiving six-figure salaries had risen by nearly 60 per cent, from 19 to 30, between 2010 and 2012, despite a fall in donations and revenue at many of the organisations. Among those identified was Justin Forsyth, a former New Labour adviser on £163,000 a year as chief executive of Save the Children UK – much less than Miss Whitbread’s assumed salary as chief executive of the charity’s umbrella body, Save the Children International. Save the Children International refused to discuss its executives’ pay rates or identify the highest-paid employee – who, according to the charity’s 2012 accounts, received $386,893, a drop from $393,012 for the previous year. All questions were referred to the charity’s 2012 annual report and accounts – which do not identify individuals against salary bands. Miss Whitbread, 50, a glamorous mother of two who lives in Oxfordshire, became the first international chief executive of Save the Children in 2010, after heading Save the Children UK since 2005. She used to be a high-flying executive for information giant Thomson Financial in the US. In 2008 she said she did not do her charity job for the money. ‘My salary (£128,000 in 2007) is less than my bonus was at Thomson,’ she said. According to its most recent accounts, Marie Stopes International’s highest paid employee received between £290,001 and £300,000 in 2012. American Dana Hovig was its chief executive from 2007 until May 2013, when he left to join the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The charity said: ‘As a global social enterprise, we establish remuneration to attract the best talent from the global market. As part of our commitment to transparency, we publish list remuneration figures. ‘Out of respect for team members’ privacy we do not list individual salaries by name or position.’","High earner, thought to be Jasmine Whitbread, among 20 earning over £100k .

"A Florida man convicted of grand theft for wooing investors out of $1 million through a sham record company was a 'vampire' who targeted women whose money he take and take until there was nothing left, his victims say. Scott Campbell, 49, netted a cool mil over 10 years from the scheme. A jury convicted Campbell of first-degree grand theft after a week-long trial. Now his penniless victims--which all told numbered as many as 30--have spoken out about the wreckage the scheming womanizer has left in his wake. Con man: Scott Campbell, 49, netted a cool mil over 10 years BY scheming women out of money by telling them he was a musical producer who could get them big returns . Prosecutors said Campbell used dating and social media websites to find female investors under the guise that he was interested in dating them. He would tell his potential investors that he was starting a record company that he would use to find new talent. It was all part of a countrywide contest and tour he called Give Me a Chance, an initiative of his fictional BDO record company. According to the Orlando Sentinel, he his potential investors, all of whom were women, 'it was going to be bigger than American Idol or The Voice.' Prosecutors say Campbell used the money to support his lifestyle, not a business. An ex girlfriend, who once got a restraining order against Campbell, agrees. 'Scott's like a vampire,' Jeannie Thompson, who dated Campbell for eight years. 'He would take all your personal finances. He would do that until he would literally suck everything out of you.' 'Vampire': Jeannie Thompson once dated Campbell and called him 'a vampire' who 'would take all your personal finances.' One of his victims, Kim Serravalle (right) mortgaged her home in order to give Campbell $70,000 . Thompson said her former man 'looked for women with very low self-esteem' and went in for the kill. According to authorities Campbell managed to drain a shocking $300,000 from one Georgia victim he met online. Another woman named Kim Serravalle said Campbell wouldn't stop persisting until he got what he want from her. Serravalle said she often gave him what he wanted because she was frightened of Campbell. Now she's paying dearly. The 55-year-old Orlando woman went as far as to mortgage her home for Campbell, leaving her $70,000 poorer when the 'returns' Thompson claimed she'd get from his business never came. 'I'm going to be paying until I'm 80,' she told the Sentinel. While the dozens of women Thompson victimized are unlikely to ever recover the many thousands they handed over to him, the scam artist will soon pay for his crimes. He faces up to 30 years in prison when he is sentenced in February. Looks legit...:A screen shot shows the website scam artist Campbell used to help in his cons.

"After a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts, Johnny Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the Cleveland Browns final game of the season on Sunday. That was not to be however, as after partying until well past midnight last Friday, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns. Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable . . . instead of looking like a jackass.' And while his season may have been over, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of this controversy, which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami on Monday night alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle on Wednesday afternoon with girlfriend Colleen Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano. Scroll down for video . Johnny Manziel (center) was spotted chugging champagne on Wednesday with a friend (left) and girlfriend Colleen Crowley (right) Manziel is spending the week at the Delano in Miami now that the football season is over for the Cleveland Browns . Manziel and his group when clubbing at the hotel Monday, and hit up their New Year's Eve celebration on Wednesday . This as Manziel's drinking and partying has come under fire by some in the NFL and sports world . Now, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, are starting to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needs to get help for his drinking. Appearing on ESPN’s First Take earlier this week, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. 'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.' He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.' Manziel decided to go tropical at one point, enjoying a nice frozen drink in his chaise . The quarterback was getting in some rest after a lackluster rookie year . The quarterback saw little playing time and only had two starts all year, which both resulted in losses . In his second start he injured his hamstring and was forced to sit out the rest of the season . Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field. A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.' Manziel was considered one of the best quarterbacks in the country, alongside A. J. McCarron, when he played at Texas A&M . Manziel won the Heisman trophy when he was just a redshirt freshman (left) and went pro after his junior year, with things getting off to a bad start after a photo of him rolling a bill went public (right) Manziel's partying and antics were well known while he was in college . Manziel assured the Browns during the NFL draft that he had 'grown up' and cooled it with the partying . Also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine. Browns head coach Mike Pettine spoke to Manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted, a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the NFL, and said he felt that things were back on track and that Manziel was focused on football once again. There was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building, and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident, it was the fan who was inebriated, not Manziel. Manziel makes no effort to hide his love for a good time with friends . A report in 2013 said that Manziel did once seek help for drinking, but he denied it was true . Manziel said he has never sought counseling for alcohol abuse or anger management . It should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by ESPN in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college, Manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem, seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks. Manziel would later claim this report was false, and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college. As for his future with the Browns, that is a little unclear. Manziel partied with Ryan Phillippe and LeBron James on Monday night in Miami . For New Year's Eve, Manziel and his clan partied at the Delano and watched J. Cole perform . In light of recent incidents, some are saying that the Browns should drop Manziel for his 'lack of professionalism' Beauty queen Crowley and Manziel have been together for a little under a year . Training for next season won't begin until the summer, but already some, including ESPN's Pat McManamon, have called on the Browns to fire Manziel after last weekend's incident, saying he and fellow player Josh Gordon have a 'complete lack of professionalism.' Gordon was also out with Manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through, an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season. Crowley is still in college at Texas Christian University . Manziel apologized for the incident this past weekend with the Browns, but not responded to any of his critics . Currently, Manziel has a four year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25 million . The 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted, and lucrative, endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers . Manziel has not responded to any of his critics in the wake of this scandal, though he did write on Twitter Monday as the off-season officially began; 'There's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success.' Currently, Manziel has a four year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25 million. The 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted, and lucrative, endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers. For the time being, Manziel just seems to be enjoying his week at the Delano, ringing in the New Year with a performance by J. Cole at the club.

"A U.S. military veteran with multiple tours in Iraq has exposed just how easy it is to travel to Syria and fight against ISIS, suggesting it's as easy as flying to Miami. The 33-year-old veteran told how he bought a  plane ticket, underwent an informal background check on Facebook and was 'approved' to fight on the front lines in Syria against the Islamic State. In a revealing interview, the fighter, who asked to be identified as 'John' said he took the trip from America to Syria with ease and joined a Kurdish group known as the YPG. Scroll down for video . The military veteran, here in shadow, asked to be identified as 'John' and said he took the trip from America to Syria with ease and joined a Kurdish group known as the YPG . U.S. military: John's military background appeared to be an asset to the fighters, who arranged for him to be met at the airport in Iraq from where was taken to the front lines . There are currently over 1000 foreign fighters travelling to Syria each month, according to official figures . He told Fox News: 'I just went online and bought a ticket. It was that easy. It was like booking a flight to Miami Beach. 'There was a Facebook page for it -- shot them a message, expressed my interest, they got back to me, told me to send them, essentially, a resume for their vetting purposes,' John explained. 'What I believe is that they are European go-betweens, they are not in Kurdistan, they operate receiving information of interested Westerners, and then they either relay it or make a decision themselves of whether or not this person is suitable to work with the YPG,' he added. 'They sent a message saying I was approved and someone would be waiting on me.' John's military background appeared to be an asset to the fighters, who arranged for him to be met at the airport in Iraq from where was taken to the front lines. But the Kurds, whom he was fighting with, were so poorly equipped that he had to stuff his vest with a Bible because there was no body armor. Meanwhile some 'soldiers' had never handled a gun. The American revealed that he met dozens of international fighters from Scotland, England, Canada and Australia while in Syria. There are currently 1000 foreign fighters travelling to Syria each month, according to official estimates. British: James Hugh, left, and Jamie Read, right, greatly exaggerated their story of going out to Syria to fight . John said: 'I got in a car and there was a guy from Scotland there. So that was kind of refreshing, to see that I'm not the only one, it helped affirm to me, hey, I actually am with the good guys.' But not all soldiers who travel to the region are fighting on the front lines as claimed. Two former British soldiers, who claimed that they had risked their lives in a battle against ISIS to avenge the beheading of aid worker Alan Henning were exposed for exaggerating their story. According to The Mail on Sunday  Jamie Read and James Hughes were in fact in the region to obtain videos and pictures for financial gain. And testimonies by ex-soldiers revealed that the British soldiers stayed in a plush four star hotel because they didn't like the 'safe house' that they were taken too. Support: Lieutenant General James L Terry, commander of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve said: 'The [Kurds] are considered allies and we are in many ways enabling them . There is widespread confusion over U.S. policy on penalties, if any, for foreign fighters who travel to Syria. The Supreme Court argues it's not a crime for a U.S. citizen to go overseas and join a foreign army. But if the recruitment took place inside the country, it may be against the law. The U.S. military is backing Kurdish operations while the State Department discourages direct involvement by U.S. citizens. Lieutenant General James L Terry, commander of Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve said: 'The [Kurds] are considered allies and we are in many ways enabling them when you look at the strikes that have been going on in places like Kabani, I'm pretty comfortable we're supporting them right now.' John fled the front line after ISIS put a bounty out for him. He headed to the U.S. Consulate in Iraq and is still not sure what the legal penalty for his actions will be. He told the U.S. embassy: 'I'm an American first.'","The veteran only underwent an informal background check over Facebook .

"These sickening pictures show the disturbing fantasy world imagined by Islamic State extremists - despite increasing pressure from American airstrikes and reports they are being driven out of crucial Syrian border town Kobane. Overnight U.S.-led coalition warplanes are said to have carried out more than a dozen bomb attacks around Raqqa, the northern Syrian city adopted as the de facto headquarters of Isis. But as America and its allies bear down on the jihadists, photoshopped pictures circulating online show the chilling truth of what Isis hopes to achieve. In one image, terrorist fighters overrun the Capitol building in Washington, and fly an extremist banner from the top in a scene that echoes the fictional attack on the US embassy in Islamabad by the Taliban, in the series Homeland. Scroll down for video . Fantasy: The U.S. Senate is shown engulfed in flames and flying the Islamic State flag . Air force: This unlikely fantasy shows Isis with the ability to attack from above. The fighter-jet is branded with the Isis logo . The image was shared by Russian-speaking Isis militants, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Isis flags fly from the iconic building, which is engulfed in flames, and the American flag is falling. Reality: Smoke rises from the Syrian border town of Kobani  following the US-led coalition airstrikes on New Year's Eve . A second image created and circulated by Russian-speaking terrorists is of smiling Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, with Big Ben burning in the background. The caption reads: 'Soon!! In all cities of the world', according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Another fantasy depicts a white horse carrying the Isis flag escaping from the mouths of hungry wolves. It could have a number of different meanings, but it seems to depict a pure (white) Isis overpowering those standing in its way. In September, it was reported that Isis militants were changing tactics in the face of U.S.-led air strikes in Iraq by ditching conspicuous convoys in favour of motorcycles. But it seems these terrorists dream of an air force, although this fantasy it very unlikely to come true. The group's logo is painted on a black fighter-jet and another shows a 'pilot of the Islamic State'. Smiling: Isis military commander Abu Omar al-Shishani, who heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria, looks on as Big Ben in London falls . Pilot: Islamic State's hopes of build an air force are depicted in this disturbing image . Symbolic: This image shows a white Isis stallion escaping from the jaws of hungry wolves . But these fantasies could not be further from the reality. In December, it was reported that Isis has lost ground in  Kobane, where Kurdish fighters now control more than 60 percent of territory. The strategically located town on the border with Turkey has become a major symbol of resistance against Isis, which has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq. The jihadists launched a major offensive in mid-September to try to capture Kobane, and at one point controlled more than half of the town, known in Arabic as Ain al-Arab. But supported by US-led air strikes and reinforced by Kurds from Iraq, 'Kurdish forces now control more than 60 percent of the city', said Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. More than 76,000 people were killed in Syria last year. The death toll of 76,021 included 17,790 civilians, among them 3,501 children and 1,987 women, 15,488 rebel and Islamic fighters, and 12,861 regular regime soldiers and officers,according to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.","U.S. Congress building is engulfed in flames and flying the Isis flag .

"While attention is paid to aircraft tracking systems following the disappearance of two passenger jets, a Canadian airline’s planes are outfitted with a system that makes them nearly impossible to disappear. First Air’s entire fleet is protected by a 6lb electronic tracking system that activates when something goes wrong while a plane is in the air. The hardware is the size of a hotel safe and helps to pinpoint an aircraft’s location during an emergency situation. Scroll down for video . First Air's fleet is protected by a system that transmits data, including location and altitude, in real-time . Many planes are equipped with a similar reporting system that transmits data, but not in real-time . Based in an Ottawa suburb, First Air flies between most remote communities in Canada’s Arctic and its planes often find themselves off conventional radar in sparsely-populated regions. When a plane is in distress the system the system transmits data – including location, altitude, airspeed and engine information– to computers on the ground using the Iridium satellite system. In an age when it seems like it would be impossible to lose a plane – until the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 last March, that is – most commercial airlines have no comparable safeguard, the Washington Post reported. One of the prohibitors, especially for larger airlines with a massive fleet, is the massive cost associated with purchasing and installing the technology on every plane, plus  training for staff. The hardware installed on First Air planes helps to pinpoint an aircraft’s location during an emergency . First Air has a fleet of nearly 25 planes, which carry more than 225,000 passengers every year . The system used by First Air was designed by FLYHT Aerospace Solutions, and Bill Tempany, the Calgary company’s chief executive, told the newspaper that installation along costs about $120,000 per plane (approximately £77,000). First Air has a fleet of nearly 25 planes, which carry more than 225,000 passengers every year. According to the company, it automatically transmits four-dimensional GPS-based position and flight data recorder information, including real-time positioning, when triggered by an airborne event. ‘The real-time streaming of critical flight data to the ground creates a “virtual black box”, allowing the data to be analysed immediately,’ the company said. This Google Earth image provided by FLYHT shows positioning reports using the tracking system . All commercial planes are equipped with a 'black box', which does not transmit information to the ground . When the system is triggered data arrives from the aircraft within 15 seconds, and personnel are automatically notified via an urgent email or text message, or through visual or audible notification on FLYHT software. ‘With immediate event reporting and position tracking it is possible to enhance the provision of appropriate procedures and resources to improve SAR reaction times,’ the company said on its website. Most planes are equipped with the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, which transmits flight data to the ground but is not in real-time. Flight data recorders, or black boxes, do not transmit information to the ground. The disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines plane sparked calls for improved flight-tracking systems . The disappearance of MH370 sparked calls for airlines to improve their flight-tracking and data-reporting systems so that they are more precise, transmit data more frequently and cannot vanish without a trace while flying through 'blind spots' on conventional radar, including oceans and polar regions. Those calls were amplified following last week’s disaster involving AirAsia flight QZ8501, which crashed into the sea off Indonesia. But Mr Tempany isn't convinced that change will happen any time soon, telling the Washington Post: ‘The industry itself feels it has no reason to hurry up and do it. ‘They feel everything is good just the way it is. I personally have a very strong feeling that it’s not fair to the flying public.’","First Air's fleet is protected by a system that transmits real-time data .

As police were talking to the suspect, his father, 54-year-old Edward Campbell, allegedly pulled alongside in a red SUV and opened fire on the officers, ABC11 reported. The father fled in his truck but was captured 90 minutes later in the woods. A search of his truck revealed two dead bodies under a mattress on the flatbed, according to WRAL. A spokesman from the Greenbrier County Sheriff's Department told Daily Mail Online on Friday that two officers were shot by the suspects and had been hospitalized but were going to be fine. He said that the two quick-thinking cops had relatively new information as to the license plate of the stolen SUV when they apprehended the vehicle. Sheriff Brindell Wilkins, of Granville County, North Carolina, said he believed the couple were killed at their home and their bodies loaded into the truck before the suspects fled for more than 200 miles into West Virginia. Crime spree: The suspects allegedly abducted and killed the elderly couple in Oak Hill, North Carolina at 7am on January 1.

He and the couple's other son, Ricky, were at the scene helping investigators. The pastor said that he was first alerted to the fire at the elderly couple's home on Thursday morning and went down there. Amid the busy scene, he could only stand and watch as their home burned to the ground. Mr Richard said that he only found out the full extent of the tragedy when reports emerged on Thursday night. He said that the church congregation planned to come together on Friday night to share their feelings and pray. 'We have seen death before,' he said. 'But this is something so brutal and vicious.

"Several Oregon players are facing team discipline after celebrating their Rose Bowl win Thursday night by mocking Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston and allegations of sexual assault that have followed the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner the past two years. Video taken from the field as Oregon celebrated its 59-20 win in the College Football Playoff semifinal showed at least three players chanting 'No means no!' to the tune of a chant used by Florida State fans.

The short video was uploaded to Vine by Bear Heiser of Fox Sports West, who said the video was taken on the field as Oregon players celebrated the win from a podium. He shared a longer, 27-second video that showed the chant initiated somewhere off-camera, with the players in the shorter video, as well as wide receiver Chance Allen, joined in. Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said in a statement  that the behavior was inappropriate. 'This is not what our program stands for, and the student-athletes will be disciplined internally,' Helfrich said. Winston was never charged after a woman accused him of raping her in 2012, and was recently cleared of violating Florida State's student code of conduct.

The case was the focus of a major New York Times piece, that pointed out some rather shocking details about how the incident was handled. The victim, a freshman at the school, showed signs of trauma after reporting the rape and was later found to have had semen in her underwear. Despite the trauma and the presence of fluids however, no investigation was ever done into the incident by local police or the University. What's more, Winston, who was immediately named by the victim as her rapist, was never given a DNA test and was not interviewed for two weeks. And so, despite the trauma and semen, the local prosecutor announced he lacked the necessary evidence to charge Winston and the case was dropped. Winston would go on to win the Heisman trophy the following year.

"Two Italian aid workers captured by Islamic extremists in Syria this summer are believed to have appeared in a new video begging for their lives. Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August while distributing aid in Aleppo. Now video footage has emerged apparently showing the pair wearing niqabs, sitting in a sparse concrete room and holding a piece of paper with the date Wednesday, December 17 written on it. Scroll down for video . Video footage has emerged which seems to show Italian women Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, begging to be returned home and warning that their lives are in danger after being captured in Syria . Miss Ramelli (left) and Miss Marzullo (right), who travelled to Aleppo this summer to help distribute aid, are thought to be hostages of Jabhat Al-Nusra, and Al Qaeda affiliated group fighting dictator Bashar Al Assad . The camera is placed in a fixed position in front of them, but neither look directly into it, and instead seem to be looking down at a script, as Miss Ramelli reads from it. Speaking in badly-worded English, she says: 'We are Gretta Ramelli and Vanessa Marzullo. We supplicate our government and its mediators to bring us back home before Christmas. 'We are in big danger and could be killed. The government and it mediators are responsible of our lives [sic].' The message seems to have been recorded three weeks ago, thought it is not clear why it has only come to light now. The Italian foreign ministry has so-far refused to comment. The 32 second clip appeared on YouTube on Wednesday, and is titled 'Al-Nusra Front detains two Italian employees because of their government's participation in the coalition against it.' However the video was not posted on any official accounts belonging to Al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Just after the pair vanished on August 1, Miss Marzullo's father revealed he had begged her not to go to Syria, but she had insisted, saying she wanted to help people . Al Nusra are not linked to terror group Islamic State, who have previously published gruesome videos of hostages being executed, including Britons Daivd Haines and Alan Henning . In previous hostage videos by the group, detainees have been shown in front of Al-Nusra's flag. According to reports at the time of the girls' disappearance, they were captured on August 1 along with an Italian journalist who managed to escape. The pair were initially taken to the town of El Ismo, west of Aleppo where they were transported to the home of the head of the local Revolutionary Council. As the news spread, Miss Marzullo's father, Salvatore, revealed he had begged his daughter not to travel to Syria, but she had insisted on going. He said: 'What could I do? Vanessa is an adult, a golden girl, brave and responsible. I tried to reason with her, I tried to convince her in every way I could not to do what she had in mind. 'But when you realize that all your talk, your thoughts, and eventually all your prayers are not heard, what can you do? 'I could not stop her from doing what she wanted. It's not like you can take a person and tie them down. Tell me what I had to do. Was I wrong? I had to tie her down?' The girls travelled to the large Syrian city of Aleppo this summer, and continued posting images of bombed out cities and protest marches on their Facebook pages until mid-July . Miss Ramelli is pictured in Syria after she travelled there to give out aid before being captured by armed militia from the Jabhat Al-Nusra . Jabhat al-Nusra are a terrorist group based in Syria who are primarily engaged in fighting the regime of Bashar Al Assad and other Syrian groups, with the aim of establishing a fundamentalist Islamic regime. It is not known precisely how many hostages Al Nusra hold, though they are one of the most well armed, well equipped, and well established terror groups in Syria. As an affiliate of Al Qaeda, Al Nusra have no association with ISIS, who have become infamous for publishing gruesome videos of hostages being executed. British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning were killed by ISIS after being taken hostage, as well as American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and US aid worker Peter  Kassig.","Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, travelled to Syria this summer .

"A model who suffered years of being teased about her height has beaten her bullies to become a Naomi Campbell lookalike. Lystra Adams was constantly picked on by her classmates for being 'too tall and nerdy' but now says she can't leave the house without being stopped for autographs. The 37-year-old was bullied while at school in Montserrat and the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that used to suffer panic attacks before going to class. Lystra Adams has launched a career as a Naomi Campbell (pictured) lookalike after being bullied . But Lystra, who lives in Staffordshire, has since conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel's lookalike. The model says that she could never have imagined such a turnaround after her bullies had left her confidence at an all-time low. 'I was constantly bullied at school - I was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys, let alone girls my age, and I wore these thick glasses. As a child Lystra, pictured left, had always towered over her school friends and had worn thick glasses but after growing up, right, and moving to Halifax people constantly remarked on her likeness to Naomi . Lystra says she can rarely walk down the street without being stopped for autographs . 'This one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like ""freak"" and ""nerd"" and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back.' Lystra says that the jibes may have sounded tame but as a child they had really taken their toll. 'It doesn't sound much, but when you're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school. 'It was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all I think now is look at me now!' When people first remarked on Lystra's resemblance to Naomi (right) she had no idea who the supermodel was but after looking her up Lystra signed up to an agency and never looked back . Lystra says that since Naomi has been less of a diva she has seen her bookings slow down . In 1997, at the age of 20, Lystra moved from Montserrat to Yorkshire at the height of Naomi Campbell's catwalk career. The town of Halifax was a far cry from the runways of  Paris, Milan and New York - but was still stared at in the street. Astonishingly, at that time Lystra had no idea who the supermodel was so could not work out why she was receiving so much attention. 'When all these people stared at me I thought there was something wrong with me! As well as being approached by fans, Lystra says she has received a few negative comments when being mistaken for Naomi . 'I had no clue until one day, about a year after I'd arrived, this woman came up to me and told me I looked like Naomi Campbell. 'I just said ""Who?"" but when I looked it up I was flattered and started doing lookalike work.' Soon after noticing her resemblance to Naomi, Lystra put her career into motion and has never looked back. 'I signed up with the Model Bank modelling agency in Birmingham, and I have been in work ever since.' For the past 15 years Lystra has been hired to turn up at functions and events in stretch limos and be 'papped' on the red carpet. Lystra even claims that at one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards, who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet. As the supermodel - the first black model to cover French Vogue in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press, lookalike work has slowed for Lystra. 'She's been a bit less of a diva recently though - I need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in!' Still Lystra says she is stopped in the street on the daily - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter Jasmine, 13. 'There isn't a day goes by where I'm not told I look like her - if I had a pound for every time that happened I'd have as much money as her! 'Whenever we go on holiday I'm always stopped for autographs - it probably doesn't help that I'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva! 'I had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after I told her I wasn't Naomi.' As well as admiration Lystra says that her likeness to the super model has seen her deal with some negative comments. 'On the other hand, another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she didn't believe I wasn't Naomi and said I was lying and being a b**** and a diva! 'Sometimes I just can't win, but I try not to complain - there are worse people to look like!'","Lystra Adams was teased for years about her height by classmates .

"Happy New Year! Although, if you celebrated New Year's Eve properly then you probably aren't feeling so happy right now. In fact, you should be feeling properly awful. Like you never want to party or drink again? If you are contemplating a Dry January then this is actually an excellent thing: remembering this feeling of self-loathing meets severe dehydration will help you through those long, cold, sober Friday nights (there are FIVE of them this month, people). If booze is a big part of your life then taking a month's time out from your old friend is of course a daunting task. Scroll down for video . As many of us attempt the daunting prospect of dry January FEMAIL's Toni Jones gives advice on how to swap wine for water for a whole month . But it's also a brilliant thing to do for many reasons: to save money, to lose weight, to reset your body and brain ready to take on a new year, to prove to yourself that you can actually do it, to break habits, and to have an excuse to organise the RETOX party to end all parties when you finally make it to February. I gave up drinking for a month last February (partly to do with travelling in January and more to do with it being the shortest month of the year). As a professional drinker I found it tough: lots of my work and social life is booze-if-not-bar based. Plus, I generally love drinking and the bonhomie and fun times that accompany a night on the ale. But I did it (surprising side effects included more morning sex and too many ideas to handle) and now have lots of tips on staying sane while staying sober. So, with thanks too to some of my best drinking buddies, here are 11 ways to help you stay dry when you really would rather not be... DITCH YOUR FRIENDS . Not forever. But staying on the wagon is a lot easier when you remove yourself from situations that usually include booze. And friends and booze tend to go together like gin and tonic (mmmmm....). If you are giving up booze for a month you might want to forget seeing friends who aren't . This is the time to start screening calls, ignoring invitations and make the most of your Netflix membership. Jon Snow, Carrie Mathison and What's App will be your new BJFs (Best January Friends). Don't worry, your real friends will understand, because they will be doing the same to you. GROOM A PARTNER IN CRIME . The exception to the rule above. Most of us have loads of PICs for naughty nights, now you need some for sober time. If you live with someone try to get that boyfriend/brother/flat mate/wife on the sober train too. Like a diet, it's much easier to stay strong when you have support and a joint food or booze-free fridge. Away from the house start doing something that doesn't involve going to the pub, with one of your most fun (and strong on willpower) friends like movies, dog walking or spinning. NUMBER CRUNCH . On the subject of diets, let's look at this from an entirely shallow point of view and calculate the calories you are saving each time you DON'T drink. Not drinking 20 glasses of wine per week (that's four bottles, not unheard of in my house) = a saving of over 28,000 calories and £350 across the month. That's pretty epic. Stay dry, get thin! (Cancer Research has a great calculator on their Dryathlon page). EMPTY THE HOUSE . Remove temptation by throwing or hiding away all alcohol. A cold beer is a lot less appealing if you need to head to Thresher in the rain to procure it. By forgoing wine for an entire month you could save yourself 28,000 calories . Stock up on nice-tasting alternatives like elderflower fizz or fruity smoothies to sate your sugar cravings. And serving soft drinks with ice in elegant glasses will give them a feeling of ceremony, tricking your brain into thinking of them as a treat. GO TO BED . Hiding away 24/7 isn't feasible, but not drinking and then thinking about not drinking can get very boring indeed, and so sometimes going to bed at 8pm is the only thing to do. Friends on the 5:2 diet have similar issues with food on the '2' days and swear by herbal sleeping tablets and a dose of David Nicholls under the duvet. MAKE PLANS . Keeping busy is the best way to keep your mind off anything and having (booze-free) plans means that you are less likely to say yes to a quick one after work or find yourself wandering into the local off license for a browse. Club Soda is a website for people wanting to change their drinking habits and has loads of ideas on stuff to do if you need some inspiration. SAY NO . If your willpower is weaker than a Stella splash with too much Sprite (mmmmm...) turn down or push back any social/professional events that aren't vital. If 'no' is not an option choose breakfast meetings instead of lunch/dinner. If it has to be a dinner fill your wine glass with sparkling water. It might not pass the Debretts test darling but will help feel like you aren't being too worthy (and also make you realise how much wine drinking at dinner is just habit). If it's a party then arrive late so that everyone's tipsy enough not to notice you aren't really drinking (there's nothing duller than having to explain to slightly drunk people that you're off the booze) and ignore any (usually grim) Mocktails in favour of a soda and lime. BECOME THE DESIGNATED DRIVER . Nominating yourself as the group taxi on a night out is a brilliant way to stay dry AND earn mega brownie points from your friends (assuming you can cope with their drunk selves telling you to ""turn it up, drive"" from the backseat as you head home). TREAT YOURSELF . Set goals and decide on some suitable rewards for when you reach your target. Getting to ten days, surving a big event, making it through Monday without booze are all causes for a celebration I think. START A MORNING ACTIVITY . No booze = no hangovers = longer days. Even a short time off the drink will mean the 'morning after' will become the 'morning before' and no matter how good you think you are at hangovers you WILL have more energy and time at the start of the day. How will you use it? If you have children this is a chance to fit in some of the life laundry that never seems to get done (or maybe just an extra hour of crucial social media stalking). If you don't, this is the perfect time to take up some kind of exercise (also a great motivator for needing to feel fresh in the morning when the lure of the bar is extra strong). For everyone, it's a window in the diary to plan the rest of the day's healthy living, or at least order some more Nytol from Boots.com. And if all else fails... GET PREGNANT/GO TO PRISON . Extreme, yes. But a straw poll of my Facebook friends indicates that extreme measures may be needed in the battle to stay dry. Your body will thank you for it.","Dry January will see many of us giving up booze for an entire month .

"Tragedy: Shannon Zwanziger passed away in early December after contracting the flu . Now that the CDC has declared a national flu epidemic that has already claimed the lives of at least 15 children and nearly 1,000 others, the parents of a Minnesota teen who died from the virus last month are speaking out. Shannon Zwanziger, 17, died on December 9 after being struck down with this years mutated H3N2 strain, despite having no underlying health conditions. The healthy teenager had not visited a doctor for three years and passed away in her mother's arms after she had to help daughter out of a bath, so weak was she from the debilitating virus. 'I helped her get in the bathtub, but when I saw her eyes, I said, 'I think this is a mistake -- we've got to get you out of here,' said her mother, Gwen, in Owatonna, Minnesota, to CNN on Wednesday. 'She couldn't help me get her out. So I lifted her up, and she passed away in my arms.' Frantically calling for her husband Terry to come and help her, Zwanziger tried to administer mouth-to-mouth before EMT's arrived and flew her by air ambulance to hospital. Sadly she never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead. 'She was such an incredible kid,' said Gwen Zwanziger. 'She had her whole life planned out. She was living life to the fullest. If you're going to have the perfect kid, she was it.' Scroll Down for Video . No health issues: According to Shannon's parents, she had no underlying health problems before she got the flu . Family: Terry, Gwen and Shannon Zwanziger at home in Minnesota with their family dog in happier times . One week earlier, Zwanziger had taken her daughter to a clinic when she became sickly and was told that yes, it was the flu, but that she needed fluids and bed rest. However, she became so ill that her liver 'gave out' according to the autopsy - which confirmed she had type A flu. Gwen has said that although her daughter's health care was excellent, she wants people suffering symptoms to have tests to see if they have underlying health issue. Gwen also revealed that Gwen had not had the flu vaccine, however it is unknown if that would have had any bearing because the CDC have admitted that this year's batch is useless against up to 50 percent of flu virus's this season. Up to its most recent report issued for the last week of December, the CDC said that the flu has hit epidemic levels across the country as activity of the virus became widespread in 36 states. Officials said that 837 flu deaths were registered in its 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System and that those deaths accounted for the 6.8 percent of the 12,358 people who died that week - meeting an epidemic threshold. The flu epidemic was raging across the country with 36 states seeing high levels of the outbreak . Victims: Ayzlee McCarthy, 3,  and Jose Gullapa, 6, all passed away within 72 hours of contracting the flu . The crisis is only going to worsen, with January and February the worst months for flu nationwide. The problem worrying the authorities is the particular strain of flu. This year's dominant strain is the H3N2, which was not targeted by vaccinations this year. It affects children and those over 65 particularly, such as Ayzlee McCarthy, who died three days after developing symptoms at home in Des Moines, Iowa. Ayzlee had no underlying health conditions and was buried on New Year's Day. Another child who died just days after developing symptoms was Jose Gullapa, 6, who passed away in his father's arms on December 20. He had fallen ill just two days before, but was suffering from asthma. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared a national flu epidemic on Tuesday as this year's, virulent mutated strain, the H3N2 virus, swept from coast to coast. The Midwest and southeast of the country were being hardest hit with cases. The CDC said the flu vaccine currently on the market doesn't prevent that strain's spread. Between October 1 and December 20, CDC figures show that 15 children have died from the virus and four in the week before Christmas. Epidemic: The number of states reporting high instances of flu across the country now stands at 22 . Six children in Tennessee have died this year from the flu, according to the state's Department of Health and so far East Tennessee Children's hospital has seen 442 children with flu this month. On Monday, Anne Arundel Medical Center in Maryland announced that an increased number of patients were coming to the hospital and visitors would be limited. Other Maryland hospitals including Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Northwest Hospital in Randallstown and Johns Hopkins, also put precautions in place, according to CBS. Delaware has seen nearly ten times the number of flu cases this year compared to the same time period last year. The Delaware Division of Public Health says there were 632 reported flu cases through December 20. For the same time period last year, there were just 70 flu cases. Health officials say the uptick reflects earlier influenza activity being reported throughout the country. Those particularly at risk are those over 65 and younger than four. Across the nation, 2,500 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis. According to the CDC, data from 122 U.S. cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline and is at the epidemic threshold of 6.8 per cent. About 90 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent H3N2 sub-type, the CDC reported. Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong. The flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in December while battling the illness. The CDC admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2. That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly. 'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden. CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC. Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season. Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter. The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. The three most deadly flu seasons of the last 10 years — in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 — were H3N2 seasons. In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said. But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said. An official with one vaccine manufacturer — GlaxoSmithKline — emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain. 'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business.","Shannon Zwanziger had no underlying health conditions say parents .

"The brother of an apparent street beggar who became an internet star for spending $100 on food for other people claims his 'mentally unstable' sibling chose to be homeless and is awaiting a $150,000 inheritance. Kevin Nickel also said the man the internet knows as Thomas - whose online donation kitty has received more than $135,000 from members of the public - is actually named Kenneth Nickel, or Kenny, and that he wants people to know 'it's all a scam' so that the donated money can go to those who actually need it. 'He's sitting on money - he's sitting on an estate,' Mr Nickel told CBS Los Angeles. 'He chose this way of life. 'This money needs to go to real people - people who have fallen down.' Mr Nickel says his brother is an alcoholic who lived with their parents up until their death recently, and that he is waiting on $150,000 from their estate. He suggested his sibling chose to live on the streets as he waits for the money. Scroll down for videos . Exposing his sibling: Kevin Nickel (left) has given an interview saying the homeless man the internet knows as Thomas is named Kenneth Nickel, or Kenny, who is set to inherit $150,000 from the estate of their late parents . Family photos: Mr Nickel provided some photos of his brother to show that he 'chose' to be homeless . Smartened up: In Josh Paler Lin's most recent video, Thomas, who became an internet hit after spending a $100 donation on food for his friends, is given a new suit and a makeover . Mr Nickel also said his brother recently spent some time in jail after being arrested for public intoxication. However he believes that his sibling may have been 'manipulated' into filming the video. The claims come after a witness spoke out about seeing the filming of the video by YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin, who claims to have given 'Thomas' $100 cash and then secretly followed him to a liquor store, where he bought food and gave it to homeless people in a park. Nursing student Taugan Tan Kadalim, 26, said he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw Paler Lin - who he recognized from his previous videos - in the driver's seat of a car. In the passenger seat, he claims, was Thomas. 'I was there, they didn’t ‘follow’ him,' Kadalim told CBS. 'They drove him there (to the liquor store). 'I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful and dishonest.' A spokesperson for Paler Lin told The Daily Mail on Friday that Kevin Nickel's statements to the media are 'totally untrue'. 'The video wants not staged,' the spokesperson, Imal Wagner, said. Thomas gave an interview to Fox LA insisting that to him it was 'all a surprise' and he had never met Josh before he was handed the $100. Gesture ... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money . He told the news channel: 'I appreciate it, most definitely. It's all a surprise to me. I thought this was just a project video, I had no idea this was going where it went. Thomas added: 'Normally people give you a dollar, maybe five as a big tip, but a hundred, wow that's a week's worth. Crazy.' Paler Lin said he initially set out to 'expose homeless people' in Los Angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol. However, Thomas proved to be an exception. Instead, he spent the money on food to share with his friends, prompting Paler Lin to return and surprise Thomas with a Christmas meal, makeover and a night in a hotel. The feel-good video spawned an Indiegogo page - believed to be run by Paler Lin - for Thomas to get his life back on track, which as of Friday had a total of $135,028. But critics have pointed to a number of flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000. YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit. One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh. Using chopsticks: Lin captioned this photo of Thomas:  'Taking Thomas to eat Shabu Shabu in this Xmas eve' Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right) 'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened. 'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.' Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site. 'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin. Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube . Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash. The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax. Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside. 'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said. He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart. After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people. Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin . However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'. 'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper. However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.' When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park. But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange. 'I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn't,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.' Giving: The camera following Thomas as he hands food to a family in the park he was initially filmed in . However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit. Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers. After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn't expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.' He added: 'I'm so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel. In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street. 'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Paler Lin said.
