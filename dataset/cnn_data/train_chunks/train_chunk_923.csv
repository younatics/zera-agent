"By . Alasdair Glennie . She sobbed her way through all 11 weeks of The Great British Bake off, only to fall at the final hurdle. So when Ruby Tandoh’s ordeal was over at last, she certainly had plenty of sorrows to drown. The disappointed contestant headed straight to her local pub to get ‘absolutely trolleyed’ – and kept her Twitter followers updated every step of the way. Miss Tandoh made the final three of the BBC2 competition, but was eliminated when her ‘showstopper’ wedding cake failed to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. Scroll down for videos . Updates: The Bake Off star used Twitter to keep her fans in the loop as she drowned her sorrows . As soon as the final episode was aired, the 21-year-old former model hit the tiles with a female friend. On the tiles: Ruby Tandoh meets up with a female friend . She was soon spotted the bar of at . her local pub in Southend, Essex, where she had what she described as . ‘the most desperately needed/deserved/overdue pint of my life.’ Several hours later, the philosophy . student had switched drinks. Tweeting a drunken message to Bake Off’s . eventual winner Frances Quinn, she said: ‘I LOVE YOU! I’m sitting . sobbing with pride and relief into my red wine. A friend for life :) xxx’ It seems Miss Tandoh may have been helped along the way by last year’s finalist James Morton. He shared his version of the Bake Off ‘drinking game’ online, which requires viewers to down a shot of alcohol every time a contestant or judge uses one of the show’s well known innuendos such as ‘soggy bottom’ and ‘good bake’. But Mr Morton updated the game – which became a hit with students last year – by insisting players finish all the alcohol in front of them when a contestant cries on air. Given Miss Tandoh spectacularly failed to keep the floodgates closed when she lost Tuesday night’s final, watching herself back on TV may have led her to consume more than was wise. She wrote: ‘Nothing like a drinking game to legitimise my getting absolutely trolleyed tonight. WOOHOO.’ The following morning – while a triumphant Miss Quinn was doing the rounds of breakfast TV studios – Miss Tandoh freely admitted she was nursing a sore head. Asked how her hangover was, she wrote: ‘Feeling a more than a little queasy...’ Miss Tandoh has made no secret of the fact she found her progress through the different stages of Bake Off more difficult than most. Joy... and more usually pain: Ruby holds one of her delicious creations, and the tears flow after criticism from the judges in the final . Not such a showstopper: Ruby deliberately avoided decorative baking in case she was dismissed as 'silly', as evidenced by her lacklustre wedding cake . Writing an article for The Guardian yesterday, she complained at the ‘nastiness’ of some fans. Viewers had persistently complained her self-effacing manner was false modesty, and accused her of flirting with Mr Hollywood to stay in the show. She said: ‘I’d rather eat my own foot than attempt to seduce my way to victory, and even if I had any intention of playing that card, it’s insulting to both the judges to suggest that they’d ever let their professional integrity be undermined in that way.’ Cake experts: (L-R) Ruby Tandoh with Mary Berry, Kimberley Wilson, Frances Quinn and Paul Hollywood .","Ruby Tandoh drowned her sorrows after failing to win TV competition .

"By . Leon Watson . The original painting of the Chinese Girl, thought to be the most reproduced print in the world, was bought by billionaire British businessman and jeweller Laurence Graff for nearly £1million today. Mr Graff, chairman of Graff Diamonds International, owns the Delaire Graff Estate near Stellenbosch, South Africa, where the picture will go on public display with the rest of his art collection. The jeweller, who in 2010 spent a staggering $46million (£30million) on a 24.78-carat rare pink diamond, paid £982,050 - nearly double its expected price - for the painting. Victoria Eaton of Bonhams in central London, adjusts Chinese Girl by the Russian artist Vladimir Tretchikoff . The work by Siberian-born artist Vladimir Tretchikoff was part of a sale of South African art at Bonhams auction house. Millions of reproductions of the picture, also known as the Green Lady because of the unusual blue-green skin tone of the subject, have been sold since it was painted in the 1950s. A Bonhams spokesman said: 'It's very exciting. Suddenly the market has decided they like what they can see with Tretchikoff.' Forbes magazine put Mr Graff’s net worth at $4.3billion (£2.8billion) this month, making him the eighth richest man in Britain and the 299th in the world. A self-made tycoon, Mr Graff grew up in the East End of London and dropped out of school at age 14 to become a jeweller's apprentice, the magazine said. The 74-year-old billionaire has more than 20 stores worldwide, including new outposts in Hong Kong, Gstaad and Dubai. The Sultan and Queen of Brunei, Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump are listed as clients. Laurence Graff who bought the original Chinese Girl painting, pictured with a diamond . Chinese Girl is the most iconic work by Vladimir Tretchikoff and is said to be the most widely reproduced and recognisable picture in the world . The sum is the highest ever paid for a work by Tretchikoff, who was born in Russia in 1913 but emigrated to South Africa after the Second World War, working for a period as a propaganda artist for the British Ministry of Information. The familiar image of the woman, with her dark hair and bright red lips, has featured on T-shirts, mugs and posters. The picture, which has been described as one of the most important pop culture images in Britain, was inspired by Monika Sing-Lee, who modelled for Tretchikoff after he spotted her at work in her uncle’s launderette in Cape Town, South Africa. The Bonhams spokesman added: 'It's almost triple the £380,000 we sold his painting Lenka for last year. 'It shows he's beginning to close in on the other major figures on the South African art landscape, Irma Stern - whose picture Arab Priest we previously sold for £3million - and Pierneef.' Pierneef's work Landscape, Stellenbosch sold for £713,250 and Stern's painting Congolese Beauty for £541,250 at the Bonhams auction today. Tretchikoff, who painted with oils and watercolours, died in Cape Town in 2006 at the age of 92. His work was often regarded as 'kitsch' during his lifetime, but Tretchikoff hated this categorisation and insisted he was a serious artist. In 1991 he rejected a request to have his work on the front cover of a book on kitsch for this reason. Tretchikoff's other notable works include Weeping Rose, Blue Monday, and The Dying Swan, which featured the dancer Alicia Markova.","Laurence Graff paid nearly double the expected price for the painting .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A couple who raised £60,000 to save their baby son from a life of silence have spoken of their joy after he reacted to sound for the first time. Oliver Bosch was born without vital nerves in his ears - meaning he was profoundly deaf and could not benefit from even the most advanced hearing aids. His parents Jemma and Ben were told by doctors their only hope was to send Oliver for an expensive operation at a leading clinic in Verona, Italy. But they had just six months to come up with the cash or it would be too late. Oliver Bosch was born profoundly deaf and could not benefit from even the most advanced hearing aids. Thanks to pioneering surgery he can now hear basic sounds . Hope: Thanks to donors, the couple raised the £60,000 they needed to take Oliver to Italy for pioneering surgery. There, surgeons fitted him with a special electronic device to stimulate his brain stem . When the device - known as an auditory brainstem implant - was switched on, Oliver instantly reacted to the sound of a banging drum . Scientists believe the procedure is largely ineffective on children over the age of two because their brains have already adapted to total deafness. Thanks to donors - including a £30,000 mystery donation - the couple raised the money in time, giving the go-ahead for surgeons to fit 19-month-old Oliver with a special electronic device to stimulate his brain stem. Last month they were able to travel to the University of Verona . Hospital so Oliver could be operated on by top surgeon Vittorio . Colletti, whose research helped develop the groundbreaking procedure. Oliver's family was thrilled when the device - known as an auditory brainstem implant - was switched on and Oliver instantly reacted to the sound of a banging drum. Mrs Bosch, 37, from Dundee, said: 'It has been a real race against time to raise this money and we're just so relieved we've managed to do it. 'It was very emotional when the implant was switched on and Oliver reacted to the sound of the drum. 'Both Ben and I promised each other that we would try not to cry and we just about managed to hold it together. 'We've been on quite a journey and we both know that if we'd waited just a few more months it could have been a different story as it might not have worked. 'It is a long road ahead and we still need to raise thousands more for all the speech therapy he'll need. 'But . we've now been told that by the age of five, his hearing should be at . the stage where he'll be able to have conversations on the phone. 'He'll be able to go to a mainstream school, which is something we never thought would have been possible before. 'We're absolutely overwhelmed by the generosity of people who have donated and fundraised and we want to have a big party to say thanks to them - they've given us the best gift ever.' Doctors discovered Oliver was deaf four . months after his birth in July 2011 but reassured his parents he would . be able to hear with the help of hearing aids. Oliver (with sister Darcy) now faces years of speech therapy, but doctors are confident he will still be able to learn to communicate normally . But Mrs Bosch and her husband, a 29-year-old dental technician, were devastated when tests revealed Oliver's auditory nerves were missing completely and that surgery was his only hope. They were offered a date for the operation last year but had to turn it down because they hadn't raised enough money. Mrs Bosch, a full-time mother to Oliver and his five-year-old sister Darcy, added: 'We were devastated when we first found out what was wrong with Oliver. 'The thought of your child never being able to hear or speak is heartbreaking - all you want is for them to say ""mummy"" and ""daddy"". 'When we heard about the operation, we knew we could never afford it but we had to do everything we could for Oliver. 'It was so hard to have to turn down the . first operation date but getting the £30,000 donation was just amazing, . although we don't know who it was from.' Oliver's mother Jemma said she was 'absolutely overwhelmed' by the generosity of people who have donated and fundraised . Oliver underwent surgery on February 26th and the auditory brainstem implant was activated on March 26th. He now has a total of 12 electrodes in his brain, which will help him to interpret sound. He faces years of speech therapy but doctors are confident that he will still be able to learn to communicate normally and could be holding full conversations before he reaches school age. Mrs Bosch said: 'It sounds so silly, but I used to worry so much that Oliver wouldn't be able to go to the pub with his friends when he turned 18 because he wouldn't be able to hear anything. I just feel so relieved that he won't be so left out. 'We just want to thank everyone who has helped us get to this stage.'

An auditory brainstem implant (ABI) is a small device that is surgically implanted in the brain of a deaf person whose auditory nerves are lacking or damaged. The auditory nerves conduct the sound signals from the ear to the brain. The implant enables otherwise deaf people to have a sensation of hearing. The auditory brainstem implant consists of a small electrode applied to the brainstem (the part that joins the spinal cord), small microphone on the outer ear, and a speech processor. The electrode stimulates vital acoustic nerves by means of electrical signals and the speech processor digitally transmits the sound signals to a decoding chip placed under the skin. A small wire connects the chip to the implanted electrode attached to the brainstem. Depending on the sounds, the electrode delivers different stimuli to the brainstem, making deaf people hear a variety of sounds.

"By . Kate Lyons . Woolworths is trialling a controversial scheme, offering in-store medical checks to people while they shop. The retailing giant has hired nurses to conduct blood pressure and cholesterol checks on shoppers. The program is currently being trialled in nine stores across New South Wales and Queensland and may be expanded to other states soon. Scroll down for video . One of the new recruits: A nurse at Woolworths in Canberra last week. The health check program is being trialled in nine stores in New South Wales and Queensland . The scheme has come under fire from the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Guild of Pharmacists as 'risky' and 'highly inappropriate'. Many of the criticisms of the program were based on a job advertisement on Seek.com, believed to be from Woolworths, which called for 'final year pharmacy students, or graduate pharmacists; and entry level nurses' to join their team. However, a Woolworths spokesperson denied that the advertisement was from their company, saying they were not hiring pharmacists and the advertisement was 'issued by a third party and did not relate to Woolworths' in‐store cholesterol and blood pressure testing trial.' The spokesperson added that the cholesterol and blood pressure tests in Woolworths stores were performed by 'qualified nurses',  and in a survey of people who had used the service more than 90 percent said they thought it was valuable and useful. The Australian Medical Association has called on Woolworths to scrap the scheme, saying it undermines quality health care and puts people at risk. 'Even if they're only using nurses, we don't think any health checks should be occurring in-store, we don't think it's the right environment,' said a spokesman from the Australian Medical Association. AMA President Associate Professor Brian Owler added: 'Nothing is simple or straightforward when checking a person's health. In the proposed Woolworths environment, there would be no access to patient history and there would be no privacy.' 'These checks also run the risk of making people think they would not have to see their doctor.' As well as this, Mr Owler said it was 'highly inappropriate' to conduct health checks in a supermarket that sold alcohol, cigarettes, sugary drinks, energy drinks and foods that are high in fat.

"By . James Chapman . Foreign visitors and short-term migrants cost the NHS £2billion a year, an official report warns today. The first comprehensive assessment of ‘health tourism’ says the true cost to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates. It concluded the Health Service has ‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. Costly: A report estimated the health tourism costs the NHS up to £2billion a year . The bill was put at between £1.9billion and £2billion  – with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back. The Government said it would be ‘impractical or inappropriate’ to charge in full some patients, such as students or those with infectious diseases. However Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hopes to recover up to £500million a year, arguing Britain cannot afford an ‘international health service’. The study estimates that £388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged. Health tourists – those who specifically travel to the UK for treatment – cost up to £300million more. The Home Office plans a new annual levy of £150 on foreign students and £200 on temporary migrants. The surcharge is expected to generate £200million. Extra strain: According to Professor Thomas, the NHS levy will make coming to the UK for treatment even more attractive . Angry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt vows to recover £500m and blasts our 'international health service' Today's findings will prove highly controversial – and are likely to be hotly disputed by the Left-wing medical establishment. Labour suggested earlier this year . that the Government was ‘xenophobic’ for proposing charges for more . temporary visitors and migrants. The situation is complex when it . comes to deciding in practice who is and who is not eligible for free . NHS hospital treatment. Data on migrants in the UK is limited, and that . which has previously been compiled is of very poor quality. The Government admits that today’s . twin reports on the scale of the problem are, by definition, based on . incomplete information and a series of assumptions and must be treated . with some caution. The documents concede that the . definition of ‘health tourists’ can vary widely, applying to people who . come here deliberately to obtain free healthcare, and others who are . simply frequent visitors who register with GPs. Researchers conducted telephone . interviews with 36 senior officials at a cross-section of NHS trusts, . and interviews with nine Border Force and immigration enforcement . officers based at five major airports.  Seven trusts involved the study . were visited and a range of staff, from clinicians through to front line . staff, were interviewed face-to-face. To collect data about the number of . migrants and overseas visitors in a more consistent way; a ‘diary’ was . distributed to NHS staff taking part in the study inviting them to keep a . record of all patients brought to their attention over a two-week . period. Mr Hunt said: ‘Having a universal . health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the . world, but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking . British taxpayers who fund it. ‘It’s . time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service – not an . international one. With the NHS already under pressure from an ageing . population, it cannot be right that large amounts of taxpayers’ money is . being lost through treating people who should be paying from foreign . countries.’ Ministers have . appointed Sir Keith Pearson, former chief of the NHS Confederation, as . an adviser on ‘visitor and migrant cost recovery’. He will bring in . measures to identify those who should pay and find ways of making them . do so. Estimates of the cost of ‘health tourism’ have varied from £20million to £200million, sparking much political controversy. Kailash . Chand, of the British Medical Association, insisted earlier this year: . ‘Believe me, there is little evidence that health tourism is a . significant burden on the NHS. The £40million allegedly written off over . the last four years by hospitals in England and Wales is approximately . 0.01 per cent of the NHS budget over the period.’ Diane . Abbott, then a Labour health spokesman, suggested charging foreigners . for care was ‘xenophobic’ and Clare Gerada of the Royal College of GPs . said: ‘It is important we do not overestimate the problem.’ But even if only 75 per cent of the £500million target is recovered, it would pay the salaries of almost 4,000 doctors. Free care is offered to temporary visitors and students, unlike in Spain, where students must pay £50 a month. Australia charges £260 a year for restricted private health insurance for students. The Home Office’s Immigration Bill will create the powers to increase the number of migrants who will have to pay to access healthcare. Labour pointed out that the figures from the Department of Health were based on ‘incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions’. Andy Burnham, Opposition health spokesman, said: ‘We are in favour of improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment. 'More spin than substance': Opposition health spokesman Andy Burnham dismissed today's report . ‘But it’s hard not to conclude that this announcement is more about spin than substance. The Government’s own report undermines their headline-grabbing figures, admitting they are based on old and incomplete data. ‘Instead of grandstanding, the government need to focus on delivering practical changes. Labour would not support changes that make doctors and nurses surrogate immigration officials.’ Earlier this year, the Mail highlighted a warning from a consultant of the ‘massive and escalating problem’ of foreigners travelling to Britain to exploit the NHS. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of The Royal Marsden hospital in London, suggested in an article for the Spectator magazine that expectant mothers were arriving in this country just to give birth, while others are flying here for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment and leaving without paying. The Government estimates that in hospitals alone fewer than 50 per cent of chargeable foreign nationals are identified.","Previous figures estimated £20m to £200m of NHS funds went on tourists .

"By . Emma Thomas . A rise in the number of flies has prompted a run on the unusual Christmas gift of Venus Fly Traps, a report says. Britain's women are buying the carnivorous plant to give to the men in their lives, says high street retailer Homebase. Demand has rocketed by 50 per cent, making it one of the fastest selling plants in the UK. Unusual: Venus Fly Traps, which have the Latin name Dionaea muscipula, trap flies and insects by suddenly closing the spikes of their leaves around them. Demand has risen by 50 per cent this year . Homebase Marketing Director Jo Kenrick said: 'This is fidelity in a plant pot. It's a reminder that trust is essential in every relationship - as well as being an environmentally friendly way to keep pest in your kitchen under control.' The hidden meaning in the gift of a Venus fly Trap emerged when Homebase carried out customer research into its growing horticultural market. However, as well as being used to send a message to partners, the recent boom in food waste home composting bins across Britain has also had a huge effect upon demand for the unique fly eating plants. Experts believe that environmentally aware homeowners are choosing the carnivorous plant to reduce the additional number of flies created by the bins. Carnivorous: Venus Fly Traps derive all of the food and energy they need for growth from its prey . Venus Fly Traps, which have the Latin name Dionaea muscipula, trap flies and insects by suddenly closing the spikes of their leaves around them. Powerful juices secreted by glands in each leaf then digest the victim while it is still alive. It is a native of subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of America. Venus Fly Traps derive all of the food and energy they need for growth from the prey that they catch. Adding fertilizer to the soil can kill it. Ms Kenrick said: 'Venus Fly Traps take a little while to settle into a new home, but they're can be a much better alternative to insecticides sprays. 'The sudden popularity of Venus Fly Traps shows how British plant tastes are changing. Until comparatively recently, our most popular plants would have been those found in a typical English country garden, with roses, tulips, chrysanthemums and other native plants on the top of everyone's list. 'However, recently we've noticed a move towards less traditional plants, with Australian tree ferns, dwarf palms and olive trees becoming more popular. We believe that the increased number of people taking holiday abroad may be having an effect. 'Seeing exotic plants growing overseas, encourages British people to recreate a little bit of their holiday in their gardens when they return.'","Britain's women are buying carnivorous plant to give to men in their lives .

"By . Alan Roden . Alex Salmond’s top advisers have held a crisis summit on their referendum campaign as panic sweeps through the Scottish Government. The Scottish Daily Mail can reveal that civil servants were ordered to raid the public purse and launch an unprecedented advertising blitz in a desperate bid to close the gap on the No campaign. Mr Salmond’s most senior political aides, the Scottish Government’s top mandarins and heads of the communications department attended the emergency meeting on Thursday, which was convened in less than 24 hours. What does the future hold? Top advisers to Alex Salmond (pictured) have held a crisis summit on their referendum campaign as panic sweeps through the Scottish Government . Fearing they have been massively ‘out-gunned’ by the Westminster Government, the SNP administration now plans to send a pro-independence document to every household in Scotland at a likely cost to taxpayers of more than £700,000. They are also set to follow the UK Government’s lead and bombard the Google internet search engine with adverts, boost their social media presence on sites such as Facebook and Twitter and engage more with businesses and organisations. Attempts will be made to target online adverts at youngsters and women, who are among the most hostile groups to separation. And the Mail understands that several SNP politicians have been told they must curtail their summer holidays to focus on the battle to destroy the Union. The dramatic increase in activity comes after recent opinion polls gave the No campaign a 20-point lead over Yes, with just over 80 days to go until the referendum on September 18. Ewan Crawford, Mr Salmond’s ‘senior special adviser’ on constitutional issues, was behind the crisis summit, while other key players included special adviser Liz Lloyd, policy executive Martin McDermott of the elections and constitution division, and head of news Fiona Wilson. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is leading the government’s referendum campaign, was urgently briefed on the outcome and – in a desperate attempt to distract from the Mail’s revelations – rushed out a press release announcing a ‘major public information campaign’ at 6.30pm last night. Support: The dramatic increase in SNP activity comes after recent opinion polls gave the No campaign a 20-point lead over Yes, with just over 80 days to go until the referendum . Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ""This crisis summit shows the nationalist government knows its assertions and bluster isn't cutting the mustard in the face of the considered, factual case to remain in the UK. 'Alex Salmond's rushed PR strategy won't cover up the fundamental risks of independence that his White Paper failed to address. 'With only weeks left they are running around like headless chickens desperately grasping for the appropriate wheeze that will win then their long sought after dream. It shows how desperate they have become.' Anas Sarwar, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said: “The nationalists' campaign looks to be in meltdown because the majority of Scots are seeing through their bluster and assertions and deciding we are better together. 'The SNP are running out of time to persuade Scots to break up the country and no matter how much they spend on advertising, their message of division and grievance is being rejected.' The crisis meeting comes after Better Together board members held their own emergency talks in March, as exclusively revealed by the Scottish Daily Mail. They dramatically reversed the campaign tactics and a more positive message was adopted as part of a major advertising drive. Selfie time: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond with former pupil and apprentice Rachel Kyle, at Ayrshire College on Wednesday . At the time, the gap in the polls had narrowed significantly to just a few percentage points. But the latest poll, published earlier this month by YouGov, found that 53 per cent of adults plan to vote No, up two points since March, while support for Yes has slipped from 37 per cent to 36 per cent. As well as a concerted effort from Labour to defeat independence, the Tory/LibDem government has produced more than 2.5million 16-page publications, which are being delivered to every household in Scotland. The initiative cost taxpayers £720,000 and the Scottish Government will launch a similar mailshot in early August, after the Glasgow Commonwealth Games are over. Paid-for Google adverts will specifically be targeted at young and female voters, the Mail understands, while there will be ‘promoted Tweets’ – which are essentially adverts on Twitter. Miss Sturgeon said last night: “We want people to be armed with the facts before they vote, which is why we are stepping up our public information campaign in the coming weeks. 'This will match the efforts of the UK Government in every way. The Tory-led Westminster Government has been using public funds to push their anti-independence message, and it is important that that is directly countered.'","Top advisers hold crisis summit on referendum on ailing Yes campaign .

"By . Paul Thompson . A female impersonator has launched a $20million lawsuit for damages after he was jailed in a prison for women. Carla Brenner said his life became a living hell once the other prisoners realized he was a man. The 52-year-old drag queen said he was assaulted and abused by the other prisoners when they realized he had still had male anatomy. Outraged: Carla Brenner, pictured here in drag, filed a lawsuit against Metro Health Department in Nashville for placing him in a female prison even though he is a man . Brenner, who wears women's clothing and refers to himself as a 'she,' says he did not undergone a sex change and has not intention of becoming a woman . Despite dressing like a woman Brenner maintains that he was still a man and has not undergone a sex change. He claims he was examined by two sets of doctors - but because he looked like a woman was sent to a female facility. ‘The big hair, the makeup - I am an entertainer, a drag queen,’ he said. ‘That basically means a man who enjoys dressing as a woman. It's not a woman. I have no intention on being a woman - never, ever have.’ Brenner's problems began when he was convicted of felony theft in 2011 and jailed for three months in Nashville, Tennessee. Brenner said he was examined by the Metro Health Department in Nashville and he said it was obvious that he was a man. Accusations: Brenner claims he was examined by two sets of doctors, but ended up in a female prison for three months because he looked like a woman . ‘How can you not tell a vagina from a penis? They had two doctors - someone from the board of health and a Metro administrator come to the jail. ‘And they had me get on the table and examined me and everything. They also said I was female. I don't understand that,’ Brenner said. Brenner, who is also known as Lamonda Fuller, claimed officials deliberately said he was a woman. Dual identity: The 52-year-old is a drag entertainer who also goes by the name Lamonda Fuller . He claims in his lawsuit that when he complained he was threatened with being locked in solitary confinement. After being sent to the female prison run by the Corrections Corporation of America he said he was abused by the other women. ‘I was strip searched, completely naked, with the women. I was showered with the women. I was sexually assaulted on two separate occasions in the shower by women,’ said Brenner. Brenner claimed his stay for several months was so traumatic he contemplated suicide. ‘I survived it through the grace of God, because it was hell. I had contemplated suicide. It was horrible,’ Brenner said. His lawyer, Jim Roberts, claimed authorities deliberately placed him in the female prison. ‘Metro's decision was, “Let's do it the easy way. She looks female on the outside. We will lie to everybody and say she's a female,” even though they knew she was a male the entire time,’ Roberts said. ‘When Metro takes shortcuts like that people get hurt, people get killed and people's rights get violated,’ he added. Officials with both CCA and Metro Health said they cannot comment on the lawsuit or any medical information on a specific inmate. Harsh treatment: Brenner says he was sexually abused by female prisons who became angry when they discovered that he is a man .

"By . Sandra Parsons . As a devoted Bake Off fan, my adoration of Mary Berry knows no bounds. But on Tuesday night my faith in her collapsed faster than an over-beaten sponge. Because the wrong woman won. The final was as tense as it was confusing. The annoying but undeniably talented Ruby produced a wedding cake that could have been knocked up by a 12-year-old. Meanwhile, the almost as annoying but consistently excellent Kimberley presented a pie that was nothing short of a shambles. Scroll down for video . Worthy winner? Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood thought Frances Quinn deserved the 2013 Great British Bake Off title . As for Frances, to most of the nine million of us watching, she didn't appear to be in the running for the Bake Off crown. It was a two-woman race and there was only one question: had Kimberley ruined her chances with that terrible pie? So, when the sainted Mary announced that she had 'a winner in mind', I felt nothing but quiet relief. Naturally, she would know who should win. (As for fellow judge Paul Hollywood, I'm afraid I can no longer respect his judgment since he left his wife for a bit of fondant fancy). Mary, however, is another matter. Like her similarly kind, but no-nonsense namesake, Mary Poppins, she is practically perfect in every way. So, how could she have got it so wrong? Style over substance: But her wedding cake was undeniably the best when it came to appearance . The final three await the verdict: It appeared to be a two horse race between Ruby, centre, and Kimberley . Frances Quinn is charming and unassuming. Or at least that's how the BBC production team chose to present her - just as they must have decided Ruby would be the Tearful One and Kimberley the Confident One. And Frances is certainly creative. A clothes designer, her artistic skills were evident from the start. Indeed, by episode five, her canapes (cunningly made to look like carrots and mini cauliflowers) were so astonishing that Paul decreed they were of professional quality. But Britain's best non-professional baker she ain't. Surprise: Frances' victory shocked many viewers . What's more, I'd lay odds that there are dozens of women in every town in Britain who can bake more flavoursome cakes and pies. Throughout the contest, the criticism from both judges - Mary in particular - was that Frances produced 'style over substance', with bakes that looked fantastic, but tasted less so. Yes, her wedding cake decoration was vastly superior to Ruby's and Kimberley's disappointingly home-spun efforts. But it didn't taste better - and as both of them had beaten Frances in the previous two rounds, not to mention all but one of the previous heats, making her the winner was a travesty. If the Great British Bake Off can be won simply by a prettily decorated wedding cake, then all is lost for a programme that's become the nation's favourite precisely because - unlike most other reality shows - it has valued substance above all else. In fact, Mary Berry must have been as quietly appalled by Ruby's frequent tears as she was by Kimberley's show-off behaviour. Despite her withered left hand (from childhood polio) and the tragedy of her eldest son's death in a car crash aged just 19, she has never been self-indulgent or self-pitying. She's also modest, despite knowing more about cooking than an entire chef-filled Bake Off tent. So, perhaps the real reason why Frances won is simply that she was less irritating than the other two contestants. As for who should have won instead - oh dear, I was afraid you'd ask me that...","Final was as tense as it was confusing .

"By . Simon Walters for The Mail on Sunday . Anna Yearley, Labour general secretary is reported to have said that 'Northerners are backwards' A senior aide to Ed Miliband called Northerners ‘backward’ over choosing women MPs in a blazing row with a Labour veteran, it was claimed last night. Anna Yearley, the Labour leader’s political secretary and ‘fixer’, is said to have made the remark in an argument over moves to replace Northern male Labour MPs with younger, female ones. Austin Mitchell, 79, who is retiring as Labour MP for Great Grimsby, North East Lincolnshire, at the next Election, said Ms Yearley told him Labour activists in the North had blocked moves to promote more female MPs – and she was determined to make them toe the line. The allegation is especially embarrassing for Mr Miliband, whose Doncaster North constituency is in South Yorkshire. Mr Mitchell said Ms Yearley, from Oxfordshire, talked to him like ‘an educationally subnormal pensioner’. And, he claimed, leading female Labour MPs ran ‘an orchestrated campaign of abuse’ against him after he attacked the party’s all-women shortlists, designed to produce more female MPs. The furore took a further turn last night after Labour denied Ms Yearley had made the comment. But Mr Mitchell hit back, revealing Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, who was present at meetings between them, confirmed it. Miss Winterton later disputed this. Ms Yearley, 35, has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in the Labour leader’s office, acting as a link between Mr Miliband, MPs and unions. It is not the first time she has come under fire – earlier this year she was accused of bullying a junior official. Mr Mitchell said yesterday: ‘Ms Yearley said Yorkshire and Northerners are very backward when it comes to choosing women and something had to be done about it. She may be right, but Northerners have the right to choose whoever they want. She is a woman on a mission. I find her attitude condescending and it irked me. ‘She talked to me as though I was an educationally subnormal old-age pensioner. She said, “You think the best person for the job is always a man, but I think the best man for the job is a woman.” Last week's Mail on Sunday reported on the divisive row at the heart of the Labour party . ‘She had no right to treat me like an idiot, it was totally unjustified. She is totally out of touch with the real world.’ Ms Yearley’s style was questioned in June amid claims she treated a junior worker poorly. Gemma Tumelty, 33, quit as Labour’s stakeholder relations manager with a pay-off after complaining about her treatment. Ms Yearley denied any wrongdoing. She was also blamed for failing to predict the backlash after Mr Miliband posed with a copy of The Sun during the World Cup. The image angered some Liverpudlians who boycott the newspaper over its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster. A Labour spokesman said: ‘These claims are untrue. We want to see more women in Parliament and we make no apology for introducing, and using, all-women shortlists.’ Ms Yearley is believed to have convinced Ed Miliband, pictured, to pose with a copy of The Sun .","Labour is split over plans to introduce 'all women shortlists' for the election .

"By . Daniel Martin . The Chancellor in Glasgow on Monday: He has vowed to spend billions on a 'Crossrail of the North' to give an economic boost to Manchester and Leeds . George Osborne says it is better to spend public money on transport links in the North than continuing to fund so many people on welfare. The Chancellor yesterday pledged billions to fund a ‘Crossrail of the North’ to prevent cities such as Manchester and Leeds from lagging behind London and the south. He said that although the plans could cost as much as £15billion, the benefits that would accrue in terms of prosperity would be better than spending so much on benefits. Mr Osborne said that if the GDP of the north of England was brought up to the UK average, it would be worth an extra £56billion to the northern economy over the next 18 years – the equivalent of £1,600 per household. He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that governments should not have to choose between investing in the north or the south of the country. ‘I hope we don’t have to make a choice between the two,’ he said. ‘I think the real choice in our country is actually spending money on this big economic infrastructure, trans-Pennine rail links, Crossrail 2 in London and the like, and spending money on, for example, welfare payments which are not generating either a real economic return and at the same time, are trapping people in poverty.’ At an event in Manchester, he backed a report by the leaders of the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle who call for £15billion of investment to improve road and rail links. The Chancellor described cost in the One North report as ‘affordable’ – and that is was necessary to make it easier to travel between the cities to enable them to compete with London. The report said that if adopted, the 15-year investment plan, which complements the HS2 proposals, could deliver benefits for the whole of the North of England including up to 150 per cent additional capacity on roads and as much as 55 per cent quicker journey times on a faster, more frequent interconnected rail network. Mr Osborne said: ‘Of course £15billion is a lot of money – it’s about the size of the Crossrail project in London. ‘It’s a project over a number of years, out to 2030. We have got a £100 billion capital budget to the end of the decade. I think this kind of proposal is affordable.’ Mr Osborne has said he wants to build a ‘Northern powerhouse’ around the major cities of the North, whose legacy of heavy industry has led to an economic performance lagging behind the rest of the UK. The Chancellor also said that this autumn there will be new proposals on transferring more power and a bigger say over how money is spent, from Whitehall, to the cities and regions in a ‘new model of city governance’. He added: ‘I’m prepared to roll up my sleeves and get it done, so let’s get on with it’. Mr Osborne said if the Government and the cities could get the economic performance of the North to match the rest of the UK, it would add billions to the wealth of the nation and ‘rebalance’ the economy from an over-reliance on the City, London and the South East. Crossrail construction workers on the Connaught tunnel below the Royal Docks in east London: Public spending on infrastructure is £5,312 per person in London but in the North West it is only £420 per person . The One North plans also include increased road capacity for both freight and personal travel through extended motorways, improving links to ports and airports and fast and frequent intercity rail links, all interconnected with HS2, the super-fast North-South rail project from London. Labour Treasury spokeswoman Shabana Mahmood said: ‘Only Labour will properly back our city and county regions with ambitious plans to devolve more funding and economic power to them. ‘Mr Osborne will be judged on his actions, not his words. He is failing to back the Heseltine report or Labour’s plans to devolve billions of pounds of funding.’ Figures from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) show the North has fared badly in terms of investment in the past. Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, said planned spending of public money on transport infrastructure in the National Infrastructure Plan was £5,312 per person in London but in the North West it was £420 per person and the North East just £157 per person.","Bringing the North's GDP up to UK average could boost economy by £56bn .

"By . Associated Press . An Egyptian teenager accused of illegally protesting his country’s government has defected to the United States after attending an international science fair for high school students in Los Angeles. Abdullah Assem, 17, decided not to board a Cairo-bound plane Sunday for fear he would be arrested upon landing. For the last four days he has stayed with family friends in Los Angeles County while he seeks asylum in the U.S. Seeking asylum: Egyptian teen prodigy Abdullah Assem chose not to board a flight home after attending a science fair in Los Angeles . Last week, Abdullah was one of 1,787 teens participating in the six-day International Science and Engineering Fair sponsored by chipmaker Intel at the Los Angeles Convention Center. His project, 'Eye Detection and Tracking-Based Communication System for Tetraplegia Patients,' had qualified for the competition through one of the program’s 450 preliminary science fairs. His research involved the use of eyeglasses and motion sensors to enable quadriplegics to use computers. Abdullah was arrested April 25 in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo and accused by police of illegally protesting - apparently by flashing the banned four-fingered hand gesture showing support for ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. Assem said he was handcuffed, blindfolded and forced to sit on the floor of a government building while he was kicked and called a traitor for 16 hours, reports The New York Times. He spent two weeks in jail, but was finally released and permitted to attend this week's science fair in Los Angeles after his imprisonment received much publicity in Egypt, where he is celebrated as the 'little inventor.' Young scientist: Abdullah Assem demonstrates his invention at the . Intel International Science and Engineering Fair before his decision to defect to the United States on Saturday . Against violence: Assem was arrested and held for two weeks, accused of forming an anti-government group and firing at a government building, charges he denies. He says he has no political inclination but 'rejects the blood' that has been shed recently . 'They accused me of a crazy thing - saying I had created a group with 15 people and shot against a building that is impossible to get to,' Assem told The New York Times Thursday.. 'When they took me in,' he said, referring to the Egyptian police, 'I had no idea where I am. They were asking me about everything I have written in my life. I asked them the whole time to tell my family where I am or that I am alive, and they refused that. They just said again and again: ""Something bad can happen to you.""' It wasn't until he arrived at the airport Saturday that Assem made the decision not to return home, when his chaperones refused to guarantee that he would be safe upon returning to his country. After skipping his return flight, Abdullah told Al-Jazeera he feared being rearrested. 'In case I get back to Egypt, my future will be in jail, considering that I am threatened all the time to be detained,' the boy said. Farida Chehate, an attorney with the Los Angeles-area Council on American-Islamic Relations, said her group will help the teen apply for amnesty with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. She said the teen may also be accused of setting fire to cars belonging to police officers, although Chehate has yet to see Egyptian authorities’ reports. 'Little Inventor': Assem is well-known in his homeland and gained a place at the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angeles . 'He’s somewhat politically active,' Chehate said. 'He has posted on Facebook and formed a group. His feelings have put him on the wrong side of the government.' Chehate said media coverage of Abdullah’s apprehension in April apparently motivated the government to allow him to attend last week’s International Science and Engineering Fair. She said the boy’s family supports his asylum effort. 'We’d hope the family is not in jeopardy' since Abdullah’s arrest attracted extensive Egyptian media attention, she said. The boy’s father, Assem Mohammed, told Egyptian news agencies that his son did not perform well in last week’s fair 'because he didn’t have enough time to prepare' for judging. 'He made his presentation with handwritten notes. He didn’t even have time to type it on a computer.' Some $5 million in cash prizes and scholarships were awarded at the competition’s end. Abdullah, a senior at Dar Heraa Islamic Private School in Assiut, Egypt, was scheduled to take his final high school exams this week. Sharon Rummery, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in San Francisco, said her agency would not be authorized to discuss an asylum application, even if one had been filed on behalf of Abdullah. Bright future: Assem was one of 1,000 international students to attend the fair. He was due to take his final high school exams next week . Life-changing: Abdullah Assem has invented eyeglasses for quadriplegics to operate computers and communicate with others . There are five criteria for asylum, which can lead to citizenship, and two of them are fear of political leanings and membership in a social group, she said. Rick Bates, interim chief executive of Washington, D.C.’s Society for Science & the Public, said he knows of no previous situation where a high school student participating in a fair has defected at the end of the competition. 'I don’t know that we have a reaction,' Bates said. 'The young man and his family have made that decision.' Annual science fairs have been conducted since 1950, and the event began including international high school students in 1958. After Abdullah arrived in Los Angeles on May 12, 'I think he had a normal week,' Bates said. 'He did indicate that he wanted to stay and look at colleges.' Abdullah is staying with a family friend in the Los Angeles area while his bid for asylum is considered. He refused to speak about his family in Egypt for fear that they will become targets of the government. 'I can’t continue my life,' he told The New York Times. 'I am a normal person. They are killing innocent people - this is what I am against.' 'I don’t have any political inclination at the moment,' he wrote on Facebook on May 18, while in Los Angeles. 'But I absolutely reject the blood, and I’m against the massacres that occurred in Egypt during the past period just like anyone who respects humanity.'","Abdullah Assem, 17, decided not to board his return flight to Egypt after attending a science fair in LA .

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter for The Daily Mail . Esther McVey now attends Cabinet as the Employment Minister . Unemployed young people are being put off even trying to find work because of the ‘morally reprehensible’ doom and gloom spread about the jobs market by Labour, the employment minister has said. Esther McVey said there are ‘more than enough’ businesses willing to give young people a chance. But she said jobless youths are giving up before they even start to look for work because of the ‘relentless negativity’ about their prospects. Miss McVey, 46, who previously said young people should be prepared to take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, said jobseekers should be more optimistic about their chances. She told the Mail: ‘For too long now, young people have been subjected to relentless negativity about the state of the workplace that is waiting for them when they finish their study, training or apprenticeship. ‘I meet with thousands of young people a year and they all say the negative picture painted by opposition politicians about young people and their bleak future has a very negative effect on them. ‘It saps their confidence and energy before they even look for the job and crushes their spirit so much that it forces them to give up trying. ‘Such wrong and negative information for political gain is morally reprehensible. This affects people's whole lives and futures.’ Miss McVey said that young people should be encouraged and given guidance on how to find work, rather than be put off by negativity. She said: ‘Many people who should know better insist on talking down young people’s chances, rather than putting their effort into doing all they can to help them build up the experience and skills they need for the employers of the future. ‘We want to build a better future for our young people - not destroy it for them with misinformation.’ ‘One thing is clear from the employers I’ve visited is that there are more than enough businesses willing to give young people a chance.' Miss McVey added: ‘Young people should get to hear from more voices like these - rather than having their hopes drowned out by those peddling damaging myths. ‘The truth is, youth employment is up, there are fewer young people out of work than at the election and young people deserve credit for having weathered the great recession better than previous generations of young people before them.’ The latest official quarterly figures published last week showed the number of jobless young people fell by 102,000 to 767,000 in June. The numbers are also 206,000 lower than the previous year. Labour has criticised the government’s record on youth unemployment and accused the government of ‘abandoning a whole generation’. At the start of the government’s reforms, shadow business minister Iain Wright said: ‘There is little prospect of hope for young people if the Government continues on its present course.’ Earlier this year shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said youth unemployment was an ‘injustice for the individuals whose life chances have been stolen’. Labour had said it would introduce a ‘jobs guarantee’ scheme for jobless youngsters. Unemployment is falling across the country - but remains stubbornly high in the North East, Yorkshire, the North West and even London . Under the plan, 18 to 24-year-olds out of work for a year would be offered a taxpayer-funded job for six months - with those who refuse losing benefits. Earlier this year, Miss McVey vowed that tackling youth unemployment would be her ‘top priority’ but said that those looking for work have to be prepared to get a foot on the ladder before expanding their horizons. Asked if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: ‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to run a hotel in Dubai.’","Miss McVey said there are 'more than enough' firms with jobs for youngsters .

"By . Mail on Sunday Reporter . THE OPERATION . HYSTERECTOMY – the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix, and sometimes Fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes. Usually carried out to treat or prevent cancer, or remove benign tumours, it may involve an incision in the abdomen, but can be carried out through  the vagina or via keyhole surgery. All options involve a general anaesthetic. Operation: A  hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix, and sometimes Fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic lymph nodes . THE SURGEON SAYS . Mr Demetri Panayi, consultant gynaecologist at Epsom and  St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, says: ‘The fitter you are before surgery the quicker you’ll recover. You can get abdominal and back pain after surgery so taking nurofen before the op will help. ‘Get moving as soon as you can afterwards as this speeds recovery. Start with some gentle walking. Don’t go swimming until the wound  has completely healed to avoid infection, and don’t lift anything heavier than a full kettle until you are fully recovered to give abdominal muscles time to knit. ‘Consider the layout of your home. Will the bed be within easy access of the bathroom? Can you avoid stairs? ‘Some bleeding is normal but if it goes on for a few days or  is heavy or painful, see your doctor. Use sanitary towels rather than tampons to help reduce the risk of infection. Recovery: You can get abdominal and back pain after a hysterectomy . ‘Opt for showers rather than baths, and avoid fragranced soaps as they can irritate. Keeping up fluid intake and having plenty of fruit and fibre in your diet will help with bowel or bladder movements. ‘Wear loose-fitting clothes and avoid tight underwear.  If your ovaries have been removed, it may bring on menopausal hot flushes. You may be offered HRT, so discuss this with your doctor.’ THE PATIENT SAYS . Sara Murawa, 52, a special-needs teacher from Cheshire, had the operation three years ago after suffering with fibroids and anaemia. She  says: ‘I knew I was going to be immobile so before I went  into hospital I made sure everything I’d need was  within easy reach. I also had  a bikini wax – psychologically, it made me feel better. ‘I took plenty of pairs of big knickers and large sanitary towels into hospital. There was some bleeding and the only thing they give you in hospital are incontinence pads, which are depressing to wear. I also took in a V-shaped body pillow to support my lower back. ‘I was catheterised, which I don’t remember anyone telling me about, and it was a shock to discover this. The catheter can be in for up to 24 hours. ‘You can get a lot of wind  pain after the operation since it can make you constipated, and so drinking some peppermint tea was invaluable. ‘I felt unstable on my feet when I first started moving around – having comfortable supportive shoes is vital. ‘Prepare friends and family for how emotional you might feel. My two sons were 16 and 19 at the time and we had no intention of having more children, yet there was still a sense of loss which made me very emotional. You need people around you to support you through that.’","Our Recovery! series takes a look at the effects of an operation .

"By . Alice Smellie for The Mail on Sunday . When boxer Glenn McCrory became a world cruiserweight champion in 1989, he could hear the raucous applause of the crowd – but the faces of his thousands of fans were just a blur. Indeed, until three months ago  his vision was so poor that he likens his vision to being ‘like opaque  tights pulled over a camera lens’. He admits cheating at eye tests to get his boxing licence – by memorising the letters on the chart. Nice view: Until three months ago, 49-year-old ex-boxer Glenn McCrory's vision 'like opaque tights pulled over a camera lens' But thanks to an operation in May using a new type of laser, Glenn now has near-perfect vision and says his life has changed immeasurably. ‘To be honest, at the World Championship it didn’t bother me too much,’ says Glenn, 49, who is now a Sky Sports pundit. ‘All I was looking at was the face of my opponent, Patrick Lumumba. ‘But I lived in the shadows for years. I could see clearly for just a couple of feet, then everything was blurred. By the time I had my operation I was convinced that I would never see the world clearly.’ Sight problems run in the McCrory family. Three close relatives, including one of his sisters, are blind, but Glenn’s condition was more straightforward. He simply suffered from myopia – short-sightedness. The condition occurs when the eyes keep growing and become too long from front to back. This means that light doesn’t reach the retina but focuses too early, so distant objects become blurred. Glenn’s problems started when he was 12 and at school in Stanley, Co Durham. ‘I was a tough kid and wanted to sit at the back of the class with the cool lads,’ he says. ‘The trouble is, I couldn’t see a thing on the blackboard.’ His main concern was that his condition might prevent him from following a career in the ring – boxers need to have good eyesight for their own safety. ‘I’d turn up for my regular eye test with a lovely chap called Dr Graham. He’d ask about my parents, and I’d ask about Mrs Graham. ‘In the meantime I’d memorise the . third line from the bottom of the chart. As he talked I’d make sure I . was standing near enough to see it, so I passed the test every time.’ So . why didn’t Glenn, who also fought Lennox Lewis in 1991 for  the . European heavyweight title,  not just wear glasses in secret? ‘If I’d . been spotted it would have ruined my career,’ he replies. Punched: Glenn and Lennox Lewis in the European heavyweight title fight in 1991 . According to a survey by insurance firm Simplyhealth, more than half of those aged between 40 and  75 have not had a recent eye test, even though 41 per cent have noticed a deterioration in their sight. Glenn was spurred into action only when he started to suffer from long-sightedness too three years ago. ‘Now I couldn’t even read a restaurant menu,’ he says. ‘I was devastated.’ Finally, he underwent laser eye surgery, but to his disappointment, any improvement was short-lived. However, at a Burns Night dinner this year, Glenn found himself sitting next to John Morgan, who works at Optical Express. ‘He was watching me squinting at the menu. We got chatting and he told me about lens-replacement surgery.’ Glenn underwent a ground-breaking procedure that uses a computer-guided ‘femtosecond’ laser to dissolve the lens with a remarkable level of precision, before it is replaced with an artificial one. First, anaesthetic drops numb the eye before a cone-shaped suction ring is applied to the eyeball, says consultant ophthalmologist David Teenan, who operated on Glenn. The laser is lowered and attached to the ring, and after a scan of the eye, two incisions are made – one is less than three millimetres, the other just one millimetre. The lens of the eye is broken up within the little bag where it sits. The patient is then given a local anaesthetic before the lens fragments are removed and a new intraocular lens is injected. On the train home afterwards, Glenn telephoned John Morgan. ‘I told him the colours were so vibrant and everything was so sharp. I am so happy to be able to see again.’ From £1,495 per eye, opticalexpress.co.uk .","Ex-boxer Glenn McCrory, 49, has recently undergone laser eye-surgery .

Scroll down for video . The creator of hit game Flappy Bird is set to release a follow-up game called Swing Copters (pictured) which looks just as addictive - and infuriating - as his first hit . It will be free to download with a $0.99 (69p) charge to remove adverts, TouchArcade reported. A journalist at the publication said the game is ‘hard,’ and that players have to tap a smartphone screen to keep their character airborne and move him left and right. The aim of the game is to fly through gates - just like in Flappy Bird - except they are arranged vertically so the pilot wants to get as high as possible, while avoiding swinging hammers. Players score a point for every obstacle the pilot successfully passes. Mr Nguyen, a 28-year-old Vietnam-based developer, has a tough act to follow. His first game, Flappy Bird, was the most downloaded game in the App Store in January 2014 with more than 50 million players. Mr Nguyen, a 28-year-old Vietnam-based developer, has a tough act to follow as his first game, Flappy Bird (pictured), was the most downloaded game in the App Store in January 2014 . Dong Nguyen's first game - Flappy Bird - was the most downloaded game in the App Store in January 2014 with 50 million players. A month later he announced that he was pulling it. He told Forbes that his decision was based on the game being an addictive product. 'To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever,' he said. However, after a glut of copy-cat games flooded app stores, the developer re-launched the original game. He is now about to release his second title - Swing Copters - which is a similar design and features similar game play. Critics may argue that the developer's move of pulling his first game, was more of a press stunt than altruistic. A month after his success, Mr Nguyen pulled the game because it ruined his ‘simple life’ and he announced on Twitter: ‘I'm sorry Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this anymore.’ The developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $50,000 (£30,000) every day in in-app advertising alone. He seemingly pulled the game from various app stores for altruistic and personal reasons. In February he told Forbes: 'It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. 'To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.’ A glut of copy-cat games were developed to fill Flappy Bird’s space and fans of the game were willing to go to extremes to keep on playing it. Phones pre-loaded with the hit were listed for as much as $20,000 (£13,000) on eBay just after the game disappeared and Mr Nguyen reportedly received death threats to bring it back. In a change of heart, Mr Nguyen released an official new version called Flappy Birds Family exclusively on Android’s store last month. And it now appears that the developer has put his qualms about addictive games to bed with the impending launch of his latest offering. While the game is set to launch on the App Store, Mr Nguyen announced on Twitter that there will be an Android version too.","Swing Copters game will be available to download from Thursday .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Inventions for a greener world, life-saving medical devices and soaring skyscrapers are often seen as the pinnacle of achievement for engineers, designers and inventors. But until now there has been no recognition for the people that created iconic guns or effective gas-guzzling machines that harm the environment. Now, The Dead Prize has set out to highlight the individuals and companies that have created objects which have a detrimental effect on the planet, whether the fruit of their labours was a harmful success or an epic commercial failure that has left the world a worse place. And the winner is: The Dead Prize has been created to recognise effective harmful inventions, such as commercially successful guns (pictured) and objects that have unwelcome consequences . What: The Dead Prize was set up to recognise people who have created objects that have a detrimental effect on the planet. Nominations: Entries will be nominated by the public and can include well designed objects that cause harm, such as guns and tanks, useful innovations with undesired side effects such as aeroplanes or clothes that support bad working conditions, and badly designed essentially useless projects and objects that simply don't work well. Process: The public will nominate individuals and objects by tweeting @deadprize before November 1. A panel of judges will then create a shortlist from which a winners will be chosen and announced at the beginning of 2015. Prize: Undetermined. Aim: To highlight mistakes so that designers and engineers can learn from them. Set up by Cameron Sinclair, the cofounder of the nonprofit Architecture for Humanity in London, which uses design to address humanitarian crises, the harmful objects and botched projects in the running for an award will be nominated by the general public. ‘We often critique the surface of a design solution. Is it pretty? Is it cool?’ he told Quartz, ‘But rarely do we take a pragmatic view on whether a design solution has improved life. Has it caused harm?’ Nominees for The Dead Prize will include bad architecture, industrial design and engineering, which has ‘created a negative impact on either the user or the community as a whole.’ This means that well designed objects that cause harm, such as guns and tanks could be in the running alongside useful inventions with unwelcome side-effects - such as aeroplanes or clothes that support bad working conditions - and badly designed, essentially useless projects, such as sprawling concrete housing estates that people hate living in. Nominees for the prize will include bad architecture, industrial design and engineering, which has 'created a negative impact on either the user or the community as a whole.' It aims to inspire designers and planners (stock image) to create better products and towns in the future, by recognising and fixing past mistakes . ‘In the past decade we have seen an explosion of honours and awards for the most innovative and forward thinking solutions,’ he writes on the prize’s website. ‘Yet no one recognises the projects that have caused harm to the environment - designs that are helping shorten our existence on this planet. This is why we created The Dead Prize. ‘Let's recognise the bad, honour the failures and hopefully do something to rectify these designs against humanity.’ People can nominate inventions until November 1 on Twitter, using the handle @deadprize. So far no designs have been submitted. ‘When a gem comes in we might ask you to write a blog post as to why you deem it a failure,’ the prize’s website says. Mr Sinclair insists that the prize is ‘not meant to be disparaging,’ but sets out to highlight poor and harmful design so that inventors will think about the consequences of their creations. Well designed objects that cause harm could be in the running, alongside useful inventions with unwelcome side-effects, such as aeroplanes and cars (pictured) that belch out carbon dioxide, and badly designed, essentially useless projects and objects . ‘We don't believe in being negative, our focus is to discover what the benchmark is to design against or getting a better understanding of how a design failed or was intentionally harmful,’ he said. ‘It is our hope that like-minded designers see these failures as a challenge to create something new, to correct the mistakes of the past or to find the antidote for the project in question.’ Mr Sinclair said that he will try and reach out to nominated designers and companies to ask what went wrong, or why they engineered such a harmful product. He said that designers can even nominate their own creations. A team of judges from the fields of design, health, education and the media will shortlist nominations, before an overall winner is selected in early 2015.","The Dead Prize sets out to highlight .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple's iWatch has been delayed and will not go on sale until 2015, it has been claimed by a Chinese analyst. It is believed the firm has delayed the watch to ensure the hardware and software is perfect at launch. However, Apple's stock today hit an all time high ahead of an expected September 9th launch of the iPhone 6. Scroll down for video . Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate. It could launch at an event in October, alongside Apple's next iPad range . Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Apple Inc shares rose 1.4 percent to end at $100.53, a closing record high for the tech bellwether when adjusted for the stock's June seven-for-one stock split. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says difficulties with manufacturing the new device will likely be the cause of the delay, according to 9to5mac. 'We reiterate our view that iWatch, as compared to existing products, and as Apple’s (US) first attempt at a wearable device, represents a much higher level of difficulty for the company as regards component and system design, manufacturing and integration between hardware and software, he said. 'While we are positive on iWatch and believe that the advantages of the design and business model behind it are difficult to copy, we think, given the aforementioned challenges, that the launch could be postponed to 2015.' Apple recently  poached a senior executive from Swiss luxury watch brand Tag Heuer, which could be to help it with the launch of its iWatch expected this autumn. Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple. It did not say what his new job would be, and Apple declined to comment. The iWatch will be the closest the U.S. company has come to selling a fashion accessory and marks its first foray into the personal luxury goods market. The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton . It is in a race against Samsung Electronics and Google to turn computers into wearable fashion and must-have items as smartphones, increasingly becoming commoditized items, start losing their appeal. Apple has plucked several executives from the luxury sector in recent months. Burberry ex-Chief Executive Angela Ahrendts started as its new head of retail and online sales in May, and former head of French fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent Paul Deneve was hired last year to work on special projects. 'I think he was probably head-hunted,' a Tag Heuer spokeswoman said of Pruniaux, adding a replacement had already been found. Analysts and industry executives say the jury is still out on whether smart watches will disrupt the luxury Swiss watch industry. The Tag Heuer Mikrotimer watch: It has emerged Apple has poached the firm's head of sales for its iWatch product . 'I don’t believe that an iWatch will be a threat to luxury Swiss watches,' said Jon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. 'But where I do see some potential impact is at lower, for example below $1,000, price points where there could be a temporary dislocation if there is super high demand for iWatches.' Jean-Claude Biver, head of watch brands at LVMH and chairman of watch brand Hublot, said he believed the threat of smart watches had to be taken seriously by the Swiss watch industry. 'The iWatch will have the same status symbol power as many other Apple products, especially at the beginning,' he said. 'I personally believe it has the potential to be a threat for the industry, and it should not stay with its arms crossed.' Apple applied for a trademark for the ""iWatch"" in Japan, a patent official said earlier this week, signaling the iPhone maker could be moving ahead with plans to launch a watch-like device soon. Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like . Speculation has been mounting that Apple was preparing to launch an iWatch which would include multiple health and fitness sensors and access to features such as messages and notifications through integration with the iPhone and iPad. A sweat sensor is believed to one of at least 10 sensors on the watch. It has also been revealed Apple has signed up a host of sports star to try the wearable - including basketball star Kobe Brant, who was recently spotted at Apple's Cupertino campus. According to laoyaoba.com, the sweat sensor has been developed in house by Apple. Although the watch is shrouded in secrecy, players from the MLB, NHL and NBA have believed to have been approached about the fitness aspects of the watch. One of these athletes is reportedly Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant, who was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month. According to 9to5Mac's source, Bryant met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team, to discuss upcoming products. Apple is also believed to be working with Los Angeles Kings' Dustin Brown and an unnamed player from the Boston Red Sox, according to 9to5Mac. However,  laoyaoba.com also claims the watch may be delayed as it must be certified as a medical device with the Food and Drug Administration. Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband . Apple has already revealed it is working with Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and the National Institutes of Health on its HealthKit app, which is believed to work in tandem with the iWatch. Earlier reports say the watch will includes more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. It is also set to come in multiple sizes - and is expected to go on sale in October. The much rumoured watch is believed to be about to begin mass production in Taiwan. The Wall Street Journal also said that Apple is planning multiple screen sizes for the device, and previous rumour have claimed a male and female version will be released. Rumours still differ as to whether the watch will be round or rectangular. Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard Kobe Bryant (pictured) was spotted on Apple's Cupertino campus last month, and is believed to have met Apple's design boss Jony Ive and his team to discuss upcoming products - including the iWatch. Samsung, Sony, Qualcomm and others have already released smartwatches, but the gadgets have mostly functioned as companions to smartphones, offering email notifications, clock functions and the like. Samsung's Gear 2 line, released this year, added fitness-related apps and has a heart rate sensor. But the market is growing fast, with data firm IDC saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices - a category that includes smartwatches - will triple in size this year over 2013. Apple has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena, hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA, and proclaiming that it will introduce 'new product categories""' this year.","Chinese analyst claims complexity of watch design has led to delay .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Robert Toney failed to provide basic life-saving treatment to the baby when he arrived at the scene . A paramedic who failed to give adequate emergency care to a new-born baby boy that was blue and ‘looked dead’ was suspended for a year today. Robert Toney raced to an address in Plymouth, Devon, after receiving an emergency call about a woman in labour. But when he arrived he made no attempt to give the baby oxygen despite the fact that he was struggling to breathe, the Health and Care Professions Council heard. Fellow paramedic Sheryl Hanks attended the scene shortly after Toney when the emergency call was made at 7.13am. She said: ‘I immediately thought that baby was not breathing adequately enough - it looked a horrible colour and actually, in all honesty, it looked dead. ‘The baby was laid on towels with its arms up in the air above its head, not wrapped just with an open towel underneath it.’ Mrs Hanks explained the baby was in ‘serious respiratory distress, almost on the stage of death’ when she arrived. She said Toney failed to provide basic life-saving ventilation oxygenation and that the standard of care given was inadequate. Toney had worked for the South West Ambulance Service NHS Trust for 28 years. He blew on the baby’s face and rubbed him with towels but did not use a resuscitation kit because he said he did not have the right equipment. The baby improved on the journey to the hospital and recovered at Derriford General Hospital on arrival. Toney was found to have provided inadequate care to the new-born baby, in that he did oxygenate or deliver ventiliations. The panel also found that Toney did not seek urgent assistance or make his bosses aware of the baby’s condition. HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe said: ‘The panel is satisfied that the registrant expressed real and genuine remorse as he wanted to see the family after the event to see if the baby was alright. The baby boy improved during his ambulance journey and recovered at Derriford General Hospital in Plymouth . ‘But the panel is of the view that the registrant has a limited insight into his failings, demonstrated by his admissions. ‘However, he does not fully accept that he has failed to act promptly in a time critical situation. ‘He has failed to demonstrate that he has reflected on the situation, has learned how things went wrong and how he would address such a situation differently in the future. ‘The trust had identified a college based assessment day in respect of paediatric care, the need for a reflective log and the need to be assessed by a tutor in terms of leadership before the registrant could return to being part of a crew. ‘The registrant failed to take up any of these suggestions and has instead decided that he no longer wishes to practise. ‘Although he is no longer operating as a paramedic, he remains employed on an ad hoc basis as an Emergency Care Assistant. ‘He has taken early retirement and said that he wished to avoid stress, wanted to give new paramedics an opportunity and wished to devote his time to family. Toney was suspended from the profession for 12 months.","Robert Toney failed to give the baby life saving oxygenation when he arrived .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Bones of large animals discovered in south-west France, suggest that Neanderthals were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought. Our ancient cousins may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and bison, only carrying the meatiest cuts back to their caves. French archaeologists came to this conclusion because long bones were missing from the carcasses of many of the animals found at the Middle Palaeolithic site in Quincieux. Neanderthals may have butchered the bodies of animals such as mammoths and horses so they only carried the meatiest parts back to their dwellings to eat. French Archaeologists based their idea on bones discovered at the Middle Palaeolithic site in Quincieux, including this section of an ancient horses' spine . Neanderthals lived at the site between 35,000 and 55,000 years ago. Archaeologists from Institut National de Recherches Archeologiques Preventives (Inrap) in Paris discovered the bones of mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, horse, bison and reindeer when land was being cleared for the new A466 road. The prehistoric site on a hill would have overlooked the ancient bed of the Saône River and has yielded ‘a rich faunal assemblage’ spread throughout three levels including flaked flint objects made by Neanderthals. Archaeologists from Inrap said that most of the bones belonged to animals that lived in a cold climate and were herbivores. Archaeologists from Institut National de Recherches Archeologiques Preventives (INRAP) in Paris discovered the bones of mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, horse (pictured right), bison and reindeer as land was being cleared for a new road – the A466. They also found the skull of a cave bear (pictured left) Bones of large animals discovered in south western France, suggest that Neanderthals were more sophisticated at hunting and gathering than previously thought. It is already known that Neanderthals used tools to scrape carcasses clean (illustrated) and sometimes cooked meat before eating it . They also found the skull of a cave bear and a several wolf bones. The experts think that all the bones belong to animals that were deliberately hunted or scavenged by Neanderthals who used the carcasses. Some of the bones have cutting marks, showing they were butchered. The archaeologists noted a ‘lack of long bones,’ which they believe shows that only the meat-rich parts of the bodies were carried back to the Neanderthals' homes. They think the poorly-preserved site might have been a carcass processing area. It is hoped that the site will reveal more about the behaviour of Neanderthals away from hunting camps and dwellings so that experts learn more about their hunting techniques. Toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals, who unlike their brutish reputation, had the brains and skill to catch the birds. The discovery was announced earlier this month after an excavation of Gorham's Cave where Neanderthals are thought to have lived nearly 100,000 years ago. Archaeologists unearthed leftovers of Neanderthal feasts, which included pigeon bone, in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of Gibraltar. Researchers believe the Neanderthals hunted wild pigeons, possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests. So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons. Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks. Some also had signs of charring, which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire. They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,' study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told journalists of the bone analysis. 'They had the knowledge and technology to do this.' Professor Finlayson said the bone analysis added to a growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than was once widely believed. 'This makes them even more human,' he said.' In June, researchers at MIT reported evidence from 50,000-year-old Neanderthal poo that those living in southern Spain also ate nuts and vegetables. Other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in Neanderthal teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle, harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Getting large equipment into space is no easy feat. At nearly £14,000 ($23,400) to send a kilogram into orbit, it's expensive, and room is always limited. To deal with the problem, Nasa has turned to the ancient art of origami, in the hopes of getting larger solar panels into space. These solar panels could someday be used in the form of an orbiting power plant that harvests energy from the sun and beams it back down to Earth. Scroll down for video . Nasa's solar array has a diameter of 8.9ft (2.7 metres) when folded and 82ft (25 metres) when unfurled. The design, which looks like a flower blooming, was created by Nasa mechanical engineer, Brian Trease . After two years of research, the space agency has come closer to that goal by creating a solar array with a diameter of 8.9ft (2.7 metres) when folded and 82ft (25 metres) when unfurled. The design, which looks like a flower blooming, was created by Nasa mechanical engineer, Brian Trease. Mr Trease partnered with researchers at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, to pursue the idea that spacecraft could be built using origami folds. Sending the solar arrays up to space would be easy, Mr Trease said, because they could all be folded and packed into a single rocket launch, with 'no astronaut assembly required.' Shannon Zirbel, a student in mechanical engineering at Brigham Young University, unfolds a solar panel array that was designed using the principles of origami. These solar panels could someday be used in the form of an orbiting power plant that harvests energy from the sun and beams back down to Earth . Panels used in space missions already incorporate simple folds, collapsing like a fan or an accordion. One technique that has been used for an origami-inspired solar array is called a Miura fold invented by Japanese astrophysicist Koryo Miura. When you open the structure, it appears to be divided evenly into a checkerboard of parallelograms. With this particular fold, there's only one way to open or close it: Pull on one corner and the whole thing is open with only a tiny amount of effort. Mr Miura intended this fold for solar arrays, and in 1995 a solar panel with this design was unfolded on the Space Flyer Unit, a Japanese satellite. Despite this test, the technology is still in its early stages. But now, with an emphasis on small satellites and large structures, Mr Trease says arrays inspired by this fold could see renewed usefulness. Solar power has had a difficult start on Earth thanks to inefficient panels and high costs. But in space, scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy. Now, the space-based solar power – once merely the stuff of science-fiction – could be available sooner than expected if Japan has its way. Within 25 years, the country plans to make space-based solar power a reality, according to a proposal from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa). The agency has outlined its plans to create a 1-gigawatt commercial system for space-based solar power, which would provide about the same output as a nuclear power plant. In a recent IEEE article by Susumu Sasaki, a professor emeritus at Jaxa, outlined the agency’s plans create a 1.8 mile long (3 km) man-made island in the harbour of Tokyo Bay. The island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity. The microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles (36,000 km) above the Earth. 'The fact that we're going both bigger and smaller may open up domains where it may be relevant again,' Mr Trease said. The fold that Mr Trease and colleagues used is not a Miura fold, but rather a combination of different folds. Mr Trease's prototype looks like a blooming flower that expands into a large flat circular surface. Mr Trease envisions that foldable solar arrays could be used in conjunction with small satellites called CubeSats. And he says the origami concept could be used in antennas as well. It could be especially appropriate for spacecraft applications where it's beneficial to deploy an object from the centre, outward in all directions. Origami was originally intended for folding paper, which has almost no thickness, so Mr Trease and colleagues had to be creative when working with the bulkier materials needed for solar panels. 'You have to rethink a lot of that design in order to accommodate the thickness that starts to accumulate with each bend,' he said. The art has been the subject of serious mathematical analysis only within the last 40 years, Mr Trease said. There is growing interest in integrating the concepts of origami with modern technologies. 'You think of it as ancient art, but people are still inventing new things, enabled by mathematical tools,' he said.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . When nine-month pregnant Holly Cross felt a sudden and searing pain in her stomach, she thought she was going into labour. The 23-year-old described feeling 'something burst', just days before her second child was due. She was rushed to hospital where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section. But as well as delivering her son, doctors discovered a 10-inch cyst attached to one of Mrs Cross' ovaries had popped, causing the agonising pain. Scroll down for video . Holly Cross was nine months pregnant when she felt something burst inside her stomach. The 23-year-old thought she had gone into labour and rushed to hospital where doctors found a cyst attached to her ovary had burst . Tests revealed the cyst, found during a C-section as doctors delivered her second son Joshua, pictured left, was cancerous. Mrs Cross is pictured with her older son Liam, right . Tests carried out on the cyst revealed the mother-of-two had ovarian cancer. Terrified she would die, leaving her husband Ray, 24, to bring up their sons alone, Mrs Cross opted to have a full hysterectomy, to try and rid her of the cancer. ‘I was devastated when I was told I had cancer, I thought I was going to die,’ she told MailOnline. The mother-of-two, from Chatham in Kent, had been at home with her husband and their three-year-old son Liam, in September 2013, when she complained of feeling sick from the pregnancy. ‘I wanted the baby to be born so I could get on with feeling normal again and enjoy family life,’ Mrs Cross, said. ‘Then I felt a popping sensation and a piercing pain in my stomach. ‘I was doubled up in pain and thought I was having a heart attack and was convinced I was going to die.’ She was rushed to Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, where doctors monitored her baby. They found its heart rate had dropped so Mrs Cross was taken to theatre for an emergency C-section. Baby Joshua was delivered safely, weighing 7lbs, 13oz. ‘When I came round doctors told me they’d found a cyst and had taken a biopsy to run tests,' she told MailOnline. 'In the meantime I could go home. I was stunned, but it hadn’t sunk in that it could be cancer. I was too busy embracing my new role as a mum-of-two. Mrs Cross, pictured with Liam after the birth of Joshua, believes her unborn son wriggling around caused the cyst to burst. She said: 'I believe had it not been for my baby, Joshua, wriggling around, which I think caused the cyst to burst, it could have continued to grow and the cancer could have spread' Around one in every 50 women in the UK develops ovarian cancer during her lifetime. While the causes are not yet completely understood, the risk of developing ovarian cancer is very low in young women, the risk increasing with age. More than 80 per cent of cases occur in women over the age of 50. Most ovarian cancers start in the cells that cover the surface of the ovary. Symptoms of the disease include: . Because the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be mistaken for symptoms of other non-cancerous conditions, there can often be a delay in diagnosis. Health bosses advise that if a woman has suffered bloating, feeling full, pain or discomfort in the lower tummy and needing to pass urine more often or more urgently for more than a month, they should see a GP straight away. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . ‘A week later the results showed I had cancer. Nobody knew how long the cyst had been growing. ‘In a way I was lucky to be pregnant as I hadn’t had any symptoms that would have made me aware I had ovarian cancer. ‘I believe had it not been for my baby, Joshua, wriggling around, which I think caused the cyst to burst, it could have continued to grow and the cancer could have spread. ‘It’s popping made the doctors aware of it, which saved my life.’ The paramedics, who arrived at the couple's house, told Mrs Cross the pains were contractions and that she had gone into labour. ‘But I knew they were a lot worse than that,’ she said. ‘I was struggling to breathe. I thought I was having a heart attack. As I held my stomach, it felt as hard as rock. ‘I remember Liam tried to comfort me by rubbing my back and saying, ""Mummy, are you OK?"".' She added: ‘The pain I had been in wasn’t from labour pains but the cyst bursting.’ ‘I was told that cysts were quite common during pregnancy so I thought everything was going to be alright and all I had to do was recover from my caesarean.’ However, a week later, Mrs Cross received a phone call from the hospital asking to come back in to see doctors. There, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Doctors gave her the option of having the ovary affected removed, or a full hysterectomy to make sure the cancer did not spread. The latter would cause Mrs Cross to experience the menopause, at the age of just 22. Terrified she would die, leaving her husband Ray, 24, pictured, to bring up their sons, Liam and Joshua,  alone, Mrs Cross opted to have a full hysterectomy, to try and rid her of the cancer . ‘I was devastated at first but I decided I’d had my two boys and didn’t want there being any chance the cancer could come back,' she said. 'I wanted to see my boys grow up. I was prepared to do anything for my family.' On November 6, 2013, Mrs Cross had the procedure, with surgeons removing her womb, cervix, lymph nodes, appendix and both ovaries. After suffering an infection, the mother-of-two was kept in hospital for a further month. 'I felt a popping sensation and a piercing pain in my stomach' - Holly Cross . She said: ‘One week I was in hospital I felt so ill I asked Ray not to bring the boys in to see me. 'I didn’t want Liam to see me in pain again. He’d been so upset the time the cyst had burst. ‘During those weeks I was in hospital I felt like I didn’t get the chance to bond with my new baby boy. 'When I was allowed home I realised he’d changed so much and I’d missed that.’ Mrs Cross was told the cyst contained fluid and cancerous cells, that could have leaked causing the cancer to spread. In January 2014 she began chemotherapy. ‘I was grateful I had a lot of help with the boys and I came home and played with them when I could,’ she told MailOnline. ‘I said yes to everything Liam wanted to do because I knew that a week later I could be feeling too tired to do anything with him. So we went to the park, the zoo, the farm, activity centres.’ The mother-of-two underwent chemotherapy and has since been given the all-clear from cancer. She is raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support to help others facing the disease . Mrs Cross, who lost her hair during chemotherapy, didn’t want her sons to see her bald, so she wore wigs to cover it. She completed her chemotherapy in May this year and her hair started to grow back straight away, marking the end of her battle with cancer. Earlier this year, Mrs Cross decided she wanted to help others facing cancer by raising money for the cancer charity, Macmillan Cancer Support. ‘Because my stomach was still sore, following the caesarean and hysterectomy, I knew a running event could potentially put a strain on my wounds,’ she said. ‘Then I heard about the Great London Swim, taking place on August 30, so I suggested to Ray we could take part, and we began to train for it. ‘I found being in the water relaxing and I could spend time with our boys in the pool too.’ Mrs Cross has now been given the all clear but will continue to have regular check-ups. She said: ‘Finally I’m getting to put the past behind me, and make up for lost time with my boys. They’re all that matter to me.’","Holly Cross was nine months pregnant when she felt an agonising pain .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars. But the Tesla-founder claims the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons. At the weekend, the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at a robot uprising, claiming ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’ Over the weekend, the billionaire tweeted a recommendation for a book that looks at such scenarios, claiming 'We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes' Musk referred to the book ‘Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies’, a work by Nick Bostrom that asks major questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers. Mr Bostrom has also argued that the world is fake and we are living in a computer simulation. In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’ Musk's tweets follows a similar comment in June in which the Tesla-founder said believes that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand.

In March, Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher. Vicarious’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘computer that thinks like a person…except it doesn’t have to eat or sleep’, according to the company's co-founder Scott Phoenix. In an interview with CNBC, Musk said: ‘I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.’ ‘There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator,’ Musk continued. ‘There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.’ 42-year-old Elon Musk (pictured) is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand .

I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex. The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is around 3mm thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions. These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans. According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. ‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. ‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’ In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human. Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example.

"Maroon Rafique missed an important talk concerning her son's university education because she would not remove the niqab . By . Jaya Narain . A mother was turned away from a parents’ evening because she was wearing a full-face veil. Maroon Rafique, 40, was told that for the security and safety of children and teachers at the college there was a ban on any type of face coverings. She was warned that unless she removed her full-face covering, known as the niqab, she would not be allowed into the college to attend. Embarrassed: Maroon Rafique was turned away from a college parents' evening because she was wearing a veil . In the end, a stunned Mrs Rafique was forced to call her husband, who took her place and went with their son Awais, 18. Mrs Rafique, who has worn the niqab for seven years, said: ‘I’m born in this country and British. Why should what I wear offend anyone? I didn’t want to make any fuss. All I wanted was to find out the information to help my son go to university. ‘I offered to sit at the back or  at the front, anywhere where I wouldn’t be seen, if they thought I was going to offend anyone. ‘I was really upset because whenever I’ve visited the college before there’s never been a problem, in fact the tutors have been welcoming and friendly.’ Mrs Rafique, of Whalley Range, Manchester, had been invited to attend the parents’ evening and talk about her son’s education at The Manchester College. But when the mother of two arrived she was apprehended by security staff in the lobby of the college’s Northenden campus. Mrs Rafique, who is married to double-glazing firm boss Abdul, 40, and has a younger son, Ibrahim, 12, said she felt humiliated. Apprehended: Mrs Rafique was   refused entry to The Manchester College by senior staff who told her there was a ban on face coverings . She added: ‘I do get abuse every now and again in the street, which I just have to deal with. However, I was very surprised when I was treated this way by the college.’ Business student Awais, 18, who hopes to take an accountancy course at Manchester University, said: ‘It was really embarrassing when they told her she couldn’t come in. We’ve never, ever been told about any rule about what parents can wear.’ A spokesman for The Manchester College said Mrs Rafique’s concerns were being taken ‘very seriously’ following the incident. She added: ‘The Manchester  College provides a safe and inclusive environment that fosters development and achievement.  We apply a single dress code to all college users, including learners and visitors. ‘At all times we need to be able to identify all individuals easily  in order to maintain safety and security, and therefore we ask that faces are clearly visible  while indoors. Our dress code is reviewed through our quality improvement group and we will take this situation into account at the next review.’ In March, a Muslim woman was barred from serving on a jury because she refused to remove her niqab. The judge said she could not sit on an attempted murder trial because the niqab concealed her facial expressions. And last year, France imposed  a total ban on the full-face veil, introducing fines for anyone who breaks the law.",Maroon Rafique missed an important talk concerning her son's university education because she would not remove the niqab .

The full line-up features Andy Pandy; Ivor the Engine; Dougal from the Magic Roundabout; Windy Miller from Camberwick Green; Mr Benn; Great Uncle Bulgaria from the Wombles; Paddington Bear; Bagpuss; Postman Pat; Bob the Builder; Peppa Pig; and Shaun the Sheep from the Wallace and Gromit series. Some of Britain's best-loved children's TV characters are to be rewarded with a first-class honour - their own set of stamps. 2014 marks the 40th anniversary of Bagpuss's TV debut. The saggy cloth cat is continually cited as one of the favourite British children's TV characters of all time. The year will also mark the 50th anniversary of The Magic Roundabout, a show originally based on a French children's programme and later rebooted by the BBC. Dougal, a dog and the main character in the show, was created by prolific British animator Ivor Wood, who went on to animate Paddington Bear and Postman Pat. The characters were chosen because of their popularity and due to the fact that their shows are often repeated now, and some of them have even been reinvented. The line-up of 12 favourites covers each decade since the 1950s . This year will even see the films Postman Pat: The Movie and Paddington hit the big screen at cinemas nationwide. And 2015 will see a return to television for The Wombles and a new CGI series giving them a hi-tech makeover. Many of the shows, while aimed at a young audience, have gained a cult status and have devoted adult fans. Such was the popularity of The Magic Roundabout that when it was moved to an earlier timeslot in 1967, the BBC received complaints from its adult fans who would not get home in time from work. Andrew Hammond, from the Royal Mail . Stamps department, said: 'For over 60 years, Britain's children's TV . characters have brought cheer to generations of viewers. 'More . importantly, it has presented us with a cast of characters that, like . the memories of the programmes themselves, remains with us throughout . our lives.

"By . Emily Payne . Cycling-mad Imran Mughal arrived home to rapturous applause after spending 15 months pedalling 25,000 miles around the world when he was made redundant. The former NHS worker has revealed his album of fascinating photographs from his trip which took  him to 33 countries in four continents in just over a year. After surviving a terrifying ordeal at gunpoint in Bosnia, deadly spiders in the Australian outback, 53-degree heat in the Oman desert and cycling through monsoons in Indonesia, Imran is now glad to be back with his family. Scroll down for video . Intrepid: Imran Mughal, pictured in Oman, travelled 25,000 miles across the globe on his charity bike ride . The 35-year-old, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'I can't believe what I have seen and done. I have lived a lifetime in 15 months. 'I think I am the first English Pakistani man to do something like this. In my community it is a huge positive thing. 'I am really proud of myself for doing this, I can't believe I have lived out a dream. And the most amazing thing I will take away from this is that the world is generally good and to be in an unfortunate situation is a rare thing.' Imran, 35, left his hometown, Harehills, in May last year and visited 33 countries including China . 'On my journey around the world I experienced the most overwhelming hospitality, love and support. 'I've been asked if I was ever scared while I was on my own in remote places but it's much scarier on a night out in Leeds. 'When you are in such wonderful places, with stars overhead in the middle of nowhere with only the sounds of nature enveloping you, it is wonderful, so serene. It is blissful.' Imran first started cycling at 18 years old when he bought a second-hand bike that he used as his mode of transport. Frightening moments: Imran pictured in Bosnia, where he survived a terrifying ordeal at gunpoint . He said: 'It wasn't until the bike was nicked three months later that I realised how much I loved cycling and how much I missed it. Five days later I had got myself a better bike and I was off.' Imran decided to take on the challenge after being made redundant from his NHS job, using his redundancy money to fund his trip and has raise thousands of pounds for the charity, Charity: Water. He arrived back in Leeds from his once-in-a-lifetime trip on August 2 and was welcomed home by 70 friends and family, who lined the street and applauded as he cycled down Banstead Terrace to his front door. Far flung: Imran, pictured in Thailand, now home, plans to continue fundraising by writing a book about his trip . Imran now plans to continue fundraising by writing a book about his trip and hopes to visit schools to speak about his experiences, inspire others and promote cycling and healthy living. He is also hoping to get more Asian children  involved in the sport. He told how on sporting events he was almost always the only Asian involved. Although the real message, he said, is: 'You can do anything you put your mind to, whatever your challenge, wherever you come from.' Imran set off from London on May 4, 2013. He cycled an average of 100 miles each day, with his longest distance being 157 miles in one day. Adventurous: His travels by bicylce took Imran as far as Indonesia . He travelled from London to France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Dubai, Oman, India, China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Canada, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium and back to England. He said: 'I didn't cycle through Pakistan because my mum made me promise that I didn't go there. 'Going to Pakistan is okay but it is the bordering countries that are pretty lawless. 'I did look into it but I considered that it wasn't worth risking my life for, or breaking a mother's promise. 'In the end it worked out for the best because it meant instead the route took me through Dubai, where I lived with workers and saw behind the glitz and glamour, and Oman, where I travelled in 53 degree heat but managed to fill up with icy cold water every 40-or-so miles whenever I came across a mosque - these were fantastic places to travel through.' Viva la France: Imran's 15-month adventure took him across Europe . The most terrifying moment was when he was in Bosnia and was looking for somewhere to set up camp. He found an old derelict house and started to unpack when a man arrived with a gun to shoo him off. He ended up outside the house on his knees with his hands behind his head and a gun to his head. When the man realised he was harmless he let him go, but not before Imran said his prayers thinking he was going to die. In Iran he was robbed of $900 when two men pulled up in a car pretending to be cops and searched his bags. Home: Imran cycled an average of 100 miles each day, with his longest distance being 157 miles in one day . He said: 'But the upshot was that the robbery meant I ended up staying in a village I wasn't originally going to stay in and ended up seeing such hospitality I couldn't believe it. 'My faith in humanity was destroyed and restored all in one day.' He said of his trip: ""It was the most amazing time of my life, but all good things must come to an end. 'Now the wheels have stopped rolling I can really focus on the fundraising side of it and look forward to my future knowing anything is possible.'

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Former NFL star Tim Shaw used the Ice Bucket Challenge to announce that he is suffering from ALS - the disease for which the internet craze is raising millions of dollars. The 30-year-old former Tennessee Titans linebacker - who only retired last year - posted his Ice Bucket video on the team's website and revealed that he had recently been diagnosed with ALS - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - a form of motor neurone disease. The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has seen hundreds of celebrities and public figures post videos online of themselves being doused in ice water, then nominate someone else to follow suit. Scroll down for video . Ice to see you: Tim Shaw douses himself in freezing water after revealing that he is suffering from ALS . The nominee has 24 hours to comply or donate $100 to ALS research. Most participants undergo the soaking and make a donation as well. Among those who have taken part are former President George W Bush, pop star Britney Spears and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Standing tall: The former Tennessee Titans linebacker, 30, was forced to retire from NFL action last year . Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also known as Lou Gehrig's disease - is the most common form of motor neurone disease, which affects a person's ability to move voluntarily. While the person continues to think and feel, they suffer muscle atrophy and are often unable to walk, eat or talk, leaving them effectively 'locked in' to their body. It is estimated that about half of those diagnosed with motor neurone disease will die within the first 14 months of knowing they have it. There is no known cure at present. The campaign has gone viral on the internet and is estimated to have raised more than $31million, according to the ALS Association - including $8.6million on Wednesday alone. Shaw's Ice Bucket was especially poignant, however, as he revealed in his video that he has been diagnosed with ALS himself. He says: 'A year ago I was playing NFL football. I've recently been diagnosed with ALS. I'm here today to stand up and fight with all of you against this disease.' 'I want to challenge the Tennessee Titans organization, Coach Franklin and the Penn State football team and my Clarenceville community,' Shaw says. 'Let's do this.' His former Titans team-mates - including quarterback Jake Locker and running back Dexter McCluster - then performed the challenge en masse. Shaw is at least the fourth NFL veteran in the past seven years to be diagnosed with ALS, according to Forbes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report that ex-NFL players were four times more likely to die from ALS than other people. Two years ago, former New Orleans Saints safety Steve Gleason was diagnosed with the condition. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects two in every 100,000 people.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai . Follow @@riathalsam . Michael Jackson blaring from pitch-side speakers in training and a committee created for players to moan. The world of Ian Holloway is still weird and wonderful. The sense of wonder spread to his press conference on Saturday when, unprompted, he took the admirable step, albeit a risky one, of criticising his own fans for their deplorable Jimmy Savile chants during the 2-0 win over Leeds. ‘Until we make a stand the world ain’t right,’ he said. ‘How often do we turn a blind eye to things?’ It was spoken with passion and anger, a hand slapping the table and eyes darting around the room. In charge: Ian Holloway shouts instructions to his Millwall players during  their 2-0 win against Leeds . With any luck, those supporters will react the right way, because their club is enriched by this emotional man of a thousand tangents, just as he is by the club. What better surroundings than Millwall for a manager who sometimes likes to feel he is fighting the world? It’s that attitude that appears to have made men of little boys, a group that Holloway says ‘were all good at making excuses’ when he arrived in January and they were 21st in the Championship. They finished last season with an eight-game unbeaten run and have started the new one with passing football and a hammering for a club in need of its own inspiration. His methods, revealed by Millwall defender Mark Beevers at the weekend, are wacky yet chime completely with what you might expect. ‘Every manager has a different way of doing things and this time it’s started off pretty well,’ said Beevers, who had scored Millwall’s opening goal and recently became a father. ‘The oddest thing he’s done was when he first came in. We had a training session with speakers around the pitch and ended up doing training drills to Michael Jackson at full blast. It was Billie Jean, wasn’t it gaffer?’ In the groove: Holloway looks to have got the Millwall players fired up for the new Championship season . By this point, Holloway had entered the room and was seated at the back. Holloway: ‘Are you telling these people? That’s private!’ Beevers: ‘It’s not — not anymore.’ Holloway: ‘It didn’t work though because nobody enjoyed it. Doesn’t he look more mature now he’s a father?’ Beevers: ‘I’ve always looked mature.’ On it went. Another day in the Holloway house. The manager would later lose his cool in discussing the behaviour of his fans, an answer which came in response to a gentle opening question about his side’s perfect start to their season. Unique: Mark Beevers (left) revealed Holloway played Michael Jackson songs during his first training session . There was also a rant about a penalty not given and the actions of West Yorkshire Police, who he believes have not shown Millwall fans respect when travelling to Leeds in the past. There were contradictions and all manner of digressions. At one stage, he explained himself by saying: ‘I am doing a lot of talking because I have had a long summer.’ Holloway works himself up and then calms himself down. Same as always. He is emotional but utterly decent, and also a fine manager who has evolved over 18 seasons and is not afraid to try new things. His solution to last season’s in-house moaning has been to create a complaints committee, enabling senior professionals to raise issues from the squad. Democracy: The Millwall boss has also created a complaints committee to help senior player raise any issue . ‘I’m not involved’, said Beevers, 24. ‘It’s more the older generation, your Fordies (David Forde) and Chappers (Richard Chaplow) who have more experience in the game. ‘Anything you need, you go to them and they go to the manager. He’s got it more organised. He has a certain way of doing things and he’s installed that into us from day one on and off the pitch. We got our rewards for it here.’ Some bookies make Millwall second favourites to go down. Holloway loudly mocked those suggestions in his dressing room after this match. A win over Leeds is no great indicator these days, so it remains to be seen how they face the challenge. One thing that is certain is Holloway will not stop talking — to do that he says ‘you’d have to lock me in a cage, in a bag’. Who would? PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Mick McCarthy told me last week that ‘if money was everything in football I wouldn’t bother’. How interesting, then, to see McCarthy’s Ipswich beat Fulham 2-1 at Portman Road. Ipswich choose not to pay transfer fees and Fulham recently spent £11m on Ross McCormack, who came off after 57 minutes. Winners: David McGoldrick is mobbed by team mates as he celebrates scoring for Ipswich . WHAT’S CAUGHT MY EYE... Leeds owner Massimo Cellino was everywhere on Saturday. Smoking in the car park before kick-off, then in the dugout talking to manager Dave Hockaday before chatting with Millwall’s groundsman. He was silent in the dressing room afterwards. Matej Vydra and Troy Deeney have picked up where they left off. They netted a combined 44 goals two seasons ago before Vydra’s season at West Brom. Reunited, they each scored in the 3-0 win over Bolton. Eddie Howe was described by Bournemouth’s chairman as the country’s best young boss and he has been backed financially. Over £2million was spent on Callum Wilson — and he scored twice on his debut at Huddersfield.

"By . Alex Gore . A large cup of Starbucks coffee contains more than three quarters of a person's 'safe' daily dose of caffeine, according to a report. The 16oz 'Grande' coffee is said to contain nearly double the recommended limit for a pregnant woman, while a typical home-made 8oz cup of coffee is well above a 10-year-old's daily allowance. But scientists stress that such statistical averages can vary widely from person to person, with factors such as gender and genetics having an impact on tolerance levels. Caffeine: Table shows a range of drinks in order of caffeine content and their relation to daily allowances . A person's tolerance can also be affected by other drug use, with women who take the contraceptive pill breaking down caffeine slower, and smokers process the stimulant faster than non-smokers. A study by the government regulatory agency Health Canada concluded that the average person can have up to 400mg of caffeine a day without experiencing negative affect, such as anxiety or heart problems. Too much caffeine? A Starbucks 'Grande' coffee . The average allowance for a pregnant woman is 200mg, according to the Food Standards Agency, and 75mg for a 10-year-old. A 16oz Starbucks coffee has 330mg of caffeine, according to a table compiled by Chemical and Engineering News. However, Starbucks deny the findings, saying their Grande contains just 140mg - still more than a third of the daily recommended limit. This is compared to an 8oz cup of brewed coffee, which contains 133mg, and an 8oz cup of instant coffee, which has 93mg. An 8oz can of Monster Energy has 92mg, while an 8oz Red Bull can has 83mg. A bottle of Coca-Cola contains 58mg of caffeine, while a an 8oz cup of decaf coffee has 5mg and hot chocolate has 9mg. University of Florida's director of . forensic toxicology, Bruce A. Goldberger, told Chemical and Engineering . News: 'People often don’t understand the potential risk of these . beverages. 'Caffeine is a stimulant and, when consumed at high enough levels, can have negative effects.'

"By . Dan Bloom . and Damien Gayle . The Help to Buy scheme could net the government £4.5billion because of a house price boom - even though the boom has partly been blamed on the scheme itself. The Treasury is on track to receive a vast windfall because of a clause allowing it to share the cash from homes which are sold on at a profit. Help to Buy hands buyers 20 per cent of a home's value - and when the house is sold with the loan still active, the government takes 20 per cent of any increase over the years. Windfall: The government could make £4.5billion from the Help to Buy scheme, research has claimed . Because of the explosion in British house prices, the government will make a 59 per cent return on its loans over the scheme's lifetime, research by the Financial Times claimed today. That means by 2020, when the scheme is due to end, the Treasury will have handed out enough loans to net itself £4.5billion. Launched in March 2013 to help first-time buyers of new-build homes who could not afford a deposit . It aimed to kick-start housing market . Buyers stump up as little as 5% on a mortgage which carries a 25% deposit . Treasury loans the buyer the other 20%, interest-free for five years . If house is sold after rising in value, Treasury wins 20% of the difference . But if it has fallen in value, Treasury pays 20% of the difference instead . A second scheme, nicknamed Help to Buy 2, is also available and involves state guarantees on loans for any type of property - not just new builds . Neither can be used for interest-only mortgages or buy-to-lets . But the windfall is controversial because the recent surge in house prices has partially been blamed on the Help to Buy scheme itself. Critics say it is inflating prices by encouraging more houses to be sold without new ones being built, which was the original aim of the scheme. Local government committee chairman Clive Betts, who has attacked the scheme as 'dangerous', told the Financial Times: 'What would reassure people is if the government said they would take any profits and reinvest them in new homes, that would represent a substantial building programme.' And he wrote previously: 'The very last thing we should be doing is fueling inflation in a still over-priced market and, thus, actually disabling even more families from becoming owner-occupiers.' But the government has not said whether it will reinvest the money directly into building new homes. A Treasury spokesman told the Financial Times it had 'a direct financial interest in the Help to Buy scheme and an increasing interest in the tax revenues generated from the housing market'. The Financial Times arrived at its figures by assuming all houses bought under the scheme would be sold after five years. It based the total on the £184,000 average selling price of homes so far, and the government's ambition to lend to 25,000 people a year. Controversial: The windfall is caused when house prices rise - but the Help to Buy scheme itself has been partly blamed for a housing boom. MP Clive Betts (left) said profits should be reinvested in new-build homes . Scheme could be triggering a house price boom making it even harder to get on the ladder in the first place . Many homes bought under the initial scheme would have been built anyway, meaning it is not boosting house-building as it was intended . Extending the scheme to include houses which are not new builds will not help boost the housebuilding industry . Middle-class parents could 'hijack' scheme to invest through their children . However, the profits will reach government coffers extremely slowly as they only become available when houses are sold. And . the scheme is not without its risks. The government takes 20 per cent . of profits when a house rises in value - but also has to stump up 20 per . cent of the loss if it falls. Help to Buy loans are also interest-free for five years, which reduces the amount of money the government makes. The scheme began last March and had a major test this week when figures were released for its first full financial year. They showed the government loaned £791million to 19,394 buyers - less than the 25,000-a-year target. Some areas of the country have benefited far more than others, according to analysis by MailOnline. In many of the wealthiest London boroughs - including Kensington . and Chelsea, Richmond, Haringey, Hammersmith and Fulham, Camden and . Westminster - not a single Help to Buy loan appears to have been issued . all year. That contrasts sharply with Leeds, which with 337 was the council area with the most Help to Buy loans in the last year. It was followed closely by Wiltshire with 316, Central Bedfordshire with 287 and Milton Keynes with 282. The most Help to Buy loans per head, meanwhile, were given out in Corby - which had one loan for every 570 residents. It was followed by Peterborough, South Norfolk, Gloucester and Aylesbury Vale.","Treasury is set to receive the windfall through its own house loan policy .

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho splashed £27million to secure the Spaniard’s signature earlier this summer and he has since followed up that purchase with deals for Atletico Madrid pair Luis Filipe and Diego Costa. Speaking at St Georges Park, where Barcelona are currently training ahead of the new season, Pedro spoke in glowing terms about his former team-mate and admitted that the Catalan side may miss Fabregas next season. VIDEO Scroll down for Frank Lampard wishes old foe Cesc Fabregas his best at Chelsea . Provider: Pedro says Cesc Fabregas is a dream to play with for forwards because his passing is so good . ‘Cesc is a great player, one of the best midfielders and he creates chances,’ the 27-year-old said, ‘For a forward, he is a great player to have. He will do really well at Chelsea. ‘He is a good friend of mine, not only here, but we were together with the national team. Chelsea will be difficult to beat in the Champions League because they have strengthened well and made some great signings.’ Pedro also praised the club’s new signing Luis Suarez and the Spaniard expressed his belief that the four month ban from all football - handed out by FIFA when the Uruguayan bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup - is too severe. Barcelona have launched an appeal that will be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the middle of August and there is an increasing feeling in Catalonia that the ban could be softened to allow Suarez to train with his team-mates, while the club also harbour hopes that the duration of the ban could be lessened. Friends: Pedro and Fabregas are both products of the academy at Barcelona and Pedro says he will be missed . Assist: Fabregas and Diego Costa hug after the Spaniard set up his new team-mate to score against Olimpija . ‘Suarez’s punishment seems excessive and we will see if it is reduced,’ Pedro said. ‘But we have to cope with it. He is coming here to work with everyone and he will be well received by the supporters if he works for the team and does well. He is one of the best forwards in the world.’ Pedro, now an established member of the Barcelona squad after graduating through the club’s La Masia academy several years ago, admits that his opportunities in the side could be limited with Suarez set to join up with Lionel Messi and Neymar in a fearsome front three. Pedro, however, burst onto the scene when Samuel Eto’o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were in town and he believes that he can still make a wholesome contribution to the Barcelona cause. Competitive: Pedro admitted he was worried about competition for places at Barcelona this season . Persuasive: Pedro said he considered leaving but manager Luis Enrique persuaded him to stay . He does, however, admit that he considered making a fresh start elsewhere before holding talks with Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta and new manager Luis Enrique this summer. ‘I was thinking about leaving last season but it’s normal to have ups and downs,' he said, 'I would have loved to play more but now I am confident and happy. 'I have been here a long time and I spoke to Andoni and Luis, who knows me well. The club have faith in me and it gives me confidence to stay here. I want to deliver here. ‘There are new signings every year at Barca and I have to deal with that. It is not only those three - Messi, Neymar and Suarez - but Gerard Deulofeu and Rafinha as well. 'The manager will decide who will play, it can be hard but I can handle it. I have always had tough competition here, with Samuel Eto’o, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Alexis Sanchez.

Angela Mayger, 73, was left with shocking bruises to her head, eyes and arms after 20-year-old traveller Gary Smith confronted her. Smith punched her in the face, pushed her and then slammed her head against a door in an attack branded 'cowardly and despicable' by his own barrister. Horrifying: Angela Mayger, left, pictured with the terrible bruising to her face inflicted when she was attacked in her own home by vicious traveller Gary Smith, right, still lives in fear he might return, the court was told . After she refused to hand over the keys to her new car he snatched her walking stick from her and used it to beat her around the head. Mrs Mayger was so terrified that she could barely move. Smith, a career criminal who was high on alcohol and cannabis, refused to stop despite pleas from his victim and repeatedly screamed: 'Give me the key to your car.' He was yesterday jailed for five years as the court was told that Mrs Mayger now lives in daily fear that he will return to her home once released from prison. Recorder Julian Goose QC told Smith: 'You violently and viciously attacked an elderly woman at night. 'You put her to the ground as you attacked her. In the victim impact report Mrs Mayger said she was shocked by the level of violence used against her. 'She says that every day she lives with the fear that once you are released you will come back and visit her again.

Critical: Recorder Julian Goose QC slammed the CPS for not bringing charges of robbery against Smith . Mrs Mayger, who lives alone, thought it was her son and went to open the door only to be confronted by Smith who pushed his way into the pensioner's hallway. Mrs Mayger tried to fend him off with her walking stick but Smith was too strong and snatched it from her before unleashing the terrifying assault. 'I thought I was safe in my own home,' she said after the attack. 'All my doors and windows have locks and I have a burglar alarm. I just answered the door and he burst in. I was very frightened. 'He punched me on the right hand side of my forehead with a clenched fist. 'He banged my head against the door. He hit me straight away with the walking stick, very hard to the theft hand side of my forehead. 'It sounds silly, but my legs were quivering.' After a brief tussle with his victim Smith grabbed the pensioner's car keys and drove off with fellow traveller Richard Miley, 23. The men, who live on a traveller site just yards from Mrs Mayger's home, sped off towards Bridlington but crashed minutes later. They later handed themselves into the police after a wave of public revulsion. Both men pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking at Hull Crown Court whilst Smith admitted a further offence of burglary. Steven Garth, for Smith, told the court: 'The defendant carried out this despicable and cowardly attack on this old lady. 'It was only when he sobered up did he realise what he had done. 'He was extremely drunk and to compound matters he was smoking cannabis. He remembers little - he was almost senseless.' Smith was disqualified from driving for two years.

Almost three decades later, the singer has been accused of sexually assaulting a boy at the event at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane football stadium – an allegation he vehemently denies.

Sir Cliff Richard with Billy Graham's musical director, Cliff Barrows, in 1966. The singer describes Graham as his 'hero' Sir Cliff is pictured left at the 1985 Graham rally. Almost three decades later, the singer has been accused of sexually assaulting a boy at the event at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane football stadium – an allegation he vehemently denies. Right, Cliff discusses his Christianity on a TV show . The American evangelist is in no physical or mental state to support his old friend but there is little doubt he would do so if he could. The pair, united by a shared faith, have been friends for 48 years. Sir Cliff has repeatedly described Graham as his ‘hero’. The singer was one of the country’s biggest stars when he became a Christian in the mid-1960s. It was at a Billy Graham ‘crusade’ event, in front of 27,000 people at Earls Court in London, that the star announced his newfound faith. Word of his conversion had spread to Graham’s organisers, who invited him to be a special guest on June 16, 1966. Dressed in a jacket and tie and wearing glasses, Sir Cliff spoke from the lectern, crediting his parents for bringing him up on the Bible. ‘I can only say to people who are not Christians that until you have taken the step of asking Christ into your life, your life is not worthwhile. When Graham returned to the UK in 1984 to preach, Sir Cliff was by his side. He told an audience at Villa Park, Birmingham: ‘For me being a Christian has become the most important part of my life’ ' It works. It works for me,’ he said, before singing It Is No Secret, a gospel song recorded by Elvis. After the service – during which Graham performed his brand of Christian rhetoric to the assembled crowds – the singer addressed the 5,000 people listening via a PA system outside the venue. That night was a turning point in Cliff Richard’s life. The influence of Graham stayed with him over the decades and he made many more guest appearances for the evangelist. Realising that being a Christian was not in keeping with the usual image of a pop star, Sir Cliff contemplated becoming a teacher instead. He sat in on RE lessons at a Sussex grammar school and spent two months at an Anglican theological college. But friends persuaded him against abandoning music. His association with Graham became stronger and he appeared in 1967 film Two A Penny – released by Billy Graham World Wide Pictures. That summer, Cliff discussed his faith on TV with Graham and was inspired by the preacher to use his stardom to spread the word of God. In a tribute for a book about Graham, Sir Cliff wrote: ‘From the first time I heard him preach … I admired his courage, his faith and his style. As I got to know him … admiration developed into a huge respect as I recognised his dedication and unswerving integrity.’ When Graham returned to the UK in 1984 to preach, Sir Cliff was by his side. He told an audience at Villa Park, Birmingham: ‘For me being a Christian has become the most important part of my life.’ The next year he sang at an event in front of 47,000 at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane – details of which are the subject of the police inquiry. As his career earned him a knighthood, Sir Cliff’s devotion to Graham remained as strong as ever. In 1996, Graham preached to a TV audience of 2.5billion. The programme, billed as the world’s biggest evangelist event, was hosted by Sir Cliff.

At a press conference Pugachyova revealed that her father, Yakov Begeshev, had disappeared in 1942 while fighting the Nazis on Russia's Eastern Front during the Second World War. The last contact she had with him was in the form of a letter sent from a battle in the Voronezh region south of Moscow. In it, Pugachyova, who was just six at the time, said her father described the fighting as so fierce he was unlikely to survive. Her story was heard by Nina Geryusheva of the Bailiffs .

Swansea are no exception, but the Welsh side have perhaps hit the big time when it comes to chance meetings after coming face-to-face with Lady Gaga. Poker-faced: Lady Gaga poses with Lukasz Fabianksi and Swansea staff in Chicago . On tour: Lady Gaga performed in Chicago last Friday as part of her ongoing tour . The pop star posed rather poker-faced with the Swans' new signing from Arsenal, Lukas Fabianski, as well as members of the club's back room team for a quick picture, with the former Gunners keeper just about squeezing into shot standing at the back. With Fabianski were under 21 kitman Shaun Baggridge, Chris Watkins, sports massage therapist Matthew Murray and Swans kitman Michael Eames. Eames said of the meting: 'Lady Gaga asked for a picture, couldn’t say no! We are on pre-season in Chicago.' All smiles: Lukasz Fabianski has joined Swansea after leaving Arsenal on a free transfer . Looking ahead: Swansea will hope to keep hold of key stars including Wilfried Bony going into the new season . For once there was little paparazzi about to catch the artist, who looked more than happy to be pictured with a team hoping to at least reach the edge of glory over the 2014/15 campaign. The Swans are currently in Chicago for their tour of the USA before they play Chivas Guadalajara in Milwaukee for their first friendly on July 16. Garry Monk's side then conclude their American trip with with a clash against Minnesota United three days later.","Former Arsenal goalkeeper posed with Lady Gaga along with Swansea back room team .

"Gary Neville believes the likes of new club captain Wayne Rooney, Robin Van Persie and Michael Carrick need to step up to lead a Manchester United recovery following the exit of several club legends this summer. New manager Louis Van Gaal had a disastrous start on Saturday as United lost 2-1 to Swansea at Old Trafford. The Dutchman is tasked with returning the Red Devils back to their glory days without stalwarts such as long-standing captain Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and the retired Ryan Giggs. Captain: Neville is looking to new club captain Wayne Rooney to lead the recovery at Manchester United . Top pundit: Since retiring Gary Neville has established himself as a pundit and commentator at Sky Sports . Former United right-back Neville highlights the importance of new leaders emerging at Old Trafford to cope with the club’s transformation. ‘Big personalities like Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have gone, and new leaders and characters need to emerge in the dressing room,’ said Neville in his ambassador's column in the United Review. ‘This is now the opportunity for [the likes of] Phil Jones, David De Gea, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera - players who've been signed - to become leaders and develop the mentality that they want to take over the mantle. Assistant: Club legend Ryan Giggs has retired playing for Manchester United but now assists Louis Van Gaal . Moved on: Former Manchester United captain and left-back Patrice Evra has joined Italian side Juventus . Gone: Centre-back Rio Ferdinand has departed Old Trafford to start a new challenge at Queens Park Rangers . ‘That's particularly true for the ones who have been there for a period of time. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Jonny Evans are the five obvious players who have won many honours between them, now they need to step up. Louis van Gaal is leading the way and Neville feels the former Holland manager has the vast wealth of experience to create and nurture that evolution within the squad. ‘The main thing is that the manager is a fantastic leader in his own right,’ added Neville, ‘so he will demand that his players take more responsibility out on the pitch.’ New club: Former Manchester captain Nemanja Vidic has also moved to Serie A with Inter Milan .","Ryan Giggs retired during the summer and fellow stalwarts Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra all departed for new clubs .

A couple who claimed £50,000 in false benefits by pretending to split up were caught after going on a secret second honeymoon - to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary. Nicola Harrison, 51, and Dean Harrison, 52, from Maerdy, South Wales, pretended their marriage was over so they could claim benefits as single parents for more than 10 years. But a court heard the brazen pair remained lovers and even went on the 'second honeymoon' to Scotland just weeks before they were caught. Nicola Harrison, 51, and her husband Dean, 52, from Maerdy, South Wales, were exposed as benefit fraudsters after an anonymous tip-off. The pair had pretended to split up, but had actually been on holiday to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary . Their ten-year scam - from which they pocketed £52,489 - was finally brought to an end by an anonymous tip-off. Dean Harrison has now been jailed for ten months - the second time he has been jailed for benefit fraud. His wife, who was said to be 'under his influence', was give a five-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. The pair offered to start repaying the money on a voluntary basis and have so far repaid £245. But no court order was made for the rest of the money to be repaid. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard the fraud began when the recruitment company worker pretended he lived with his mother after being released from jail.

The jumpers spent years organising their jump and finalising details such as access and their escape route . Base jumping involves jumping from fixed objects, such as skyscrapers or tall man-made structures, using a parachute to break the fall . Base jumping is an extreme sport which has gained prominence in recent years, often through its participants' bold stunts. It involves jumping from fixed objects, such as skyscrapers or tall man-made structures, using a parachute to break the fall. There have been a number of base jumps attempted from London's high rise buildings. Most notably, Dan Witchalls, a roofer from Essex, has jumped from the top of The Shard four times. In fact, Mr Witchalls has jumped many of London's landmarks, including the London Eye, Nelson's Column, Wembley Stadium and the O2 Arena. Stuntman Gary Connery has also base jumped from the top of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. Video of the jump shows only split seconds of freefall before he has to active his parachute. One of the jumpers said via a statement: 'This jump is something that we’ve been planning for a good few years now - looking at safety issues, access to the bar, where we could get changed, outside areas and a quick escape route too. 'On the night itself, we were there for a few hours just chatting. 'The windspeed was a bit too high so we were just waiting for it to pass. 'When last orders was called, we checked the windspeed again and luckily it was safe so that was our moment to jump. ‘It was an incredibly ballsy way to do it.

"By . Helen Pow . A drunken Russian sea captain twice crashed his 3,000 tonne ship at a busy British port before asking police if he could 'have another go?' Viatcheslav Poleshchuk, 44, hit the Goole port lock gates once manoeuvring the RMS Baerl having downed a bottle of vodka. He ignored warnings and was described as 'all over the place' as he managed to do it a second time. Scroll down for video . Drunken sailor: Russian sea captain Viatcheslav Poleshchuk, pictured, rammed his giant ship into lock gates in Goole . Unsteady on his feet, he steered a collision course with his 328ft long ship loaded with scrap aluminum. Poleshchuk . was more than four-times over the drink drive limit. He had 157 . milligrams of alcohol in blood when the legal limit is 35. When he was quizzed by police about his . mayhem he drunkenly replied: 'Can I have another go?' Poleshchuck of Rostov, Russia, pleaded guilty to a charge of being over the prescribed alcohol limit for a ship’s master at Hull Crown Court. Paul Norton, mitigating, said Poleshchuk had been drinking 12 hours before the September 12 incident, because he thought he didn't have to sail until later. But his departure time was unexpectedly brought forward to just after midday. A Goole-dock boat handler spotted Poleshchuk as he tried to manoeuvre the ship, and became worried when he noticed the captain's eyes were glazed and he smelled of booze. Busy port: The captain crashed his 326ft vessel at the busy Goole port. (File picture) He admitted he had drunk a bottle of vodka before taking the helm but later changed it to five or six pints. Judge Michael Mettyear told the Russian: 'It is outrageous to be in charge of a great big vessel like this while . over the drink limit. It is monstrous.' John Thackray, prosecuting, said Poleshchuk was being assisted but did not want to know. 'It was a tight fit,' Mr Thackray said. 'The captain's eyes were glazed. He was described as being 'all over the place'. '(A boat handler) tried to assist. But Poleshchuk would not let him. He ignored him. Eventually the ship was towed into position.' The court heard it was not unusual for ships to hit the lock gates, but it was rare to ram them with such brute force. Mr Norton said ship's captains were seldom put behind bars for collisions, unless lives were put at risk. Tight fit: Maneuvering the ship into the gates is a task that requires the full attention of the operator, as this aerial view of Goole shows . He said a skipper who had been drinking had grounded a ship at Stornaway and another drunken captain had crashed in to a rig off the Lincolnshire coast, had both been sentenced to 12 months jail because the crashes resulted in sea rescues. But he said the crew in Goole was not put in such danger. 'He has lost his master’s certificate and has a wife and two children,' Mr Norton said. 'The ship's agents have washed their hands of him. He has remained in Goole staying in a hotel awaiting his fate.' He added that Poleshchuk's family had £5,000 and they could wire to the UK if the court was thinking of a fine. Judge Mettyear said: 'My instinct is a custodial sentence, but not a long one. I don’t want him thinking he can buy his way out of this.' Poleshchukhas was remanded in custody until sentencing next week.

It is unfair on the child and her family to take the mother away for the year while she travels the globe. ‘It raises issues about who would take care of the child.

It is modeled by a man wearing a white wig, a powdered white face, with 'blood' dripping from his mouth. He smiles into the camera and hold his hands out menacingly, while dressed in Savile's trademark shell suit, coloured glasses, medallion and cigar. Peter Saunders, at National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the Sunday Express: 'It is tasteless, senseless, and extremely insensitive. 'Nobody wants to remember Savile’s horrible face, particularly his many victims.' Amazon said the costume is no longer on sale.

"By . Hugo Duncan . and Becky Barrow for The Daily Mail . Interest rate hikes being considered by the Bank of England would be a catastrophe for millions of families, a senior Tory MP said last night. Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury committee in the Commons, said any increase would herald ‘a very difficult time’ for mortgaged households. His warning came after publication of the minutes of the Bank’s rate-setting meeting revealed two officials want an immediate rise to 0.75 per cent. Scroll down for video . Dr Martin Weale, left, and Ian McCafferty, right, both voted for the Bank of England to raise interest rates . They were outvoted by the other seven members of the monetary policy committee, which met on August 6 and 7. It was the first time since July 2011 that anyone at the Bank has called for higher rates. Five votes are needed for an increase – but analysts warn that day is fast approaching. ‘The tide is turning on the MPC,’ said Andrew Sentance, who sat on the committee before joining consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Christian Schulz, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank, said the split vote was ‘a sign that the first rate hike may come slightly earlier than markets currently expect’. He added: ‘The Bank will not wait too long before hiking.’ The base rate has been at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Hikes would be welcomed by savers but would hit cash-strapped households who are borrowing at the highest levels for six years. A rate rise to 1 per cent would add £456 a year to a £150,000 variable rate mortgage. Mr Garnier said: ‘There is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise. When the day comes there will be households holed below the water line, and they will be in trouble. ‘The problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country. People have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates. It is not normal at all. ‘If you are a saver, rising interest rates are fantastic. If you are a borrower it is bad news and for those that are already struggling, or close to struggling, raising interest rates will be a catastrophe.’ Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday showed mortgage lending is at its highest level since the financial crisis in 2008. Mark Garnier, pictured, who sits on parliament's treasury committee said any interest rate hike would cause trouble among many householders . More than £19billion was handed out last month, equal to nearly £620million every day. A recent report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that the number of ‘highly geared’ mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could double from 1.1million today to 2.3million by 2018. David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘Any increase in interest rates at the moment would be premature. The economic recovery is still not secure.’ The minutes of this month’s meeting of the MPC showed that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted for rates to rise to 0.75 per cent immediately. The pair argued that ‘the continuing rapid fall in unemployment’ to a six-year low of 6.4 per cent, or 2.08million, and the likelihood that wage growth will pick up later this year, meant rates should rise. The two economists appeared to be concerned that delaying the first rate hike could force the Bank into more aggressive action in future. Governor Mark Carney voted to hold and analysts played down the prospect of an imminent move, pointing out the vote was cast before this week’s figures showed inflation has fallen to 1.6 per cent, well below the 2 per cent target. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: ‘The low inflation outlook suggests the odds are still in favour of a delay until early next year.’ A separate report from the Bank revealed ‘signs of an easing of house price inflation concentrated in the South’. The Bank’s agents have spotted ‘fewer cases of sealed bids and offers over asking prices’.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Burnley head into Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday off the back of defeats in their opening two games of the season - but midfielder David Jones is convinced things are coming together for the team. The Clarets' comeback campaign in the Barclays Premier League has so far seen them lose 3-1 at home against Chelsea and then go down 1-0 at Swansea on Saturday. Jones believes there were plenty of positives to take from the second-half performance against the Swans as he and his team-mates tried to fight back after Nathan Dyer's 23rd-minute strike. Ice cool: Burnley midfielder David Jones, right, battles for possession with Swansea star Gylfi Sigurdsson . 'I think there was more belief in the second half,' said Jones, quoted by the Lancashire Telegraph. 'We seemed to move the ball quickly and it looked as if we had more space and they couldn't cope with our shape and the way we shifted the ball. 'It was a good showing in the second half and something to definitely build on in the next game.' Jones is in no doubt Burnley must soon start making the good things they are doing, and the lessons they are learning from their top-flight return, count. Mixing it with the best: Jones, left, lunges in for a challenge on Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard in opening game . Dejected: Despite Burnley losing their opening two games of the season, Jones is optimistic about the future . 'I think we took the shackles off and played with some freedom, but we can't wait to go a goal behind to do that,' he added. 'We've had two games and we need to learn quickly. 'We've had two games where we've had sort of a bedding-in period. 'Obviously we wanted to pick points up in those games but now we need to move on quickly and look forward to the next game.' Clarets boss Sean Dyche, who named the same first XI for both matches so far, is set to shuffle his pack for the clash with Sky Bet Championship outfit Wednesday at Turf Moor. Matt Gilks, Stephen Reid and Stephen Ward are all summer signings yet to make their debuts and will be hopeful of doing so on Tuesday. Clean bill of health: Burnley boss Dyche has no fresh injury concerns in his squad ahead of Tuesday's game . Dyche has no fresh injury problems after Saturday, with Sam Vokes (anterior cruciate ligament damage) his only unavailable player. And the manager told his club's official website www.burnleyfootballclub.com: 'There's a different feel to the cup because of the enormity of the Premier League. 'We have always respected all of the cups and we will do that again, but it's also important that we use players. Ginger Mourinho: Dyche, who has been likened to the Portuguese coach, meets the man himself at Turf Moor . 'We have a deeper squad than last season and we need to make sure that players are fit because everyone can see the demands that are on the players here, so we will look at the idea of change. 'That's not necessarily what we are going to do, but players do need games and there is a bigger picture to our season and that's here for all to see.' Dyche, who continues to seek new recruits with the transfer deadline now just a week away, added: 'I think I am loyal to players, but I am not naively loyal and I need to see the people we have brought in and how they operate and can affect the team, because we have brought them in for a reason.’","Burnley were thrashed 3-1 by Chelsea and then lost 1-0 to Swansea .

"By . Janet Tappin Coelho In Brazil . Motorists driving along a busy  highway in Brazil were shocked to see a horse being ferried in a two-door car with its head poking out of the window. The bizarre scene was captured on video in Fortaleza on Thursday by an astonished driver who first thought the animal was a very large Great Dane. 'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,' said Evi Braga. 'The horse was sitting on the backseat of the car as if it was a dog. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: The horse was seen peering out of the window of a car in Fortaleza in the north west of Brazil . 'It scared me when I realised it was a horse. It looked fully grown and seemed to be enjoying the drive. It pushed its head out of the passenger’s front car window and didn’t look stressed at being squashed into such a small space. 'I drove alongside the vehicle and the driver didn’t even glance over at me to acknowledge he was doing anything wrong. 'The incredible thing was I couldn’t figure out how the owner got the horse into the car in the first place,' she added in amazement. The animal was being driven in a run-down two-door Ford Del Rey, manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in Brazil between 1981 and 1991. According to Brazil’s Federal Highway Police animals should be transported in a box or strapped in with a car seatbelt - something which would have been impossible to do with the horse. Braga added: 'It was at least 30 degrees on Thursday so it must have been really hot and smelly inside the vehicle. I wanted to laugh but I also felt more sorry for the horse.' Shocked: The driver of the other car initially thought the animal was a Great Dane . Passenger: The horse appeared to stick its head out of the window as the other car approached . There is no legislation in Brazil banning motorists from carrying an array of animals in their vehicles. A traffic cop said: 'The Brazilian Traffic Code states that if the driver is caught with animals on the seat in the front of the car, or between their arms or legs they face four penalty points on their licence and a fine of £25. He added: 'Besides putting their own life at risk they endanger the lives of others on the road. Unfortunately we didn’t catch this incident on our motorway cameras, if we had the offender would have been stopped immediately.' He admitted however, that over the years officers have logged all types of creatures being carried in domestic vehicles including sheep, goats, birds and snakes.

"By . Darren Boyle . A film has been released that appears to show the shocking moment ISIS jihadists blew up the burial site of biblical character Jonah, who famously survived being eaten by a whale. The fundamentalists had previously been filmed smashing tombstones and graves in city of Mosul in north-west Iraq. The video captures the moment when the tomb explodes, showering the surrounding area with rubble and dust. It is believed an ISIS operative set up a camera waiting for the massive explosion in Mosul, Iraq . The structure is completely demolished moments after the detonation which threw debris into the air . The dust cloud caused by the explosion continued into the sky after the latest . Scroll down for video . ISIS militants believe giving special veneration to tombs and relics is against the teachings of Islam. One of the devastated tombstones belonged to the Prophet Jonah (Younis in Arabic) and was revered by Muslims and Christians alike, according to Iraqi authorities. The prophet, who is the central figure in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Jonah, is best known for being swallowed by a fish or a whale, depending on translation. The attack is the latest in the ISIS's violent rampage across Iraq. Earlier . this week, a series of images emerged showing the destruction of almost . a dozen Shia and Sunni religious shrines in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, . and the town of Tal Afar, which is also currently under ISIS control. Armed: The rebels, who are members of the Islamic State terror group, were filmed attacking centuries-old graves in the north-west city of Mosul in Ninevah province. Above, an ISIS militant vandalises a tombstone . Smash: Donning balaclavas and black coats, the rebels swung sledgehammers into the green tombstones . Speaking of the latest attack, Ninevah official Zuhair Al-Chalabi, told IraqiNews.com: 'The elements of ISIS [have] controlled the . mosque of the Prophet Younis in Mosul since they invaded the city.' '[They] engaged in the process of tampering with the contents of the Mosque. It is . still held by them until now.' The shrine of the Prophet Seth (Shayth) was also destroyed by rebels, according to reports. Revered tomb: One of the devastated tombstones belonged to the Prophet Jonah (Younis in Arabic) and was revered by Muslims and Christians alike, authorities said. Another belonged to the Prophet Seth (Shayth) It . comes as more than 50 bodies have been discovered by Iraqi authorities . in an agricultural area outside the city of Hillah, just south of . Baghdad, today. Military . spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan Ibrahim said most of the 53 . bodies were found blindfolded with their hands bound and several gunshot . wounds. The grisly discovery in Hillah, a predominantly Shiite city around 60 miles south of Baghdad, has raised concerns over a possible sectarian killing amid the battle against a Sunni insurgency. Brig Gen Maan said an investigation was underway to determine the identities of the dead, as well as the circumstances of the killings. ISIS have been attacking a host of historical sites across Iraq as part of their terror campaign . The dead were all men between the ages . of 25 and 40, and it appeared they had been killed a few days earlier . and then dumped in the remote area, said a local police officer and a . medical official. They officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media. A . lightning sweep by the insurgents over much of northern and western . Iraq in the past month has dramatically hiked tensions between the . Shiite majority and Sunni minority. At the same time, splits have grown between the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and the Kurdish autonomic region in the north. Destroyed: The photographs were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from the Islamic State extremist group . Prime . Minister Nouri al-Maliki today accused the Kurdish zone of being a . haven for the extremists and other Sunni insurgents. The claims are . likely to further strain Baghdad's ties with Kurds, whose fighters have . been battling the militant advance. Mr . al-Maliki lashed out at the Kurds in his weekly televised statement, . saying 'everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned' - a reference to disputed territory Kurdish fighters have taken. He . went a step further, saying: 'We can't stay silent over Irbil being a . headquarters for Daesh, Baath, al-Qaida and the terrorists.' Daesh is . the acronym in Arabic for the Islamic State group, often used as a . pejorative by its opponents, while the Baath was the party of former . dictator Saddam Hussein. But Mr al-Maliki provided no evidence to . back up his claims, which are sure to be rejected by Kurdish leaders in . Irbil. Evidence on the ground also contradicts his allegations. While . the motives in this case remain unclear, such killings hark back to the . worst days of Iraq's sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. At that time, . with a Sunni insurgency raging, Shiite militias and Sunni militant . groups were notorious for killings of members of the other sect. Bodies . were frequently dumped by roads, in empty lots, ditches and canals. As . the levels of violence dropped over time, such discoveries became rare. But . sectarian tensions have soared once more and authorities have once . again begun to find unidentified bodies since the Sunni militant . offensive swept across much of northern and western Iraq. The . militant surge is led by the Islamic State extremist group, but other . Sunni insurgents have joined, feeding off anger in their minority . community against the Shiite-led government. Prime Minister: Nouri al-Maliki today accused the Kurdish autonomic region in the north of being a haven for the extremists and Sunni insurgents. He said: 'Everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned' On the other side, Shiite militias have rallied around Mr al-Maliki's government to fight back against the militant advance. In . the far north, Kurds have taken advantage of the mayhem to seize . disputed territory - including the city of Kirkuk, a major oil centre - . and move closer to a long-held dream of their own state. Kurdish . fighters say they only want to protect the areas from Sunni militants. Many of the areas have significant Kurdish populations that they have . demanded for years be incorporated into their territory. These moves have infuriated Mr al-Maliki, who is under pressure from opponents as well as former allies to step down. The photographs of the destroyed churches and mosques that emerged last week were posted on a website which . frequently carries official statements from ISIS. Some . of them showed bulldozers plowing through walls, while others featured . buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble. Three Sunni clerics were also killed by ISIS gunmen in Mosul after calling on locals to reject the terror group and refusing to leave the city, authorities said. The victims were Khattab Hassan, 43, Riyadh al-Wandi, 39, and 48-year-old Abdul Ghafoor Salman. Today, archbishops from Baghdad, Mosul and Kirkuk said the violence . in Iraq is hastening the end of nearly 2,000 years of Christianity there . as the few remaining faithful flee Islamic State militants. War and sectarian conflict have shrunk Iraq's Christian population to about 400,000 from 1.5million before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, they said on a visit to Brussels seeking European Union help to protect their flocks. And now, even those who stayed are leaving for Turkey, Lebanon and western Europe, they claimed. The three - Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako, Syrian Catholic Archbishop of Mosul Yohanna Petros Mouche and Kirkuk's Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Youssif Mirkis - are all Eastern Catholics whose churches have their own traditional liturgy but are loyal to the pope in Rome. 'The next days will be very bad. If the situation does not change, Christians will be left with just a symbolic presence in Iraq,' said Sako, who is based in Baghdad . 'If they leave, their history is finished.' More than 50 bodies have been discovered by Iraqi authorities . in an agricultural area outside the city of Hillah, just south of . Baghdad, today.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for the Daily Mail . Follow @@riathalsam . Swansea have won three Premier League games in a row for the first time since August 2012. Sean Dyche estimated recently that he has made more than 500 telephone calls in efforts to build a squad that might keep Burnley in the Barclays Premier League. What isn’t known is how often Ross McCormack’s name came into the conversation and ruined everything. The striker’s £11million move from Leeds to Fulham not only stunned the selling club but also sent a shockwave through the transfer market, which is unfortunate for Dyche. No laughing matter: Dyche (right) shares a joke with his opposite number Monk but he knows he needs quality . Dyer delight: Nathan Dyer scored the only goal of the game, handing Burnley to the worst possible start . His side, with the exception of the first half, were good in the defeat at Swansea. But good won’t quite be enough if they continue to lack a creative edge, or the tactical options to match the numerous teams that play five in midfield, as Swansea did. Dyche admitted on Saturday that Burnley want new blood, having used only 23 players in the Championship. But at a time when a second-tier striker can cost £11m, Dyche’s sensible approach to spending might be at odds with the market. He said: ‘The challenge is obvious — how much have you got and how much can you spend? Everyone wants the prices up. Graft: Danny Ings works hard during Burnley's second defeat of the season but couldn't find the net . Firing blanks: Scott Arfield tries a shot despite the attentions of Ki Sung-Yueng as Burnley struggled . ‘Some Championship clubs pay more in wages than we do now in the Premier League. The biggest challenge this season has been the McCormack deal. I think that surprised everyone. ‘I respect him as a player, of course, but the finance that was put into that deal raised everyone’s level. Anyone who is sub-£11m (clubs that would not normally spend £11m on a player) is affected by that.’ For Dyche, it is proving to be quite a problem. His task in consolidating against Premier League resources is daunting, with their record now two defeats in two. He has spent £5m assembling this side and insisted at the weekend that club policy dictates he cannot spend big. Inflated: Ross McCormack's £11million move to Fulham has pushed up prices beyond Burnley's limited means . ‘The club made it quite clear there are guidelines I have to work in and that’s part of my role,’ he said. ‘We are aligned, though, because there is no point in me saying we have £25m to spend.’ Swansea led through Nathan Dyer’s first-half goal, but were forced to fight for their win after the break. Their captain Ashley Williams admitted the side have tried to add an extra physicality to their normal passing game. He said: ‘People think we are a passing side and a bit weak and a pushover. We want to address it and this was a day for that. Sometimes you have to win ugly and we did that.’","Burnley unable to spend big to stay in the Premier League .

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Everton are unbeaten in their past five matches against Arsenal — the longest undefeated spell in 110 years of playing the Gunners. He did what all top strikers should. With time ticking away and a crucial match on the brink of being lost, Olivier Giroud saved the day. Getting his head to a cross from Nacho Monreal and diverting it beyond Tim Howard as a pulsating game entered its 90th minute, Giroud sped away after rescuing a point, sliding on his knees into the corner of Goodison Park where Arsenal’s supporters celebrated. Giroud was crucial in turning the tide. His fizzing volley, which sped over Howard’s bar, gave Arsenal a jolt of confidence a minute after he replaced the ineffectual Alexis Sanchez; he provided his team with belief, a presence and, ultimately, a reward for their laboured efforts. VIDEO Scroll down to watch struggling  Sanchez and Arsene Wenger on Everton draw . Game changer: Giroud heads home his late leveler having completely changed the focus of Arsenal's attack . Knees up: The French striker celebrates his header in front of the travelling Arsenal fans at Goodison Park . That’s what all the top front men do and, for 45 minutes, that’s how Giroud — who left with his left foot in a protective boot — performed. But . . . There has to be a ‘but’. Giroud may have scored 16 times in the last Barclays Premier League campaign and won the FA Cup but many, notably Gary Lineker, have questioned if the France striker will ever be the 25-goal man to take Arsenal up a level. ‘How sure are you he won’t be that man?’ asked Wenger, who is likely to be without Giroud against Besiktas on Wednesday. ‘What he demonstrated when he came on was convincing. ‘Olivier is improving every year. I wouldn’t rule out he will get 25 goals. All our opponents have been looking for strikers as well and nobody has found a world-class one available better than the one they have.’ Strength: Gareth Barry tries to get the ball off the Arsenal forward but he proved a tough opponent . Doubt: Giroud left the ground in a protective boot but if he stays fit could score many more goals this season . Slow start: New signing Alexis Sanchez has not hit the ground running on the wing or up front for Arsenal . There was more support for Giroud from Aaron Ramsey, whose 83rd- minute goal gave Arsenal a lifeline. ‘I like playing with him because I can run off him and he can play me in,’ said Ramsey. ‘He got a load of goals for us last season, he was our top scorer. He is very valuable to this team.’ Many Arsenal fans were excited to see Alexis Sanchez get the nod as the lone centre forward against Everton, but Chile’s World Cup star struggled to impose himself against Everton centre halves Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin. Before his half-time substitution, Sanchez managed just 26 touches — none of which were in Everton’s penalty area. It was down to much-maligned striker Olivier Giroud to bring Arsenal’s attack more purpose. Yet does Wenger still need another forward before the window closes? In the opening half, when Sanchez looked woefully off the pace, you would have said yes. Wenger, though, is unmoved and says he never considered entering the bidding for Liverpool-bound Mario Balotelli. ‘We have (Yaya) Sanogo, who will be important,’ added Wenger. ‘We have Giroud, Joel Campbell can play centre forward, and of course Sanchez, and Theo Walcott coming back. 'You don’t put a pot of players together and bring in people just to have them there. The transition was better in the second half when we had the ball.’ It is to Arsenal’s credit they hauled themselves off the floor, having been run ragged for 45 minutes, as goals from Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith threatened to see Everton repeat the 3-0 savaging they inflicted in April. They would have seen the game out had they taken a couple of chances in the second period. That explains why Roberto Martinez is looking for another striker before the window closes, with Samuel Eto’o and Danny Welbeck contenders. ‘There is a lot of money involved in those two (deals),’ said the Everton manager. ‘I am looking at all options. Our first half shows what we have got in the squad. It is about how we are going to do that over 90 minutes.’ One back: Aaron Ramsey arrives in the six-yard box to score the Gunners' first goal and start the comeback .

"By . Craig Hope for The Mail on Sunday . Tom Ince believes goals should not be a problem for Hull City — despite manager Steve Bruce’s striker pursuit. The Tigers remain in discussion with Blackburn over Jordan Rhodes, who scored his 54th goal in 100 games for Rovers on Saturday as they beat Bournemouth 3-2. An initial bid of £8million was rejected though it is thought a fee of around £10m plus players could be agreed.

Ideal replacement: Bruce wants to sign Blackburn Rovers' Jordan Rhodes (right) after selling Shane Long (left) Bruce sold frontman Shane Long for £12m to Southampton earlier this month, then lost his £7m summer signing Robert Snodgrass to a knee injury for at least six months. Ince, though, feels he and his attacking colleagues carry enough firepower to keep the opposition worried. ‘There is enough capability in this team to score goals,’ he said. ‘We are creating chances, it would be a worry if we weren’t. We would sit and say “how did we lose that game?” added the former Palace loanee.’ Hull were beaten 1-0 by Sporting Lokeren in Thursday’s Europa League play-off first leg, but opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 victory at QPR.

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Swansea boss Garry Monk insists he is not getting carried away with the club's 100 per cent start to the Barclays Premier League season. Monk's men followed up their shock opening-day win at Manchester United by beating battling Burnley at the Liberty Stadium, Swansea withstanding pressure for most of the second half after Nathan Dyer had given them a 23rd-minute lead. But Monk is fully aware of the pitfalls of management, even though he has only been in the Swansea hot-seat for eight months. Joy: Swansea City scorer Nathan Dyer (third right) and his team-mates celebrate after his goal against Burnley . Bright: Swansea City boss Garry Monk is delighted with the 'best start' possible but will not get carried away . All smiles: Garry Monk (left) and Sean Dyche (right) share a joke before Saturday's Premier League match . 'It's a fantastic start and great to have six points, I'm not going to lie about that,' Monk said after the game. 'The way I am, the players know we have a (Capital One Cup) game on Tuesday and that is what we focus on. 'It's the best start we could have had, but we know we are only two games from being on your back and getting dragged down. 'We have to build on what we've done and improve on mistakes.' Monk was delighted with how Swansea withstood Burnley's second-half assault, with goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski only really stretched once when David Jones burst onto Danny Ings' pass and forced a fine save from the Polish international. 'It was very hard. The first half we controlled the game and if we could have got a second that would have made it easier,' Monk said. 'We spoke at half-time that they would throw everything at us and we weren't at our fluent best, but we dug in and defended well. Goalscorer: Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton was unable to keep Dyer's shot out of the net despite his best efforts . 'Burnley were in a no-lose situation but we limited them to one shot on target and defended very well the whole game. 'We know we have to show the other side of the game and there are times when you have to dig in. 'The boys were magnificent in that respect and that comes from the work we have done in pre-season. 'We would have liked it to be more comfortable but six points in two games is all you can ask for.' Burnley boss Sean Dyche admits his newly-promoted Clarets are on a fast learning curve after losing their opening two games to Chelsea and Swansea, but he remains positive with what he sees as signs of progress. 'We showed them too much respect in the first half and that can happen for a team that's just been promoted,' said Dyche. 'The early part of the season it's about believing that they belong and the first half we didn't do that and they were the better side. Team effort: Swansea, pictured celebrating Dyer's goal, proved to be too strong for  Burnley . 'The second half we played with that freedom and I thought we were terrific - the quality and energy of play and the framework of the team to make sure we didn't give chances away. 'I'm not naive enough to think the growth period doesn't have to be quick because it does. 'But there were good signs against Chelsea because they're a different animal at the moment. 'Swansea are not Chelsea yet and, though they've done fantastic and they're a very good side, this was probably a more realistic challenge which we applied ourselves to.' And Dyche insists that Burnley will be able to compete in the Premier League as the season unfolds. 'I want them to play with freedom, quality and energy and I thought we did that in the second half,' he added. 'That's the challenge you've got and there's times you'll take an ugly 1-0 as any manager would, but the belief is there that we can compete at this level. 'I want us to be brave, but not in a naive way, We want to play on the front foot, create chances and win games. 'There were times when we might have to change slightly but I didn't feel that was necessary today, even against a very good team like Swansea.'

"By . Stephen Mcgowan In Maribor . Celtic manager Ronny Deila called on Celtic fans to roar his team to the Champions League group stages after they secured a worthy 1-1 draw in Maribor. Callum McGregor was the goal hero once again as he fired Celtic into a sixth-minute lead. While Maribor punished slack defending and equalised through Danjan Bohar soon after, there was little prospect of a repeat of Celtic’s Warsaw capitulation which saw them ship four goals after McGregor had also given them the perfect start. 12th man: Celtic manager Ronny Deila hopes the fans can cheer his side to victory next week . Now very much in the driving seat, Deila is relishing the prospect of the return leg of the play-off encounter and his first experience of a European night at Parkhead after the temporary home at Murrayfield. ‘That is one of the advantages, we play them at home and I saw on Saturday how much it means for the players,’ he said. ‘It is important now that people meet up and give us everything, the way Celtic Park is. ‘We have a big chance now. ‘The second leg is going to be a tough game. It could be that Maribor are more dangerous away than at home because they will play in the same way. ‘We have to play with the right balance and attack them the right way. But of course we have the advantage of playing at Celtic Park and that’s what we are going to use to get through to the group stages. I have a good feeling we can reach it.’ After being handed a shock reprieve in the competition thanks to Legia Warsaw’s administrative blunder, Celtic last night were a far more composed and controlled force than they had been in the 6-1 reverse to the Poles. Chance: Callum McGregor (right) is hailed by Jo Inge Berget after opening the scoring for Celtic . And Deila insisted his side were unfortunate not to travel back to Glasgow with a win. ‘I think we were closer to winning than they were,’ he said. ‘But I think the performance was good and we worked very hard for 90 minutes. ‘We got into the game in the right way so I am pleased. it is going to be very exciting to play them now at Celtic Park on Tuesday. ‘I am very pleased with the performance today. We were well prepared and we knew what we were going to meet. The players were fantastic for 90 minutes. ‘There are things to work on but we are looking like a team now. We are working hard and creating chances. 1-1 was a good result but I think we could have won the game. ‘We knew they were going to sit deep because we had seen a lot on video and you know what you can expect. They are very good on the counter attacks and they showed they are also good to go through the middle. But we kept them away for long periods and we created chances ourselves so I am happy today.’ Back in the game: The NK Maribor team celebrate Damjan Bohar' goal after 14 minutes . Goal hero McGregor was singled out for special praise in what was a strong team performance. The 20-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Notts County, made it four goals in seven games after being given his first-team chance this season. ‘He is a fantastic player,’ Deila said. ‘He works both ways, good in defence and in offence so again a very good player and today he performed fantastic. ‘We can be proud he is a product of the Celtic youth department.’ At the other end, Craig Gordon also stood strong when Maribor threatened to take advantage of any slackness. Blameless for the goal which came through weak defending on Celtic’s part, Deila said of his keeper: ‘You see every day the hunger he has and wants to get back to the level where he was. I think he is almost there now. ‘I believe he is an experienced keeper who is calm and knows how to focus and he is a leader in the group now. That is very important. ‘He is so calm when he stands in the goal, he is athletic so I am pleased with him as well today.’","Ronny Deila hopes Celtic fans can cheer his side to victory against Maribor .

Liverpool have had a £16million offer for AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who previously played for City.

'I always say to the players these games are games of six points – especially when you play at home,' he said. I'll say something, you can't accuse Pellegrini of being anything other than a straight talker. Asked if last season's failure to win the league will affect Liverpool, he says simply: 'I don't know whether they will be affected. Last season is finished. For Liverpool also.'

A hard-fought 2-1 home victory over Southampton got Brendan Rodgers' side under way but it seemed a long way from the devastating performances which tore opponents to shreds last season. Next up are Manchester City, who pipped them to the title in the final week, but Lambert believes the Reds will soon pick up the tempo. VIDEO Scroll down to watch New signings excellent - Rogers . Salute: Daniel Sturridge celebrates after scoring the winner in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Southampton at Anfield . Match-winner: Sturridge nods past Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster to give Liverpool the victory . 'I don't think we played badly, I just don't think it was as fluid as Liverpool can play,' said the England international, who made his debut against his former side with a late substitute appearance. 'But I thought the first goal (from Raheem Sterling) was excellent: a great pass from Jordan (Henderson) and a good finish and after some pressure from Southampton we came strong and got the win. 'It was a really hard game and it was a great three points. The first game is always nervous, you are never quite as sharp as you want to be. 'The first game everyone is excited and desperate to win and you are not sure how you are going to play and the quicker you can get that win the better. 'It makes you get into your rhythm a bit easier and faster. 'The win is perfect but we now have a few hard games coming up.' Upping the tempo: Rickie Lambert believes Liverpool will quickly find their rhythm this season . Like last season, when Simon Mignolet saved a last-minute penalty against Stoke to hold on to three points, it could have been so different had the goalkeeper not produced a brilliant late save from Morgan Schneiderlin. 'It was one of the best saves I've seen,' added Lambert. 'It was definitely a goal and he's managed to push it on to the underside of the bar.' Lambert found himself in the unique position of being applauded by both sets of fans as he made his way onto the pitch with the 32-year-old former Reds trainee still warmly regarded by supporters of the club he served so well. 'It was strange to come on against your old team-mates. I haven't had many situations like that in may career but you have to be as professional as you can,"" he added. 'It was special from the Liverpool fans making my debut, which was a dream, and it was special from Southampton fans who showed a lot of respect and appreciation.' Special: Lambert replaced Phillipe Coutinho to make his first Premier League appearance for his boyhood club . There was not the same appreciation from Dejan Lovren, another former Saint who made his Liverpool debut - the third, Adam Lallana is recovering from a knee injury. The Croatian was booed throughout by fans who were unhappy with the way he handled his exit after just a season on the south coast but it did not appear to affect his performance. 'I thought Lovren was excellent,' said Rodgers. 'It is always difficult when you play against your old team. If you have nine or 10 things to think about, when you play your old team you have 20. 'He is a real leader and he was excellent.' VIDEO New signings excellent - Rogers . Leader: Dejan Lovren faced his former club and was labelled 'excellent' by new manager Brendan Rodgers .

Cech, winner of three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League with Chelsea, has not faced such a threat in his 10 years at the club. Courtois, though, is not considered your ordinary goalkeeper. The 6ft 6 Belgian - an inch taller than Cech for what it's worth - is regarded as one of the best in the world after helping Atletico Madrid win their first La Liga title for 18 years and, at 22, has plenty left to give. Being stuck between a rock and a hard place has  never felt so good for Mourinho who, as blunt as ever, insists he can keep hold of his apparent second-choice goalkeeper. ‘We are Chelsea. We can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club,' he said. 'We can. We are economically stable. We can have Diego Costa, Didier Drogba and Fernando Torres, so we can have Courtois and Cech. 'I can have Ramires, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar, yet I cannot have two top goalkeepers? I can. Chelsea can as a club, and I can as a manager.' The trouble is Cech  may feel waiting  to be brought back into the loop at the age of 32 is a battle not worth waging. As a result, Paris Saint-Germain have been circling Cech and Chelsea goalkeeeping coach Christophe Lollichon in anticipation of him being dropped. The  Ligue 1 club remain open to a loan as it would see them meet UEFA's strict Financial Fair Play restrictions, although Monaco and Real Madrid are there to create competition. Mourinho, who ended Courtois's three-year loan spell in La Liga,  told his squad the starting XI during training on Sunday and has certainly taken this - a 'problem every manager in every club would like to have' - in his stride.

His emergence as a promising teenager at Italian side Lecce in 2002, where he made his senior debut a month short of his 16th birthday, drew glowing reviews and comparisons to another teenage sensation – England's Wayne Rooney, then at Everton. Bojinov got his big move aged only 18 in 2005, when he moved to Fiorentina, where he scored eight goals in 36 appearances. He also spent some time on loan at Juventus – then relegated to the Serie B following the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal – before securing a move to Manchester City in 2007. His career in England was derailed by two major injuries – first to his knee ligaments in August 2007 and then an Achilles injury a year later. All in all, he played only 11 matches for City and scored one goal before being loaned to Parma, a move made permanent in the summer of 2010. The striker never appeared to recover from his injuries and played mostly as a substitute at Parma, moving to Sporting Lisbon a year later, where he failed to stake a claim as a starter as well. Only six months into his tenure with Sporting, he was banned from the club after taking, and missing, a potential match-winning spot kick deep into added time in a cup game – wrestling the ball from the designated penalty taker – sparking a furious reaction among the coaching staff and the club's fans. After several loan spells with Italian clubs, Bojinov came to Bulgaria but has been underwhelming at Levski, as the club finished fifth in the league last season.

"By . Alex Sharp for MailOnline . Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert has slammed the ambition of Southampton’s owners for allowing ex-Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino to leave for Premier League rivals Tottenham. After months of speculation Pochettino signed a five-year deal back in May to become head coach at Spurs and Lambert believes his exit lead to the player exodus at Southampton this summer. ‘There’s obviously a reason why the gaffa went and that was the moment it became clear to the players what the ambition of the club was going to be,' Lambert told Fox Sports. Departure: Rickie Lambert has criticised Southampton's owners for allowing Mauricio Pochettino to leave . Saints success: Pochettino guided Southampton to eighth last season, their best ever Premier League finish . Under fire: Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger and owner Katharina Liebherr watch from the stands . The former Argentina defender impressed during his 16-month reign at Saints, leading the south coast club to their best-ever Premier League finish of eighth last season. However, soon after Pochettino’s departure to White Hart Lane, there was an exodus of star talent at St Mary’s as Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren departed for rival Premier League clubs. Lambert feels the criticism directed towards the players by Southampton fans should be re-directed at the club’s owners: . ‘Obviously a few of the players who have left have taken a bit of stick but that’s football. It’s been surprising it’s all been at the players and not on the owners.’ Gone: Calum Chambers was part of the player exodus at St Mary's this summer, joining Arsenal for £12 million . Left: Dejan Lovren was one of three Southampton players to leave and join Liverpool this transfer window . The England international striker was evidently delighted to make his competitive debut for Liverpool during their 2-1 win over Southampton at the weekend: . ‘Yeh it’s so special I managed to get on and make my debut, obviously it was mixed emotions against my old teammates but it was brilliant. ‘We scored the winner and I had a little contribution in it, so it was excellent.’ Winning start: Daniel Sturridge celebrates scoring Liverpool's winner against Southampton at the weekend . Despite his departure from Southampton in the summer, Lambert has retained a decent relationship with the Saints fans who chanted at him at Anfield on Sunday: . ‘I loved Southampton fans, I’ve got a good relationship with them and it was nice that they acknowledged me in the way that they did. ‘I tried to acknowledge them back in the same manner with the same kind of respect. I’ve got nothing but respect for Southampton Football Club, the players and the fans.'","Former Saints striker lays into club's owners for summer player exodus .

"By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . Arsene Wenger believes the attacking weapons already at his disposal will be enough come the business end of the season despite the widely held belief his Arsenal squad lacks a top level striker. Despite being linked with a number of available stars during the transfer window - including Mario Balotelli and Edinson Cavani - Wenger is preparing fans for the news that there may be no news on any further additions to his line-up before Monday's deadline. The imminent return of Yaya Sanogo from injury boosts the manager's options up front after Wenger reinforced his faith in Olivier Giroud, whose winning header at the death against Everton on Saturday snatched a hard-fought draw. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sanchez and Sanogo link up for incredible training goal . Strike force?: Arsene Wenger believes Yaya Sanogo's return will boost his goal-scoring options . Young gun: Wenger cites France under-21 striker Sanogo and Giroud among reasons needs no more  strikers . Managing expectations: Arsenal fans should be prepared to not see a new striker before Monday's deadline . 'We have [Yaya] Sanogo who will be an important asset, we have Giroud, we have Lukas Podolski, we have Joel Campbell who can play centre forward,’ he said. ‘We have Alexis [Sanchez] and [Theo] Walcott coming back. Let’s not forget that.' Out of all the names Wenger lists though, only the French 21-year-old Sanogo joins Giroud as a recognised striker - with the others, despite what the players themselves think, preferred in wider positions. Sanogo impressed in the preseason, with a four goal blitz in 22 minutes against Benfica the pick of his performances. He's anything but the finished article, but Wenger showed signs he clearly rates the young striker by starting him in the Community Shield final against Manchester City and in their Premier League opener against Crystal Palace. Front line: Olivier Giroud is Wenger top-choice striker, with 21-year-old Sanogo emerging as his understudy . On the attack: Costa Rica's Joel Campbell, who's returned from loan, can also play in a forward position . Threat: Chile forward Alexis Sanchez is also strong in the final third, though not a recognised striker . As far as Wenger is concerned, he's better to be happy with what he has than to try and shoe-horn an expensive No 9 into his system. ‘All of our opponents look for strikers as well and nobody finds a world-class striker available who is better than the strikers you have,’ he says.

"By . Charlie Eccleshare for MailOnline . Under-fire West Ham boss Sam Allardyce believes his side are well stocked in the attacking positions, but need defenders to compete in the Premier League this season. The Hammers have already signed strikers Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia this summer, and been offered Sassuolo striker Leonardo Pavoletti, but look short defensively.

'There's no search for any more strikers from my point of view, the difficulty is at the other end,' he said. 'We're without James Collins because of suspension and we could be without James Tomkins because of injury.' 'We're looking at players who are able to play in that position [centre back] throughout Europe.' Plenty to ponder: Allardyce needs a result after the opening day defeat to Tottenham .

'I expect them to be difficult to break down and dangerous on the break.'

"By . Garry Doolan . Who should be England's next captain? Bookmakers have already installed Wayne Rooney as favourite to be England’s next captain in the wake of Steven Gerrard’s international retirement. As if they had much choice. It’s not through Rooney being the stand-out candidate, rather he is the best of an average bunch - as was painfully obvious with the dismal elimination from the World Cup after just two group games. Rooney at least has the benefit of previous, short-lived captaincy experience for his country and has been Manchester United’s on-off skipper in recent years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard announce retirement from International football . Obvious choice: Rooney (right) is the bookies' favourite to replace Gerrard (left) as England captain . He may also be in the running to secure the armband full-time now that Rio Ferdinand has left Old Trafford. That would certainly improve the 28-year-old scouser’s cause in the eyes of England boss Roy Hodgson. If it’s good enough for Louis van Gaal, then it should be good enough for Hodgson. On the international front, Rooney has played almost 100 games for his country and that sort of experience is invaluable, even if it is the experience of never winning anything. When he made his senior international debut at the age of just 17 in February 2003, he was England’s youngest international cap. That’s an enviable record, although since eclipsed by Theo Walcott. Rooney has matured on and off the field since those early days wearing the Three Lions and, as an established figure for club and country, now commands respect among his peers. Fresh start: Rooney jokes with new Man United manager Louis van Gaal on their pre-season tour of the US . But his performance in England’s World Cup defeat by Italy, when cast out in an unfamiliar wide position, may have blotted his copybook in the eyes of the manager. A captain is expected to lead from the front, even when it does not suit, not sulk on the fringes. If not Rooney, then who? Chelsea defender Gary Cahill is another early front-runner to carry the armband as Hodgson’s side look to banish the bitter memory of their dire campaign in Brazil. Hodgson wants to rebuild with youth ahead of Euro 2016 and Cahill, like Rooney, is at just the right time in his career for the responsibility. In contention: Chelsea defender Cahill (centre) has been a regular starter under Roy Hodgson . Hodgson, as a traditionalist, may prefer a defender to be barking orders as captain from the back rather than relying on a striker to get the message through on the field. Forwards can be detached from the action further back and that will form part of Hodgson’s thinking. While the late, great Bobby Moore is perhaps England’s most well-known and well-loved skipper, there have been strikers who have worn the armband in the post-war years. Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker share the distinction. If Hodgson does not fancy a striker, he may fancy a goalkeeper even less. Joe Hart is another who tops the list of early favourites, but Ray Clemence or Peter Shilton he is not. Experienced: Joe Hart has been England's established No 1 for some time . The Manchester City stopper was backed for the England captaincy by fans and pundits alike as far back as 2012, with many favouring a string of emphatic performances. But his form last season dipped and that leaves a question mark over his club future. City boss Manuel Pellegrini sees £6million summer signing Willy Caballero as providing real competition for Hart next season and it would be a brave England manager who has as his captain a player not even guaranteed first-team football at club level. Beyond the obvious front-runners, the strength of the England candidates tail off dramatically directly proportional to their number of caps. End of an era: Gerrard captained England from the World Cup in 2010 . Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka have been thrown into the hat, for no other obvious reason, it appears, than they have played for their country. Daniel Sturridge has yet to prove his maturity and consistency beyond a good season with Liverpool last time around. And Jack Wilshere’s slender chances would appear to have gone up in smoke with that picture of him partying in Las Vegas so soon after England’s elimination from Brazil. Hart was also in that picture, which may perhaps have done his hopes even more harm than the fact he may not be playing for City next term.","Steven Gerrard has retired from international football .

"By . Laura Williamson . Another year, another Arsenal captain bidding farewell to north London. Thomas Vermaelen became the fifth current skipper to leave the club in the past nine years when he joined Barcelona, following Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie's departures. With new captain Mikel Arteta already into the last year of his contract, it does not bode well for the Spaniard's chances of staying at the Emirates beyond next summer. Arsene Wenger's willingness to sell his skippers - assets that should, traditionally, be at the very heart of any football club - betrays the Frenchman's lack of sentimentality, but also the lack of regard in which the Arsenal manager holds the position. Fresh start: Former Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is presented as Barcelona's latest summer signing . Sold: Both Vermaelen (left) and Patrick Vieira (right) were let go by Arsene Wenger . He did not strip Vermaelen of the club captaincy last season although the Belgian made only 21 appearances, initially owing to a stress fracture in his back, while he seemed to think it insignificant that another player, usually Arteta, would wear the armband on the pitch in the defender's absence. Questions about captaincy generally merit one of Wenger's quizzical looks, as he ponders why people brought up on Bobby Moore, John McGovern or Bryan Robson are making such a fuss about an armband on a shirt sleeve. But it does matter. Old-fashioned though it may seem, you want there to be honour in an individual being chosen to be the captain of your football club. At Arsenal, however, the role has been diminished to the point where it was fitting the club ended their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup at Wembley last May with their long-term captain, Vermaelen, as an unused substitute. It is not just at Arsenal, of course, but across English football at many football clubs. The England captain's armband has long been devalued; tossed haphazardly between one-cap wonders during dismally dull friendlies or given, sentimentally, to players who have reached a milestone number of appearances for their country. This is very sweet, but it shows that, contrary to what we might like to believe, the captain's armband is ultimately just a piece of cloth tied around a player's shirt sleeve. Gone: Robin van Persie wore Arsenal's captain's armband before leaving for Manchester United . Leaving London: Thierry Henry (left) and Van Persie (right) decided to leave the Emirates for new challenges . There are no special privileges for a football captain in the Laws of the Game, after all, merely an expectation that they work with the referee and take responsibility for their team's behaviour. Players look to their manager or coaches on the sidelines for tactical direction, unlike on a cricket pitch, and so a football captain's role is largely ceremonial or inspirational. You would hope it still means something, though, otherwise what's the point of having a captain at all? They meet the referee with the team-sheet an hour before kick-off, and should act as a pathway between players and management and, ideally, between the club and its fans. This may be as simple as the ghosted, largely anodyne notes that appear every fortnight in the matchday programme under the captain's name, or fronting up to the television cameras or written press when things are not going so well. It could also be things that help make team-mates' lives easier: Joey Barton recalls requesting six new plugs for the players' baths when he was made captain at QPR, to save them trying to clog up the holes with toilet paper. Captain fantastic: Cesc Fabregas lead the Gunners before swapping north London for Barcelona in 2011 . These varied roles, however, make it a particularly difficult task if the club captain is not a guaranteed starter. How can he act as a go-between if he is worried about his place in the squad or not on the pitch at all? This concern now affects a manager's choice of captain more than, perhaps, their suitability as a leader. Some Arsenal fans, for instance, have suggested Aaron Ramsey or Jack Wilshere should have been chosen this time around, but their relative youth has prompted Wenger to look elsewhere. By picking talismanic players such as Henry, Fabregas and Van Persie to wear the armband in the past, the captaincy became something the Arsenal boss did not really have to think about. His captain led the team out, invariably scored or put in a match-winning performance, and that was that. When Wenger abandoned this model, with William Gallas and then Vermaelen, the captaincy suddenly became an issue again; an issue Wenger does not want or particularly recognise as important in the grand scheme of running a football club. Consequently, it is not since Patrick Vieira in 2005 that Arsenal have had a captain who really seemed to define the honour, in the traditional sense of how we want our captains to be. Sadly, that has been sold off a long time ago. VIDEO Excited Vermaelen relishing Barca challenge .","Thomas Vermaelen joined Barcelona for £15million last week .

All the talk in the week and all the speculation surrounding factors they aren’t able to change could have been a distant memory had they turned up here. Sadly for everyone connected with this football club, Keith Millen’s back four were picked apart at will by an exuberant West Ham and looked players in need of serious direction. Sam Allardyce’s side quite rightly sensed the afternoon was one in which they’d get up and running, points on the board. They weren’t wrong.

Brilliant debutant Mauro Zarate first volleyed in before Stewart Downing added another to silence Selhurst Park. Off to a bad start: Mauro Zarate made matters worse for manager-less Crystal Palace by giving West Ham the lead after 34 minutes .

Goals: Zarate (34), Downing (37), Cole (62) Referee: Mark Clattenberg . Palace briefly rallied and got a goal back via Marouane Chamakh, but when Carlton Cole thrashed in a third, attention quickly turned to the tricky week ahead. To just encapsulate the defensive problems Millen endured, this is the first time West Ham scored three goals away from Upton Park since beating Tottenham in October. The star of the show then, Ravel Morrison, was an unused substitute here after being released on bail for assault. It has been the strangest of few days around these parts, all told. They were primed to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager before Sportsmail’s revelations about private texts sent between the former Cardiff boss and then Palace sporting director Iain Moody. What followed was a quick re-think, co-chairman Steve Parish couldn’t possibly continue blindly with the original plan, and we now find ourselves no closer to knowing who will take over. Hardly ideal for a side many had tipped for a top half finish before Tony Pulis left the club on the season’s eve. Parish smiled and politely declined the suggestion that the man who transformed them last season could make an immediate return beforehand. But then there is a heap of pragmatism involved in running and sporting the Eagles. One supporter walking down Homlesdale Road at half-past one told it best. ‘This is just a normal week - it’s not that desperate,’ she said. ‘Remember when we were going out of business?’ The wider footballing world would do well to consider that. This is a place that found itself on the brink of falling off a cliff four years ago and refused to boo its players even when two down at half-time. Mackay and Moody’s faults have absolutely nothing to do with Palace. They’ve been an unfortunate, innocent bystander. It’s been made their business and caretaker Millen has been handed a thankless task to keep this football-related.

Unfortunately for Millen - who does want the job full-time - the hosts looked jaded, out of ideas and yearning for direction. The manager said that himself after a gutsy opening day defeat at Arsenal but nothing has changed. If Palace allow this situation to fester any longer they’ll find themselves without the new signings they need by the transfer deadline and without points. Safe for a blocked Mile Jedinak effort and speculative Damien Delaney drive, Palace offered little in their opening half at home this season that had started with Joe Ledley pulling out minutes before kick-off with a groin strain. Home optimism drained, West Ham were two up at the break. Zarate was afforded too much space on the edge of the box from a corner to have broken, zipping a low volley into Julian Speroni’s left-hand corner to notch his first goal in English football since a loan spell at Birmingham City in 2008. Moments later it was two. Downing was quite incredibly allowed to coast in from the right - Joel Ward wrong-footed - and guide a whipped effort to the goalkeeper’s right. It was no less than they deserved, and thanks in no small part to the brilliance of Zarate. Allardyce knows he has a player on his hands here. In a not-so-covert bid to make the Hammers a more attractive team to watch, the Argentine can do what he likes in behind the striker. In this case that man was Cole who - despite his many, many critics - gave the visitors an easy outlet. Given hope: Striker Marouane Chamakh got Palace back in the running with a second-half strike that made it 2-1 to the visitors . In: Chamakh of Palace scores during the Premier League match against West Ham at Selhurst Park to give caretaker manager Millen hope of nicking a point . Back in it: Palace edged their way back into the game to make it 2-1 with more than 40 minutes left to play but could not inspire a full comeback . Zarate, often found in midfield, was the focal point, at the heart of everything positive going forward; his ability to jink and weave beyond defenders is the sort of attribute missing last year. Now they’ve a man who saunters in pesky areas - spaces a sitting midfielder can’t drop in to but impossible for a centre-half to venture to. If we see more of that and less of the shockingly late studs-up challenge on Stuart O’Keefe , he’ll become a big hit. The Zarate-inspired Hammers should have made the game safe seconds after the restart. Speroni rushed out to collect a Downing corner in the flight, James Tomkins rose highest to seemingly plant a header into an unguarded net, but could only find the crossbar. A reprieve for Palace, who were back in it in a flash. Jedinak broke out to the left, dinked a ball inside to Chamakh and the striker, 20 yards out, fiercely drove home. That was just reward for a player who is being asked to put in incredibly tough shifts by Millen. The mood had changed. Barry Bannan’s stinging effort was just held by Adrian and Yannick Bolasie’s shot blocked - tails were up. But that didn’t last though, and again it was all their own doing. Delaney was incapable of mopping up an innocuous deep free-kick, finding himself in a tangle and providing Cole with the opportunity to smash home from 12 yards. He duly obliged. While that woman was quite right to maintain perspective on her walk into the ground, there’s no escaping that Palace need a manager, and quickly. Settling it: Carlton Cole makes it 3-1 to West Ham against a Palace side whose manager left less than 48 hours before the Premier League season started .

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Who should be England's next captain? To appreciate what playing for England meant to Steven Gerrard, let us to take you back to early November 2012 and the place where it all began for him. Ahead of his landmark 100th appearance against Sweden, Gerrard had agreed to pose for a photograph for Sportsmail with pupils from his first school, Huyton with Roby, wearing his 99 caps. The idea was to re-create the famous image Kent Gavin has taken of Bobby Moore, with Gerrard sitting in amongst the children, cap-less, wearing a gleaming white England shirt. The children who had been chosen to appear on the photograph were in position on the schoolyard, eagerly awaiting his arrival, when the time for Gerrard to make his entrance came. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard's greatest moments in an England shirt . International superstar: 99 schoolchildren sit with Steven Gerrard to celebrate his England career in 2012 . Role model: Bobby Moore (centre) poses with 99 schoolchildren prior to winning his 100th cap . Just as he was about to head out, though, he stopped in the Assembly Hall and began looking around, memories of his childhood clearly flooding back. It was in that moment the enormity of everything he had achieved - from the young lad who had dared to dream to the man who became England captain - appeared to hit him. He loved being involved in the project and the shirt he wore for the picture now currently hangs in a frame in that assembly hall, a permanent reminder to those who sit in the same classrooms about what can be achieved with hard work, determination and dedication. That is why there are no empty words when Gerrard says his decision to call time on playing for England career was ‘one of the hardest decisions’ he has ever made; he will have consulted many family and friends, most notably his wife, Alex, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, England head coach Roy Hodgson and his trusted long-term agent Struan Marshall - before making this announcement. This has not just been made on a whim. And it is the right decision because he has made it himself. England would have definitely been richer for his presence and experience in the Euro 2016 qualification campaign but the baton has now been passed on. End of an era: Gerrard was made captain for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . Young guard: Jordan Henderson may be handed the chance to replace Gerrard for England . Obvious choice: Rooney (right) is the bookies' favourite to replace Gerrard (left) as England captain . Confidantes: Gerrard spoke with Brendan Rodgers (left) and Roy Hodgson (right) before making his mind up . He is going on his own terms and that will inevitably benefit Liverpool, particularly with an assault on the Champions League looming. Gerrard, who turned 34 in May, explained: 'Brendan has been fantastic and obviously I have to look after my body as much as possible to ensure I can give everything when I take to the field. ‘To ensure I can keep playing to a high level and giving everything to Liverpool Football Club I believe this is the right decision, and having Champions League football back at Anfield is another big factor in my decision.' Luis Suarez may have been crowned the PFA and FWA Player of the Year last season, after his 31 goals propelled Liverpool to the brink of the Barclays Premier League title, but the influence Gerrard had on the assault should not be underestimated. His slip against Chelsea that gifted Demba Ba a crucial goal may still be fresh in the memory but that should not be why his most recent campaign is remembered.

Gerrard was brilliant last season, the driving force in a number of crucial wins, converting ice-cool penalties and dictating play from a deep-lying position. It has been called the 'Pirlo role' but on Merseyside it has become known, simply, as the 'Gerrard role'. He still has much to give at the highest level and nobody at Anfield is looking forward more to hearing that instantly recognisable Champions League music blasting out from the speakers once more and coming up against the biggest names in Europe; showdowns with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are what Liverpool's No 8 is made for and saying goodbye to England will mean he is primed for such occasions. But do not think that he has relished terminating a journey that started in May 2000 against Ukraine and, ultimately, ended with a brief substitute appearance against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. He loved putting Three Lions on his chest - that was abundantly clear one Friday morning on a schoolyard in Huyton.","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has called time on his England career .

"By . Andrew Magee . Despite an England career spanning 14 years, six tournament appearances and 114 caps, it is unlikely that Steven Gerrard will have anything but heartache to look back upon following his retirement from international football.

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Mauricio Pochettino wants to keep his playmakers firmly in the spotlight after they all shone brightly in a comfortable win over QPR. The new Tottenham head coach is well known for advocating an attacking philosophy and it was his front players who stole the show on Harry Redknapp's return to White Hart Lane as Spurs romped to a 4-0 victory. Erik Lamela, the club-record signing whose early-season rejuvenation under Pochettino is clear for all to see, as well as Nacer Chadli, Christian Eriksen and Emmanuel Adebayor, proved far too strong for the back three deployed by Redknapp. Two-goal hero: Nacer Chadli bagged a brace against Queens Park Rangers at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Magician: Erik Lamela was in brilliant form for Tottenham against former manager Harry Redknapp's side . Chadli scored twice in the first half, either side of a second goal in as many Barclays Premier League appearances for Eric Dier, while Adebayor added a fourth in the second half to take Spurs top of the table. And Pochettino was full of praise for his wealth of attacking talent, insisting he always wants to let them play unshackled. 'Lamela, Adebayor, Chadli and Eriksen create the movement and rotate - they are free,' he said. 'We work a lot on the training ground but it is important that the players are free in their minds because they are creative players. 'You can not put the players like that in the shade, you need to provide the organisation but after that they are free. 'It is true that Lamela can improve a lot. He is still young and when a young player arrives in a different country it is hard to adapt. 'We all know his skills and we are very pleased for him and for all of the squad - Sunday was a very good day.' Free role: Mauricio Pochettino has said he wants to unleash the likes of Chadli and Lamela . Calming influence: Pochettino refuses to get carried away after seeing his team win their first two games . Despite being pleased with his first competitive home game in charge of Spurs, Pochettino was quick to dispel any early season talk of a title tilt. 'It is nothing,' he replied when asked about Tottenham sitting top of the table. 'It is two games. The most important thing is to try and develop our style and philosophy, we showed our basis. 'For me, it is important that the team show they are a team. We played like a team all together and we can achieve something. 'It is important to keep the reality and stay calm. If you lose two games you are in danger but we need to keep calm, it is only the beginning of the season.' Redknapp saw his side given something of a run around, especially in the first half as his back three of Rio Ferdinand, Steve Caulker and Richard Dunne were exposed. Although he introduced Nedum Onuoha at half-time and reverted to four at the back, the 67-year-old is keen to persevere with his new 3-5-2 system. Defensive reshape: Harry Redknapp was forced into reshuffling a back three which included Rio Ferdinand . Unfazed: Redknapp will not be changing his side's formation despite the heavy defeat at Tottenham . 'I don't know if that (the system) is a problem,' he said. 'We played okay last week playing that way, it is about energy really. We were slower on the ball and were off the pace a bit - in certain areas we weren't sharp enough. We have to work harder both with and without the ball. 'I don't think it is about systems. That system allows me to get two strikers into the team which I was trying to do. '(Loic) Remy doesn't play up on his own, it is difficult. Charlie Austin doesn't play up on his own. You look to play 4-4-2 and you get slaughtered in midfield, it is not easy.' With Austin ruled out with a hamstring injury, Redknapp played Matt Phillips up with Remy and the Scotland international was guilty of missing the best chance of the game for the visitors with the score at 1-0. Redknapp was jeered by the travelling QPR contingent in the latter stages for acknowledging Tottenham fans calling for him to wave at them. Mutual respect: Former White Hart Lane boss Redknapp acknowledged the Tottenham supporters . But he brushed aside those complaints and insisted it made no difference where his side lost, just that certain issues need addressing. 'It was a disappointing day obviously, we started poorly and didn't get out of it,' he said. 'We could've been 1-0 down in 30 seconds, we looked like a team of strangers. We let them play, stood off them and didn't get close to them. 'It is three points, that is all that matters to me, come here play well and pick up a positive result. Getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else. 'I'm sat there watching the game and there are punters up there singing ""give us a wave"". I don't know what punters they are - it isn't a big deal.'","Nacer Chadli scored two goals in Tottenham's emphatic win at the Lane .

"By . Adam Crafton for the Daily Mail . For all Manchester City’s attacking flair last season, there were times when the cavalier approach bordered on the naive and a certain fragility was apparent. We need only think back to the last time Manuel Pellegrini side’s faced Monday night's opponents on that emotional afternoon in April. Liverpool won 3-2 because City were too open and were torn to pieces in a scorching first half. Ultimately, it did not matter. As Liverpool stumbled in the title race, City pulled away. It was, however, an instructive afternoon for Pellegrini, who will also be concerned that City last season lost home and away to Chelsea and failed to win at Arsenal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City's Fernandinho in the Ice Bucket Challenge . Strength in depth: Fernando will add assuredness to Manchester City's midfield this season . Hard tackler: The former Porto man impressed on his debut against Newcastle last Sunday . They also lost 3-1 at home by Bayern Munich. It is those results that perhaps persuaded City to push through a £12million deal for Porto’s Fernando, after almost sealing a move in January. Pellegrini favours adventurous football but the acquisition of Fernando  suggests we may see a cuter City this season. City will now have muscularity to complement the elegance. City already boast Fernandinho and Yaya Toure in central positions but there was a suspicion that at times they neglected their defensive duties. Now, City could field a three-man midfield with Fernando, providing greater protection in front of the defence. Fernandinho sees his new team-mate as a positive addition. ‘Fernando is a big signing for us,’ he said. ‘The club is not just thinking about defending the title but also the Champions League. ‘Our target is to reach the Champions League final and I’m sure he can help us do it. Whether it is me, Yaya or Fernando who plays, we have the quality to win the Champions League.’ Attacking force: He will be hoping to complement the creative talents of Yaya Toure in City's midfield . Competition: And he will likely be challenging fellow Brazilian Fernandinho for the second central rol . Pellegrini may opt to experiment for the first time with all three in the same midfield tonight. Fernandinho, though available, is also still working towards full fitness after returning late from the World Cup, so if Pellegrini plays with only two in there, he may a face a battle with compatriot Fernando for a starting place. ‘That doesn’t matter,’ said Fernandinho. ‘If he plays one game, I can play another, and sometimes we can play together.’ The Brazilians did not know each other before Fernando’s arrival but have hit it off. Fernandinho added: ‘We have worked and lived together and done things socially. I told him to find a house near me. He is like me, calm and quiet.’","New man Fernando will be hope to add muscularity to Man City's midfield .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Mauro Zarate has 'matured' enough to put his controversial days behind him and pull West Ham's attacking strings, according to Sam Allardyce. West Ham's Argentine summer signing volleyed a fine debut goal in Saturday's 3-1 Premier League victory at Crystal Palace. Zarate was Argentina's top scorer last term with 20 goals in 35 games for Velez Sarsfield - a second stint at his home club following a turbulent four years at Lazio. Dream start: Mauro Zarate scored on his Premier League debut to put West Ham one-nil up against Palace . Jubilant mood: Zarate celebrates with his new team-mates after his volley beat Julian Speroni . The versatile playmaker was photographed giving a fascist salute among Lazio's 'Ultras' fans during a two-match ban in 2010, though a spokesman later claimed he was unaware of the gesture's significance. Zarate was then spotted on holiday in the Maldives in April 2013 when he had told Lazio he was in Argentina receiving medical treatment. Allardyce hailed the 27-year-old's full debut, and backed him to make a big Premier League impact this season. 'The lad has grown up and matured, I remember his loan spell at Birmingham six years or so ago,' said Allardyce. 'He's been to Italy and back to Argentina since then and scored some goals, I think he looks at his age a mature player with a lot of quality in the final-third which is something different from what we have.' Changed man: Sam Allardyce believes Zarate has matured since his spell with Birmingham City . Pleased: Allardyce is happy with the way his new players have settled into life in east London . Chronically toothless finishing scuppered West Ham in their season-opening 1-0 home defeat to Tottenham. Saturday's comprehensive Selhurst Park victory played witness to an immediate reversal of fortunes in front of goal, with Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole all claiming well-taken strikes. Allardyce admitted he hopes his side can now seize on Saturday's victory. 'This time the quality of our finishing has been absolutely superb and that's why we're all so happy about the performance and the result,' he said. 'Mauro's was a fantastic finish from outside the box and Stewart Downing's run and finish were both of the highest quality. 'Crystal Palace could not complain, they couldn't defend against the quality of those two goals, particularly so that was the icing on top of the cake for a great first-half performance.' Allardyce hailed Cheikhou Kouyate as another new recruit with the potential to wield influence at Upton Park this term. Midfield maestro: Allardyce believes Cheikhou Kouyate will become an important player for West Ham . The 24-year-old made the summer switch from Anderlecht, and Allardyce said his enthusiasm is proving infectious with his Hammers team-mates. 'I think he's got the modern-day midfield player written all over him,' said the West Ham boss. 'The one thing maybe he might be missing is a goal or two, I don't know yet, but certainly he gets in that area a few times. 'He's high-energy, two-footed, great box-to-box, committed in the air, he tackles: I think it's great to see a player that comes in with a big smile on his face every day. 'He's living his dream by playing in the Premier League.'","Mauro Zarate scored the opening goal at Selhurst Park on Saturday .

It was Demba Ba’s unlikely hurrah and the away goals rule which did for Paris Saint-Germain in Europe last season, but as they approach the beginning of a new campaign in which they will once again target Champions League glory, a more fundamental obstacle lays in their way. The French champions, enhanced by the untold wealth of Qatar Sports Investments since 2011, were sanctioned similarly to Manchester City for breaching UEFA’s financial fair play regulations and have had to tailor their moves in the transfer market accordingly. When winning the continent’s premier club title by 2016 has been the stated target all along, it was unsurprising to hear club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi call the punishment a ‘tremendous handicap’.

PSG were fined £49million, told not to increase their wage bill for the next two campaigns, and to ‘significantly limit spending’ in the market while curbing losses to no more than £24m next year. Laurent Blanc’s team have won the last two Ligue 1 crowns, finishing ahead of Monaco at a canter last season by nine points, and with France’s other mega-wealthy side losing James Rodriguez to Real Madrid this summer it seems a formality the domestic title will once more head to the capital. But it is in the Champions League where the owners want success, explaining why PSG paid a staggering £50m for David Luiz, who won the trophy with Chelsea in 2012. ‘To be clear -- the players I want, I'll have them,’ Al-Khelaifi had also said. Luiz joins Marquinhos, who moved from Roma last summer, in a rather costly Brazilian centre back pairing. Such a purchase may seem to fly in the face of the financial regulations but it should be their only large cash signing this window. A different method beckons. Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier has signed from Toulouse on a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent, circumventing the transfer cap for this season. A similar arrangement could also bring Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Madrid to Paris. Yohan Cabaye, signed for £20m from Newcastle in January, is another addition to the squad which started last season’s Champions League with a 4-1 win at Olympiacos. Even more domestic success: Ibrahimovic lifts the French season-opening Champions Trophy in Beijing . Back in business: After a summer with no World Cup the Sweden striker is back in form at his club . Desire: Cavani wants to play a central role but Ibrahimovic's presence makes it difficult for the Argentine .

In action: Serge Aurier has arrived at the club on loan after a good World Cup with the Ivory Coast . 2010-11: Europa League round of 16 - lost 2-1 to Benfica . 2011-12: Europa League group stage - finished third behind Athletic Bilbao and Red Bull Salzburg on goal difference . 2012-13: Champions League quarter final - lost on away goals (3-3) to Barceloba . 2013-14: Champions League quarter final - lost on away goals (3-3) to Chelsea . The conundrum for Blanc was always how to fit £53m man Edinson Cavani with star performer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who cost £31m in 2012. The Uruguayan was upset at playing out wide while the Swede plundered 40 goals in all competitions and has been consistently linked with a move away. Cavani, who scored 16 league goals in his debut campaign, said last week that he would be staying but he added: ‘It is important for an attacker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows what my position is and there is no point talking about it again.’ Ibrahimovic will see this as an important season too however. He turns 33 in October and perhaps this is his final opportunity to win the trophy he and his club covet most. He scored both PSG goals against Guingamp to win France’s curtain-raising Champions Trophy in Beijing last weekend – one a long-range screamer – and in a poll for L’Equipe, 65 per cent said he would be the top scorer for the third year running.

But despite all the silverware that had followed Qatari gold, Ibrahimovic knows the main objective. ‘To do better than last season,’ he said. ‘We had a fantastic season winning three trophies. We are focused on keeping this project growing and moving forward. ‘There is pressure on us but the players who are here are used to that. To say that we are a great team is not enough. We have to prove it on the field.’ PSG start the season on Friday night with a match away at Reims but Luiz, Thiago Silva and Maxwell have not featured in pre-season following the World Cup, and Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi and Ezequiel Lavezzi are also behind schedule. ‘The beginning of the season is as complicated as it was last season,’ said Blanc. ‘We will try not to give up too many points on the road but I'm happy with what the players have done so far.’ To be truly satisfied, success further afield must follow.

"By . Joe Bernstein . UEFA chief Michel Platini is determined to ban clubs from European competitions in 12 months if they continue to stick two fingers up at financial fair play regulations – causing further problems for the toxic Qatar brand. Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City and Qatari-owned Paris St Germain have already been punished with a heavy fine and squad reduction after running up excessive losses. Platini is now prepared to push through the ultimate sanction – exclusion from the Champions League – for repeat offenders. Watching: Michel Platini is determined to ban clubs from European competitions if they ignore FFP rules . Punished: Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour was found in breach of the FFP regulations . Significantly, he has the backing of many of Europe’s leading clubs including Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United who argue spending should fall in line with revenue. Ironically, Europe’s governing body are not expecting further problems with City, whose owner Sheikh Mansour is working hard on cutting losses. City reported losses of £51.6m in their latest set of financial figures in January which broke Uefa’s £37million threshold, but it was greatly reduced from the previous year’s deficit of £97.9m. But Paris St Germain, Qatar Sport Investment, a venture of the Qatari government, have incensed Platini and other Uefa bigwigs by completing the £48milion signing of David Luiz from Chelsea while they were being warned about their over-spending. It is seen within the game’s governing body as deliberately provocative and is leading to a resolve that they will punish Paris more severely unless they take heed of Uefa’s wishes. Qatar is already under huge international scrutiny following allegations that they used bribery as a tool to be awarded the 2022 World Cup. Too far: PSG have incensed Platini by signing Chelsea's David Luiz for £48million during over-spending row . City and Paris were each fined £49million by Uefa last month, £32million of which was suspended, after failing financial fair play rules. In addition, they can only name a 21-man Champions League squad next season instead of he usual 25, and can spend only £49million net in transfers in this window, and not increase the club’s overall wage bill. A senior source said: ‘There is a perception that Platini doesn’t want to take Paris St Germain on because they are a French club. ‘But the reality is he and others are fuming at the way they seem to be carry on spending despite already being fined. There is a real resolution within Uefa and among the other clubs to impose a Champions League ban on any club that carries on playing outside the rules.’ Qatar have spent millions trying to gain respectability through football, sponsoring Barcelona among other clubs as well as buying Paris and winning a vote to host the World Cup. But the game's rulers are now aware of a public backlash against a perception of Qatar ""buying"" football and are determined not to allow Paris to outspend other clubs.

"By . Press Association . Dessie Quinn, 43, . was found dead in bed by a friend in the early hours of yesterday morning . An Irishman who was feared infected with Ebola after dying in bed in Donegal following his return from the outbreak zone in West Africa did not have the virus. Dessie Quinn, 43, was being treated for malaria after returning two weeks ago from the west African country and was found dead in bed by a friend in the early hours of yesterday. Medics ordered blood tests following a post-mortem investigation into his sudden death amid fears he may have been suffering from the incurable Ebola. The Quinn . family said they had been kept in the dark and were not notified of . health chiefs' concerns before a statement on the precautionary . investigation was released to national media in Ireland yesterday. The . agency said: 'The Health Service Executive (HSE) has confirmed that . laboratory test samples for an individual, who had recently returned . from Africa, has proved negative for Ebola virus. 'Infection control procedures, which had been put in place as a precautionary measure, will now be stepped down. 'The HSE expressed its condolences to the individual's family and friends for their loss.' Parish priest Father Adrian Gavigan said the family were given no information about fears over the Ebola virus before a statement was issued to national media last night. 'It was told to the public, it was not told to the family,' he said. 'Truthfully I was angry. When I heard this report I went back down to the family home for the very reason that you'd wonder what are they thinking when they hear this. 'The family told me that they had no word at all from the Health Service Executive that this is what is being investigated. They could see I was pretty angry.' Fr Gavigan added: 'I am amazed by the approach. It is distracting for the family and it worsens their grief.' Mr Quinn, . the father of a five-year-old boy, was working with telecoms firm KN . Network Services in the west African country, where his brother Martin . had also been based. The company had brought all expatriate staff out of Sierra Leone as a precaution following the outbreak of Ebola. The . World Health Organisation has put the number of people infected with . the deadly virus at 2,473. Some 1,350 have died since the disease was . identified in Guinea in March and spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and . Nigeria. Ebola . virus:  An Irishman who was feared infected with Ebola after dying in . bed in Donegal following his return from the outbreak zone in West . Africa did not have the virus, health chiefs have confirmed . Ebola has no cure and rigorous quarantine measures are used to stop its spread, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with sufferers. Mr Quinn, whose girlfriend and son live in Dublin, had returned to his family home in Doorin, Mountcharles, Donegal, to spend time with relatives and friends. Although he was being treated for malaria on his return, he was not an inpatient in hospital and was well enough to be out socialising with friends in the evenings before he died. He had gone to bed at a friend's house on Wednesday night after complaining of feeling unwell. Health chiefs are expecting the results of blood tests later today following a post-mortem examination at Letterkenny General Hospital. Mr Quinn's body remains there, isolated in the mortuary. The Health Service Executive said it is investigating the death for suspected links to Ebola as a precaution and  that the risk of transmission is considered to be 'extremely low'. It also said that appropriate infection control procedures have been put in place in the community as a precaution. A Chinese doctor works at a clinic in Freetown, Sierra Leone: Mr Quinn, an engineer, had been working with telecoms firm KN Network Services in the west African country, where his brother Martin had also been based . Scores of locals in the townland of Doorin called at the family home throughout the day yesterday to offer condolences, and relatives  were not informed of any restrictions or precautionary measures. Dr Darina O'Flanagan, head of the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, said someone would have to be in very close personal contact with an infected individual or their body fluids for there to be any risk. 'We await the outcome of the laboratory tests before we will know whether or not this individual had contracted Ebola virus disease,' she said. 'The appropriate public health guidelines are being followed at every stage in this process as a precaution.' Mr Quinn's brother Martin had also worked in Sierra Leone for a number of years but left before the start of the year. It is understood the engineer told people he was tested for the Ebola virus on leaving the west African country. He has nine brothers, two of whom are returning from Australia for the funeral, and three sisters, one of whom has come home from New York. KN Network Services issued a statement expressing its deepest sympathies. 'Dessie was an extremely hard-working and valued member of staff and was very popular with all his colleagues and he will be missed by everybody who worked with him,' the company said. The firm said it has offered support to the family in Donegal and is liaising with Mr Quinn's colleagues from Sierra Leone about the necessary support, updates, precautions and company contacts ahead of the blood test results. 'KNNS have also had ongoing contacts and discussions with HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The company had already returned all their staff from Sierra Leone as a precaution,' the firm said. It is understood the family are hoping to get the results of the blood tests at around midday. The HSE declined to comment on when the checks would be completed or when information would be passed on to the family and the public. Relatives, friends and neighbours gathered at the home in Doorin late last night and Mr Quinn's friend, who was with him in the hours before he was found dead, was also at the house. Later, in a statement, the HSE insisted it maintained close contact with the Quinn family following the death and only issued the statement on the back of media reports. 'The HSE was in contact with some family members from the outset of the tragic situation yesterday,' a spokeswoman said. 'The story broke in the media just before 6pm yesterday at which point the HSE had to make a public statement on the matter, given the urgency and nature of a public health issue such as this. 'The HSE has expressed its sincere condolences to the family for their loss.' KN Networks Services said all its remaining staff in Sierra Leone were removed from the country last Saturday and were screened for Ebola on their departure. There were no positive tests or signs of symptoms for the disease, a company spokesman said.","Dessie Quinn was being treated for malaria after his return from Africa .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Botox injections could provide an effective new treatment for stomach cancer, research has shown. The rejuvenating anti-wrinkle treatment used by numerous celebrities slows tumour growth by blocking nerve signals that stimulate cancer stem cells. In laboratory tests, Botox - made from the toxin of botulism bacteria - proved 'highly effective' at suppressing gastric cancer in mice. The promising results have led to the launch of an early clinical trial involving human patients with stomach cancer in Norway. Botox injections could provide an effective new treatment for stomach cancer, as scientists found the anti-wrinkle treatment slows tumour growth . Locally administered Botox mirrored the effect of 'vagotomy' - surgical removal of branches of the gastric vagus nerve, which regulates processes linked to digestion. U.S. lead researcher Dr Timothy Wang, from Columbia University Medical Centre in New York, said: 'Scientists have long observed that human and mouse cancers contain a lot of nerves in and around the tumour cells. 'We wanted to understand more about the role of nerves in the initiation and growth of cancer, by focusing on stomach cancer. 'We found that blocking the nerve signals makes the cancer cells more vulnerable - it removes one of the key factors that regulate their growth.' Botox prevents nerve cells releasing a neurotransmitter - a chemical signal - called acetylcholine. In cosmetic treatments, blocking acetylcholine reduces wrinkles by temporarily paralysing face muscles. The neurotransmitter is also known to stimulate cell division, hence the link to cancer. Co-author Professor Duan Chen, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'The anti-cancer effects were remarkable, especially with local vagotomy or by injecting Botox. 'It actually surprised us. The finding that Botox was highly effective was particularly exciting.' He added: 'We believe this treatment is a good treatment because it can be used locally and it targets the cancer stem cells. 'The Botox can be injected through gastroscopy (a thin tube passed through the mouth to the stomach) and it only requires the patient to stay in the hospital for a few hours.' Botox injections were less toxic than most standard cancer treatments, caused hardly any side effects, and were relatively cheap, said the scientists. However, they pointed out that combining nerve-targeting treatment with traditional chemotherapy may be the most effective approach. Botox slows tumour growth by blocking the nerve signals that stimulate cancer stem cells. The promising results in mice has prompted a new clinical study using human participants in Norway . Tests showed that removing the nerve signals not only had a direct effect, but also made cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapy drugs. In mice, the combination of Botox and chemotherapy boosted survival rates by up to 35% compared with chemotherapy alone. The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, focused on early-stage stomach cancer. 'In the future, we'd really like to look at how we can use this method of targeting nerves to stop the growth of more advanced tumours,' said Dr Wang. His laboratory hopes to develop drugs that block the receptor molecules on the surfaces of tumours that are sensitive to acetylcholine. This could be more effective than either surgery or Botox in more invasive cancers, since it would seek out cells that have broken away from the main tumour. Other solid tumours, such as prostate cancer, may have their growth stimulated by similar nerve signals, say the scientists. But more research was needed to identify the nerves involved, which were expected to vary between different organs and tumour types.","Anti-wrinkle treatment used by celebrities found to slow tumour growth .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Climbing up the walls and splashing in the water, these brown bear cubs were the main attraction at this year's Enstone Country Show. It seemed like delightful summer entertainment. But the quaint fair in Oxford has been accused of animal cruelty for caging up the three wild cubs. Animal cruelty? Activists have condemned Enstone Show for caging up three wild brown bear cubs . Get me out of here! The cubs climbed up the railings  after organisers decided to go ahead despite protests . Hundreds of families flock to the Enstone Fair in Oxfordshire every year for a fun fair, food market, and animal performances. However, this summer animal rights activists have sent more than 2,000 emails to organisers to condemn the 'cruel' display of the animals from eastern Europe. The trio of cubs were loaned by Amazing Animals, a company which trains animals for film, television and circuses. Last year, the firm was embroiled in a row with animal protection societies footage emerged of their lion cubs performing in a Japanese circus. Condemning their inclusion at the event, Animal Defenders International (ADI) and the Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS) urged followers to ambush the event and email their complaints to the organisers. One of the shows organisers made a complaint to the police after receiving abusive emails and comments on social media. Performers: The bears were loaned by Amazing Animals, which trains pets for film, television and circuses . Innocent entertainment? The bears were the main attraction at the Oxfordshire event splashing around . Last night, on the eve of the show, organisers said the brown bear cub was still set to appear through television handlers Amazing Animals as well as all the other planned stalls and events. One of the organisers Kate Farquhar-Thomson said she had she had received more than 600 emails and had felt harassed because of the communications. 'Amazing Animals, who are bringing the bears along, are a perfectly professional company. We will be continuing with the event as normal,' she said. 'The bear cubs are not for entertainment they are for education. 'Some of the messages have been abusive but I'm trying not to take it personally.' A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed a complaint had been made but that the communications did not amount to threats. 'We have given appropriate advice to the complainant,' said the spokesman. 'If anything arises tomorrow we will attend and deal with it.' Popular: Hundreds of families flock to Enstone every year, and this year they clamoured to see the cubs . Defence: Organisers said the bears were there for education not for entertainment . ADI Group president Jan Creamer said: 'Using wild animals for entertainment may appear harmless, but it is certainly no fun for animals like bears who are highly intelligent and have very specialised needs.' The Captive Animals' Protection Society (CAPS) were tweeting supporters to turn up to the event to protest. 'Anyone in the #Oxfordshire area available to take part in peaceful demo against wild animal use at #enstoneshow on Sat 23, pls DM #circusban,' CAPS tweeted. Vicki Morton tweeted '#enstoneshow @kateft Please, please do not exploit a bear cub at your show. Not acceptable in 2014.' Babs Fitzgerald tweeted; '@kateft #EnstoneShow - Please cancel use of bear cub at your event! Wild animals do not belong in cruel captivity for human entertainment!' Anger: Activists claimed the animals have very specific needs and cannot be caged up as they were . The European Brown Bear cubs are being supplied by Chipping Norton firm Amazing Animals, which trains animals for television and film and has provided circuses with animals. Owner Jim Clubb refuted ADI's claims saying 'Chipping Norton Veterinary Hospital, and our film vet is the former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. 'He will be attending on Saturday. 'There will be three young bears who at no time will be touched or petted by members of the public. 'We have annually supplied young animals for this event to support our local community and resent being judged by radical groups like ADI.' Animals including camels, reptiles, spiders and lions have previously appeared at the show.","Three wild brown bear cubs displayed in cage at Enstone Annual Show .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A British Gas customer today slammed the company after it took nearly £17,000 from his bank account when it accidentally overcharged him on his monthly bill. Businessman Oliver Wotherspoon, 32, returned from holiday earlier this month to find that the energy giant had mistakenly charged him 100 times more than usual - and that they had taken the astronomical sum directly from his company account. Mr Wotherspoon, whose energy bills normally cost £150 a month, was told that the error occurred after an 'incorrect meter reading' - but the company still refused to give his money back. Scroll down for video . Businessman Oliver Wotherspoon, 32, returned from holiday to find that British Gas had mistakenly charged him 100 times more than usual - and that they had taken the sum directly from his company bank account . Eventually Mr Wotherspoon had to contact a solicitor who demanded the firm return the £16,670.57. It was returned to Mr Wotherspoon’s account after an 11 day legal stand-off. Normally Direct Debit users are protected . by a guarantee which means if an error was made, the account holder is . entitled to a full refund paid by the bank or building society. However, . Mr Wotherpoon's bank said the figure went above the amount protected by . the guarantee. Mr Wotherspoon, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who runs a company which makes play areas for schools said: 'I’ve built up business from scratch through blood sweat and tears and yet a big bully company like British Gas can come along and taken away my cash flow. 'It was blatantly obvious the bill was wrong yet they took my money without of any thought of what such a giant transaction might do. 'Thankfully I did have some reserve funds to dip into so that money was able to keep things going but we are two weeks behind on jobs. 'If British Gas had held onto the money any longer, I would have had to put everything on hold for considerably longer. It was a massive worry and all of a sudden our guys were panicking that they may not be paid. The bill shows Mr Wotherspoon's account after British Gas refunded £16,670.57. A spokesman said: 'Unfortunately we applied an incorrect meter reading to his account which meant he received a large bill' 'Getting the wrong bill is one thing but the physical taking of the cash from my account is another. As far as I’m concerned British Gas are hypocrites when keep going on about looking after their customers. 'What they did is an absolute joke, they haven’t contacted me once to say sorry.' The incident occurred on August 4 while the father-of-two was on holiday in Majorca with his wife Tamsin, 32, expecting his regular £150 bill to be taken out by direct debt. He added: 'We came back all jolly until I opened up the bill from British Gas. Initially I just burst out laughing and literally pointed at the figure and said ""god they have got that a bit wrong"" - then I saw the direct debit date and saw that it was that day. 'I logged onto the banking and saw that it had been taken out and immediately I just started to panic. 'When I called them up I was put through to customer services but they wouldn’t let me speak to a manager. They were really unapologetic that they had made a mistake. 'I said I wanted my money back immediately but they said they weren’t authorised to return it. The whole process was taking up vital time and in this time I was worrying thinking how am I going to pay for materials and the guys each week. 'Every day I was waking up thinking ""they have got almost £17k of my money"". 'I have three employees and I have up to 10 others working for me day in day out so it’s a lot of money going out. I need the money back fast. 'I had to slow the process right down, slow down buying materials until I got it back. It was only when I got a solicitor on the case that they started jumping and gave us the money back. British Gas hasn’t made any effort to contact me. 'Every time I called them they said they hadn’t started the process of the claim. It was an absolute farce, I was just passed from pillar to post. ' Mr Wotherspoon, who has since cancelled his direct debit and said he will pay by cash in future, added: 'British Gas said there was three meters in the workshop and the guy who read them got confused and read them wrong, it was human error - but it left me with an astronomical bill. 'I’m always really careful with my money, the way I built up the business and that’s what I pride myself on. I’m proud to say I don’t have any credit cards I don’t have any debts and I’ve always had money there to pay my guys and I’ve worked hard to get here. 'I have got the money back but its been a nightmare and I would like a hand-written apology. I just feel like the ""big boys"" are pushing round the small fry.' British Gas refunded the £16,670.57 on August 15, and said that although it did apologise to Mr Wotherspoon initially, it should have contacted Mr Wotherspoon’s bank when the issue was raised on August 4. A spokesman said: 'We are very sorry we sent a large bill to Mr Wotherspoon. Unfortunately we applied an incorrect meter reading to his account which meant he received a large bill. 'We should have provided a refund at the time including any associated costs. We will contact Mr Wotherspoon to apologise for distress and inconvenience caused.'","Oliver Wotherspoon, from Bolton, spends £150 a month on energy bills .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Early modern humans had already developed distinct cultural traditions before they left North Africa. Researchers carried out the largest ever comparative study of stone tools  between 130,000 and 75,000 years old to shed new light on our ancestors. The tools, discovered in the region between sub-Saharan Africa and Eurasia,  were made in different ways, reflecting a diversity of cultural traditions. Researchers carried out the largest ever comparative study of stone tools dating between 130,000 and 75,000 years old to shed new light on our ancestors. A collection of prehistoric tools are pictured . A new study also identified at least four distinct populations, each relatively isolated from each other with their own different cultural characteristics. It also suggests that early populations took advantage of rivers and lakes that criss-crossed the Saharan desert. A climate model coupled with data about these ancient rivers was matched with the new findings on stone tools to reveal that populations connected by rivers had similarities in their cultures. This could be the earliest evidence of different populations ‘budding’ across the Sahara, using the rivers to disperse and meet people from other populations, according to the paper published in the journal, Quaternary Science Reviews. Researchers from the University of Oxford, Kings College London and the University of Bordeaux took over 300,000 measurements of stone tools from 17 archaeological sites across North Africa. They combined the data about the tools with the environmental model for the first time, which showed that the Sahara was then a patchwork of savannah, grasslands and water, interspersed with desert. The new study also identified at least four distinct populations, each relatively isolated from each other with their own different cultural characteristics. It also suggests that early populations took advantage of rivers and lakes that criss-crossed the Saharan desert. An artist's impression of early humans is pictured . The study supports other recent theories that modern humans may have first successfully left Africa earlier than 60,000-50,000 years ago, Dr Eleanor Scerri said. Dr Huw Groucutt, from the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford, said: ‘The question of whether there was an early successful exit from Africa has become one of whether any of the populations discovered in this paper went in and out of Africa for some or all of this time. A crucial next step involves fieldwork in areas such as the Arabian Peninsula to understand how these populations spread into Eurasia.’ Ongoing fieldwork seeking to do just that is making ‘remarkable discoveries’ in the deserts of Arabia, which may also have been the region where both Neanderthal and Homo sapiens populations might have interacted, he explained. The team also mapped out known ancient rivers and major lakes so they could piece together where populations made and used their tools, according to the study, which is published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews. The results show, for the first time, how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the Sahara before forming small populations by the rivers. ‘This is the first time that scientists have identified that early modern humans at the cusp of dispersal out of Africa were grouped in separate, isolated and local populations,’ Dr Eleanor Scerri, visiting scholar at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study said. ‘Stone tools are the only form of preserved material culture for most of human history. In Africa, owing to the hot climate, ancient DNA has not yet been found. ‘These stone tools reveal how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the Sahara just before they left North Africa. While different populations were relatively isolated, we were interested to find that when connected by rivers, they share similarities in their tool-making suggesting some interaction with one another.’ The researchers used a variety of tests in order to rule that tools from different areas were culturally distinct simply because of differences in raw materials. The tools, discovered in the region between sub-Saharan Africa and Eurasia -  including the desert (marked on the map) - were made in different ways, reflecting a diversity of cultural traditions . The study looking at different types of tools, has for the first time shown how early populations of modern humans dispersed across the Sahara before forming small populations by the rivers . Dr Scerri said: ‘Not much is known about the structure of early modern human populations in Africa, particularly at the time of their earliest dispersals into Eurasia. ‘Our picture of modern human demography around 100,000 years ago is that there were a number of populations, varying in size and degree of genetic contact, distributed over a wide geographical area. ‘This model of our population history supports other theories recently put forward that modern humans may have first successfully left Africa earlier than 60,000-50,000 years ago, which had been the common view among scholars. ‘Our work provides important new evidence that sheds light on both the timing of early modern human dispersals out of Africa and the character of our interaction with other human species, such as Neanderthals.’","Researchers carried out the largest ever comparative study of stone tools dating between 130,000 and 75,000 years old .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Asia Parveen: Caused 57 injuries to the child and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by hormones . A Muslim woman who repeatedly beat a ten-year-old girl with a steel ladle for not reading enough verses of the Koran was jailed yesterday. Asia Parveen, who was five months pregnant at the time, left the child with 57 injuries and later claimed her violent outburst was prompted by  her hormones. The girl managed to escape when Parveen ran to her kitchen for a knife, and was found alone at a bus stop in the early hours of the morning. Parveen, 31, had argued with the girl on August 15 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court in London heard. She accused the girl of lying about how many verses of the Koran she had read while praying. She then hit the girl with the ten- inch ladle for 45 minutes and forced her to stand with her arms outstretched for four hours. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, escaped when Parveen went to fetch a knife which she brandished, saying she was going  to kill her. She was found four hours later, alone and in the cold at the bus stop, by police. Doctors identified 57 injuries, including marks on her arms, legs, elbows and head, when she was examined at hospital. Parveen, a former professional traditional dancer who had toured worldwide, had been fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan before  the attack. She was considered to be ‘immoral’ by some in the community in Pakistan for her former dancing career and so wanted the girl to take her religious duties seriously. Parveen, a mother of three, accepted causing some of the girl’s injuries with the ladle  but claimed that others must have happened when the girl ‘fell over’. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said: ‘The girl was praying from the Koran and Mrs Parveen accused her of lying about how many of the verses she had read. ‘She was ten at the time. Mrs Parveen took a metal spoon about ten inches in size and hit the child with it repeatedly, causing extensive bruising over both arms, her legs and head. ‘Mrs Parveen said she was going to kill the girl and ran to get a knife from the kitchen. ‘The girl had no alternative but to leave at around 10pm.’ Jailed: Asia Parveen launched 'a sustained and vicious attack' with a metal ladle . Jailing Parveen, who is now divorced, . for nine months, Judge Martyn Zeidman ignored pleas in a letter from the . child victim to spare her jail. He . said: ‘You need to understand that this was outrageous behaviour and if . you ever attack a child again, you will go to prison for very much . longer. 'Of course the injuries itself were . not life-threatening but there were so many of them and the pictures and . the body plan prepared by the paediatrician demonstrate there were 57 . injuries. ‘Having a very young baby should not be seen as a get out of jail card.’ Parveen, who lives in Hackney, East . London, admitted a single count of child cruelty after initially . insisting she had used the spoon only once or twice on the girl’s arms . and bottom. During further court proceedings, she . admitted in a second plea that she had lost her temper after feeling . ‘hormonal’, ‘isolated’ and ‘ashamed’. She claimed the other injuries had been the result of the girl falling over. She also denied threatening to kill the ten-year-old or picking up a knife. Parveen, who was told the verdict by her Punjabi interpreter, collapsed in the dock while being led down to the cells by guards.","Asia Parveen, 31, inflicted 57 separate injuries during attack .

"By . Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail . UKIP’s policy chief Tim Aker said he was too 'scared' to cut the cost of public sector pensions . UKIP’s policy chief has admitted he is too ‘scared’ to confront Britain’s public sector pensions black hole. Tim Aker, head of the party’s policy unit said he had looked into public sector pensions, adding ‘I have, and then got very scared and ran away.’ His comments came in an interview with Prospect magazine in which he revealed the party’s manifesto would include a vast array of tax cuts. Ukip would, he said abolish income tax for anyone paying the minimum wage, and increase the point at which people can earn before paying 40p in every pound they earn. This would rise from the current £41,865 to £45,000. And he said the party would abolish the 45p rate for those earning £150,000 or more, adding: ‘We are for flatter, simpler and lower taxes. He said the party’s proposals would make people’s lives easier and help them ‘just get on and feel more comfortable’. But the party will face question marks about how it intends to pay for all the tax cuts, which initial estimates suggested could cost £20billion or more. His comments on public sector pensions will also raise questions about whether the party is serious about dealing with big problems the country faces. Later in the interview he appeared to change tack, saying the party ‘haven’t looked into’ the public sector pensions problem. The cost of public sector pensions to taxpayers is expected to rise to up to £1,600 a year within the next decade. Around £4 in every £5 paid out in generous public sector schemes is accounted for by taxpayer funding because public sector workers’ contributions will not cover payments. Mr Aker said that despite all the tax cuts proposed, Ukip intends to cut the budget deficit. He said the party would cut foreign aid and abolish the Climate Change Act. It will not propose an increase in the retirement age. Overall he said the party would fight on a ‘blue-collar platform’ of aspiration. In addition, the party would restrict child benefit to two children and stop migrants claiming any benefits until they have been earning and paying tax and national insurance for five years. Nick Clegg and George Osborne have both attempted to take credit for the Government's decision to increase the personal tax threshold to £10,500. The Lib Dems and UKIP have announced they want this to rise to £12,500 by 2020 . He said higher benefits would be available for those who have contributed but who lose their jobs. ‘There will be an offer for people who have paid in to the pot and find themselves for a considerable amount of time unemployed – higher jobseekers’ allowance. ‘We are prioritising people who work and pay into the pot instead of people who have made a living out of having children so that they can get more benefits and a bigger house.’ Mr Aker is UKIP MEP for the Eastern Counties and prospective candidate for Thurrock in Essex at the General Election.","Tim Aker said he looked into public sector pensions and 'got very scared'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Famous composers including Debussy and Franz Liszt have written music about clouds. But now clouds can create their own piece of music, with help from an American artist who has engineered a smart piano. Musical compositions based on the density, speed and shape of the clouds are played on the hi-tech instrument, which relies on a robot to press down the keys. A piece of music is composed based on the density, speed and shape of the clouds and is then played on a grand piano which has been modified with mechanical parts (pictured) hooked up to a computer . David Bowen is often inspired by the elements. He previously engineered works of art such as ‘Underwater’. For that installation, he used a Microsoft Kinect sensor to collect data about the movements of a river, which was simulated on a grid of ropes including 486 servo motors, hung from the ceiling. The motors recreated the rippling motion of the river on the ropes, which when viewed from underneath, looked like the motion of the ocean. An art installation called Cloud Piano records the movement of clouds in the sky, which are then cut into 88 segments by a computer programme called Max/MSP, Quartz reported. The segments correspond to keys on the grand piano. The computer programme analyses the appearance of the clouds pictured in each of the pieces of the sky, artist David Bowen explained. This information is sent to a robot that plays the keys of a grand piano ‘based on the movements and shapes of the clouds,’ according to the artist's blog. An art installation called Cloud Piano uses a camera (pictured) to take pictures of the sky. From this information, a discordant melody is created . It does this by pressing the keys at different speeds and pressures. ‘If a dense cloud is detected, the key is pressed hard,’ he told Quartz. ‘If it is a light cloud, the key is barely pressed at all. In this way, the intensity and speed at which the piano is played is determined by the intensity, speed, and shape of the clouds.’ According to the blog, ‘the system is set in motion to function as if the clouds are pressing the keys on the piano as they move across the sky and change shape. ‘The resulting sound is generated from the unique key patterns created by ethereal forms that build, sweep, fluctuate and dissipate in the sky.’ The melodies created are largely discordant but are strangely calming, although a slight squeaking can be heard when the robotic 'fingers' press piano keys. The images are cut into 88 segments (pictured) by a computer programme called Max/MSP, which analyses the appearance of the clouds pictured in each of the pieces of the sky. They correspond to keys on the piano . Information about the cloud's appearance is sent to a robotic device (pictured) that presses keys on the grand piano 'based on the movements and shapes of the clouds'. This means that dense clouds are played loudly and light clouds are quiet . Cloud Piano will go on show at a gallery in Saint Etienne, France, next month. It is not his first kinetic, robotic work to be exhibited in a gallery, as Mr Bowen is well known for engineering works of art such as ‘Underwater’. For that installation, he used a Microsoft Kinect sensor to collect data about the movements of a river, which was simulated on a grid of ropes including 486 servo motors, hung from the ceiling. The motors recreated the rippling motion of the river on the ropes, which when viewed from underneath, looked like the motion of the ocean.","Music is composed based on the density, speed and shape of the clouds .

"By . Associated Press . and Mark Prigg . It was one of Google's most mysterious projects - a barge that was believed to be everything from a 'party barge' to a secret server farm cooled by sea water. However, Google today confirmed that at least one of its two barges is being scrapped. However, the firm has still not revealed exactly what they were supposed to be for. Fish fins: The vessel in San Francisco will have sails made to resemble 'fish fins' to remind visitors that they are on a 'seaworthy vessel' although the barge itself will be powered by large diesel motors . A barge built with four levels of windowed shipping containers is seen docked at a pier on Treasure Island in San Francisco. It was later moved to Stockton. google confirmed today one of the two barges will be scrapped. The barge carries dozens of old shipping containers that were joined to create a four-story building. Google envisioned it as one of three floating retail stores. ‘A floating data center? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur? 'Sadly, none of the above,’ a Google spokesman said following huge interest in the structures when they were first spotted last year. ‘Although it’s still early days and things may change, we’re exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.’ MailOnline got up close to one of the barges in California and was able to get a better idea of the floating vessel. Speculation was rampant over what the barges will be used for - with the two most likely reasons being floating showroom 'party boats' to market Google Glass or data centers that can be cooled by sea water. Inside: Google hopes to turn the four story barges into tourist attractions, housing atriums, 'welcoming areas', exhibition spaces and 'support facilities' Google's barge up close: One of the two barges will be scrapped, Google said today. Such is the level of secrecy surrounding the project - said to be overseen by Google founder Sergey Brin himself and his Google X team - even members of the Coast Guard have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements along with the teams of engineers and welders who have been working there. The Portland Press Herald says an international company is buying the barge and taking it on an ocean voyage. The barge was originally spotted in San Franciso's Treasure Island, and later moved to Stockton. A second, identical barge is in Portland- and will now be ripped apart. Portland Harbor's deputy harbor master says the containers will be disassembled and scrapped. The barge first docked in Portland Harbor in October and moved to South Portland Wednesday. A Portland city spokeswoman says the city received $400,000 in state reimbursements while it docked there. Google initially had little to say about the barges, leading to speculation about its intentions. It later revealed they were to be stores. The second is still moored in Stockton, California.","Barge was subject of mystery when Google refused to reveal what it was for .

Islamist militant group Boko Haram - a . sect which has condemned the use of Western medicine - has been blamed for the attack. In the first attack in Kano the polio vaccinators were shot dead by gunmen who drove up on a motor tricycle, reported the BBC. Thirty minutes later gunmen targeted a clinic outside Kano city as the vaccinators prepared to start work. Previously religious clerics had some of their followers stop . receiving the vaccines saying that it would sterilise their children. Boko Haram wants . to impose Islamic law, or sharia, on a country of 160 million split . roughly equally between Christians and Muslims. The group has carried out a spate of assaults on security forces in the city in . recent weeks. Force: Alleged members of the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram - the group wants to impose Islamic law, or sharia, on a country of 160 million split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims . Despite The World Health Organisation’s international vaccination programme, the disease has never been eradicated and continues to attack children in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghnaistan. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 53 in 2012 according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. It has also re-appeared in Nigeria because of malicious rumours that the Western-donated vaccine is harmful, while a renewed threat to Europe has emerged from with eastern side of the continent. It is caused by a virus which attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is spread via human faeces and leads to muscle weakness and painful spasms, followed by paralysis and sometimes death when the lungs are affected. Post-polio syndrome is believed to affect at least eight out of ten of the survivors. Although the syndrome was first described by doctors in the Eighties, the scale of the problem is only just emerging, as more polio survivors live long enough to develop it. Polio has not been reported in Britain since the mid-Sixties, but there are a number of celebrity survivors, including actors Mia Farrow and Donald Sutherland, film director Francis Ford Coppola, celebrity academic David Starkey, and singers Judy Collins and Neil Young. Today's attack will be a further setback to efforts by global health organisations to eradicate polio in Nigeria, one of only three countries, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the disease remains endemic. In December gunmen in Pakistan shot dead aid workers running a U.N.-backed polio vaccination campaign. The killings were a major setback for a campaign that international health officials consider vital to contain the crippling disease but which Taliban insurgents say is a cover for espionage. Suspicion over the programme followed reports in 2011 that the CIA plotted a fake vaccination programme in Pakistan to snare Osama bin Laden's DNA. Agents had reportedly started the vaccine drive against hepatitis B in Abbottabad, where they believed the Al Qaeda leader was hiding out just before he was killed, according to Pakistan officials and local residents. Following the shootings the vaccination campaign was suspended indefinitely in the north-west tribal region of Pakistan - Quetta, Killa Abdullah and Pishin districts.","Islamist militant group Boko Haram been blamed .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The age of the smart home is well and truly upon us, but keeping track of all the different devices in a house can be difficult. That’s where Ninja Sphere comes in - the system is intended to monitor all aspects of a home and sync them with various devices. By tracking location and environment, the designers say Ninja Sphere can give the user intelligent control over a smart home. Scroll down for video . Sydney-based company is preparing to release a unified smart home device. The Ninja Sphere links different appliances in a home and controls them all. The central hub called a 'Spheramid' (shown) can be controlled by smartphones or gestures . - Be alerted if you have left home and left an appliance on, and easily turn it of, such as heaters or lamps. - See who is at home or away by detecting smartphones in the home. - See exactly where lost wallet and keys are located using a tag. - Be alerted if a valuable is being moved and you’re not at home, possibly suggesting an intruder is in the house. - Control of lights, media, and environment devices via natural gestures on top of the Spheramid. - Create ‘if this then that’ (IFTTT) style rules against presence, location or time such as: ‘If I’m on my way home and it’s cold outside turn on the heater.’ Australian company Ninja Blocks, based in Sydney, have now started accepting pre-orders for their Ninja Sphere system following a successful Kickstarter campaign, with delivery due in October this year. Using GPS, Zigbee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) it is able to detect devices and create a ‘map’ of them in a home. Through an app it can then sync with a phone or other devices to control them all. The brain of the entire system is the Spheramid, £180 ($305), which acts as a central hub for different devices in the home. Around the house the user then needs to place contact, motion and temperature sensors supplied by the company, known as ‘Smart Sockets’. There can be configured with other services such as Nest, Philips Hue and Dropcam. Tiny devices known as a Waypoints also need to be placed around the house, which will allow the Ninja Sphere to locate things. This means, for example, it could show you where pets are in the house if they have a small Bluetooth-enabled collar. Ninja Sphere an open source modified version of Ubuntu Linux to operate. Shown here is one of the potential uses for Ninja Sphere. By syncing with a Smartwatch and lights it can alert a user that their lights are still on and let them turn them off using several devices . One of the touted benefits is also that, using tags on certain items, it can detect when they are being moved and send an alert to the user (shown). This could indicate than an intruder is in the home, for example . Using a phone or smartwatch, the central Ninja Sphere hub can then control other aspects of a home. For example, while watching the TV Ninja Sphere could alert a user on-screen if their phone is ringing in another room, and even tell them where it is. Or while out of the house it could send a message to a phone that items are being moved while the owner is not there - suggesting an intruder might be in the home. The device also has gesture-recognition software so, for instance, by waving a hand over the device the volume of music in a room could be altered. Or simply tapping the device could turn lights on and off. It’s not especially cheap at the moment, however: It costs £180 ($305) for one Spheramid, in addition to the other sensors that are needed. And the company also recommends that at least one Spheramid is need for every floor of a home for it to work properly. Two per floor are needed if the house is especially big. ‘Your Ninja Sphere learns about you, and your environment,' says the company. 'It uses data from sensors and actuators to build a model that can inform you if something is out of place.’ ‘It can monitor temperature, lighting, energy usage, you and your pets' presence, and anything else you connect to your sphere. ‘By using data from your devices, environment, and location your sphere is able to advise you intelligently and give you control only when you need it.'

"By . Hugo Duncan Economics Correspondent . The Treasury raked in more than £1billion from stamp duty in a month for the first time since the financial crisis began, official figures showed yesterday. Some £1.09billion of the property tax was paid in July – the most since August 2007 – as a booming housing market swelled Government coffers. The surge in stamp duty receipts, the majority paid by families at a time of rapidly rising house prices, sparked fresh calls for the system to be reformed. Experts branded it ‘archaic’ and said stamp duty was ‘a strong contender for the worst designed tax’ in Britain. The bands have failed to increase in line with house prices, which some critics say has created a stealth tax. The amount of money raised by the Treasury from stamp duty soared under Labour, before falling off a cliff after the 2008 financial crash. It has now recovered to the pre-crisis peak . Despite the increased tax take from stamp duty, public borrowing has soared since 2000, when the Government ran a surplus . Others have attacked the way the levy rises in abrupt steps or ‘slabs’. Houses sold for up to £125,000 are exempt but properties costing just a penny more carry a 1 per cent stamp duty – which rises to 3 per cent on homes more than £250,000. The tax goes up to 4 per cent for houses worth more than £500,000, 5 per cent for over £1million and 7 per cent for over £2million. With house prices soaring by more than 10 per cent since last year, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of the levy. The Office for National Statistics said last month’s total stamp duty receipts were 23.5 per cent higher than in July 2013. From April to July this year, the tax raked in £3.8billion, or 37.7 per cent more than the same period in 2013. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to lift stamp duty thresholds to ease the burden on families moving home . In the year to June, there was £5.1billion generated in stamp duty from house sales, Nationwide said . Overall, £10billion was generated in taxes from property sales last year, close to the high reached before the 2008 crash . It has not earned the Treasury so much money since before the run on Northern Rock seven years ago plunged the economy into crisis. In March 2009, it was worth just £213million to the Exchequer. Two thirds of homebuyers are now forced to pay stamp duty. HMRC figures show a quarter of buyers are paying stamp duty of 3 per cent or more – up from just one in ten in 2003. Stuart Adam, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘It is a strong contender for the worst designed tax in the system. The slab structure is particularly ludicrous.’ The average UK house price is £265,000, attracting a levy of £7,950 when sold, while in London a typical home worth £499,000 would mean £14,970 in stamp duty. The Institute of Directors’ Stephen Herring said: ‘Significant reforms are overdue … to reflect property price increases.’ Jeremy Blackburn, of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said stamp duty was ‘an archaic tax structure’. A Treasury spokesman said the tax is ‘an important source of Government revenue’ that helps fund ‘essential services’. ÷ THE cost of an average home in parts of London is now £1.5million – 42 per cent higher than in 2008, property website Rightmove reveals today. But prices are up to 13 per cent below their pre-crisis peak in parts of the North.","Between April and July stamp duty receipts soared by 25%, figures reveal .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . It is the stage when a husband and wife finally have the chance to spend time together, free from the stresses and strains of working life. But far from being an era of relaxed contentment, retirement can be a stressful experience for couples. Many wives begin to suffer from ‘retired husband syndrome’ once their men give up work, academics have claimed. Scroll down for video . A new study suggests that wives suffer from ‘Retired Husband Syndrome’ when their husbands have given up work. Experts claim that women can suffer ‘stress, higher depression or inability to sleep’ once their husbands retire and arguments are common (file picture) They . discovered that nearly half of women complained of increasing levels of . stress, depression and sleeplessness after their other half retired. And . to make matter worse, the Italian researchers also found that with . every extra year the husband spent in retirement, the wife’s condition . became worse. They . said that the affliction does not only affect housewives, but can be . even worse for women who are still working while their husbands stay at . home. In 1984, an American researcher called Charles Johnson collected anecdotal evidence about RHS. Wives of retired men told him: ‘I’m going nuts’, ‘I want to scream’, ‘He’s under my feet all the time,’ ‘I’m nervous’, and ‘I can’t sleep’. His clinical description of the symptoms of the stress-induced conditions, included: headaches, depression, agitation, palpitations and lack of sleep. The new study supports his findings with empirical evidence. A BBC report suggested that over 60 per cent of older Japanese women are affected by the syndrome and there are soaring divorce rates. ‘We . have found that retirement effects are stronger for employed women, who . are already stressed by their job and have less time to comply with the . additional requests by their retired husbands,’ they said. Part of the cause of greater stress was that women were faced with an increase in housework, the authors reported. They also had to deal with the added burden of reduced income, an extra concern for both partners. The . research was carried out by social scientists Dr Marco Bertoni and Dr . Giorgio Brunello, from the University of Padova, who analysed interviews . with 840 Japanese women between 2008 and 2013. They chose Japan because the country is thought to have strong traditional gender roles. But . the researchers said their results could apply to many countries, . because the effect was even more pronounced when both partners had . worked. They gave each woman a retired husband syndrome ‘score’ depending on the extent of their emotional problems. They found that for every extra year the husband spent in retirement, the score increased by 6 to 14 percentage points. The . authors, writing in the Institute for the Study of Labor journal, said: . ‘After a life apart and progressive estrangement, many Japanese couples . are forced to start spending time together when the husband retires. ‘This . can be a very stressful experience for wives, who suddenly have to face . the continuous presence of a stranger in the house and the additional . burden of his requests.’ The scientists said that the condition does not only affect housewives, but in fact can be even worse for women who have been working for years . They . found that 47 per cent of wives reported emotional problems when their . husbands had retired – 41 per cent were more stressed, 23 per cent said . they were depressed and 16 per cent had experienced sleeping problems. The theory of retired husband syndrome was first established 30 years ago by US doctor Charles Clifford Johnson. Wives . of retired men told him, ‘I’m going nuts’, ‘I want to scream’, or ‘he’s . under my feet all the time’, he wrote in 1984. His theory gained much . attention, but the new study is the first to demonstrate it is true on a . large scale. Dr Bertoni and Dr Brunello said their evidence showed retirement could be tough for men too. And as their mental health and moods declined, life in turn became yet harder for their wives. ‘The . estimated effects are almost identical among both partners, suggesting . that concern with the “retired husband syndrome” should not be limited . to wives, as both partners are affected,’ they wrote.","Experts claim women with RHS suffer stress, depression and insomnia .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Ireland's former prime minister Albert Reynolds has died at the age of 81. He served as taoiseach for just under three years, from February 1992 to January 1993 and again from January 1993 to December 1994. Representing the Fianna Fáil party, he played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process and is best known as one of the architects of the historic Downing Street Declaration of 1993. Reynolds retired from politics in 2002 and developed Alzheimer's disease in later life. Ireland's former prime minister Albert Reynolds, who served as taoiseach in the 1990s, has died aged 81 . He was born in 1932 and grew up in the small village of Roosky in Co Roscommon. He later abandoned a sensible job and set up a dance hall empire with his brother Jim to capitalise on the big craze of the 1950s and 60s. After turning to politics, he was first elected to Dail Eireann for the Longford/Westmeath constituency in 1977 for Fianna Fail and was appointed a government minister just two years later. He was elected Ireland's eighth taoiseach in 1992 and worked with then-prime minister John Major, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and then-SDLP leader John Hume to try to deliver stability to the north. The Downing Street Declaration, which Mr Reynolds co-signed with Mr Major on December 15, 1993, paved the way for an IRA ceasefire in 1994, which in turn led loyalist paramilitaries to declare an end to terrorism, and laid the foundations for the eventual signing of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Mr Adams recently claimed that Mr Reynolds brought a new dynamic to peace negotiations and praised his 'directness' in addressing the potential for progress. One of Mr Reynolds's most famous achievements was  the Downing Street Declaration, which he signed with then-British Prime Minister John Major in 1993, paving the way for the Northern Ireland peace process . Mr Adams said: 'His wife Kathleen and their family welcomed me into their home and we enjoyed copious cups of tea during the ups and downs of that time. 'His was a relatively short term as taoiseach but Mr Reynolds ended exclusions, formal censorship and brought the Irish government in from the cold.' Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams expressed his condolences to the Reynolds family today, saying: 'I'm really sorry to hear of the death of Albert Reynolds. 'Albert acted on the North (of Ireland) when it mattered. My thoughts are with (his wife) Kathleen and all the Reynolds family. May he rest in peace.' Mr Reynolds resigned as leader of the party and as taoiseach in late 1994 following a dispute with Fianna Fail's then coalition partner, Labour. Mr Reynolds pictured with then-US president Bill Clinton on St Patrick's Day in March 1993 . In 1997, he suffered another political defeat in an internal Fianna Fail election to determine the party's presidential candidate. He was beaten by Belfast-born academic Mary McAleese, who went on to win the presidency and served as head of state for two terms. Mr Reynolds later retired from politics in 2002. Husband to Kathleen and father to seven children, the once busy businessman-turned-politician had since been enjoying his retirement. But his health became poor and in 2008 and, in December 2013, ill-health kept him away from the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Downing Street Declaration. That week, his son Philip revealed that Mr Reynolds was in the very last stages of Alzheimer's disease and in need of 24-hour care. At the end, he was unable to have conversations with people.

"By . John Hall . A Spanish tourist resort is trying out the idea of using dogs as lifeguards - and the idea is working so well it could catch on elsewhere. The experiment in the coastal town of San Pedro del Pinatar, in the southern province of Murcia, began when a human lifeguard started taking his pet Newfoundland out to sea with him, and found he was not only an incredibly strong swimmer, he was also able to pull a very large weight. Since then 'Bruno' has been employed full time as a lifeguard, assisting his owner David Alvarez on rescues and convincing the local coastguard to recruit more dogs to help patrol the area. On patrol: Bruno's webbed feet and ultra-buoyant coat make him a natural swimmer. He also boasts an ability to swim up to three miles without tiring and can drag a load of up to one and a half tonnes . When Mr Alvarez first purchased Bruno as a two-month-old puppy weighing only 15lbs, he didn't expect him to be anything more than a much-loved pet. But after taking him to the beach one day and allowing him to swim in the water, the lifeguard realised that his rapidly-growing canine friend might just have the potential to become a colleague. 'I just wanted a dog as a pet and had not . really thought about working with him in my job as a lifeguard, but . after I had him two weeks I took him with me to the sea and realised . what a fantastic swimmer he was,' Mr Alvarez said. Bruno's thick double layer of fur and webbed feet make him a natural swimmer, adding to his buoyancy and allowing him to cut through the water with ease. And in the searing heat of the Spanish summer, there is nothing black-furred Bruno loves more than to cool off with a dip in the sea. Hit: Bruno regularly accompanies David Alvarez (yellow T-shirt) on rescue missions in San Pedro del Pinatar. He has proved such a success that officials are now considering hiring more Newfoundland lifeguards . Although . Bruno is making front-page news in Spain, he is actually following a . long tradition of Newfoundland dogs being used for water rescue work. In . 1995 a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired man . from drowning in the Yuba River in Northern California. Boo . noticed the struggling man while he and his owner were walking by the . river. He instinctively jumped into the water, dragging the drowning man . to shore by holding on to his arm. According to Janice Anderson, the Newfoundland's breeder, Boo had received no formal training in water rescue and simply showed a natural ability for both swimming and saving lives. It's not just his talent for swimming that makes Bruno an ideal lifeguard. His incredible strength and stamina means he can easily swim three miles before getting tired and needing a rest. Mr Alvarez has also given Bruno a few strength tests and was shocked to discover he could quite happily drag water-filled plastic containers weighing up to one and half tonnes back to shore. With him showing all the assets of a natural lifeguard, it wasn't long before Bruno started accompanying Mr Alvarez on rescues - testing whether he could do in a life-or-death situation what he was easily capable of while fooling around with his owner. The results were unsurprisingly positive, with Bruno easily capable of dragging a drowning - and often panicking - person back to the shore with the minimum of fuss. 'If I . rush out to rescue someone and there is a second person with them, then . Bruno can carry one of them and pull them to shore. Or if I get tired, . he can pull us both or we take turns at pulling the other person,' Mr . Alvarez said. 'I . wasn't sure if my employers go for it but after trials they really love . the idea, and now I think they are planning to get other lifeguard . dogs,' he added. Bruno . may be the first lifeguard rescue dog ever to be used in San Pedro del Pinatar, but it now looks as if he is unlikely to be the last.","Bruno the Newfoundland has incredible strength and swimming ability .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Dramatic video footage has been released which shows a lifeguard saving people from dangerous rip currents off a beach in Cornwall yesterday. A young body boarder and a swimmer in difficulty are both seen being pulled onto a board by a lifeguard who has paddled out to save them. The rescues took place yesterday on the popular beach resort of Chapel Porth in Cornwall and follow last week's dramatic rescue of a young boy at Crooklets Beach in Bude. The exhausted boy clambers onto the lifeguard's board after being pulled from the sea . Last week Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) lifeguard Joby Wolfenden-Brown picked up the screams of a young boy on his head-mounted GoPro and paddled out to save him. The latest footage from the helmet-mounted cameras of lifeguards captures a boy and then an older male swimmer grabbing the rescue board and clambering onto it before being paddled back to the beach. British coast deaths have reached record highs says the RNLI, which today launched a campaign, 'Respect the Water'. Death rates along Britain's coast last year were the highest in four years, says the organisation, which revealed that more people were killed at the coast last year than the numbers who died in cycling accidents. The RNLI lifeguard is seen at the rear of his lifesaving board encouraging the young boy to climb on . The lifeguard drops off the boy safely before turning and paddling out again to help someone else . This time it is an exhausted older male swimmer who is pulled on board . Figures show that 167 people died in water-related accidents , and a further 368 were rescued by lifeguard crews after getting into difficulties. As temperatures continue to soar and people take to the coasts for the school holidays, the RNLI stressed that people must focus on safety in and around the water. 'We really feel that that number is too high and we need to do something about it, said RNLI coastal safety manager Ross Macleod ahead of the campaign launch in Brighton today by England rugby player James Haskell.","Lifeguard paddles out to help swimmer and body boarder in difficulty .

He said: 'She went to follow me through the EU only lane but I pointed her towards the non-EU residents' line.' Jamie Kelly and the mystery woman, Katie Moreau, have made plans to meet again . Kelly waited outside passport control for about 10 minutes but Katie didn't emerge. He told TodayFM: 'See, I was so engrossed during the flight and being the gentleman that I am I didn't want to go to the toilet in front of this beautiful girl so I used the time I had at the passport control to nip to the loo.' Love at first flight: Jamie Kelly and Katie Moreau met on a Ryanair flight from Barcelona to Dublin . The online campaign eventually spread across the ocean to Canada, where one of Moreau's relatives saw the story and reached out to one of Kelly's friends to put the potential romance back in play. Moreau told CBC News she was 'surprised and flattered' when she learned the 'handsome Irishman' had launched an online campaign to find her. Jamie Kelly and Katie Moreau became separated when they arrived at passport control . She said: 'When I was on the plane I talked to him incessantly because I had just been travelling for two months in Italy and Spain and it was just so nice to be around English speaking people, plus I'm a talker. 'We had lots in common plus he was very easy on the eyes.' Her family and friends have been inundating her with messages after they caught wind of the campaign. She said: 'I find it very humorous because all my friends back home are losing their heads over it.' Kelly and Moreau have been chatting online and made plans to meet in person.","Jamie Kelly's friends launched the #loveatfirstflight campaign on his behalf .

"By . Helen Nicholson . Sir Richard Branson has waded into the row over term-time holidays in a blog post entitled ‘Let children travel the world’. In the post, the Virgin Atlantic boss says he ‘wholeheartedly’ supports parent Janice Skelcher who is campaigning for a judicial review of recent legislation that tightened the rules on term-time trips. Mrs Skelcher, 39, and her husband were prosecuted for taking their two children out of school to travel to Australia for three weeks in October last year. 'Grab it with both hands': Sir Richard Branson said travel was important for children and argued that parents should not be punished for taking a holiday during term-time if that was the only time they could afford it . Sir Richard wrote: ‘It is really important that kids spend as much time travelling and learning as possible, from a young age. ‘Travel is not always an option for everyone; for those who are fortunate enough to be able to travel, they should grab it with both hands. ‘If there is no other time when parents can afford - financially or time-wise - to take a holiday, they should not be punished for doing so during term.’ Referring to the fact that Mrs Skelcher had been ordered to pay £400 legal costs for removing her children from school without permission, he wrote: ‘Her circumstances - at the time she was caring for her mother who was terminally ill – were not taken into account. 'She argued that taking her children on holiday with her husband was necessary to give everyone a break and protect the mental health of her kids. ‘While it is obviously important that all children should have access to regular education, there is no reason why they cannot catch up when they return, and do extra work out of class.’ Mr Branson, who left school aged 16, said that increasing the flexibility for young people’s learning could only be a good thing and said he echoed Mrs Skelcher’s call for the government to give parents more support and greater flexibility. He wrote: ‘Letting children travel provides the opportunity for families to spend quality time with each other, something I have always found invaluable with my own family. Some of my happiest memories are of childhood holidays – some during term-time, some not.’ Family holiday: Janice Skelcher and her husband Ian took their two children to visit relatives in Australia . In her petition, Mrs Skelcher is . demanding a judicial review of the new regulations, and asks MPs ‘to . recommend that greater support and flexibility [are] allowed for parents . to enable them to more effectively care for their children’. She . claimed that her family’s three-week trip had to be during term time as . she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the . only time alternative care could be arranged. She . was prosecuted by Coventry City Council for taking her children out of . school and ordered to pay a £240 fine, which she refused on principle. The court imposed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered Mrs Skelcher to pay £400 costs. When . Mrs Skelcher was invited on a daytime TV show to discuss the case, the . council obtained an injunction preventing identification of the children . - in effect silencing her. Now . Mrs Skelcher has defied the gag and can be named under parliamentary . privilege after Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming provided details of the . case in a petition laid before the House of Commons. Mrs Skelcher, a former emergency call handler, said: ‘I am very angry because now I have a criminal record. ‘My . family circumstances mean that I had no choice but to take the children . away when I did – and there are many parents in the same position who . cannot take their children away in a period specified by school. ‘Any mother in my situation would do the same. I have not had one negative comment from the mums at the school gates. ‘The . law states that there have to be exceptional circumstances. Well, if it . is not caring for a terminally ill person with two primary school . children, then what is?’ Australia trip: Mrs Skelcher says the three-week trip had to be during term time as she is a full-time carer for her dying mother-in-law and that was the only time alternative care could be arranged . Coventry . council said it followed Department for Education guidance. It claimed: . ‘On this occasion the parents decided not to accept the penalty notice, . but the court’s verdict demonstrates that the council’s course of . action was correct.’ In . September, new legislation came into force ending a policy that allowed . schools to grant up to 10 days leave for family holidays and introducing bigger fines for parents who take their children out of school. Under the new rules, parents face fines of up to £120 for taking children out of school during term time without good reason. Failing . to pay risks a fine of up to £1,500 - or even jail - and pupils can only miss lessons in 'exceptional . circumstances', such as a family funeral. The Government recently published a Bill that would allow schools to set their own term dates. The . intention is to stagger holidays and drive down high summer prices that . prompt some parents to take their children out of school.","Janice and Ian Skelcher took their two children to visit family in Australia .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Jamaican rapper Shaggy has found an unlikely impersonator – in the form of a posh businessman from London. And now his biggest fan – Oliver Goss – has found worldwide fame after grandstanding his talents in the men’s toilets of The Boogaloo pub in Highgate. After his mates filmed him rapping along to the 2001 hit Angel featuring Rayvon, they uploaded the video to Facebook where it has been liked more than 115,000 times. Blond Mr Goss, who is sporting a suit complete with pocket hanky, is introduced to the camera when another man says: ‘We’ve found the best Shaggy impression in London.’ Another pal joins him and after an initially shaky start where they mumble along to the lyrics, the duo pick up momentum before launching into a fully blown rendition of the Noughties hit. When a man in a flat cap tries to enter the gents he stands no chance as the pair beatbox and cry out Shaggy’s trademark line ‘shabba’. 'You're me angel': Suited and booted Oliver Cox (right) raps along to Shaggy's hit in the gents . Mr Goss, who is a business consultant, has taken to Twitter to join in with the social media reaction. His twitter feed includes pictures of people playing polo, a variety of different coloured chinos, and a video of Boris Johnson. Despite some viewers being initially disappointed that the video was not an impersonation of Shaggy from the TV cartoon Scooby-Doo, the reaction was largely positive.

"By . Harriet Hernando . This is the heart-stopping moment a daredevil loses his balance on a sky-high building – and nearly falls to his death. The man, a 24-year-old called Sergey, is filmed doing a backflip but instead of landing squarely on his feet, his left foot misses the platform and he almost falls 150 metres to the ground below. But rather than crying over the close shave Sergey - who performed the stunt in Ashdod, Israel - laughs it off. And this isn’t his first brush with death. The man suffered concussion after flipping off a wall and landing on his head, and another time he broke his leg performing a stunt. And a well-known member of the parkour community, the Russian Pavel Kashin, died last year after performing the very same backflip on a 16-storey building. Parkour is a sport which developed from military obstacle training and involves getting from A to B in the most efficient way possible – without the use of safety equipment. Daredevil: Sergey, 24, stands atop a building in Ashdod, Israel. He is practicing parkour, a sport which involves climbing buildings with no safety equipment . Admiring the view: Sergey stands on a crane and takes in the sights over Ashdod, Israel . Sergey, who works in surveying, said: ‘I was scared, but fears keeps you from death. But with that, I feel great and ready to make the next flip.’ ‘Parkour is dangerous but life is dangerous. ‘There is a Tibetan saying – we do not know what will come before – tomorrow or new life. ‘In parkour you overcome the obstacles – both physically and mentally.’ Hanging in there: Sergey risks his life climbing buildings with no safety equipment. In the past he has broken his leg and suffered concussion after landing on his head . In pole position: Sergey walks across a pole between highrise buildings . Monkey bars: Sergey makes his way to the end of a crane overlooking the city. He doesn't wear a harness, meaning one slip and he falls to his death.

"By . Chris Kitching . Travellers who flout hand luggage liquid rules are creating longer queues at one of the UK’s busiest airports at the height of the summer travel season. More than 4,000 passengers are breaching the restrictions every day as they pass through Manchester Airport – causing unnecessary delays as people try to get through security and board their flights. The figure amounts to 10 per cent of the 40,000 pieces of hand luggage that are inspected by airport security officials on a daily basis. Scroll down for video . Liquids can be carried in hand luggage if they are under 100ml and placed in a clear, resealable plastic bag . Manchester Airport shared the figures after it received public criticism over growing queues during what is expected to be its busiest summer since 2007. Airport officials say many passengers are unaware of the rules, even though the restrictions have existed at airports around the world for years. Current rules require all liquids in containers over 100ml in size, including large bottles of water, lotions and perfume, to be stored in luggage in an aircraft’s hold. If large containers are found in a traveller’s hand luggage they will likely be thrown in the bin. All in a day's work: Security officials at Manchester Airport inspect 40,000 pieces of hand luggage a day . In Manchester, travellers have been quick to lay blame or express their discontent over security and passport control queues this summer. Forty-year-old passenger Darren Harris, of Stalybridge, told the Manchester Evening News he waited in line for more than an hour after flying in from Malaga last Friday: ‘It went down the corridor and down to where the planes land. I was quite shocked. I have never seen it that bad before.’ Border Force said 13 flights arrived outside their scheduled times and they deployed additional staff, but they would not compromise security while the necessary checks took place. Bag it: A sign at Gatwick Airport warns approaching passengers about hand luggage liquid rules . To reduce delays, the airport has invested £20million in security this year. Tricia Williams, the airport’s customer services director, said: ‘This summer we have increased security staff and during peak times all available staff and lanes are open for passengers to use and if needs be we deploy security staff to other terminals to help alleviate pinch points.’ She said queues are already longer during the summer due to the increase in passengers and the fact travellers are leaving additional time for their journey. The airport is encouraging passengers to allow plenty of time before their departure and obey the hand luggage restrictions. Spokeswoman Heather Griffiths said Gatwick Airport is not experiencing similar issues. She said it takes passengers an average of two minutes to pass through security at Gatwick.","More than 4,000 a day breach liquid rules at Manchester Airport alone .

"By . Jan Moir . As the England team crunched to defeat in their first World Cup match, another inauguration was taking place. It was a very special moment in the annals of footballing history, one that we are not going to forget for a long time to come. So blow the whistle – wheeeep! – and remember where you were the night Phil Neville made his debut as a commentator for the BBC. Top pundit Gary Lineker sported a slightly longer hair-do during the start of this year's World Cup coverage (left) compared to the cleaner cut he showed off at an event in October last year (right) ‘It’s always difficult as an England supporter to enjoy these occasions,’ were his prophetic opening words as the game against Italy began. It was a warning of the horror to unfold over the next ninety minutes. With his lips pressed close to the microphone, an intimate clinch of man and metal, Neville launched himself on an unsuspecting world without fear, filter or much forethought. He wasted no time in mangling his clichés, and managed to keep coma-calm when the first two goals were scored. ‘That is what Wayne Rooney is for, to put in crosses like that’, he mused as the nation erupted in joy after Daniel Sturridge equalised for England. He didn’t show a flicker of emotion – or even amusement – when the England physiotherapist was stretchered off when a celebratory group hug by team officials ended in injury. ‘Anything can happen if everybody jumps on top of each other,’ shrugged Neville. Even during the most electrifying moments, Phil sounded like a depressed undertaker with a giant peg on his nose reading aloud a seed catalogue. He spent much of the game mumbling incoherently or with his mouth too close to the mic, as if he was broadcasting in the silent hush of a snooker tournament, or perhaps hiding under the bed from his mum. Phil Neville made his debut as a commentator for the BBC on Saturday . Briefly, he would talk knowledgeably about tactics, of how important it was, say, for England’s men to put pressure on the Italian midfield. Then he would ruin it, by savagely attacking the English language when he thought the ref wasn’t looking. ‘Yeah, he’s got to fire in them low crosses,’ he would say. Indeed, throughout his match commentary, Evil K-Neville would frequently use ‘them’ when he actually meant ‘those’ – a howling and irritating grammatical error. At the very dawn of his career as a pundit, couldn’t a producer have had a quiet word in his ear and pointed out the mistake? This has nothing to do with his regional accent, but everything to do with basic good grammar. It is pretty inexcusable. After all, Neville is no longer a footballer. He is – for the moment at least – a highly paid voice for the national broadcaster, a man whose every word is being beamed to 15million bemused viewers back home. Meanwhile, back in the main studio, things were not much better. First, what has happened to Gary Lineker’s hair? The BBC’s top pundit now sports great, owlish wings of white furze flowing over the sides of his head, making him look like Grandpa Munster. The humidity in Brazil has much more to answer for than players failing to find their pace. In Lineker’s studio, Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand were joined by Thierry Henry. I couldn’t catch much of what the latter said, but at least he had the excuse of speaking in a second language. The other two have no such defence, but do they care? ‘He always wanted to play in the middle. Not on the left or the right-hand side,’ said Shearer, carefully explaining for confused viewers exactly where they could find the middle. Ferdinand either talks rubbish or spouts footy clichés. ‘Danny Welbeck opened his legs down the side,’ he said at one point – a horrifying image. Rio also wasted no time in explaining yet again how it feels like a completely unique cauldron of seafood when you are actually playing in a match. ‘It’s a totally different kettle of fish once you get on that pitch,’ he said. Thank you, Rio! Makes you think that Phil Neville isn’t so bad after all, though. Cheer up, everybody. There is only five weeks of this to go.","The BBC's top pundit now sports hair tufts over the tops of his ears .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A teenager stabbed his mother before cutting off his own penis after he was believed to have taken party drug mephedrone, commonly known as meow meow. The 19-year-old student hacked at his private parts with a knife after attacking his mother at their family home, it was claimed. He was discovered hanging out of a bedroom window, blood gushing from his groin after his terrified mother called emergency services to the house in Haywards Heath, West Sussex. Drug: A teenager believed to have taken mephedrone, or meow meow, stabbed his mother before cutting off his own penis . Both he and his 46-year-old mother, neither of whom have been named, were rushed to hospital by ambulance with injuries described as life threatening after the attack on December 29, according to the Mirror. Yesterday she was described as being in a stable condition at the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton. Surgeons at University College London hospital are thought to have re-attached the teenager's penis, and his condition was also described as stable. He is believed to have taken mephedrone, a former so-called legal high also known as M-Cat which was outlawed in 2010, before the attack. Emergency: Surgeons at University College Hospital in London are thought to have re-attached the teenager's penis . A family friend told the Mirror that the usually bright teenager had started experimenting with drugs, and had returned to his family home for his Christmas break from university. 'He had come home from university for . Christmas. 'It looks like he took mephedrone and completely flipped out . attacking his mum and then himself,' said the source. 'When the police arrived they found him hanging from a window and then discovered he had cut off his penis.' Sussex Police have been investigating an allegation of assault on the mother, and have said that officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. It is believed that least one person a week dies after taking party drug mephedrone, which until 2010 was legal . It is believed that least one person a week dies after taking party drug mephedrone, which until 2010 was legal. It is now a class B drug and is illegal to sell and possess in the UK. The drug, which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets. Despite the dangers the drug, known as . 'plant food' or 'meow meow', has been hugely popular because of its . cheapness and easy availability. The effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine. It is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy, but with the short-lived hit of a line of coke. However, it can also cause anxiety and paranoia. Other side-effects include headaches, palpitations, nausea, high blood pressure, a burning throat, nose bleeds and purple joints, especially the knees and hands.","Teenager was believed to have taken mephedrone before the attack .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . A Seniors Ryder Cup is looking highly likely to be staged for the first time, with golf chiefs from both sides of the Atlantic involved in talks to make it happen. Setting up an over-50s matchplay tournament between the USA and Europe has been in  discussion for some time, now that the Ryder Cup has become such a major event. But the impetus has come from the crop of European players newly eligible to play seniors golf, who would ensure a highly competitive event rather than American dominance. Impetus: Colin Montgomerie, who won the Ryder Cup as a player and captain, is backing the move . These include Colin Montgomerie, who has won two senior majors this year, as well as Sir Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam,  Sam Torrance and Mark James — all of whom have been European captains in the Ryder Cup. Ted Bishop, the PGA of America president, said: ‘We are analysing the possibility of hosting a senior Ryder Cup, but there are a lot of moving parts to evaluate.’ George O’Grady, chief executive of the  European Tour, also confirmed discussions were progressing between the stakeholders, but said it was too early to forecast a starting date or definitive format. The speculation suggests 10-a-side teams, with the first event to be televised by NBC in the United States in September next year. Thursday’s senior moment from 83-year-old Peter Alliss was the BBC television commentator mixing up American golfer Rickie Fowler (right) with Liverpool great Robbie Fowler. Spot the difference: Alliss confused American golfer Rickie Fowler (left) with ex-footballer Robbie (right) The Cricketer magazine, having made all three of their editorial staff redundant this week, attempted on Thursday to turn off a new, irreverent, ball-by-ball audio commentary alternative to the BBC’s Test Match Special. Guerilla Cricket was set up by the Test Match Sofa team, also sidelined by The Cricketer. Junior operatives from the magazine were sent around to retrieve the Sky viewing card utilised by Test Match Sofa. They went away empty-handed because Guerilla Cricket were using the television facilities of Sports Tonight Live for their Lord’s online commentary. The relationship between Open organisers the R&A and the European Tour is always spiky. So something can be read into the European Tour temporary offices at Hoylake being situated next to the caddie shack, while the R&A rooms are in prime position next to the clubhouse. Beeb’s army at Open . BBC Sport take an army of personnel to every event they cover. The Open is no different with 186 Beeb people employed on their Hoylake operation, significantly more than the 156 golfers competing. A spokeswoman said: ‘Every member of the team has a clear and accountable role and staff on site work incredibly hard.’ Bloated: Hazel Irvine and Peter Alliss are part of the BBC team that has more staff then the Open has players . Controversial: Dyson, who broke the rules at the BMW Open in China in October, is part of the BBC team . The BBC radio team includes Simon Dyson as a summariser, despite him being found guilty of breaking the rules in the BMW Masters in China last October when he was judged to have  deliberately tapped down a spike mark. The R&A might be in a position to announce the successor to retiring chief executive Peter Dawson in September, with headhunters Spencer Stuart having produced a shortlist of candidates. The search can hardly go worse for Spencer Stuart than their botched eight-month recruitment of a CEO for Ascot racecourse. The R&A are no respecters of reputation — even when it comes to the august membership of host club Royal Liverpool. Nick Moss, the financial director of a multi-national company and a former Hoylake committee man, was due to do scoring duties on two days, but was curtly  dismissed by an R&A operative after failing to turn up for a second briefing, not believing it was necessary. No mercy: The R&A are determined to be fair at this year's Open, and have dismissed Nick Moss . An R&A spokesman said: ‘We can’t have one rule for one and another for everybody else. The meeting was important.’ The disappearance of Bollinger’s champagne tent, an Open institution since 1969, follows the R&A wanting a massive increase in their previous £100,000 licensing agreement. The R&A are now running the tent — hidden away at Hoylake — on their own.","Former Ryder Cup captains back over-50s event .

Anthony Kirkby and Paul Tranter – two Brits who have dubbed themselves the Colburn Idiots Abroad in an ode to the popular television series starring Pilkington – have quickly become an online sensation thanks to a series of short clips documenting their trip to the US. Through the reach of social media, their videos have garnered nearly one million views and their YouTube channel is being followed by more than 13,000 subscribers in just two days. Scroll down for video . People are flipping their lids for Anthony Kirkby, left, and Paul Tranter, whose holiday videos have gone viral . One of the viral videos, titled ‘Blending in with the locals of LA’, shows Kirkby dragging Tranter out of bed at 6.30am on their first day in sunny Los Angeles. Moments later, the men stand in front of a mirror to assess their matching tourist outfits – a white T-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, tacky shorts featuring the Stars and Stripes, and wide-rimmed sunglasses styled after Old Glory. An enthusiastic Kirkby, 30, says: ‘Honestly, they will love us. We fit right in.’ Tranter, 32, isn’t pleased, telling his travel mate: ‘We’ll get beaten up!’ Seeing double: Anthony Kirkby, left, and Paul Tranter prepare to hit the streets of LA in matching outfits . Another clip shows them surveying a light fixture they damaged while climbing through a window in the middle of the night after they were locked out of the pub where they were staying. They also filmed clips of an exotic dancer on Hollywood Boulevard and one of themselves watching a Manchester United match in a bar. While watching the football match, Tranter tells the camera: 'I could have done this at home.' Kirkby is a serving member of the British Army, while Tranter is a former soldier who now works as a production supervisor with a company that manufactures and supplies pipeline products. They said they decided to create the videos as a laugh for their family and friends back home. Tranter added: ‘We quite often make stupid videos back at home to make our friends laugh and we thought this would be a funny thing to do. ‘We can look back on it in years to come and laugh watching them back.’ Nearly one million people have watched the holiday exploits of Anthony Kirkby, left, and Paul Tranter . More than 4,000 people have commented on the North Yorkshire pair’s profanity-laden videos in a thread on the social-networking website Reddit. The wildly popular travellers have gained a legion of fans and they have been overwhelmed with offers from Americans who want to play a role in their adventure. Kirkby and Tranter received VIP treatment at a comedy club and were given a free tour of Universal Studios. They have also been offered free tickets to a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game, a free day at a shooting range, guided tours of LA and San Francisco and an invite to a house party in the Hollywood Hills. Big love: American viewers have bombarded Anthony Kirkby, pictured, and friend Paul Tranter with offers . The men have also met with a representative of a US company that helps amateur filmmakers profit from their videos. Their two-week tour will take them to San Diego, San Francisco and Las Vegas, where they hope to catch a glimpse of Sheffield boxer Kell Brook before his title fight against Shawn Porter. One commenter on Reddit urged the Brits to share more of their exploits: ‘The perfect tourist duo. The enthusiastic funny guy and his friend who's annoyed by his silly antics.

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . The White House was aware of James Foley's location before his death claims the murdered journalist's former boss, who says he hired an international security firm to locate the kidnapped reporter. GlobalPost CEO, Philip Balboni, said today that his organization knew of Foley's whereabouts in Syria and said it was safe to assume the US government knew of it too. The media executive also said Secretary of State John Kerry had been personally involved at some level of the search or negotiations for Foley's return, but refused to go into details. In a press conference, Balboni revealed he had personally spent 'millions' trying to retrieve Foley, 40, but the journalist was ultimately shown 'no mercy' by his captors who beheaded him and posted the grisly video online on Tuesday. Speaking from Boston, Balboni also revealed that Foley's family had been emailed by ISIS last Wednesday and informed that the terror group intended to execute the reporter in retaliation for US bombing in support of Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq. Balboni said that ISIS 'made no demands' in their email and 'it was just a statement that they were going to execute Jim'. Scroll Down to Watch Video . Press conference: GlobalPost President and CEO Philip Balboni reacts as he speaks during a news conference in Boston, on Wednesday, one day after a video was released showing the beheading of US journalist James Foley . Balboni said he passed on the email to the government immediately and at the press conference said, 'It's safe to say our government knew.' 'We received an email from the captors on Wednesday night of last week stating their intention to execute Jim,' said Balboni in an interview with WCVB-TV in Boston. The ominous email differed to prior correspondences from ISIS, which usually contained either financial or political demands. Balboni said that what terrified him and the Foley family was the tone of the message, which was 'vitriolic' and full or rage in the aftermath of US bombing against Islamic State targets in Iraq. Balboni said they tried to engage in a conversation with the terrorists and initially held out hope. 'But you can see the seething anger. It could have been a bluff and we had to believe it was a bluff,' said Balboni to WCVB. 'You know when you kidnap someone and hold them for almost two years, you don't do it unless you believe there is value in those hostages.' Solemn: GlobalPost President and CEO Philip Balboni talks with reporters during a news conference in Boston . 'The question of whether it is right to pay a ransom is a complicated one,' Balboni, told MailOnline. 'We know that European governments with the exception of Britain, have paid them and we see that they have succeeded. 'You could say that speaks volumes, but, of course there are certain countervailing issues on the other side.' Despite Foley's murder, Balboni says he still has hope for other hostages held by the Islamic terrorist group, including journalist Steven Sotloff who was paraded before the camera by Foley's executioner, who said he would be next if American bombings did not halt. 'I feel that IS have made their cool and awful point and that they see residual value in the remaining hostages, both American and British, and they will come to some form of negotiation,' Balboni told MailOnline. 'The ball game has changed since the American bombing started and since IS has flexed its muscles and rampaged through Iraq. They may now want to be dealt with in a different way,' he said, suggesting the group could now be open to diplomacy and negotiaion. 'They consider themselves to be a state and that implies - in their minds - a sense of legitimacy.' Balboni said that immediately upon Foley's abduction at gunpoint in Syria on Thanksgiving in 2012 he hired a international team of contractors to find him. The CEO said that in September of 2013 that firm, which he did not name, found Foley and has been tracking him ever since. According to the Boston Globe the firm had been able to follow Foley, even though he being was transported to different sites. Watch Video Here: .

Dignified: Diane and John Foley talk to reporters after the death of their son, James Foley at the hands of ISIS . A plaintive Balboni said that his firm had spent millions of dollars to get their man back and according to the Boston Globe was 'fairly sure' the White House knew where Foley was. He also divulged during the press conference that he believed the federal government had attempted to rescue Foley over the past 22 months - but said that these missions were obviously classified - and presumably failed. Foley was held captive with other hostages, who were European journalists and Balboni told the Boston Globe that they were released when their ransoms were paid. However, because Foley was an American, 'There were monetary challenges that were not going to be easy to overcome.' 'Jim Foley was an incredibly brave journalist and an incredibly brave man right to the horrible end of his life,' Balboni said to the Boston Globe. The execution of journalist James Foley drew international condemnation, and western nations responded with stepped-up efforts to counter the threat posed by Islamic State. Germany announced it would supply the Kurds with weapons to fight the insurgent. Italy's defense minister said the country hopes to contribute machine guns, ammunition and anti-tank rockets.

On social media, people in the region condemned Foley's killing, but stressed that the Islamic State has been committing atrocities against Iraqis and Syrians for years. In Foley's home town of Rochester, New Hampshire, his parents spoke to reporters in an appearance where wrenching grief over their son's death mingled with laughter over his life. Diane Foley said her son was courageous to the end and called his death 'just evil.' 'We are just very proud of Jimmy and we are praying for the strength to love like he did and keep courageous and keep fighting for all the people he was fighting for,' she said. 'We pray for all the remaining Americans.'","GobalPost CEO Philip Balboni claims his organization spent 'millions' tracking James Foley .

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . He's set to join Manchester United for a staggering £75million and footballer Angel Di Maria says his good fortune is all thanks to his daughter, Mia. The 16-month-old was born three months premature and was lucky to survive after complications with her birth. She was in intensive care for weeks and doctors feared she may not pull through. It was a terrible time for Di Maria, 26, and his wife, Jorgelina Cardoso, 32. But to their relief, their little girl fought for her life and is now a happy, healthy child. Survivor: Angel Di Maria and his wife, Jorgelina Cardoso with their daughter Mia who was in intensive care for the first months of her life . The Argentinian footballer said it is daughter's example that inspires him to always give his all on the pitch - leading him to become one of the game's top earners. He told the Spanish paper Marca: 'My daughter's taught me that everything is possible. She taught me that the most difficult thing is at times the easiest, that the efforts of someone can be rewarded. 'She taught me how to suffer and be able to withstand pain and be stronger. Everything she transmitted to me helped me have a spectacular season.' Di Maria excelled in the past year playing for Real Madrid and then scored for his country in the World Cup, where they reached the final, before having to withdraw from the team effort due to injury. It was enough to attract the attention of Manchester United bosses who are keen to sign the player to help their bid for Premiership and European glory. In demand: The footballer has impressed Manchester United who want to sign him for £75m, which would make him one of the game's top earners . Di Maria's decision to join the English club will be made with the full support of his wife, known as Jorgita, who he married in 2011. She's never afraid to voice her opinions on social media, particularly if anyone criticises her beloved husband. As a proud mother, she regularly shares family photos on her Instagram account. After their daughter turned one in April, she also revealed how much Mia has enriched their lives, and how hard it was for them to see her suffering as a newborn. She wrote: 'Two months in the Intensive Care Unit. No one but your father and I know the pain it caused to see your beautiful face covered in wires and devices. There was nothing sadder than going home with empty arms and breasts full of pain. Daddy's girl: A collage of pictures Jorgelina posted on Instagram showing their baby at her most frail covered in wires, top right, and when she was healthy enough to go home, bottom right . His biggest fan: Now 16-months-old, Mia is a happy and healthy little girl . 'Tears soaked our pillow every night, I had a constant knot in my throat.' She added that it was the happiest day of their lives when Mia was well enough to go home. And on her first birthday in April, she wrote of how far she had come. 'You're a very funny girl, healthy, strong, and a great fighter of this life, your life, our lives. You came into this world to teach us not to give up,' she said. The couple remain eternally grateful to the Spanish hospital and staff who helped Mia survive. Di Maria told The Sun that they made friends for live in the process as they bonded with other parents going through the same ordeal as them. He explained: 'We spent more than two months at the hospital, always with the same parents. The pain unites people. It makes you stronger and we had a very relationship with all the parents there.' He added that trying to carry on as normal and play football was difficult while Mia was in hospital. 'It was not easy but I had to fight,' he said. Now that fight has paid off for him and his family as he's set to become Manchester United's new star - with his family cheering him on all the way.","Manchester United hope to sign Argentine player for £75m .

"By . Pa Reporter . Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness has warned the club against signing Mario Balotelli, describing the move as an 'enormous gamble'. AC Milan striker Balotelli is reportedly closing in on a transfer to Liverpool as Reds boss Brendan Rodgers looks to replace the goals of Luis Suarez, who joined Barcelona earlier this summer. The £16million move for the controversial 24-year-old former Manchester City player is seen as something of a coup by many, but Souness believes it is a risk not worth taking. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mario's maddest, baddest and best moments . Close call: Liverpool look set to take a gamble on signing Mario Balotelli from AC Milan . Writing in the Sunday Times, he said: 'It's an enormous gamble by Rodgers, a gamble I don't think he needs to take because he has a very strong group of players. 'The harmony looks good but he may find, like every previous manager of the Italian, that he will spend more time talking about Balotelli, spending time with him and defending him, than he will the rest of the group put together.' Souness, who managed Liverpool to FA Cup glory in 1992 and has also been in charge of Newcastle, Blackburn, Rangers and Southampton, went on to say that he would not sign Balotelli if he was still in the Anfield hotseat. Proven prowess: Balotelli was a strong performer for Man City and caused Liverpool several headaches . Winners: Souness, Hansen and Dalglish celebrating a Liverpool Charity Shield win in 1979 . He added: 'At times Balotelli doesn't seem to enjoy football. Big teams can do without people who pick and choose when they will have a go. It's a high-risk signing. I wouldn't want him.' Balotelli is a proven performer, but the baggage that comes with him is considerable. His spell with Manchester City from summer 2010 to January 2013 was a whirlwind one, with occasional sparkling performances interspersed with volatility on the field and erratic behaviour off it. He scored 30 goals in 80 appearances for the club and set up Sergio Aguero's stoppage-time goal against QPR which saw them crowned 2012 Barclays Premier League champions - their first league title since 1968.","Mario Balotelli looks set to sign for Liverpool this week .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Tests for a woman from Sierra Leone showing symptoms of Ebola have come back negative after she was held at a Scottish immigration removal centre. The woman was detained at Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire after she fell ill and was taken to hospital where doctors carried out tests. Health chiefs confirmed last night that she did not have the disease. A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The results have now been returned and they have confirmed that she tested negative'. Scroll down for video . The Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire where the woman was being held before undergoing tests . She was placed in isolation in the . infectious diseases ward of a Lanarkshire hospital until the results became . known. It is understood she was treated at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, while limited numbers of staff were allowed in contact with the patient. The detention centre near the town of Strathaven is used as a holding unit for failed asylum seekers waiting deportation. Officials from the Home Office suspended the detention or release of people from the unit during the investigation to islolate the risk in case it was positive. Health officials across the UK were alerted to the situation and a full emergency plan was prepared. The latest Ebola epidemic in Africa began in Guinea in February and has since spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. It is transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person. Initial flu-like symptoms can be followed by external haemorrhaging from areas such as the eyes and gums, and internal bleeding leading to organ failure. This latest incident in Scotland comes weeks after two athletes from Sierra Leone were tested for the deadly virus during the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The results were negative and the pair went on to compete. A group of international doctors yesterday admitted they did not know the true scale of the deaths from the deadly outbreak. Doctors Without Borders (Medecin Sans Frontieres) resembled the outbreak in west Africa to a state of war and said that the epidemic could last another six months. Their warning follows an announcement by a World Health Organisation official, who claimed that Ebola treatment centres are filling up faster than they can be provided in west Africa. A woman lies sick in bed while awaiting transport from her home in Liberia to an Ebola isolation ward . WHO spokesman in Geneva Gregory Hartl said: 'The flood of patients into every newly opened treatment center is evidence that the numbers aren't keeping up.' The Organization also said today that the death toll  has risen to 1,145, the World Health Organization, as 76 new deaths were reported in the two days to August 13 in the four West African nations affected by the epidemic. The U.N. health agency said that a total of 152 confirmed, probable and suspected new cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever were reported in the two day period in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, bringing the total for the outbreak to 2,127. Joanne Liu, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the pace of outbreaks in Guinea had slowed but other countries, particularly Liberia, now had to be the focus of efforts to contain the disease. She said: ‘If we don’t stabilise Liberia, we will never stabilise the region. In terms of timeline, we’re not talking in terms of weeks, we’re talking in terms of months ... at least I would say six months, and I’m being ... very optimistic.’ Her warning came after the World Health Organization said the toll of 1,069 deaths and a further 900 sufferers could ‘vastly underestimate the magnitude’ of the outbreak. The first European victim of Ebola, Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, died on Monday - five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care. The 75-year-old's condition was described as stable on arrival in Spain and it is thought he was given ZMapp, an experimental drug credited with the ‘miraculous’ recovery of two American aid workers. His body was cremated to prevent the virus spreading. International doctors today admitted they did not know the true scale of the deaths from the deadly outbreak . What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.","Woman was detained at Dungavel Detention Centre in South Lanarkshire .

"By . Sam Webb . Daniel Craig? Not a chance. R-Patz? Hardly. No, the sexiest man alive is... North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The hermit nation's figurehead has scooped the top honour, at least according to the online version of China's Communist Party newspaper. The People's Daily Online has farcically hailed a report by The Onion naming North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as the 'Sexiest Man Alive' - not realising it is satire. Swoon: Kim breaks hearts on horseback. A Chinese newspaper accidentally reported as fact a spoof news report naming the Korean dictator as 'the sexiest man alive' Dazzling smile: The People's Daily ran a 55-page picture special on Kim to commemorate his tongue-in-cheek honour . Dishy dictator: Female soldiers are overcome with emotion at an appearance by the heir of Kim Jong Il . It ran a 55-page photo spread on its website in a tribute to the round-faced leader, under the headline 'North Korea's top leader named The Onion's Sexiest Man Alive for 2012.' Quoting The Onion's incredibly tongue-in-cheek report, the Chinese newspaper wrote, 'With his devastatingly handsome, round face, his boyish charm, and his strong, sturdy frame, this Pyongyang-bred heartthrob is every woman's dream come true. 'Blessed with an air of power that masks an unmistakable cute, cuddly side, Kim made this newspaper's editorial board swoon with his impeccable fashion sense, chic short hairstyle, and, of course, that famous smile,' the People's Daily cited The Onion as saying. The photos the People's Daily selected include Kim on horseback manfully gazing into the middle distance and being mobbed by teary female forces personnel in a scene reminiscent of boyband sensation One Direction hitting New York. Rock star charisma: Kim Jong-un surrounded by weeping members of the Korean Children's Union . Other pictures show the leader of the secretive communist nation waving toward a military parade and meeting a group of adoring schoolchildren. Hello ladies: The red hot Communist leader waves to his adoring crowds. (Right) with his wife Ri Sol-ju while attending a ceremony to mark the completion of the Rungna People's Pleasure Ground in Pyongyang . The story does not make any reference to The Onion's previous winners of its sexiest man alive award, which include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, convicted investor Bernard Madoff and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. People's Daily could not immediately be reached for comment. A man who answered the phone at the newspaper's duty office said he did not know anything about the report and requested queries be directed to their newsroom on Wednesday morning. It is not the first time a state-run Chinese newspaper has fallen for a fictional report by the just-for-laughs The Onion. Man of action: One of the pictures People's Daily published in its 55-strong picture gallery . In 2002, the Beijing Evening News, one of the capital city's biggest tabloids at the time, published as news the fictional account that the U.S. Congress wanted a new building and that it might leave Washington. The Onion article was a spoof of the way sports teams threaten to leave cities in order to get new stadiums. Two months ago, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reprinted a story from The Onion about a supposed survey showing that most rural white Americans would rather vote for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad than President Barack Obama. It included a quote from a fictional West Virginia resident saying he'd rather go to a baseball game with Ahmadinejad because 'he takes national defence seriously'.","People's Daily mistakes comedy website for genuine news provider .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An opera singer has claimed a military nurse carried out an unnecessary episiotomy on her during childbirth - leaving her with incontinence and flatulence so bad that she is unable to perform. Amy Herbst, 33, alleges in a lawsuit filed against the government on Monday that nurse-midwife Tiffany Williams carried out the procedure without her consent and subsequently damaged her digestive and reproductive systems - as well as her singing career. The lawsuit filed by Herbst and her husband, Staff Sgt. James Herbst, in Cincinnati federal court seeks $2.5 million for negligence, as well as pain and suffering, embarrassment and loss of income. 'She is suffering through a very embarrassing and very significant injury, and frankly, the prognosis of a fully successful repair is pretty low,' her attorney, Charles Allen, told Army Times on Wednesday. Injuries: Amy Herbst was given an episiotomy without her consent while giving birth to her son in 2012. It left her with severe damage and incontinence that has threatened her opera career, she said . The damage also means that she now suffers pain during sex, according to the lawsuit. As a result, her husband is also suing the government for lack of consortium. An episiotomy, which involves cutting the . tissue between the vagina and anus, is carried out to help deliver the . baby and when the skin is at danger of tearing. But Mrs Herbst claims that Williams carried out the procedure at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in February 2012 without her consent. 'At no time during the labor and delivery process was [she] informed about the possible need for or the risks and benefits of an episiotomy,' the lawsuit says. 'At no time was she asked to consent, nor did she consent, to the performance of an episiotomy.' Nevertheless, birth records show that the procedure was carried out as the placement of the baby boy's shoulder was holding back the delivery. The nurse then repaired the tear using sutures. Family: Mrs Herbst and her husband James, who welcomed their first son in February 2012, have now sued the U.S. government for the allegedly botched procedure carried out by a military nurse . An episiotomy is a surgical incision in the perineum, the area between the vagina and the anus, made just before childbirth to enlarge a woman's vaginal opening. The procedure used to be routine to prevent the vagina from tearing, in the belief that this cut would help women heal easier than a spontaneous tear. CONS . Research shows women with a spontaneous tear actually recover in the same or less time than women who have had an episiotomy. Women who have had an episiotomy also tend to lose more blood during the delivery and experience more pain during their recovery. The tear also has a greater chance of becoming larger and research shows it increases the risk of tearing in a second birth. It also increases the risk of infection. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other experts now agree that the procedure shouldn't be done routinely. PROS . But if a baby is very large or in an abnormal position and a doctor needs space for forceps, an episiotomy can be carried out. It can also help when the baby needs to be delivered as quickly as possible - if it is experiencing difficulties such as a drop in heart rate. Mothers-to-be are encouraged to speak with their practitioner to find out in what conditions he or she would perform an episiotomy. Midwives carry out the procedure much less than obstetricians. Although Allen said that the placement of . the boy's shoulder probably led to the decision, he argued that they . could have used other, safer ways to deliver the boy - but they did not. 'There seemed to be an assumption that . they didn’t need to involve the patient in the decision making... and . they were completely wrong, as a matter of law and social . responsibility,' Allen said. 'The patient has a right to decide what’s . done with her body.' After Herbst left the hospital, she 'began to experience fecal urgency . and incontinence, including periodic leaking of stool and excessive . flatulence,' according to the lawsuit. At a follow-up hospital visit, she met with a nurse and 'complained she could feel gas coming out of her vagina and was also experiencing difficulty controlling bowel movements', the suit says. A nurse told Herbst that the attempts to repair her incision had not worked. Mrs Herbst had suffered a 'complete breakdown of the episiotomy and perineum and the external sphincter is disrupted and the vagina and rectum are basically connected without any perineal body,' the lawsuit claims. A colorectal surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center later told Herbst that she would need reconstructive surgery to repair the damage, but that it 'would likely not eliminate the lack of control of flatus and [she] may require additional surgeries in the future'. She was also told that once the repair was performed, she will have to undergo a C-section in any future pregnancies. When she told medical staff that C-sections could risk her singing career, they encouraged her not to undergo the procedure until she had finished having children, the suit says. Mrs Herbst agreed and has chosen to postpone the repair of the damage. A hospital spokesperson has not returned calls seeking comment. The lawsuit claims that Herbst, a mezzo-soprano, is now unable to work as a professional opera singer. She has performed with the Nashville Opera Company. 'As a result of her incontinence and . excessive flatulence, Herbst has been unable to work as a professional . opera singer,' it says. Scene: She gave birth to her son at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital. On follow-up visits, she learned that reconstructive surgery will not necessarily repair the damage, her lawsuit says . It has also left her with limitations on her sexual function, as well as pain during sex, the suit states. Online records also show that Herbst has worked as a music instructor at Belmont University, where she received her master's in music and vocal performance. Her husband was a soldier at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee state line at the time but has since left the Army. Under the concept of sovereign immunity, in which the government may not be sued without its permission for acts taken on behalf of it, most people have high legal hurdles to cross to bring a lawsuit. Under Federal Tort Claims Act, the government has waived sovereign immunity if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage.","Amy Herbst gave birth to her first child, a boy, in February 2012 .

But a group of specialist cleaners found out just how filthy today – as they started a five-day deep clean of Big Ben. The experts abseiled by rope to clean and inspect the faces of the Great Clock at the Palace of Westminster wearing ear defenders to protect their hearing from the chimes of Big Ben. A working week has been set aside for the job, one day for each of the four clock faces, with a contingency day in case the weather makes it too risky to work on the 95.7 metre high Elizabeth Tower. Scroll down for video . A specialist technical abseil team clean and inspect one of the four faces of the Great Clock, otherwise known as Big Ben . The clock was last cleaned in 2010 and as well as removing any dirt that has built up since then, the technicians will carry out a photographic survey to check the dials for damage. Each clock face is made up of 312 pieces of pot opal glass, held together by a cast iron framework. The clock was installed in April 1859 but at first would not work as the cast-iron minute hands were too heavy. Once they were replaced by lighter copper hands, it successfully began keeping time on May 31, 1859. The clock will continue to keep time during the cleaning process, but the hands on the face being washed will not move. The essential maintenance and cleaning of the four faces will take four days - with an extra day set aside in case of bad weather . The team of cleaners abseiled down from the top of the tower to clean the face of the famous clock . Cleaners wash the west face on Elizabeth Tower - formerly known as St Stephen's Tower - popularly known as Big Ben . Deputy keeper of the clock Steve Jaggs said: 'Big Ben is one of the UK’s greatest icons, and cleaning the Great Clock is a vital part of its maintenance. 'The process is complex and requires a real head for heights. 'We have an expert team who will ensure that the clock is thoroughly cleaned and that this piece of our national heritage is safeguarded for future generations.'

"By . Mark Duell . A new housing boom could be on the way - with a relaxation of planning laws prompting a surge in the number of large housing estates being forced through by developers, a study claimed today. England’s local authorities approved 195,000 planning applications over the past year, which is a 9 per cent rise on the average before legal changes came in promoting sustainable development. Planning permission for large residential developments increased by a quarter from 4,000 in 2010/11 to 4,900 in 2013/14 – with a rise in the approval rate from 73 per cent to 77 per cent. Building: Planning permission for large residential developments increased by a quarter from 4,000 in 2010/11 to 4,900 in 2013/14 - with a rise in the approval rate from 73 per cent to 77 per cent (file picture) The figures come as a Conservative peer said hundreds of thousands of homes must be built on 800 square miles of British countryside where there are ‘big, open, flat fields of no agricultural merit’. Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise said the Government must allow construction on greenfield areas - and added that he does not believe the country is already over-developed. The 46-year-old chief executive of retailer Next said ‘beautiful countryside’ must be preserved, but the proportion of the UK that has been developed should be increased from 8 per cent to 9 per cent. Lord Wolfson told The Daily Telegraph: ‘There is a lot of justifiable fear about development. People assume that there is very little countryside left which isn’t true. ‘When people say we need more land for . homes they summon up the Cotswolds and South Downs in their . imagination, and imagine it all ruined. And no-one wants that. ‘But equally there are lots of parts of . the countryside where no one walks in – that are just big, open, flat . fields of no agricultural merit.’ Next chief executive: Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise said the Government must allow construction on greenfield areas - and added that he does not believe the country is already over-developed . He claimed that an extra 300,000 homes would add 3 per cent to the UK’s gross domestic product. BROWNFIELD SITES are found on derelict or disused land. They improve the appearance of these areas and are often found near towns or cities – so reduce the need for car use. But they are more expensive to build on - because the land often must be cleared first - and are more available in the North and Midlands, despite the biggest housing demand being found in the South-East. GREENFIELD SITES are . areas on which nothing has been previously constructed. They are . praised for being cheaper to build on, but also mean the destruction of parts of . the countryside and encourage road commuting. Environmentalists also . argue that they promote urban sprawl, which is the spread of an urban . area into its surrounding countryside. Lord Wolfson - who is married to George Osborne’s economic adviser Eleanor Shawcross - is seen as  an ally of the Chancellor, and his comments echo those of the Prime Minister last November. Mr Cameron said at the time that rural voters opposed to new planning rules were killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘dream of home ownership’. The Prime Minister accused grassroots Conservatives and countryside groups that oppose building on greenfield land of putting their own interests before the country’s. But a hard-hitting report two months ago claimed that rural towns and villages were being placed under siege by the threat of 700,000 new homes in the countryside. Almost 200,000 of these are earmarked for supposedly protected Green Belt land thanks to the Government's changes to planning laws, the Campaign to Protect Rural England warned. Its report revealed that just 84 local . authorities – a quarter of those outside London – propose to prioritise . building on brownfield sites. Lord Wolfson’s Next has taken some of its . 540 UK stores out of town to industrial estates over the past decade. Greenfield land: Lord Wolfson said 'beautiful countryside' must be preserved, but the proportion of the UK that has been developed should be increased from 8 per cent to 9 per cent (file picture) In 2012 it was claimed that the company was the fifth top retail park . tenant in the UK, measured by the total area occupied - behind B&Q, . Homebase, Currys and Matalan. The study on planning figures by construction industry analysts Glenigan published in the Telegraph comes following the launch of National Planning Policy Framework planning reforms. 'There are lots of parts of the countryside where no one walks in – that are just big, open, flat fields of no agricultural merit' Lord Wolfson . CPRE chief executive Shaun Spiers told MailOnline: ‘Lord Wolfson is a businessman who has come to hate the planning system because it stops him plonking big retail sheds in the countryside on the edge of towns. ‘Now he says he wants to preserve a few beauty spots, but he clearly has no sense of the richness of the “ordinary” countryside that people love so much. That’s a great pity, but he should not be allowed to impose his aesthetic limitations – or his disdain for farming – on the rest of us. ‘Of course the country needs many more homes, particularly affordable homes, and some of those will have to go on greenfield sites. ‘But let’s start by developing the thousands of brownfield sites now lying derelict across the country. That will not only save the countryside from being eaten away. It will also vastly improve our towns and cities, and make them better places to live.’","Local authorities approved 195,000 planning applications over past year .

"By . Associated Press . The family of the two Amish girls, age 7 and 12, who were abducted by a man and woman on a 'shopping trip' for slaves, are building a garage for the couple who safely returned the girls to their home. Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson of Bigelow, New York, received the shock of their life on August 14, when the two missing girls, who they recognized from news reports, knocked on their door, about 15 miles from where they disappeared near their family farm stand in Oswegatchie, New York. Mr Stinson gave the girls, who he said were wet, cold, and still in their traditional Amish attire, some watermelon and juice, and then, after a long discussion with his wife, decided it was better to drive the girls home rather than alert the police. Scroll down for video . Pamela (pictured left) and Jeffrey Stinson (pictured right) found the girls after they showed up at their NY home . He also said he recognized the oldest girl as he had purchased corn from her at the farm stand. 'We never gave it any thought about implications or dangers,' he said. 'We knew they had to get home.' Now, as a sign of gratitude, the Amish are doing what they do best, and raising a barn for the couple. The Stinsons told the Watertown Daily Times that the garage at their home in St. Lawrence County recently burned down while they were on vacation in Maine, and, after learning this, the family of the girls said they would be building them a new one later this week. The fire was believed to have been started by a stray cat knocking over a battery jumpstart box inside. The victims, their 11 siblings, parents, grandparents and other relatives are expected to be on hand for the big barn raising, Mr Stinson said, and they would be offended if they could not rebuild the couple's garage. The Stinsons decided against alerting the authroites, and instead drove the girls home to their family . 'They won't take no for an answer,' he said. The girls were abducted on August 13 while tending to their family's farm stand near Oswegatchie. Stephen Howells II, 39, and his girlfriend, 25-year-old Nicole Vaisey, lured the girls to their parked car saying they wanted to show them a puppy, then forcing the two into the back of their vehicle and speeding off to their home in Hermon. The couple chained the girls to a bed and sexually abused them for 24-hours before getting nervous about all the news coverage of the girls' disappearance and dropping them off in Bigelow, where the luckily found their way to the home of the Stinsons. Stephen Howells II (pictured left) and Nicole Vaisey (pictured right) have been charged with kidnapping . Authorities arrested the Howells and Vesey on August 15, and they have now been charged with intending to sexually abuse or physically harm the girls, and two counts of first-degree kidnapping. During a hearing on Thursday in a St Lawrence County, NY court, Vaisey revealed that she and Howell were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves. Her attorney is claiming she was in a 'master-slave relationship' with her boyfriend, and therefore not as culpable for the crime. 'She was the submissive one,' Vaisey's attorney, Bradford Riendeau, stated last week. 'I am currently researching on what happens when prisoners of war go through enhanced interrogation. What torture has done to her personality to determine just how compliant she was? Was it really voluntary? Can you really give consent to be tortured?' Howells waived his right to a hearing, so that his case may go straight to a grand jury.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . and Associated Press . Former Chicago Bears coach and ESPN analyst Mike Ditka has blamed 'politically correct idiots' for the controversy over the Redskins' name. There have been calls for the Washington team to change its name after complaints that 'Redskins' is an offensive or racist term for Native Americans. But Ditka doesn't agree. 'What's all the stink over the Redskin name?' he demanded during an interview with the RedskinsHistorian.com. 'It's so much [expletive] it's incredible. We're going to let the liberals of the world run this world. It was said out of reverence, out of pride to the American Indian.' Anger: Former Chicago Bears player and coach Mike Ditka has said in an interview that he cannot believe the controversy over the Redskins' name - insisting that the term was used out of pride for Native Americans . He continued: 'I hope that owner keeps fighting for it and never changes it, because the Redskins are part of an American football history, and it should never be anything but the Washington Redskins. That's the way it is.' He added that the controversy was due to 'the political correct idiots in America'. 'It's fine to protest,' he said. 'That's your right, if you don't like it, protest. You have a right to do that, but to change the name, that's ridiculous. Change the Constitution -€” we've got people trying to do that, too, and they're doing a pretty good job.' But not everyone agrees with him. On Monday, two influential NFL voices - including CBS lead analyst Phil Simms, who will handle Washington's Week 4 game - said they would not be using the name during broadcasts. 'My very first thought is it will be ""Washington"" the whole game,' Simms told The Associated Press. Simms will work the Thursday night package the network acquired this season and will cover the Giants-Redskins game on September 25. He said that he isn't taking sides in the debate over whether Washington's nickname is offensive or racist, but he says he is sensitive to the complaints about the name. Decisions: CBS lead analyst Phil Simms, left, said he will use 'Washington' instead of 'Redskins' during broadcasts to respect the complaints. His broadcast partner Jim Nantz, right, said he will not take a stance . 'I never really thought about it, and then it came up and it made me think about it,' Simms added. 'There are a lot of things that can come up in a broadcast, and I am sensitive to this.' His broadcast partner, Jim Nantz, says it is 'not my job to take a stance'. NBC's Tony Dungy, one of the most prominent voices in the league as a Super Bowl-winning coach and now as a studio commentator, plans to take the same route as Simms. 'I will personally try not to use Redskins and refer to them as Washington,' Dungy said in an email. 'Personal opinion for me, not the network.' Support: Team owner Daniel Snyder has met with American Indians who have supported the name . CBS is allowing its announcers to decide on their own whether to call the team the Redskins. So is Fox, which handles the NFC and will televise most of Washington's games. 'As long as their nickname is the Redskins, I'll continue to call them the Redskins,' said Hall of Famer Troy Aikman, the lead analyst for Fox. NBC does not have any Redskins games scheduled - the late-season flex scheduling could change that - but the team certainly will be mentioned on its NFL telecasts this season. The network said: 'For all of our sports properties, our on-air commentators have full discretion to reference participating teams by their city/region/state name, team nickname or both.' ESPN said in a statement: 'We use the marks and nicknames as utilized by the teams, leagues and conferences we cover.' But several CBS announcers, appearing at a network news conference about its NFL coverage, said they will use the nickname. 'That's . the name of their team and that's what I am going to use,' said Boomer . Esiason, a member of the CBS studio crew and also an analyst for . Westwood One on Monday night games. Solomon Wilcots said he will use . 'Washington Redskins as long as that is what they are called. That's . their official name and I used it last year, two years ago, 10 years . ago.' Rich Gannon, the NFL's MVP in 2002 with the Raiders, spent one season playing for the Redskins. He now announces games for CBS. Uncertain future: The Washington Redskins are pictured during a game on Monday against Cleveland . 'There . are so many Redskins fans that take great pride in the name,' Gannon . said. '(Owner) Daniel Snyder has said he's talked and visited with . (many) American Indian nations who are supportive of the name. And there . are those who oppose it who are being heard. It's an important topic.' The Redskins' nickname was the subject of a halftime essay by NBC's Bob Costas last October when Washington played Dallas on Sunday night. In part, Costas said, 'Think for a moment about the term ""Redskins"", and how it truly differs from all the others. Ask yourself what the equivalent would be, if directed toward African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, or members of any other ethnic group. 'When considered that way, ""Redskins"" can't possibly honor a heritage, or noble character trait, nor can it possibly be considered a neutral term.  It's an insult, a slur, no matter how benign the present-day intent.'","The former Chicago Bears coach lambasted people wanting to change the name, which is deemed a racial slur for Native Americans .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Google may soon let children under the age of 13 have accounts - providing their parents have control over them, rumours suggest. The move would give youngsters limited access to sites such as YouTube and Gmail, with some content remaining age restricted. But the rumours have sparked some privacy concerns for children among experts. California-based Google is apparently planning to let youngsters sign up for accounts for its various services. This would include giving kids their own YouTube and Gmail accounts while imposing age restrictions (YouTube image shown). The move would enable parents to monitor the online activity of their kids . Internet companies such as Google and Facebook do not offer their services to children under 13, but it is tough to catch users who sign up by providing false information. More than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month. Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube. 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. 70 per cent of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US. YouTube is localized in 53 countries and across 61 languages. In 2011, YouTube had more than 1 trillion views or around 140 views for every person on Earth. Millions of free subscriptions happen each day. Subscriptions allow you to connect with channels you're interested in and keep up with their activity on the site. A US law called Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, imposes strict controls on the collection and use of information about children under 13. Google's effort is partly driven by the fact that some parents are already trying to create accounts for their children and the company wants to make the process easier and compliant with the rules, the Wall Street Journal reported. A story in The Information said the new initiative would allow youngsters to obtain YouTube accounts on a child-friendly version of the site. When signing up for an account users will also be required to disclose their age, with parents then given an a dashboard application to monitor the online activity of their children. However, some have questioned how Google will tackle privacy concerns of children. ‘Unless Google does this right it will threaten the privacy of millions of children and deny parents the ability to make meaningful decisions about who can collect information on their kids,’ Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told the Wall Street Journal. 'Google doesn’t comment on rumour or speculation,' a spokesperson for the company told MailOnline when asked to confirm or deny the rumours.

Earlier this week David Cameron announced that in the UK online music videos would get age ratings to help protect children from highly sexual and violent content. The Prime Minister unveiled a pilot scheme involving YouTube and Vevo as he gave details of his own struggle to prevent his son and two daughters watching inappropriate material. Concerns have been growing for years about the kind of footage freely available to young children online. Examples of videos that have caused alarm include Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball, which shows her suggestively licking a sledgehammer, and sexual images in Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines. Under the arrangements being tested from October, record labels will submit videos thought likely to attract a 12 rating or above to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Sites such as YouTube will then display the ratings, and they could potentially be used by filtering software to enable parents to block unsuitable clips. 'To take just one example - bringing up children in an internet age, you are endlessly worried about what they are going to find online,' he said. 'So we've taken a big stand on protecting our children online. We're making family friendly filters the default setting for all new online customers and we're forcing existing customers to make an active choice about whether to install them.' He added: 'From October, we're going to help parents protect their children from some of the graphic content in online music videos by working with the British Board of Film Classification, Vevo and YouTube to pilot the age rating of these videos.'","California-based Google is apparently planning to let youngsters sign up for accounts for its various services .

The 28-year-old former University of California track star finished last in her heat, but that didn't matter for the then-expectant mom. 'That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,' Montaño said at the time. Healthy: She continued to run and train with the encouragement of her doctors and says she felt 'really good' 'What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby. ...

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . The NFL has asked potential Super Bowl half-time acts to pay to perform at the coveted show next year, it has emerged. The league usually doesn't pay the act, but this year, it has asked potential performers if they would be willing to contribute a portion of their post-Super Bowl tour income to the NFL or offer another type of financial contribution, a source told the Wall Street Journal. The request reportedly did not go down well with the performers - which have been narrowed down to Rihanna, Katy Perry and Coldplay, according to the sources. The NFL usually pays for the halftime performers' travel and production expenses, which can run well into the millions. After the show, acts typically see huge boosts in record and ticket sales. New rules? Bruno Mars is pictured performing at this year's Super Bowl halftime show. Sources have revealed that the list of potential acts for next year's show have been asked to pay the NFL to appear . NFL spokeswoman Joanna Hunter would not comment on the claims, saying contracts with performers were confidential and that its goal was simply 'to put on the best possible show'. She would also not comment on the list of three performers, the Journal reported. The Super Bowl will be played outside Phoenix on February 1. In this year's Super Bowl, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Bruno Mars drew a record 115.3 million viewers - more than the game itself - when they played the halftime show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 'Lineup': Katy Perry, left, and Rihanna, right, have reportedly been contacted by the NFL to perform at next year's Super Bowl in Arizona - but the requests for them to pay got a 'chilly' reception . Next act? Coldplay is also reportedly among the potential performers for the game next February . Should acts have to pay to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show? According to Nielsen, the Fox telecast of the game between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks drew 112.2 million viewers. The show has long been a key promotional opportunity and some performers, including Beyonce and Bruno Mars, have put tickets to upcoming tours on sale immediately afterwards. As well as selling out these tours, artists have also enjoyed a boost in download sales. Earlier this year, Bruno Mars' second album, 'Unorthodox Jukebox', jumped from number 18 to seven on the Billboard Top 200 following his performance, while his debut album, 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans', jumped from number 82 to 19 on the chart. Previous Super Bowl half-time acts might not have been paid for their performances, but they have reaped the financial benefits long after the trophy has been lifted. With record numbers of viewers tuning in to watch the extravagant show - last year, 115.3 million watched Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers take the stage - the performance gives stars an unparalleled promotional opportunity. After his performance, Mars' second album, 'Unorthodox Jukebox', jumped from . number 18 to number seven on the Billboard Top 200, . while his debut album, 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans', jumped from number 82 . to 19 on the chart. It is not known exactly how much the appearance boosted his earnings, but by June 2014, he had earned $60 million, putting him at number 13 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 this year - his first ever appearance on the list. As Billboard pointed . out, Mars was a relatively new artist compared to previous performers, . who included Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Madonna and Bruce . Springsteen. It meant that his two albums quickly shot up the charts, . while previous artists saw the Super Bowl's impact on sales spread more . equally across numerous albums and songs. After Beyonce's show in 2013, she saw a 68 per cent boost in her track sales, while Madonna experienced a staggering 165 per cent rise in sales following her show in 2012. Astonishingly, The Who saw a 392 per cent increase in sales after their show in 2010, Nielson reported. Some performers, including Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, have also put tickets to upcoming tours on sale immediately afterwards. Beyoncé's 'Mrs. Carter Show', which she announced following her lauded performance at the 2013 game, grossed more than any other that year besides Bon Jovi's, Pollstar reported.","The league 'has asked potential performers if they will contribute a portion of their post-Super Bowl tour income to the NFL'

"By . Reuters Reporter . A cyber attack at a firm that performs background checks for U.S. government employees compromised data of at least 25,000 workers, including some undercover investigators, and that number could rise, agency officials said on Friday. The breach at Falls Church, Virginia-based US Investigations Services (USIS) exposed highly personal information of workers at the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters as well as its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection units, two officials familiar with the investigation into the breach told Reuters. Some employees have already received letters warning them about the breach that say compromised information includes Social Security numbers, education and criminal history, birth dates along with information about spouses, other relatives and friends including their names and addresses. Hacked: The website for United States Investigations Services (USIS) -  a major contractor for the Department of Homeland Security - was hacked on Wednesday, compromising the personal information of U.S. government employees . 'Records including this data were exposed to unauthorized users during the cybersecurity intrusion,' according to a notification letter obtained by Reuters. 'We do not yet know whether the data was actually taken.' One DHS official told Reuters the agency has identified some 25,000 employees whose information it believes were exposed in the breach. 'More could be notified in coming weeks as we learn more about the breach,' said the official, who asked not to be identified by name. The company disclosed the attack earlier this month, but did not say how many records had been compromised or which agencies were affected. It did say the intrusion has 'all the markings of a state-sponsored attack'. Tech Times reported that an internal investigation suggested the attack came from a foreign government. While the number of employees affected is relatively small compared to breaches at retailers such as Target Corp, which have affected tens of millions of customers, security experts say the attack on USIS is nonetheless quite serious. Files on background checks contain highly sensitive data that foreign intelligence agencies could attempt to exploit to intimidate government workers with access to classified information. Compromised: U.S. Investigations Services LLC, based in Falls Church, Virginia (pictured), said in a statement posted Wednesday on its website that experts believe the breach 'has all the markings of a state-sponsored attack' 'They would be collecting this data to identify individuals who might be vulnerable to extortion and recruitment,' said Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which sells intelligence on state-sponsored cyber attacks. The Department of Homeland Security has suspended all work with USIS since the breach was disclosed and the FBI launched an investigation. USIS says it is the biggest commercial provider of background investigations to the federal government, with over 5,700 employees, and provides services in all U.S. states and territories, as well as abroad. Officials with USIS, which is a division of Altegrity Inc, could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Altegrity, which is majority owned by Providence Equity Partners, declined to comment.","United States Investigations Services or USIS is a major contractor for the Department of Homeland Security based in Falls Church, Virginia .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . A man whose nose was sliced off by a meat cleaver in a street fight which left his rapper friend dying has given evidence at the trial of four men accused of the murder. Shajidur Rahman, 20, was left permanently disfigured with deep scars to his face and head in the attack which killed 19-year-old Isaac Stone. The aspiring rapper was allegedly chased and trapped during the fight, before he was punched repeatedly, kicked and stabbed several times, with a wound which penetrated his left lung proving fatal. Scarred: Shajidur Rahman's nose was sliced off with a meat cleaver in a fight in which the 20-year-old's friend Isaac Stone, 19, was fatally stabbed . Attack: Mr Rahman said he tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy'. He said that he was hit a total five or six times before he ran off . Giving evidence at Luton Crown Court, Mr Rahman said he thought the scuffle would be a 'fist fight', and was shocked when he spotted one of the defendants, Fahim Khan, 20, armed with a weapon. Khan, Mohammed Hussain, 22, 19-year-old Rubel Miah and his 21-year-old brother Javed Miah all deny murder and attempted murder, as well as two counts of possession of an offensive weapon. Vincent Coughlin QC, prosecuting, told the court that the 'murderous attack' had taken place in Bedford on the evening of Saturday, January 25 this year - the day after a music video starring Mr Stone, who performed under the name Dynamikk, had been posted on YouTube. The video, entitled Go Missing, also featured a number of the rappers friends, including Mr Rahman, had been made by a media studies student. Victim: Isaac Stone, 19, was punched, kicked and stabbed several times, the court was told, with a wound to his left lung proving fatal . In the course of the film, alcohol was seen being sprayed over a graffiti tag 'Riz', which was painted onto a wall. 'It upset someone,' said the prosecutor. Giving evidence, Mr Rahmah said he had seen two defendants, Rubel Miah and Khan, earlier that night in an alleyway Bedford. He said they told him they had not got a problem with him, but had a issue with Mr Stone and another youth. Earlier in the trial, the jury was told that some of the four defendants, who are all from Bedford, had paid £150 to hire a white Range Rover 'perhaps for show', before buying two meat cleavers for £2.99 each from a hardware shop. Mr Rahman said that later, he was in a Corsa driven by Mr Stone when they saw the hired Range Rover that Rubel Miah and Khan had got into. 'Everyone froze,' he told the court. 'We said ""we have got to sort it"". We never anticipated it would lead to what happened. 'It happened so quick. We stopped. We did not think weapons were involved. We thought it was a fist fight. 'Issac said ""They have got something in their hands"".' Mr Rahman said that as he and Mr Stone got out of their car, Rubel Miah and Khan came towards them. 'Fahim came up to me,' he said. 'I thought he had a hammer. It had a blue wrapping over the handle. I got hit by Fahim. I didn’t know at the time that it was a meat cleaver.' Mr Rahman said he tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy'. He said that he was hit a total five or six times before he ran off. Evidence: Luton Crown Court was told that Mr Rahman had suffered four deep cuts to his face, and his nose was effectively sliced off . The court was told he had suffered four deep cuts to his face, and his nose was effectively sliced off, with the cut off part left at the scene. As he escaped he said he saw four or five shapes on his left and that he now realised one of them was Mr Stone. He said he was unable to get a taxi to hospital, but called a friend who took him. Following their arrest, three of the defendants made no comment when questioned by detectives, while Khan said he was not responsible for the injuries and was acting in self defence. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Shajidur Rahman, 20, was left permanently disfigured in the fight in Bedford .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A Texas father's claims that he did not fatally shoot a drunken driver who caused an accident that killed his two sons appeared to be bolstered on Wednesday by testimony from prosecution witnesses. Two of the witnesses - a current deputy and a former one - told jurors they failed to note in reports that more gunfire had taken place well after the driver was shot. A third witness, a cousin of the motorist, gave contradictory testimony about whether David Barajas had hit Jose Banda before allegedly shooting him. David Barajas, center, leaves the courthouse during a break in his murder trial on Wednesday. He is accused of fatally shooting Jose Banda in December 2012 . Barajas, 32, is accused of fatally shooting the 20-year-old Banda in December 2012 near Alvin minutes after Banda plowed into a vehicle that Barajas and his two sons had been pushing on a rural road. Twelve-year-old David Jr. and 11-year-old Caleb were killed. Barajas' truck had run out of gas about 100 yards from the family's home. Barajas' attorney, Sam Cammack, has told jurors his client did not kill Banda and was focused only on saving his sons. A current deputy with the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office and a former deputy with the department told jurors they failed to note in reports that they had heard more gunfire after arriving at the crash site. Ex-deputy Lloyd Anderson, who told jurors he was fired for not including more details in his reports, said he probably did inform an investigator about the gunfire. 'You have someone at the scene who was shot in the head in the passenger seat of the vehicle, information that someone fled the scene and after that you still heard gunfire, why didn't you put that in your report?' Cammack asked the former deputy. Family snapshot: The Barajas family (from left) Cindy Barajas, Jenessah Barajas, Caleb Barajas, David Barajas and David Barajas Jr. Caleb and David Jr. were tragically killed during a Dec 2012 accident near their home in Alvin, Texas . David Barajas' attorney, Sam Cammack, told jurors his client did not kill Banda and was focused only on saving his sons . Anderson responded, 'Those details were not pertinent at the time.' When Cammack asked another deputy, Jason Knopp, why he failed to include the gunfire detail in his report, Knopp said, 'No answer for it, sir.' Cammack has focused his efforts at Barajas' trial, which began on Tuesday, on suggesting to jurors that authorities unfairly zeroed in on a grieving father as the killer without fully investigating other possible suspects. Cammack has suggested Banda could have been shot by several other people who witnesses say fled the crash site. Anderson said a search the night of the accident failed to find any individuals who had reportedly fled the scene. Gerardo Tellez, Banda's cousin, testified that he and Banda had become intoxicated on Jagermeister and possibly beer on the day of the accident. Tellez said he followed Banda home and witnessed his cousin slam into Barajas' truck. Tellez said he fled after seeing the 'body parts' of the boys on the road. He said before leaving he saw Barajas approach Banda's vehicle and start punching Banda through the driver's side window. Supporters of the Jose Banda family enter the courtroom in Angleton: Many residents in Alvin support Barajas and some have said they might have done the same thing in a similar situation . Brothers: Caleb, left, and David Jr., right, were killed as they pushed their father's truck on a rural road after it had broken down . Cammack later showed jurors a crime scene photo of Banda's car and the driver's side window was up. 'You're going to stick with that even though we saw (the photo with the window up)?' Cammack asked Tellez. 'Yes,' Tellez replied. Tellez and Banda's half-brother, Antonio Rodriguez, who also testified, said they were following Banda home in another vehicle after a night of drinking when the crash occurred. Details of Rodriguez's testimony also contradicted his cousin's account of the night, including whether Barajas was inside or outside of the truck after the crash. Both men admitted to leaving the scene after a confrontation with Barajas. Neither called 911 and did not contact authorities until days after the incident. During each of their testimonies, the men told jurors they were in shock and expressed remorse. Barajas walks with his wife, Cindy Barajas, left, and his step mother, right, Betty Hernandez towards court on Tuesday morning: In dash-camera video played for jurors Cindy Barajas can be heard screaming, 'No, not my babies' 'What happened was horrific,' Tellez said from the witness stand, his voice cracking. 'It was horrible.' Legal experts have said the case could be difficult to prosecute given the lack of hard evidence: no weapon was recovered, no witnesses identified Barajas as the shooter and gunshot residue tests done on Barajas came back negative. If convicted, Barajas faces up to life in prison. An even greater challenge for prosecutors could be overcoming sympathy for Barajas. Many residents in Alvin, 30 miles southeast of Houston, have supported Barajas. Some have said they might have done the same thing in a similar situation. Despite no murder weapon, prosecutors have said they have other evidence, including ammunition found at Barajas' home that they say is similar to a bullet fragment found in Banda's car. Cammack says police found a shell casing for a different weapon, a 9mm handgun, at the scene and that Barajas couldn't have had enough time to retrieve a gun from his home and shoot Banda before authorities arrived. During ex-deputy Anderson's testimony, dash-camera video from his patrol vehicle of the crash site was played for jurors. In the video, Cindy Barajas, the boys' mother, can be heard screaming, 'No, not my babies.'","David Barajas, 32, is accused of shooting Jose Banda in December 2012 near Alvin, Texas, minutes after Banda drove into and killed his two sons .

In June 2012, Brisbane-born Matthew, suffered from a severe case of toxic shock syndrome which almost claimed his life. The fate of Mr Ames laid with his wife Diane, who was told that her husband's only chance of survival was to have all four of his limbs removed. She told them to proceed with the operation - the first of its kind at the hospital - and he survived. Matthew is set to 'roll' his way through a 5km charity fun run 'Bridge to Brisbane' in hope of creating awareness for Amputees and Families Support Group Qld Inc . Matthew is now in the process of being the world's first 'bionic man'. The process, called osseointegration, involves two surgeries on each limb. In the first, an implant is placed inside his bone which sits there for six months to allow the bone to grow around it. During the second stage, a bolt is fitted to the implant that protrudes through the skin. He is currently six to 12 months away from having what he calls 'whizz bang bionics' fitted to the bolts, which include bionic hands that he can operate by flexing his biceps and triceps. The prosthetics cost half a million dollars – $150,000 for each arm and $100,000 for each leg – and Matthew requires a new set every six years. To fund the surgeries, the couple started a foundation, Renovating Matthew, and were overwhelmed with the response from the community, receiving enough donations to pay their medical costs for the next 10 years. Thanks to the support from his local community and AFSGQ, Matthew  was able to begin his life without all four limbs as comfortable as possible. Now Matthew wants to help AFSGQ find the funds to survive . Thanks to the support from his local community and Amputees and Families Support Group Qld Inc (AFSGQ), Matthew  was able to begin his life without all four limbs as comfortable as possible. But now, the government funded organization dedicated to helping amputees and their families much like the Ames family, have been given till December next year to find a new source of funding. The Queensland health reform is in the process of stripping funds from 20 amputee support groups like AFSGQ, to further invest in medicare applicants and a St Vincents hospital. Cossette Thompson, AFSGQ’s state coordinator told Daily Mail Australia that the government gave no reason as to why its annual $46,000 funding will soon cease. 'We came from a small office that was three metres by three metres and recently expanded to a huge community centre, so to take away our funding just as we up-sized is a real low blow,' she said. But for Ms Thompson, who knows from first hand experience the struggles of an amputee - her father lost his left leg after being run over by a train -  the real concern is trying to find the funds to continue supporting amputees and their families. 'Just by having someone else who has been there done that and actually understand what it's like to get out of bed and get dressed with one arm or trying to get to the toilet on time. 'I did have one couple say to me that I saved their marriage because we were supporting both of them and when life was really hard we were there to support the family, ' Ms Thompson said. Matthew and Diane Ames wrote a book about their experience, released in August this year . If AFSGQ and the other 20 organizations do not find the funding required to survive, Ms Thompson fears this reform could put Australia back into the dark ages, 'when you had your leg cut off and that was that.' 'It means that families could experience domestic violence or relationship break ups and they won't get the information or guidance services they require.' When speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Ames mentioned that he would like to see Australians be more inclusive of those around them who struggle. The thought of loosing AFSGQ as support, has promoted Mr Ames to participate in the charity fun run, 'Bridge to Brisbane'. AFSGQ hopes Matthew 'rolling' in the 'Bridge to Brisbane' will create awareness of how the organization has helped amputees in Queensland. 'We want people to know we exist and hopefully businesses or philanthropy funds will come on board to help support and raise the funds,' Ms Thompson said. Mr Ames told the Brisbane Times that 'there is already so little help for new amputees.' The former energy and resource executive will be rolling in the 'Bridge to Brisbane' on September 7th, with two of his friends by his side. Diane and his four children will be waiting for him at the finish line, cheering him on. The overwhelming amount of support Matthew and his wife Diane received inspired the couple to write a book - Will to Live. 'It was a pretty difficult decision to open up with that level of detail. But I think the experience we had with the community and the consistent feedback we got about how our story had helped others, we wanted to help other people,' Diane told Daily Mail Australia. 'Out of something disastrous or something tragic, there's been some good that's come out of it and if we can share that with other people, if people take something positive from it, that would be great,' she said.","'Bionic man' Matthew Ames is getting ready to 'roll' his way through Brisbane for a 5km charity fun run .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Thousands of music fans have started their pilgrimage to Reading and Leeds for two of the biggest highlights in the festival calendar. The overwhelming majority of each site's 100,000 revellers are in their late teens, with many celebrating GCSE results day today. And it seems their celebrations won't be dampened as both festivals look set to dodge the rain. Despite downpours this week, Leeds looks set to remain dry until next week, and Reading will also bask in the sunshine, forecasters say. Scroll down for video . Hunters at the ready: These girls dressed in classic Reading Festival uniform with shorts and Hunter wellies in case of rain - but it looks set to be dry and sunny . Pilgrimage: Reading's annual rock festival - the world's oldest - has become a ritual for teenagers in the wake of A Level and GCSE results, which came out this week . Kitted out: 200 miles north east of Reading's Richfield Avenue, these girls plodded to Bramham, near Wetherby, for the twin festival in Leeds . Reading's annual rock festival - the world's oldest - opened its gates at 8am today, with revellers pouring in on buses, coaches and trains lugging camping gear - and wheelbarrows of beer. It was an identical scene 200 miles north east, with festival-goers loading their bags into trolleys from supermarkets as they powered towards the country estate in Bramham, near Wetherby. The two festivals are twinned and share the same set. American pop punk stars Blink-182 will open for Leeds on Friday, before heading down to Reading's Richfield Avenue to bring the festival to a close on Sunday night. Other headliners include Paramore, Queens of the Stone Age, and Arctic Monkeys. Bryony Harrison, aged 17, from Hull, East Yorkshire, travelled down to Reading and soaked up the atmosphere with friends who all wore fluorescent face paint. Rammed: It doesn't start until tomorrow, but Richfield Avenue is already a sea of colourful tents filled with festival-goers to see Blink 182 and the Arctic Monkeys . Twin line-ups: Acts will start at either Reading or Leeds before driving to the other site to play to another 100,000 revellers in the annual festival calendar highlight . Popular: Reading festival started in 1961 and attracted a few hundred music fans with tickets priced at just £2 for the weekend. It now attracts more than 90,000 people . 'This is my first time here and it's great,' she said. 'I can't wait to see Arctic Monkeys and Disclosure.' School friends Chloe Morris, Hannah Bailey, Hannah Campbell, Talulah Farrier, and Rebecca Sneddon, all 16 years old, got straight on the train after picking up their GCSE results at school in Bromley, Kent, for three-day weekend in Reading. 'We are all celebrating,' said Chloe, adding: 'This is our first time here and we have absolutely no idea what to expect. I'm here for Arctic Monkeys and a few other bands.' The beer was flowing early. George Farrell and pals were struggling along carrying 186 cans of lager and cider. Stocked up: The leader of this group powers ahead determinedly through the gloomy rain in Leeds clutching three crates of Budweiser for the weekend . Dreary: These girls looked weary as they trekked through the drizzling rain, which will continue through this evening before subsiding in time for the main acts . Comfy stay: Many made sure they had ample bedding for the three nights between acts such as Rudimental, Paramore and Queens Of The Stone Age . 'This will probably do us for tonight,' joked the 17-year-old college student from near Brighton, East Sussex, who said he had bought the beer from a street seller nearby. There were spots of rain in the air as the crowds arrived but the forecast is for cool, cloudy conditions for most of the weekend. Rain is forecast for Monday when the site closes. Sisters Katrina and Gabriella Holmes from Littlehampton, West Sussex, struggled into the entrance with their heavy bags. 'It's my first time here and I'm really excited. I'm looking forward to seeing The 1975,' said Gabriella, aged 16. There were spots of rain in the air as the crowds arrived at Richfield Avenue but the forecast is for cool, cloudy conditions for most of the weekend . The day has arrived: Festival-goers look excited as they finally arrive at Reading, two months after tickets for both festivals sold out online . Reading Festival began life as The National Jazz Festival in Plumpton, East Sussex, in 1961, with weekend tickets costing just £2 pounds. It changed its name to The National Blues & Jazz Festival in 1962, moved to Reading in 1972 and is known today for showcasing a large variety of rock and alternative bands. In 1999, it had become so successful, owners Festival Republic decided to launch a second prong in Leeds. A weekend camping ticket now costs £205, and all had been snapped up two months ago. A few thousand festival goers had already arrived Wednesday evening after purchasing 'early bird' tickets to get the best camping spots. However, the majority arrived today ahead of acts taking to the stages from 11.30am Friday.","Around 200,000 revellers, mostly teenagers, flocked to Reading and Leeds for this weekend's three-day festival .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and MailOnline Reporter . The ex-girlfriend of Pedro Bravo, the Florida college student who murdered her new boyfriend in a fit of jealous rage, has spoken of her heartbreak over the brutal act, saying ‘he tricked us into thinking he wouldn’t hurt a fly’. Erika Friman told ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview for 20/20 that it was hard to believe that the smart, charismatic student she once dated was a murderer. She said: ‘He kind of tricked us all, thinking, you know, this guy that’s shy and he wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ Disgusted: Erika Friman, the former girlfriend of Pedro Bravo said he tricked everyone . Love triangle: Erika Friman, the former girlfriend of Pedro Bravo and Christian Aguilar, listened to Circuit Court Judge James Colaw sentence Bravo to life in prison for Aguilar's murder . Sentenced: Pedro Bravo sits in court after being sentenced to life in prison . But the Miami student was convicted of first-degree murder last week, after prosecutors successfully argued that he'd strangled 18-year-old Christian Aguilar, who Friman said was 'the love of her life'. She had not told Bravo about her new romance after they'd broken up. Speaking about Bravo, Friman added: 'This was a person we knew. This was intentional, it makes it all so much worse. It’s like the knife just turns in your heart kind of thing. 'It sounds like the mind of a sociopath, or a sick person.' The family of Aguilar watched in the courtroom as 20-year-old Bravo was found guilty. 'A lot of it was his obsession for me, and how he wanted me back and how he wanted to be with me,’ Friman said. After a two-week trial, the jury in Gainesville also convicted Bravo of six other counts related to Aguilar's death. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty and Judge James Colaw sentenced Bravo to life in prison without the possibility of parole. When Friman started dating Bravo she said he made her laugh, but by their senior year, he started to wear on her. She told him she wanted to take a break from their relationship, but Bravo wouldn’t accept it and appeared depressed. She said: 'I felt like he almost manipulated me at that point in my life, where he was kind of like, ‘if we do these things, we’ll never be the same.' 'I was really concerned that, I don’t know, something bad would happen if we took a break.’ When they broke up, Friman said Bravo was very emotional and cried, but she felt like a weight had just been lifted. Aguilar's parents and family were silent as the verdicts were read. They left the courtroom hugging and began crying outside. Bravo watched the clerk read the verdict with no reaction. He appeared calm. Aguilar's father, Carlos Aguilar, addressed the court before Bravo's sentencing. 'I cannot tell you the quantity of pain that we have been going through,' he said. The victim's brother Alexander said, 'It’s been agonizing - so much pain and agony' according to The Miami Herald. 'I am now a student at the University of Florida. I would have loved to spend time with my brother here but that is never going to happen. I trusted the jury and they didn’t fail me.' The victim's mother, Claudia Aguilar, said '[Bravo] made the most terrible decision for me and my family,' according to the newspaper. Mother: Claudia Aguilar, the mother of slain University of Florida student Christian Aguilar, cries with family . Brother: Alex Aguilar, left, the younger brother of slain University of Florida student Christian Aguilar is seen red-eyed at the Alachua County Criminal Justice Center after Bravo was convicted . Embrace: Diego Aguilar, the uncle of slain University of Florida student Christian Aguilar, hugs his nephew Alex, who is Christian's younger brother, and Christian's mother, Claudia, in the family's private room at the Alachua County Criminal Justice Center following the guilty verdict of Pedro Bravo . Diego Aguilar, center, the uncle of slain University of Florida student Christian Aguilar, hugs his son Diego . Carlos Aguilar earlier said 'The . reality is the verdict will not bring my son back. But Pedro was held . accountable. I promised Christian at his burial that there would be . justice' while speaking to The Herald. Bravo had pleaded not guilty, saying he and Aguilar got into a fist fight the day the college student died but that he left Aguilar alive. Bravo remained defiant before his sentencing, rising and walking to the podium to speak. 'I know in my heart I did not do anything to hurt my friend that would cause him to die,' Bravo said to gasps in the courtroom. 'I know in my heart what I did, I know God knows what I did. I'll take life or life without parole, and I'll do it.' Investigators found Aguilar's blood in Bravo's car and presented evidence that Bravo researched ways to drug people and dispose of bodies. Aguilar's body was found in the woods. Victim: Pedro Bravo was convicted of killing college student Christian Aguilar, pictured .

Standing together: Alex Aguilar, second from left, leaves the courtroom with lead Detective Randy Roberts of the Gainesville Police Department at left . Aguilar and Bravo knew each other from their days at Doral Academy, a high school in Miami. Bravo had dated Friman, who was also a student, while at Doral, but she and Aguilar had begun dating when the two moved to Gainesville for college. Prosecutors presented reams of writings by Bravo that showed he was obsessed with Friman, so much so that he decided not to attend Florida International University so he could move to Gainesville and pursue her. But when he arrived, Bravo learned Friman had begun seeing Aguilar. Bravo bought what prosecutor's called a 'murderer's starting pack' including a shovel, duct tape and enough sleeping drugs to knock someone out. For days, Aguilar ducked Bravo's attempts to meet with him. But after a mutual friend approached him on Bravo's behalf, Aguilar reluctantly agreed in an effort to help with Bravo's depression. On September 20, the two spent hours together eating and buying a CD at Best Buy. Prosecutors say the two men were in Bravo's SUV in a Wal-Mart parking lot when Bravo slipped into the backseat, grabbed a strap, and choked Aguilar to death. Taking the stand in his own defense, Bravo said he and Aguilar fought, and that he left his friend lying injured on the ground. But Aguilar was still alive, Bravo said. The Gainesville Police Department released a statement, saying 'The men and women of the Gainesville Police Department stand relieved with the family of Christian Aguilar as a jury found Pedro Bravo guilty of 1st Degree Murder. 'For weeks, members of the Gainesville Police investigated the disappearance of Christian Aguilar and searched tirelessly for him.  It quickly became clear that a missing persons case had turned into a Murder case.  A very detailed investigation was completed that revealed Pedro Bravo was undoubtedly responsible for the murder of Christian Aguilar.' 'I am relieved,' Friman told The Miami Herald. 'I am exhausted. It’s been a long two years but I feel like the weight has finally been lifted off of us.' College student: Pedrp Bravo had dated Erika Friman, who was also a student, while at Doral, but she and Christian Aguilar (pictured) had begun dating when the two moved to Gainesville for college . Convicted: Pedro Bravo was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Christian Aguilar . Friman added to 20/20: 'People tell me all the time, ‘oh you’re so strong, you’re so brave,’ and I look at them, and I’m kind of just like, ‘well, if you were in my shoes, you would do the same thing, you would testify,’ she said. 'If it was the love of your life you lost, and this is the one thing you can do for him, for his family, for his memory, you would find a way to pull it all together. Friman said there isn't a day that goes by that she doesn't think about Aguilar. She believes if he were alive today, they would have gotten married. 'I think we were soul mates,' she said. 'You don’t expect to lose your love that young, and not in such a traumatic way… [but] at the end of the day, when I think of all these unknowns, I think of how much Christian loved me, and that’s kind of what gets my through it.'","Erika Friman said it was hard to believe that the smart, .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . She once called Donald Trump 'a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb.' This week, he remembered her as 'an impossible person.' The woman who became a folk hero for resisting decades-long efforts by big-name developers like Trump to displace her Atlantic City boardinghouse is now 86 and, at last, has sold. The 29-room property Vera Coking and her husband bought for $20,000 in 1961 and fought to hold onto went at auction Thursday afternoon for $530,000 plus 10 percent commission, said Joshua Olshin of AuctionAdvisors, which handled the sale. Bidding started at $199,000, priced to sell in Atlantic City's depressed real estate market. Vera Coking has moved to California to be near her family. And the 29-room property she and her husband bought for $20,000 in 1961 and fought to hold onto is on the auction block Thursday for a $199,000 starting bid. The now-vacant property had been listed for $995,000 since September. Holding out: Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino towers over Vera Coking's three story rooming house, the decrepit boarding home owned by Vera Coking . The long-running saga has paralleled the rise and fall of Atlantic City's real estate fortunes, which in recent months imploded. The decision to auction the property was made by Coking's family after they could not find a buyer in recent years, said Oren Klein of AuctionAdvisors, which is handling the sale. The road to the auction block has been circuitous. Coking first took on Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione in the 1970s, who was reportedly so angered by her refusal to sell that he started building his casino above and around her property. Trump, who bought Guccione's unfinished project, also tried to buy Coking's building to tear it down and use the land for his Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. Coking battled with Trump and prevailed in a 1998 state Supreme Court case that blocked attempts by the state to use eminent domain to condemn the property. Coking's one-woman battle was closely followed in the press and by the people of Atlantic City, where she and her property, sitting defiantly in the shadow of Trump's casino, have been a familiar sight for decades. Triumphant: In this 1997 file photo Vera Coking walks past Donald Trump, partially obscured against wall at left, in a courtroom hallway at Atlantic County Superior Court. Coking, who became a folk hero for resisting decades-long efforts by developers like Trump to displace her Atlantic City boardinghouse, is now 91 and ready to sell . The modest, three-story clapboard structure is a block from the famous Atlantic City boardwalk and adjacent to the casinos, that like Trump's, have sought to expand their parking facilities or outdoor footprint. AuctionAdvisors has been stressing the boardinghouse's location just steps from a planned Bass Pro shop and adjacent to an outlet mall that the city advertises as a main attraction. Klein and his associates say that they are confident that Atlantic City will bounce back and that the Coking property is a great buy in one of the last affordable beachfront towns in New Jersey. Since then, Atlantic City's real estate market and casino businesses have faltered. Trump Plaza may close in September, although Trump himself is largely divested. The portrait of Coking as a principled holdout is wrong, Trump said, asserting that she had been willing to sell but that they could never agree on a price. 'A crumb': Vera Coking had some choice words for Trump, who in turn called her a 'difficult person' 'She could have lived happily ever after in Palm Beach, Florida; instead, she was an impossible person to deal with,' Trump told The Associated Press this week. In addition to millions of dollars, he said, he had offered Coking housing for the rest of her life in one of his properties. The famously stubborn Trump laughed off a question as to whether he would bid on Coking's home — just to have the last word. Coking's grandson, Ed Casey, previously told the Press of Atlantic City that it wasn't true his grandmother had once been offered millions. He said she wasn't opposed to selling but was proud to live in and fight for her longtime home. Messages left at a California listing for Casey were not returned, and Klein said the family had told him they no longer wished to speak publicly about the matter. Information about Coking's health wasn't available. But back in the day, Coking wasn't afraid to throw a zinger. At the height of their battle in 1998, the 70-year-old Coking said of Trump to the New York Daily News: 'A maggot, a cockroach and a crumb, that's what he is.' 'If Trump's thinking I'm gonna die tomorrow, he's having himself a pipe dream,' she said then. 'I'm gonna be here for a long, long time. I'll stay just to see he's not getting my house. We'll be going to his funeral, you can count on that.'","Vera Coking, 91, is sells Atlantic City boarding house at auction for $530,000 .

"By . Ashley Collman . For less than $1million, you can live in a piece of American history by buying up one of the four homes currently for sale on the nation's oldest housing block. Currently there are three homes for sale on Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia's historic Old City neighborhood, with another home expected to hit the market by mid-August. 'Our nation's oldest residential street', which dates back to 1702, was named after Jeremiah Elfreth, an 18th century blacksmith and property owner. Scroll down for video . American history: Elfreth's Alley is the oldest continually residential street in the United States. The four homes currently for sale on the alley range in price from $649,000 to $850,000 . The 32 Georgian and Federal Style homes on either side of the cobblestone alley were built between 1728 and 1836 for tradesmen and their families. The early owners included shipwrights, silver and pewter smiths, glassblowers and furniture builders. The demographics on the street changed over the centuries and became predominantly Irish in the 1900s, when more immigrants were moving to that area of town. In 1932, the Elfreth's Alley Association was formed to preserve the street's historic homes and save them from demolition. The EAA also restored the street's original name, after it was changed to Cherry Street for some years. The street has been designated a National Historic Landmark with it's own museum at 124-126 Elfreth's Alley. Then: Views of the historic street taken in 1960.

Current homeowners on the street continue to share the history of their street with the public, by opening their homes for tours in June and around Christmas. Realtor Adam Atacan told Philly.com that the currently surplus of homes for sale on the street is unusual in that the street has averaged one home sale every two years since 1992. But he notes that there has been increased buying and selling activity in the past few years. In the last 18 months, three homes on the street have been sold. The current homes for sale are also rare since they are the more modern-sized homes on the north side of the street. 'Homes on the north side of the street are larger – they’re built . federal style – and slightly newer, so folks tend to hold on to them . more,' he said. Realtors say the spike in 'for sale' signs probably indicate a confidence in the improving real estate market. This is the fourth time in 20 years that this many properties on Elfreth's Alley have been available at the same time. Listing price $795,000Square footage: 2,600Three bedrooms, three bathrooms . Old-world features: 123 Elfreth's Alley is called the Baker's House, for the original brick oven in the basement that was used by the early owners to bake for the neighborhood . The Federal Style home with red shingles as 123 Elfreth's Alley is called the 'Baker's House' since a large brick oven still in the basement is where the early owners baked for the neighborhood. A living room, dining room and eat-in kitchen with garden access are located on the first floor, while the master bedroom is located on the second floor. The master bedroom comes with three closets and an adjacent den with built-in bookcases. The master bath is decked out with marble finishes and a Jacuzzi tub. Two other bedrooms are found up another floor, along with a sitting room and full bathroom. An enclosed stairway on the third floor leads to a private roof deck that overlooks some of Old City's landmarks like Christ Church steeple and Ben Franklin Bridge. The listing agent points out that it's the perfect place to watch Fourth of July fireworks along the Delaware River. The home's basement has also been fully-renovated and turned into a family/media room with full bathroom, exposed beam ceiling and the original brick oven. There are five fireplaces total in the house alone with all new appliances. As a perk, the homeowners are offering to pay for the buyer's dedicated parking spot on the alley for the first year. Current owners Amy Bluemle and David Cohen told The Republic that they love the house they've owned since 2001, but are looking to find something with more space for their growing sons.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . These heart-warming images show the extraordinary lengths one nurse has gone to in her campaign to care for cats dying of leukemia. Maria Torero, 45, of Lima, Peru, has turned her two-story, eight-room apartment into a feline hospice housing 175 patients and spends a staggering $1,785 a month on their care. The mother-of-three meticulously doses out medicine while also regularly treating the cats for parasites - she even knits them shirts and jumpers to wear when it gets chilly. Scroll down for video . Maria Torero, 45, of Lima, Peru, has turned her two-story, eight room apartment into a feline hospice housing 175 patients and spends a staggering $1,785 a month on their care . The mother-of-three meticulously doses out medicine while also treating all of the cats for parasites . While some of the moggies sleep in their own bunk-beds, many more end up sprawled over every piece of furniture in the house - which they share with Ms Torero's three children, aged six, 14 and 16. The cluttered apartment is totally consumed by cat litters, food and water bowls - leaving barely enough room to walk around. To make her life easier, friends have suggested she care for healthy cats instead but Ms Torero insists she is doing the right thing. She said: 'That's not my role. I'm a nurse. My duty is to the cats that nobody cares about. People don't adopt adult cats, especially if they are terminally ill.' The cat boxes and heavy use of deodorants fail to mask the powerful odour of urine, but Ms Torero said her neighbors have not yet complained (pictured - one of Ms Torero's children naps with the sick cats) Many street cats in Lima turn out to have the disease, as well as fleas, parasites and malnutrition . For five years she has nursed unwanted strays  as they slowly succumb to the common, fatal retrovirus, which is not contagious to humans or other species. She finds them in Lima's streets and market places and has them tested for leukemia. Many street cats turn out to have the disease, as well as fleas, parasites and malnutrition and she says she only takes in adult cats to avoid spreading the disease to new generations. Leukemia in cats is usually transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and the sharing of litter boxes, food and water bowls . One of the 175 cats in Maria Torero's makeshift hospice in Lima stares out the window wearing one of the jumpers she lovingly makes for them . She added: 'Bringing a kitten here is condemning it to death.' Each cat has a name - Fellini, Peppa, Dolly, Misterio among them - and Ms Torero dresses most in small shirts and jumpers claiming that 'each one has a distinct personality'. She said she gives out medicine, sterilizes the animals and treats them for parasites every two months. Her arms bear the scratches of cats that resist the injections. The nurse spends around $1,785 a month on care for the cats - half of that amount coming from donations, the other half  her own modest wages. The nurse lovingly holds a sick cat as she reaches into her medicine cabinet . She claims 'my best gift of love and respect I give them in life' Despite using strong deodorants, the apartment gives off an overpowering smell of urine but Ms Torero said her neighbors have not yet complained. Leukemia in cats is usually transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and the sharing of litter boxes, food and water bowls, according to the website of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. They can survive for several years, though their expected lifespan is much shorter than that of an unaffected cat. As Torero lacks the resources to have the animals put down, they eventually die naturally, without any ceremony. She added: 'My best gift of love and respect I give them in life.'","Maria Torero, 45, of Lima, Peru, turns apartment into sick feline hospice .

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . California's attorney general said yesterday that she will appeal a federal court ruling that called the state's death penalty unconstitutional. The announcement by Attorney General Kamala Harris came after District Judge Cormac Carney in Los Angeles ruled last month that the state's death penalty takes too long to carry out, and that the unpredictable delays are arbitrary and unfair. Death penalty opponents have long argued that California's delays amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, which is unconstitutional. Until Judge Carney's ruling, the argument failed to persuade a judge. California Attorney General Kamala Harris is appealing a federal court ruling that called the state's death penalty unconstitutional . Harris, however, said the amount of time it takes to execute inmates in California ensures they receive due process. 'I am appealing the court's decision because it is not supported by the law, and it undermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants,' Attorney General Harris said in a prepared statement. 'This flawed ruling requires appellate review.' Capital punishment opponents had called on Attorney General Harris to let Judge Carney's ruling stand rather than risk it being overturned in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. 'We hope the 9th Circuit will recognise that California's death penalty system is as broken and unconstitutional as Judge Cormac found,' Matt Cherry, the executive director of Death Penalty Focus, which seeks to abolish capital punishment, said in response to Harris's move. Death penalty backers supported Attorney General Harris's decision. 'It is obviously the correct decision to make,' said Kent Scheidegger, the top lawyer at the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento. Judge Carney's ruling overturned the death sentence of Ernest Dewayne Jones (above), a Los Angeles man sentenced to die for the 1992 rape and murder of his girlfriend's mother . Mr Scheidegger was attending a death penalty conference for government lawyers in San Diego and said that the initial ruling by Judge Carney 'has been the talk in the hallways' among attendees. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit is often viewed as a liberal-leaning court, but the three-judge panel that will consider the appeal by Harris will be randomly selected from the entire court of more than two dozen judges of varying political pedigrees. 'You never know what you're going to get,' Mr Scheidegger said of the 9th Circuit's three-judge panels. Attorney General Harris has said she personally opposes the death penalty but promised voters she would enforce state law. Judge Carney's ruling overturned the death sentence of Ernest Dewayne Jones, a Los Angeles man sentenced to die for the 1992 rape and murder of his girlfriend's mother. Since the current death penalty system was adopted 35 years ago, the judge noted, more than 900 people have been sentenced to death but only 13 have been executed. No executions have been carried out in California since 2006 after another federal judge ordered an overhaul of the state's lethal injection procedures . The judge called the death penalty an empty promise that violates the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. 'Inordinate and unpredictable delay has resulted in a death penalty system in which very few of the hundreds of individuals sentenced to death have been, or even will be, executed by the state,' wrote Judge Carney, a George W. Bush appointee. He noted that death penalty appeals can last decades and, as a result, most condemned inmates are likely to die of natural causes before their executions are carried out. No executions have been carried out in California since 2006 after another federal judge ordered an overhaul of the state's lethal injection procedures. In addition, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is drafting new lethal injection regulations after Governor Jerry Brown said the state would switch from a three-drug cocktail to a single-drug lethal injection. No executions can occur until the new rules are adopted.","Death penalty delays amount to 'cruel and unusual punishment', which is unconstitutional say opponents .

"By . Laura Clark for the Daily Mail . GCSE English pupils have been harshly graded following sweeping reforms, furious teachers claimed last night. With more than 600,000 teenagers collecting their results today, head teachers are warning of  ‘surprises’ in English that have seen wild swings in grades compared with last year. Head teachers receive GCSE results a day before their pupils, and one said she was ‘absolutely furious’ that her school had seen a drop of 18 percentage points in the proportion of pupils getting at least a grade C. There are also concerns about maths which, with English, is central to pupils’ chances of getting into sixth-forms and landing jobs. Scroll down for video . There have been particular concerns about English tests, with teachers complaining of 'very tough' pass marks . With a series of Coalition reforms converging on GCSEs this year, results will be the most ‘volatile’ in the exam’s history. Headline pass rates are expected to edge up after rules were introduced which discourage schools from entering pupils for GCSEs a year or two early. But schools which ‘gamed’ the system by giving over-generous marks on teacher assessments and entering pupils for exams multiple times face a ‘sharp shock’, it was claimed. There were particular concerns about English, with heads complaining of ‘very tough’ pass marks. It follows changes to GCSE English aimed at cracking down on teacher assessments, which exam chiefs suspected were marked too generously. Oral presentations assessed by teachers are no longer counted towards the final grade, while written exams account for 60 per cent of the total instead of 40 per cent. Students' written exams now count for 60 per cent of the total instead of 40 per cent. Stock image used . Any drop in English results piles pressure on schools which are required to meet basic ‘floor’ standards or face being forcibly taken over by outside sponsors. One head told the TES teachers’ journal that her school had seen a drop of 18 percentage points in the proportion of students achieving at least a grade C in English. ‘We’re absolutely furious. Our overall results are now below the floor target and it’s all down to English. The kids are going to be distraught,’ she said. Heads took to Twitter to warn that ‘English looks very tough this year’. One tweeted: ‘Some shocking stories emerging from schools about way-below outcomes against predictions.’ Another added: ‘The world has gone truly mad.’ Brian Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said several union members had come forward with concerns about ‘surprises’ in their grades. ‘Clearly some schools have had some surprises,’ he said. ‘English is the main one, and we’re also hearing about some surprises in maths.’ Bill Watkin, operational director at the SSAT schools network, described reports from schools so far as a ‘mixed picture’. He added: ‘Unsurprisingly if you’ve got more rigorous courses followed by more rigorous tests, teachers can do the same job that they’ve been doing all along but get slightly lower results.’ Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment at Buckingham University, said: ‘Individual schools are likely to be affected differently according to how much they relied on gaming the old system, so for some there could be sharp shocks in store.’ In an open letter to schools, Ofqual said: ‘Our priority this summer, as in previous years, is to hold standards steady so that in general, students in 2014 are not advantaged or disadvantaged because of the changes.’","Pupils have been graded harshly following education reforms, teachers say .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Huge landslides in the outskirts of Hiroshima have killed at least 36 people after a wall of mud sparked by torrential rain wiped out dozens of houses burying many alive. Rescuers in Japan are still trying to work through piles of wreckage in their bid to find the seven people missing - with one heroic volunteer, 53, dying in a secondary landslide after he had pulled five people to safety. Aerial shots show houses buried in thick slurry, their wooden frames splintered by the weight of the mud as torrents of brown water seep through broken buildings hampering rescue efforts. A family wait to find out if their relatives have been rescued after a devastating series of landslides killed at least 36 people today . A rescue helicopter flys over the damage caused by a landslide - its course through the trees leaving a trail of debris and uprooted trees . With some still trapped, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, has deployed troops to the area and said considerable resources will spent on aid for the disaster . Earlier today, while many were believed trapped, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, deployed troops to the area and said considerable resources would be spent on aid for the disaster. Commenting on the missing residents, local government official, Nakatoshi Okamoto, said: ' A few people were washed away and it is hard to know exactly how many are unaccounted for.' Soldiers are still working their way through the devastated town with some emergency workers having to climb up to second floors and roofs of half-collapsed houses  to reach any survivors. Pictures showed there had been at least five different landslides. On top of the 36 dead and seven missing, 15 people have been injured, two seriously. Hillsides caved in or were swept down into residential areas in at least five valleys in the suburbs of the western Japanese city after heavy rains left slopes unstable. Some uprooted trees and carried rocks down the hillside into the tightly-packed houses that sit on the edge of a commuter belt, in an area where town gives way to farmland. One man, gesturing to the mud-covered remains of a house, told NHK: 'My house is over there, flattened.'

Pointing elsewhere, he said: 'A leg was seen [sticking out of the mud] and they are trying to confirm if the person is alive. The first thing we have to do is to help that person.' Another man told reporters he had seen everything he owned swept away. He said: 'We could hear the earth rumbling and all of a sudden, things roared past us.' A woman spoke of how she had escaped death because of where she had been at the time the disaster struck. She said: 'I was able to survive as I stayed in the middle of the house. Both sides were destroyed.' A high ariel photo shows the area in the valley worst affected by the series of landslides . The archipelago has been battered in recent weeks by unusually heavy rain that has sparked a number of smaller landslides and several floods, some of which have claimed lives . Despite widespread concreting to shore up hillsides, mountainous and densely populated Japan is prone to this kind of disaster . Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who abandoned a golfing holiday to deal with the disaster, said: 'I have ordered (government officials) to carry out the rescue operation in an integrated manner, aware of the possibility of further rain.' 'I also ordered them to raise the number of Self-Defense Force (military) personnel to several hundred in order to strengthen rescue operations.' Hiroshima Mayor, Kazumi Matsui, said: 'It's so regrettable. We'll find out what went wrong and take the necessary measures.'

A trail of destruction is left behind by the landslide (left) while a rescued pet dog is carried by the Japanese Self Defense Force (right) Landslides are a constant risk in mountainous, crowded Japan, where many homes are built on or near steep slopes. Torrential rains in the early morning apparently caused slopes to collapse in an area where many of the buildings were newly constructed. Hiroshima is no stranger to tragedy like . this. In 1999 more than 320 landslides hit the city, including the area . affected on Wednesday, killing more than 30 people. The city's geology, consisting of highly water-retentive soil, makes the city particularly prone to such disasters, according to Hiroshi Ikeya, a landslide expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. He claimed the damage was extensive 'because of intense rain, extremely fragile slopes and the disaster hitting in the dead of night'. Around 32,000 areas in the locality are designated as at risk from landslides. Experts said many of the hills are composed of fragmented granite, which can become unstable when waterlogged. In October last year, dozens of people were also killed when the torrential rains of a passing typhoon triggered large landslides on the island of Oshima, south of Tokyo.","Heavy rain in western Japan caused devastating mudslide which wiped out dozens of houses burying people alive .

"By . Will Stewart for MailOnline . The happy couple - husband, Dmitry Kozhukhov or Alina Davis (right) and his wife, Alison Brooks (left) To the casual eye, the two brides pictured in this photograph appear to be tying the knot as part of a modern same-sex marriage. In fact, they are a heterosexual couple from Russia - where gay and lesbian weddings are strictly forbidden. But that did not stop the groom, Dmitry Kozhukhov, 23, dressing as a woman for the ceremony - which took place in Moscow. Dmitry, who prefers to be called Alina Davis, describes himself as 'androgyne', someone who is unable fit neatly into either gender role. And he claims to feel more comfortable as a woman, despite still being attracted to females. His bride's real identity is not known, though her first name is Alisa, 19, and she is better known in Moscow by her nickname, Alison Brooks. The couple married despite official disapproval and outrage from a registry office horrified at the prospect of both bride and groom turning up in dresses. Alina said: 'In May, we filled in the application in the registry office, and our appearance did not cause any questions at all, which surprised us.' 'But just a couple of weeks before the wedding they started to call us. When they could not reach us, they called my mother.' The registry office was concerned that both would arrive in white bridal dresses, as, indeed, they did. Dmitry Kozhukhov, also called Alina Davis, in wedding dress (left) before marrying wife Alison Brooks (right) Alina added: 'The head of the registry office asked her to instruct us that we should not appear both in dresses, because in Russia marriage is between a man and a woman, and no other way. 'She threatened that she would not allow us to come in such clothes. 'When I called her, she threatened me with an administrative punishment, saying something about the insult to the feelings of believers, and so on - although we did not marry in church.' Eventually the registry office 'surrendered' since, in fact, there are no rules on couples marrying when both are wearing white bridal dresses. Alina claims that other registry offices were ready to welcome them 'with open arms' because they liked the idea of the publicity. The proud couple show off their wedding rings (left) and Alina carries his bride, Alisa (right) Alisa said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner Alina (above) was androgyne . He added: 'But we arrived at the appointed place at the appointed hour. 'The head of the office hurried into the room where we had to sign documents. Next, she told us insulting things that we shame the concept of family and we need to be treated. 'Alisa rightly explained to this woman that she looked no better than us. 'Finally, they let in the guests, and a film crew, and they declared us husband and wife, and we exchanged rings. 'All the staff of the registry office, the couples waiting to marry, and people on the street gave us amused glances.' Dmitry, or Alina, believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in Russia, where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions . He now believes that their wedding has sent an important message to people in Russia, where there is widespread official and public disapproval of the western trend of gay and lesbian unions, and where there can be hostility to non-conventional couples. He added: 'I believe that we have created an important precedent for such a wedding in Russia, for we are not alone in having such problems. 'I have written to couples who are planning similar marriages and are afraid of failures with registration. Be aware - you can not be refused.' Alisa insists the couple are deeply in love and want to have 'not one child but at least two'. She said that she took the first step in the relationship and knew her partner was androgyne. She said: 'I came up to her and said she is very beautiful.' Asked how she would explain to her children that their parents were both 'female', she replied: 'Why do we need to explain? It's how it is.' Alisa (left) said she is deeply in love with androgyne Dmitry Kozhukhov (right) Previously, Dmitry - or Alina - has explained: 'I'm a guy with a normal orientation and, accordingly, I like women's beauty. And it should be clear my desire, to some extent, is to conform to my ideal. 'After all, girls are the fairer sex. They are beautiful. So if a guy looks like a girl - it's wonderful. 'This means that at least he is a cute guy. My idea is that a man should be just as sweet and beautiful as a woman. After all, it's terrible when beautiful, slim, gentle girl is with a rough bearded man. 'I am for the beauty for all of us. Girls nowadays are often more beautiful than men, although initially boys as well as girls have an attractive appearance, but guys do not pay attention to their beauty. 'It's sad. Girls, for example, learn something from men, develop activities that had previously been a purely male and they are clever. 'Guys can also learn a few things from girls, such as beauty and grooming, empathy, emotional warmth. 'And it has nothing to do with being homosexual. Ideally, the person will be combined with both male and female features. And this is the highest level of personal development.'","Dmitry Kozhukhov, 23, - also called Alina Davis - prefers to dress as woman .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Outrage: Rock Mill restaurant manager Chao Ya-hsin, 24, of Taiwan, holds the dish controversially named 'Long Live the Nazis' An Italian restaurant in Taiwan which named a dish on its menu 'Long Live the Nazis' has claimed it did so to 'help customers'. Chao Ya-hsin, 24, who manages the Rock Mill restaurant in Banciao, New Taipei City, said she did not realise the name would be offensive. She has since apologised for her lack of sensitivity over the title of the spaghetti dish - which contains German sausages and broccoli. She told the Wall Street Journal: 'When we were deciding on a name for this pasta dish, it never occurred to us that the word Nazi would stir up such controversy.' Ms Chao claims that for the past year the sickeningly-named meal has been one of her most popular dishes. The restaurant recently came under fire when a local TV station featured a story about it. Both the Israeli and German representative officers in Taiwan told the European Pressphoto Agency that they were appalled by the name of the dish, saying it showed a lack of understanding about the Nazis and their slaughter of the Jews. During the Holocaust, the Nazis killed approximately 15 million people, including Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and prisoners of war in Russia and Poland. In response to the public outcry, Ms Chao said she now plans to rename the meals 'Long Live Purity'. She added: 'We hope from now on, customers who eat this dish will enjoy it in sheer joy.' Rock Mill's move to name a dish 'Long Live the Nazis' comes 14 years after a restaurant in the city covered their walls with photographs of Nazi concentration camps. The 192-seat restaurant, called 'Jail' featured emaciated faces of Jews incarcerated in Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps in framed photos. After it was reported, its owner took down the images, saying he did not know they were offensive.

"By . Will Stewart for MailOnline . A children's fashion show with guns in Moscow reportedly designed by a ten-year-old girl gives an illuminating glimpse into the way the Ukrainian crisis is seen by many Russians. But critics of the Kremlin are viewing it as evidence of the pernicious power of propaganda in the worsening conflict, and it has been strongly criticised in Ukraine. At the show held in a leading Moscow fashion venue, girl models believed to be aged between ten and 12 are dressed in the colours of major world countries. Scroll down for video . Young girl representing Ukraine points a gun at her own head as she prepares to commit suicide in what has been described as a 'sick' propaganda stunt . Young model is then saved by other nations including Russia (left) and the USA (right) during performance said to be about 'world peace' The girl in Ukraine's blue and yellow colours holds up a gun and points the weapon at the participants representing Russia and the US. The image seems to suggest the Russian view that Ukraine - whose leaders are often branded fascists by the Moscow media and political leaders - are the aggressors in a conflict that has led to the worst crisis in the region since the demise of the Soviet Union. In a shocking sequence, the schoolgirl representing Ukraine then points the gun at her own head. The models from Russia and other countries including Britain - who also hold guns and parade up one by one to point them at the audience - are then seen 'saving' Ukraine from killing herself echoing the common view in Moscow that the country is slaughtering its own people. In contrast, the West mainly believes the bloodshed is fuelled by Russia supplying fighters and weapons to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. In another part of the performance the girl dressed as Ukraine points a toy gun at the audience before turning the weapon on Russia and the USA . Child designer Alita Andrishevskaya, aged ten, who was also the model representing Russia in the show, is quoted saying the theme of her pageant was 'children of the world against the war'. 'It was inspired by the events in Ukraine,' said the presenter at the event, part of accessories exhibition Chapeau 2014. Girl models parade in the colours of nine countries - Russia, the USA, Ukraine, Britain, Germany, . China, Italy, France, and Greece - with specially designed exotic hats for each nation. 'The meaning of this collection is that all the children in this world are united, they are friends,' added the presenter. 'The author wanted to draw the attention to the idea of the peace in the whole world.' Alita - a former Mini Miss Moscow - posted a picture online of herself representing Russia along with the models from the USA and Ukraine, all holding hands, and captioned: 'This is how it should be'. Another young model dressed as the UK also appeared with a gun in the strangely themed show . Show designer Alita Andrishevskaya, aged ten, who was also the model representing Russia (above), said the theme of her pageant was 'children of the world against the war . This sentiment will be shared by many, but the ideas behind the show was causing anger today. The professionally-choreographed performance at leading Moscow fashion house Slava Zaitsev has come in for harsh criticism in Ukraine since being released on social media sites. Some alleged that children in the show were pawns in a political battle between Moscow and Kiev, claiming children have been taught 'garbage'. Evan Gel45 stated: 'Delirium ... Surrealism.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . Han Tak Lee, 79, was jailed for his mentally ill daughter's murder in 1989. He was released today . A former New York businessman whose arson-murder conviction was overturned in the death of his daughter was freed from prison earlier today after 24 years behind bars, following a judge's ruling that the case against him had been based on now-debunked arson science. Han Tak Lee, 79, was released from the maximum-security state prison at Houtzdale, Pennsylvania, and was en route to a federal court hearing to determine the conditions of his release. 'It is great news for everybody,' said Kyung Sohn, a longtime supporter who went with a pastor to pick him up and take him to court, under arrangements approved by a federal magistrate. Several dozen friends, family members and supporters were expected to greet him at the federal courthouse in Harrisburg, the state capital. District Judge William Nealon threw out Mr Lee's state conviction and sentence of life without parole earlier this month and gave prosecutors 120 days to decide whether they want to retry him in the 1989 death of his daughter, 20-year-old Ji Yun Lee. Prosecutors have said they probably will appeal Judge Nealon's decision. They have conceded the arson science used to convict Mr Lee was faulty but insist that other evidence points to his guilt. Though he's spent nearly a third of his life behind bars, Mr Lee — a native of South Korea who became a US citizen about 30 years ago — has never expressed any bitterness toward his adopted country, his lawyer said yesterday. 'He doesn't hold this against the United States of America,' said Peter Goldberger, who has worked on Lee's case for about 15 years. He's an American. He said this is his home.' Mr Goldberger also said Lee has no plans to return to South Korea. Mr Lee is expected to live in an apartment for senior citizens in Queens, New York, where he once lived and owned a clothing store, while prosecutors decide their next move. Mr Lee has long argued that the 1989 fire that killed his mentally ill daughter at a religious retreat in the Pocono Mountains was accidental. In 2012, the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals granted his request for an independent examination of evidence. That review, completed in June by a magistrate judge, concluded that 'much of what was presented to Lee's jury as science is now conceded to be little more than superstition'. At the time of his trial, investigators were taught that unusually hot and intense fires indicated the use of an accelerant and that arson could be confirmed by the presence of deep charring or shiny blistering of wood as well as 'crazed glass', tiny fractures in windows. Research has since debunked these and other notions about arson. Han Tak Lee, 79, was released from the maximum-security state prison at Houtzdale, Pennsylvania (above) Mr Lee's case is one of dozens around the country to come under scrutiny because of outdated beliefs about how arson can be detected. Mr Goldberger said yesterday he would oppose any appeal of the judge's ruling to throw out the conviction and 'seek to have it declared frivolous and dismissed.' Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine Jr., who prosecuted Mr Lee in 1990, did not return a phone message seeking comment. If he loses an appeal, District Attorney Christine could seek to prosecute Mr Lee again, but he has acknowledged it would be very difficult given the passage of time. Mr Lee's supporters expect he will live out his remaining years in freedom.","Han Tak Lee, 79, has spent a third of his life behind bars .

"By . Reuters . A pregnant U.S. teenager and her boyfriend accused of murder are on suicide watch on the Indonesian resort island of Bali. No charges have been brought in connection with the death of Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found in the bloodied case in a taxi outside the luxury St. Regis hotel in Nusa Dua, Bali, last week. Her daughter, Heather Mack, 19, and Mack's boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, 21, were arrested and detained as suspects. Bali police spokesman Hery Wiyanto said the couple were depressed and were on suicide watch. Scroll down for video . Heather Mack, 19, and Mack's boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, 21, are both 'depressed' and have been placed on suicide watch after their arrest, Indonesian police say . 'Their mental state is checked every day,' Wiyanto said. 'Tommy seems better, but as they both continue to refuse to speak it is difficult.' The couple have refused to talk to their Indonesian lawyer and a U.S. lawyer was expected to arrive in Indonesia on Wednesday. 'Tommy is under close observation and has no access to materials he could use to (commit) suicide,' Wiyanto said. Police last week provided CCTV footage showing the couple speaking to a taxi driver after dropping the bloodied suitcase along with other luggage outside the hotel. Police said the two left, apparently to check out of the hotel, and never returned. The case was lifted into the back of a taxi. Mack is being held on suspicion of murdering her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62 (right) an stuffing her body in a suitcase . The two were arrested at a nearby budget hotel. An official at the hospital that conducted the autopsy said von Wiese-Mack had been repeatedly hit on the face and head with a blunt object. Her body was flown back to the United States on Tuesday accompanied by an officer with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is assisting in the investigation. Wiyanto said ultrasound and urine tests had confirmed that Mack was pregnant, as she had said. Authorities had earlier suggested her pregnancy might have been a ruse to ensure she was sent home. '... In Indonesia there are a lot of cases of pregnant prisoners, if they are already processed through the courts and they are jailed,' he said. 'So if found guilty, the baby will be born in prison. The baby could grow up in prison with its mother.'","Heather Mack, 19, and Tommy Schaefer, 21, are 'depressed' and have been placed on suicide watch .

"By . Associated Press . The U.S. Army sergeant recently released from captivity by the Taliban is in something of a legal limbo as the investigation continues into why and how he left his post in Afghanistan five years ago and ended up in insurgents' hands. Senior U.S. Army officials said Wednesday that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has not yet been interviewed by the two-star general appointed last week to investigate the matter. They said he has not been read his legal rights and has not asked for a lawyer. Scroll down for video . The U.S. Army says Bergdahl has been released from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas and the former prisoner of war in Afghanistan is now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio . But the officials said the military . team helping him recover from his imprisonment has told him that he is . not immune from any subsequent charges, including anything linked to . information he gives them now. One senior Army official said that any admission Bergdahl may blurt out during the debriefings could be used against him. If that happens, the official said the debriefing would be halted and he could be read his rights and given access to a lawyer if he asked for one. The official said Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him. The tenuous legal line is that the reintegration team is focusing on the five years he spent in captivity, not how he got there. And Army officials said there is no suggestion that Bergdahl was guilty of any misconduct while he was held captive, so there is no reason yet to read him his legal rights. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly by name. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. Some former members of his unit have said that he left of his own accord. Bergdahl has not commented publicly on the circumstances of his disappearance. The Army officials said  that the investigation will examine whether Bergdahl went AWOL or if he deserted his post . Several days after he disappeared, it became clear that he had been taken prisoner by insurgents. The . Army officials said Wednesday that the investigation launched last week . into the matter will examine whether Bergdahl went AWOL or if he . deserted his post. A deserter in legal terms has no intention of returning, while a soldier who goes AWOL intends to. Maj. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl, deputy commanding general of 1st Corps at Joint . Base Lewis McChord in Washington state, is conducting the investigation . with a deadline of mid-August. His . recommendations would be forwarded to the director of the Army staff, . who could approve or alter them, and then forward them to Bergdahl's . commander for any appropriate action. The questions surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance also complicate his back pay. His pay was initially going into his bank account after he disappeared, but at a certain point the account became frozen due to inactivity. At that point, the Army set up another account to hold his pay. Bergdahl has access to the pay in his bank account, but not the pay in the second account. And, if it is determined he went AWOL or deserted, he could be forced to repay money. The official said Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him . According to a U.S. official, Bergdahl . accumulated more than $300,000 in back pay since he disappeared in June . 2009, but it's not clear how much of that has been frozen. If . it is determined that he did not go AWOL or desert his post, he also . could receive roughly another $300,000 or more because he was a prisoner . of war. Once Bergdahl was back in U.S. military hands on May 31, he began to get his regular sergeant's pay. U.S. officials have said that Bergdahl was largely held in Pakistan by . members of the Haqqani network, which has strong links to the Taliban as . well as Pakistan's intelligence service. He was turned over to a U.S. military team by members of the Taliban on May 31, in exchange for the release of five Afghans being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center. Bergdahl was initially treated at the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, but is now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. Army officials would not say Wednesday whether he has the ability to move freely on and off the base or if his movements are being constrained.","Two-star general was appointed last week to investigate the matter .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . It is one of the most natural things in the world to do, but for centuries women have been criticised and prevented from breastfeeding their child in public. Even in the 21st Century, western mothers are stopped from providing milk to their baby in everyday places like coffee shops, leisure centres and department stores. But a new poll undertaken this week shows that 80 per cent of people now think it is ok for a woman to bare the boob in a restaurant or bar in order to feed a hungry baby and 67 per cent of people polled believe that a woman should be able to breastfeed anywhere in public. Many mums still feel uncomfortable about breast feeding in public (as posed by model), although now 80 per cent of people in a new survey believe it is an acceptable practice in restaurants and bars. 20 per cent of people still felt that anywhere that people eat or drink is an unacceptable place for a woman to breastfeed. Figures for mums undertaking the practice on public transport are better, with only 18 per cent of people claiming that they would be offended to see a woman openly breastfeeding on trains, buses or aeroplanes. The positive results come off the back of a surge in young female celebrities posting snaps of themselves breastfeeding their children on social networking sites like Instagram. Most recently, the actress Olivia Wilde posed while breastfeeding her newborn in a photo-shoot for Glamour magazine. She told the publication: 'Being shot with Otis is so perfect because any portrait of me right now isn't complete without my identity as a mother being part of that, breastfeeding is the most natural thing. Actress Olivia Wilde (pictured with son Otis) caused a media storm when this snap was published in Glamour magazine . 'I don't know, now it feels like Otis should always be on my breast.' Celebrity mums including Gisele Bundchen, Miranda Kerr and Gwen Stefani has also got in on the act, posted pictures of themselves breastfeeding to social networking sites. Rosemary Dodds, Senior Policy Adviser for the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) said of the survey: 'The figures are positive overall but there is still work to do to bring the minority of people into the 21st century. 'It’s important that not only families but businesses know it is illegal to discriminate against a woman because she is breastfeeding – a law that sits under the Equality Act 2010. 'Whether formula feeding or breastfeeding, mothers needs to be able to feed their baby whenever and wherever they need it.' But while the large majority of the population believe that it is ok for a mum to breastfeed in public, there is still a minority who hold strong opinions about the practice not happening in several specific places. Gisele Bundchen posted a snap of herself feeding her daughter while having her hair, nails and make-up done to her Twitter page . 17 per cent of people still struggle to see breastfeeding in leisure centres or swimming pools areas though, which would still force women into damp changing rooms to nourish their baby. In the poll commissioned by myvouchercodes.co.uk, taking part in retail therapy would also be difficult for some mums, with 17 per cent of people believing it is inappropriate to breastfeed in shops. And 15.5 per cent of people wouldn't tolerate a glimpse of a woman's chest in a town or city centre altogether. Gwen Stefani uploaded this scenic snap of her breastfeeding to Instagram . The last statistic echoes the experience of Emily Slough, 27, when a passer-by took a picture of her breastfeeding her child while sitting on a step in Rugeley, Staffordshire, and posted it on Facebook with the caption: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp'. The snap caused outrage among women's rights campaigners and mothers' groups, with several protest sit-ins taking place as a result. Emily later appeared on ITV's Daybreak to speak out: . 'I was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - I wasn't sitting there with my breast out. Glam mum: Miranda Kerr uploaded this snap of her breastfeeding while in the make-up chair to Twitter in 2011 . 'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs. 'Why should mothers who are doing the best by their children feel that they should be confined to a toilet or changing room to provide their baby with nutrients? 'Would you eat in a toilet or with a blanket draped over your face?' Over the past ten years, UK surveys of breastfeeding mums have shown less and less are having negative experiences while feeding their child in public spaces. In 2006, The National Public Breastfeeding Survey reported that more than one fifth of mothers had either been told to stop breastfeeding or were made to feel uncomfortable by something somebody said whilst they breastfed in public. In 2010, the Infant Feeding Survey reported that just over one in ten mums  said that they had been stopped in public or been made to feel uncomfortable doing so.","Polls says only 18 per cent dislike seeing breastfeeding on public transport .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . An innocent young couple found themselves wrongly accused of shoplifting after bungling police issued a CCTV 'wanted' photograph of the pair to the public. CCTV shots of Charlotte and James Cozens shopping in their local Boots with their three-year-old son were sent to the media as part of a 'caught on camera' appeal. They were accompanied by a description of the pair and details of how they stashed stolen goods in their toddler's pushchair. James and Charlotte Cozens,  were shopping in their local Boots in Exmouth when they were filmed on CCTV . Staff at the supermarket wrongly identified the couple, who were with their young son, as a pair of shoplifters . Boots staff passed on images of the Cozens family to Devon and Cornwall police who issued an alert . The release also came with the warning to the public not to approach the couple who were suspected of similar raids at other Boots stores. Mrs Cozens, 22,  who works for the NHS, knew nothing about the investigation until a friend texted her a link to the picture on a local newspaper's website. By then it had been published for more than 24 hours and had been shared 250 times on Facebook - with users branding her a thief and a 'bad mum'. Horrified, Mrs Cozens protested to Devon and Cornwall Police who have since withdrawn the appeal and promised to review procedures on witness appeals. The force issued the black and white CCTV after several items went missing at a Boots in Exmouth, Devon, on June 29. Officers were said to be hunting a 'white male, with a shave head and white t-shirt' and a 'white female with long black hair, white top with large number on chest, black short skirt.' Shocked friends of the couple spotted the warning on a Facebook page and alerted to them to the story . The two suspects were alleged to have walked inside then 'concealed items in a push chair' before leaving 'without making payment.' Police went on to say the same pair were believed to be behind a spate of similar thefts at Boots stores across Devon. The appeal ended with the warning: 'Members of the public should not approach anyone who they believe to be displayed in the images.' Mrs Cozens, right, said she was 'devastated' to be accused of shoplifting as she has never done anything wrong in her life and works very hard . Mrs Cozens said she and carpet fitter husband James, 30, are now worried about leaving their home in Exeter, Devon, in case they suffer abuse. She said: 'It was horrific, we were so shocked. It's broken us both, we're so upset. We both work really hard for our money and would never steal anything. 'The photo is really clear and we are recognisable in it. And for my son to be pictured too, is just awful. 'I didn't know what to do, I felt like I couldn't leave the house. It's caused us so much stress, I haven't slept much or eaten properly. 'It's disgusting how this mistake could have happened to innocent people. 'Seeing everything which was written about me, including that I was a bad mum, has been so upsetting. 'We work hard for our money and would never do something like this.' Devon and Cornwall Police promised to review their 'Caught on Camera' scheme to prevent a similar mistake - but stopped short of apologising to Mr and Mrs Cozens. A spokesman said: 'Devon and Cornwall Police have been made aware of the release of an image in relation to the investigation of a shoplifting offence. Subsequently it appears that the image was incorrect and was withdrawn. 'The image was released through the 'Caught on Camera' scheme, which is used to trace unidentified individuals during investigations. 'Such images are published when the police have been unable to identify the individuals through any other means, relying on the public to help with our enquiries. 'This particular incident will be subject to review to ensure that our procedures are robust and comply with legislation and current procedures.' Now the couple want a public apology from Devon and Cornwall Police following the highly embarrassing blunder. Devon and Cornwall Police have since withdrawn the alert and now the couple want a full public apology . Mrs Cozens said: 'We were told that Boots handed the disc to the police but it was the wrong footage. We don't know anything more than that. 'The pictures have been in the local paper and on the Devon and Cornwall Police website for weeks. 'They have acknowledged the mistake but they haven't apologised. I think both Boots and the police should publicly apologise. 'Someone saw it on Facebook and commented that stealing was bad enough, but to do it with a child was even worse - what kind of example are you setting the child?' 'It's devastating because we've worked so hard to get where we are in life and we would never do anything wrong.' Boots said the company did not want to comment.","Charlotte and James Cozens were shopping in Boots when they were filmed .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A brother allegedly swindled out of a share of a £1.5 million inheritance by his younger sibling has told a jury of his shock at finding his mother's bank accounts almost empty. Jonathan Howes, 55, said he had no idea that just £350 was left in his mother Joyce's bank accounts following her death in November 2011 aged 81, Bristol Crown Court heard. Mr Howes' brother Peter, 53, is on trial accused of five counts of fraud. His wife Jane, 51, faces a single charge of fraud. Jane and Peter Howes, pictured are currently on trial for fraud at Bristol Crown Court, charges which they deny . The pair, of Lower Barn Farm, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, deny the charges. It is alleged that Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother or brother Jonathan. He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 together, before pocketing the money, prosecutors claim. Jurors were told that the estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother, but he transferred cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into a sole account in his name. The cash was then handed to former partners and used to buy a 40 percent stake in an online gaming company set up by a relative of his wife. Mr Howes, an experienced lawyer based in Singapore, told jurors that he became aware of problems in the probate of his mother's will in 2011 during a conversation with family lawyers. Bristol Crown Court heard that under the terms of an agreement Joyce Howes' estate should have been divided equally between her two sons . He then contacted a branch of LloydsTSB in Hastings, Sussex, where his mother banked and was told her accounts were virtually empty with just £350 left. 'I discovered during the course of this discussion that all of my mother's bank accounts were effectively empty - there was no money left,' Mr Howes told the court. 'I learned that all the money in those bank accounts had been transferred out to a joint e-saver account. 'The account was opened in the name of Peter and my mother's name was subsequently added on August 7 2009 as a joint account holder. 'They told me that all of the money in all of the accounts had been moved on and then, over a long period of time, had been taken out and gone into Peter's current account.' Mr Howes said the proceeds of the sale of his mother's house - totalling £1,000,050 - had been transferred out. 'The bank told me that they had never been informed of my mother's death,' he told jurors. Mr Howes insisted that in conversations with his elderly mother she never mentioned signing documents to close family trusts - leaving him to receive cash upon her death and his brother the shares. 'I was shocked when I heard this,' he said. 'The understanding was that it would be divided equally so I was rather surprised when the solicitor said I would get the cash and Peter the shares. 'I never had any conversation with Peter about winding up the trusts.' The court heard that Howes' father Thomas set up a number of trusts in 2002 a couple of years before he died. A letter was sent to both brothers where they were told proceeds of the estate, upon the deaths of both their parents, 'should be divided equally between them'. Howes was given the principle responsibility for dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father's death in August 2004, the court was told. He wound up one settlement, giving half the proceeds, some £120,000, to his brother, who at the time was living in Hong Kong with his wife and children. Mr Howes, right, allegedly resented having to look after his ailing mother Joyce after his brother Jonathan moved to south east Asia to continue his career as a construction lawyer, Bristol Crown Court heard . Rufus D'Cruz, representing Howes, suggested to Jonathan Howes that he did not have a particularly close relationship with his parents. 'I think that would be fair,' Mr Howes said under cross-examination. Mr Howes told jurors that it would 'not be unusual' for him not to speak to his mother for a couple of weeks while he was working abroad. 'I am the first to accept that my mother was a very difficult woman,' he said. 'I do not accept I hated my mother, I loved my mother. I admit on occasions I found her very difficult to deal with but I didn't hate my mother.' Peter Howes, 53, allegedly resented being left to look after their ailing mother Joyce when his brother Jonathan moved to Hong Kong and then Singapore with his career. He began to siphon off cash from her estate and continued for some time after she passed away in November 2010, it was said. Despite organising her funeral and liaising with his brother about probate Howes also neglected to reveal he had wound up a number of trusts and settlements and cashed in two life insurance policies, before pocketing the money. A court heard he also failed to tell authorities his mother had died, giving him full access to her bank accounts and trust funds for some time after her death. The family estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother but he transferred the cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into his own account. The cash was then handed to pay off former partners as well as 'loaned' to him to pay for the redevelopment on a property he owned in France, it was said. But the ploy unfolded after Mrs Howes died aged 81 and Jonathan discovered his brother's alleged deception during a conversation with her bank Lloyds TSB. Howes was arrested and charged with five counts of fraud, which he denies. His wife Jane, 51, denies one count. Bristol Crown Court heard the brothers were told of their parents' plans to split their inheritance equally in 2002. A letter was sent to both telling them the proceeds of the estate upon the deaths of both father, Thomas, and Joyce 'should be divided equally between them.' Howes was given principle responsibility of dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father's death in August 2004 and began to wind up one trust, giving the proceeds of £109,000 to his brother. Mrs Howes' health deteriorated dramatically after a fall at her home in Bexhill-on-Sea, Essex in 2009 and she moved in with Howes and his wife in Lechlade, Gloucestershire. Jonathan Howes told the court he had a very different relationship with his mother than his brother Peter following their father's death in 2004. He said: 'She would say to me Peter never expresses his feelings, he never tells me he loves me. 'I would say ""but Peter does things for you and that is how he expresses his love"". 'If I'm honest about this period, and it was a very difficult period, is that up until 2008 Peter was doing the kind of fixing. 'He would do the tax returns, he would sort practical stuff out. 'But I was the one she spoke to, I was the one I think she would see as the emotional support, we would talk about her feelings and the future.' Bristol Crown Court, pictured, heard that Jonathan Howes, who moved to south east Asia had a 'difficult' relationship with his mother after the death of his father Thomas in 2004 . He added: 'I think it would be fair to say that prior to that I didn't have a particularly close relationship with my mother. 'We all loved each other and we were close but it was not a situation where there would be daily or even weekly phone calls or visits. 'When I moved to Hong Kong contact was inevitably even less, obviously when you are 6,000 miles away you are restricted in terms of visits but I would always visit when I was back in the UK, but that was sometimes an annual event.' The court heard following his father's death Peter began to look after his mother's affairs, with brother Jonathan rarely having any input. Instead the brothers exchanged a handful of emails about the tasks, and when their mother had a fall in 2009 Jonathan admitted contact became 'even more sporadic'. 'I took some comfort from the fact she was living with Peter and Jane and had somebody looking after her,' he said. 'Rightly or wrongly I probably had less contact as a result because I thought she was being looked after. 'Over that period, a period of quite dramatic change in her physical and mental appearance, it was difficult to talk to her by telephone. 'I made contact in December and she was quite engaged. 'Looking back I think Peter made it quite difficult for me to speak to mum over that period. 'Even at that time my sense was that my phone calls were in a sense orchestrated by him.' The court also heard that Jonathan pushed for his mother to move into sheltered accommodation after feeling she had 'no bond with Peter'. He told the jury: 'I will regret to the end of my life I was not more forceful that mum should have gone into sheltered accommodation. 'I now know things we're going on in terms of her finances, but at the time I was not critical of Peter it was a really difficult situation. 'But the relation between them had broken down and it was simple about caring for her physical needs.' Mr Howes and his wife deny all charges. The trial continues.

While most of the notoriously violent weddings featured in Game of Thrones end in bloodshed, for one couple's fantasy-themed big day, there was a happy outcome instead. Heather and Robert Balise have long been obsessed with all things magical, among them the HBO drama and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, and their wedding was no exception. Held in a crumbling medieval-style castle, the nuptials saw guests arrive dressed as fantasy characters and dance the night away to music played by a DJ dressed as Lord of the Rings wizard Gandalf.

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . Kellie Littmoden, 37, from Rayleigh in Essex is the proud mother of two adorable little girls, Eden, three, and Daisy, six months. But while she and husband Darren, 42, appear to have the perfect family, their happy smiles don't tell the whole story. For while Daisy is developing normally, her older sister Eden has Phelan-McDermid Syndrome [PMS], a genetic condition so rare, there are only 1,000 confirmed sufferers worldwide. Happy family: Kellie Littmoden with her husband Darren and daughters Daisy (left) and Eden (right) Adorable: Little Eden loves nothing more than a day out in the park with her parents and sister . As a result, Kellie and Darren had never even heard of PMS, which is caused when genes that are part of chromosome 22 either don't develop or are deleted. 'We were shocked and upset,' says Kellie of the moment she first learned of her daughter's diagnosis, 'but we didn't really understand what it meant. 'We didn't know anything about genetics or anyone who had a genetic condition. But then we looked it up on the internet and got as much information as possible. 'Darren and I feel that getting as much information that you can get is the best thing to do. It was a big shock but it gave us some idea of what we were dealing with.' Quite what she is dealing with remains virtually unknown, with much still waiting to be discovered about the disorder - not least how long sufferers can expect to live. What is certain is that between 97 and 99 per cent . of children born with the disorder will never speak, while the ability . to walk develops at an unusually slow pace. Unsurprisingly, this is something that weighs heavily on Kellie's mind. 'I think it's the not knowing, the uncertainty that is the worst part. 'It's the thought of Eden never having any speech at all. Also the thought of her never being able to do anything for herself. We're very aware that Eden is probably going to live with us forever.' Eden, whom her mother describes as a 'happy and healthy little girl', currently spends her days at nursery or going for walks in the park with her parents like any other child. Hard: Eden's condition had nothing to do with her parents and is a natural phenomenon that is rarely seen . And Kellie also hopes she will one day go to school as well as learning how to do things like feeding herself and walking on her own two feet. But for now, the focus is on making sure Eden is happy and living as normal a life as possible, although Kellie does worry about how some people might react to her. 'I'd like to think that people have gone . beyond [discriminating against disabled people] but they are always . going to stare because Eden's different,' she says, tentatively. 'I don't think she looks very . different but if you watch her for any amount of time, you can see that . she is different.' Children, however, have proved considerably more accepting and Kellie says that being around other infants at nursery has proved hugely beneficial. 'Nursery has been brilliant for Eden and . seeing other children running around has just been positive,' she smiles. 'As Daisy . gets bigger, that will be brilliant for Eden as well.' Kellie says Eden's illness has also helped to bring her family closer together, not least because of the prolonged crying fits that she, like the majority of those with PMS, suffers. Sign up: Jeans for Genes day takes place on the 19th September and raises money for children like Eden . On the job: Olympic and Commonwealth Games gymnast has also gotten behind the campaign . 'Although Eden is happy 99 per cent of . the time, sometimes, she does wake up in the night and she will be . screaming for hours and there's nothing we can do,' says Kellie. 'You know, you've got to support each other through things like that and through difficult times together. 'It's made me a different person but for . the better,' she continues. 'It's opened my eyes to a lot of things and I think it's made . us closer and it has made us stronger.' While Kellie is positive about Eden's condition and says she will always love her daughter regardless, her biggest hope now is that scientists will find a cure. 'If I could have anything in the world, . it would be that Eden didn't have it,' she confesses. 'They [scientists] are doing . studies all the time but I'm not sure I'll see a cure in my lifetime.' In the absence of a cure, Kellie says she hopes, at the very least, that Eden will manage to develop some speech and say the thing she most wants to hear: The word 'Mum'. 'Never hearing her call us Mum . and Dad is something I miss,' admits Kellie. 'It's things like that that people take for granted. 'I would love for . her just to have a little bit of speech and to be able to communicate . properly.' Most of all, however, Kellie just wants Eden to be happy and healthy. 'Even though she's got PMS and lots . of other children with it have things like seizures, she is healthy,' she explains. 'I . just want her to be healthy and make progress - no matter how slow it is.'

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A man who used to live off takeaways and frequented his local pub on a daily basis has totally transformed his life and his physique by taking up body building. As the oldest surviving male in his family, having lost many relatives to cancer, Carl Class, 48, from Stafford, was already aware of his health and became determined to make a change as he approached his 40th birthday. The father-of-three now works out every day and has even started a new career as a personal trainer. Scroll down for video . Carl only started taking care of his health and his body at age 40 (left), but has managed to totally transform himself (pictured right recently) ‘As I approach my 48th birthday in a few weeks’ time, I feel stronger fitter healthier and happier than ever before in my life. ‘As cancer surrounds my family, I decided at 40 years old to change my lifestyle completely. ‘I stopped going to the pub every night and instead starting going back to the gym, cutting down on my alcohol intake. ‘It was hard at first but I soon got the bug for it and began changing my life and well being.’ Until he was 40, Carl worked in the construction industry, going to the pub every day as well as living off fast food in the form of takeaways – eating at chip shops and the local Chinese every week. Although never overweight, Carl was unfit, unhealthy and un-toned. Guinness lover Carl used to visit the pub most days and lived off a diet of chips and takeaways . He used to snack on anything sweet, such as chocolate, sweets and crisps, as well as drinking pints of Guinness daily. Carl . initially began just to workout, making few changes to his diet, but soon . realised he needed to make drastic changes to his food intake to see . real improvements in his well being. Having lost many family members to cancer, Carl was becoming increasingly aware of his health as he approached 40 . ‘I . trained to do a triathlon for over 18 months but this made me feel too . slim and cut my muscles away, so I changed my plan. After spending the . next three years working abroad and trying to go the gym daily I started . to see muscle growth and developments. ‘I . soon realised that food is as important if not more important than . anything you do in the Gym, as no great body has been achieved without a . healthy lifestyle.’ Since . he has started his new regime Carl has cut out all bread, and swapped . any white carbs for brown, choosing a wholemeal alternative when . possible and exchanging potatoes for sweet potatoes. An . average day now might start with a breakfast of eggs and porridge . followed by chicken salad for lunch and fish with sweet potatoes and . vegetables for dinner. He . has ditched the Guinness and now makes a juice mix in the morning that . he drinks over the course of the day which includes celery, cucumber, . beetroot, rhubarb, apple, pear, banana, pineapple, avocado, protein . powder, peanut butter and honey. ‘After . changing the way I thought about food and supplements my body began to . change slowly but surely. After three years of consistent training and good . eating I’m now a different man with a totally different body, my whole . body skin and face look healthier younger and fitter. ‘My . whole life has changed for the better, I can deal with problems, I’m . more positive, stronger and very much contented with where I am now.’ As well as transforming how he feels, Carl has gained a new career through his new found love of exercise. As well as totally changing his body and health, Carl has begun a new career as a personal trainer . ‘I currently work as a full time personal trainer with 15-20 regular clients and two separate classes. ‘I have a lot of clients who are over 40 and I have inspired them to get into great shape also. ‘The gym is now a part of my life I could not do without, it has helped me get rid of depression and anxiety. I’ve passed this on to my clients, and they can’t believe the difference. ‘I also work with the elderly and over 80’s and seeing these people made me realise how important it is to keep your body flexible and mobile. ‘We are still very capable of performing and keeping a body in great shape no matter how old we are, my fitness and capabilities have gone from strength to strength. ‘I believe that everyone over 40 should try and change their lifestyle to include the gym and a healthy lifestyle, giving them a better quality and longer life expectancy.’ Carl is not alone in discovering fitness later in life. A survey commissioned by sports nutrition supplier Bodybuilding Warehouse of over 2,000 people has shown that MAMILS (middle aged men in lycra) are the fastest growing age group to have taken up bodybuilding over the past 12 months, with them representing more than one in ten of the nation's bodybuilders.","Carl went to the pub nearly everyday and mainly lived off takeaways .

Arizona State offensive lineman Edward Sarafin has become the first active Division I college football player to come out as gay. A fifth-year senior, Sarafin told Phoenix-based Compete, a magazine for gay sports, that he began telling team mates about his sexual orientation last spring. 'It was really personal to me, and it benefited my peace of mind greatly,' he said in the magazine's August issue. The walk-on lineman, who goes by the nickname Chip, follows the precedent set by St. Louis Rams linebacker Michael Sam. Sam told team mates he was gay during his playing days, but did not come out publicly until after finishing his career at Missouri. Arizona State coach Todd Graham said: 'We are a brotherhood that is not defined by cultural and personal differences, but rather an individual's commitment to the Sun Devil Way. 'Chip is a fifth-year senior and a Scholar Baller, a graduate and a masters student. His commitment to service is unmatched and it is clear he is on his way to leading a successful life after his playing career, a goal that I have for every student-athlete. 'Diversity and acceptance are two of the pillars of our programme, and he has full support from his team mates and the coaching staff.' Arizona State athletic director Ray Anderson added: 'The entire athletics department is extremely proud of Chip and is unequivocally supportive of him.'

He became the first openly-gay player to play in an NBA game after signing with the Nets last season. Numerous other athletes have come out as gay the past couple of years, opening the door for players like Sarafin to do it without so much fear of repercussions from team mates or coaches. The 6-foot-6, 320-pound lineman from Gilbert, Arizona,  graduated with a degree in biomedical engineering last spring and is currently in Arizona State's masters programme.

Sarafin has been involved in research for football-related concussions and has been active in the community with youth sports and the Tillman Scholars programme.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A three-year-old boy narrowly avoided plummeting down a drain after a manhole cover gave way beneath his feet while he was playing outside with his sister. Shocked parents Stewart and Amy Akenhead want more checks to be carried out after young Oliver almost fell into the hole in Kelloe, County Durham. CCTV footage shows the youngster walking across a grassed area used for children’s games when he stepped on the manhole cover. Scroll down for video . An image from CCTV footage shows the manhole cover flipping over as Oliver first steps foot on it . One side of the cover flipped over when he placed his weight on it and Oliver fell into the shaft. Luckily, he threw out his arms and stopped himself falling further down the shaft - only going in as deep as his chest. His panicked screams were heard by his sister Daisy, eight, and passers-by, who pulled him to safety and returned him to the family home, on nearby Ann Avenue. Oliver was left distressed and suffered cuts to his legs and back and a blow to his left cheek, where the opposite side of the cover came up and struck him. Mr Akenhead said: 'What would have happened if he’d fallen all the way down? 'Daisy might have run ahead. Oliver wouldn’t have been able to get out on his own.' Mrs Akenhead added: 'I think Northumbrian Water need to do more surveys to spot things like this. 'For something like that to happen to a little boy, he was traumatised. It will affect him.' Northumbrian Water responded by cementing the frame and securing the lid later the same day.

The spokesman added: 'It is impossible for the company to regularly inspect them all and in addition to our own monitoring we depend on the public, agencies and councils who maintain grassed areas such as this one in Kelloe to report any faults, which we immediately deal with as a top priority.

"By . Laura Clark for the Daily Mail . Teenagers were warned to expect a shock when they get their A-level results today after a crackdown on resits. This year they had to take the exams in one sitting instead of being able to sit them a second time to boost grades. This could leave many faring worse than expected, said experts. Previously pupils were able to try papers in January and then again in June. Scroll down for video . Some pupils getting their A-level results today have been told to expect a shock after a government crackdown on resists which allowed pupils to sit modules once in winter, then again in summer to boost grades . But they were only allowed to use the summer sessions in a Coalition drive to end the ‘resitting culture’ of many schools. Analysts have predicted the changes will lead to a dip in the number of top grades. Any fall in A* and A grades would be the third consecutive drop after more than 20 years of relentless rises. Education expert Professor Alan Smithers warned: ‘With the removal of the January exams, candidates this year are going to be examined on the whole year. ‘Taking the exam at the end of the course is probably going to be more difficult because you have got the whole year’s work to understand. 'You cannot take the exam in January and if you’ve dipped have another go at it, so that they may tend to push the results down a bit. ‘The change from 2013 to 2014 means that it will be a bit of a shock to some students who got their eye in on the old arrangements and now suddenly find they have to cope with a whole year’s work.’ The comments of the professor, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, follow a previous alert by Ofqual. The exams watchdog has warned that results at both A-level and GCSE will be ‘particularly volatile’ in 2014. This year is also expected to feature the biggest university clearing round in history. The squeeze on top grades comes in a year when there has also been a fall in the number of 18-year-olds and an extra 30,000 university places made available. Even elite institutions are set to enter the annual scramble to fill spare places, hoping to pick off the best applicants. The combination of factors could benefit students who slip grades as they could get into sought-after universities after all. While any dip in good grades is expected to be slight, the impact on individual schools and pupils could be more dramatic. Schools which relied heavily on resits to boost final grades and failed to adapt quickly are expected to be the worst hit. Those which made less use of the resit window are likely to see little change. Ofqual has pledged to ensure that national results are ‘held steady’ to avoid disadvantaging candidates in the first year of the new system. But it expects a ‘greater variation’ between schools. Nationally, pupils are expected to pass around 26 per cent of A-levels at grades A or A*. But schools which made heavy use of resits could see the proportion of pupils getting good grades plummet. Professor Smithers added: ‘They are going to try and hold the national result pretty much the same, probably a bit down, but the make-up of the schools contributing to that overall pattern will be different.’ Independent schools are expected to be least affected by the change as they are believed to have entered more pupils for end-of-course exams. The worst-hit are expected to be those which encouraged students to resit AS-levels – the first half of an A-level course. ‘The ASs have been important for university admissions and a lot of effort would have gone into getting those as good as possible,’ said Professor Smithers. ‘There was quite a lot of opportunity in the past.’ Glenys Stacey, chief executive of Ofqual, has warned that schools will be affected differently depending on how they structured courses. Those where pupils already sat exams at the end of their courses were less likely to be hit. Nansi Ellis, a senior official at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ‘We wait to see what the impact of the removal of January exams has had on students who could not take one unit early this year. ‘This change will have put students under a lot more pressure as January exams gave them the chance to complete part of their course and track their progress. ‘We hope that students have not been disadvantaged because of this move to an end-of-year exam. It has been introduced with no trialling and has put increased pressure on a system that is already creaking.’ The number of A-levels awarded A* or A tripled between the early 1980s and 2010, hitting a record high of 27 per cent in that year and in 2011. But top grades dropped marginally to 26.6 per cent in 2012 following the introduction of measures aimed at controlling grade inflation before dipping last summer to 26.3 per cent. Research by the Mail has found that most universities in the elite 24-strong Russell Group are preparing to enter clearing this year while many other institutions also expect to have more places available. Russell Group universities will mainly be battling it out for students with ABB grades after the Government allowed unrestrained competition for applicants with these marks. Some parents are offering their children incentives of up to £2,000 for achieving an A* and £1,500 for an A grade, according to a study by Leeds Metropolitan University. Boys have been offered £183 on average for doing well against £124 for girls. Some 11 per cent of youngsters have been offered a laptop, 11 per cent a car and 10 per cent a holiday.","Experts warn some pupils will have done worse than expected in exams .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . He has called it the ‘biggest mistake of my life’. But 18 months after his affair with his American co-star left his marriage and career in tatters, TV baker Paul Hollywood’s fortunes appear to be rising. The 48-year-old heart-throb is thought to have made more dough in the last financial year than ever before – almost £1million. Scroll down for video . Paul Hollywood, right, declared his affair with Marcela Valladolid, left, the biggest mistake of his life . Not only is he judging BBC1’s The Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry but he has also embarked on a string of lucrative live tours. On top of that, he has published three best-selling baking books, lined up new TV work and released his own range of merchandise online. It is a far cry from 2011, when his company, Paul Hollywood Ltd, made a paltry £547. This then grew to £409,728 the following year – before his affair with Marcela Valladolid, his 36-year-old co-star on his US television series, threatened to ruin it all. His show, the American Baking Competition, was dropped while his marriage to his wife Alexandra appeared to be hanging in the balance. Since then, however, Hollywood has succeeded in turning his life around. After reconciling with Alexandra, 50, at the end of last year, he has concentrated on making the most of his media profile. The presenter, who has yet to publish his accounts for the last financial year, drives a £135,000 Aston Martin DB9 and owns a Ducati motorbike. Here’s how he has cashed in on his fame: . Hollywood, left, has since been forgiven by his wife Alexandra, right, for his marital indiscretion with his co-star . He is paid an estimated £300,000 to present his BBC shows. As well as judging Bake Off, he has hosted two spin-offs: Paul Hollywood’s Bread and Paul Hollywood’s Pies and Puds. Last month, it emerged he had been lined up to present another, as yet unnamed, show about motoring for the BBC. In the past three years, Hollywood has published three books, which became best-sellers. To maximise sales, each was released to coincide with his television projects. The first two books, How to Bake and Bread sold more than 275,000 copies between them. His latest, Pies and Puds, which tied in with his 20-part BBC2 series, came second in the Christmas bestsellers list and has sold more than 100,000 to date. Hollywood set up a new company, PJH Media, last year to channel the profits of his growing media empire. Last year, Hollywood also started selling a range of personalised merchandise on his personal website. A T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Get Your Bake On costs £15, while hoodies are £35. Fans can also buy a spoon and whisk keychain for £7. Tea towel sets cost £8, tote bags sell for £8 each, while signed tour programmes are £13. Earlier this year, Hollywood toured up and down the country with his sell-out Get Your Bake On! masterclasses. The 23-date tour saw him mix baking advice and demonstrations with smutty puns and innuendo, shocking and delighting his largely female audience. He is launching another 27-date tour this autumn, with tickets costing from £32.40 for a basic seat to £84.75 for a VIP package. This includes a complimentary welcome drink and a welcome goodie bag, as well as the chance to meet Hollywood before the show. The only part of Hollywood’s empire which is not booming is, ironically, his baking business. Earlier this year, it emerged he had closed down his artisan bakery after it ran up nearly £60,000 in debts.","Paul Hollywood declared his affair as the biggest mistake of his life .

"By . Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . Microsoft has revealed that it keeps $92.9billion 'permanently reinvested outside the U.S.' - meaning it has not paid $29.6billion in taxes. The tech company said in a SEC filing 'As of June 30, 2014, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S.' Microsoft noted that 'The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $29.6 billion at June 30, 2014.' Those figures were first noted in a report by The International Business Times. Sheltered? Microsoft has said it keeps $92.9billion overseas . 'The amount of money that Microsoft is keeping offshore represents a significant spike from prior years, and the levies the company would owe amount to almost the entire two-year operating budget of the company’s home state of Washington,' the website reported. In June, a Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ) report indicated that Microsoft heavily relies on tax shelters. 'Microsoft reported operating 10 subsidiaries in tax havens in 2007 in 2013, it disclosed only five,' the report said. 'During this same time period, the company increased the amount of money it held offshore from $6.1 billion to $76.4 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that the company pays a tax rate of just 3 percent to foreign governments on those profits, suggesting that most of the cash is booked to tax havens.' International: Microsoft reportedly employs locations in Ireland, Bermuda, Singapore, and Puerto Rico to help it avoid paying taxes, according to a Senate report. Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is seen here . That report cited other companies that allegedly use tax shelters, some of which reportedly include Apple, General Electric, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Google and Exxon Mobil. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations explained in a 2012 report that Microsoft uses locations in Singapore, Puerto Rico, Bermuda and Ireland to handle its funds. MailOnline's request for comment to Microsoft was pointed toward testimony from Bill Sample, who appeared in front of the subcommittee - not unlike a request from The International Business Times. At the time, Sample said 'Microsoft's tax results follow from its business, which is fundamentally a global business that requires us to operate in foreign markets in order to compete and grow. In conducting our business at home and abroad, we abide by US and foreign tax laws as written. That is not to say that the rules cannot be improved--to the contrary, we believe they can and should be.' Sample's testimony also criticized the US tax system, including 'U.S. international tax rules,' corporate tax and residual tax. 'We believe the U.S. should reform its tax rules to support the ability of American businesses to compete in global markets and invest in the U.S.,' Sample said at the time.","The tech company said in a 2014 filing it keeps $92.9billion in funds 'permanently reinvested outside the US'

"Dr Jenny Stedmon will be the third Australian doctor to join the fight against the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa . A Brisbane woman will become the third Australian doctor to risk their life in West Africa and join the fight against the deadly Ebola outbreak. Dr Jenny Stedmon, an anaesthetist from Brisbane told Daily Mail Australia she feels prepared to join a team of international physicians and nursing staff in Sierra Leone and believes it is treatable if detected early. Dr Stedman, who leaves for West Africa on Saturday, admitted that she's hesitant about coming into contact with the disease and the sufferers, but says it's a 'normal response'. 'I'm sensitively precautious of course, and I am well aware that this is a nasty disease but there are so many positive stories coming out at the moment - I'm talking about people surviving on the ground. 'There is a pregnant lady there who is currently getting treatment and shows signs of surviving.  So I think we are likely to see more positive stories and more control of the virus.' But her husband Jim and friends of hers were not so quick to jump on her humanitarian bandwagon. 'Initially my husband wasn't that thrilled about me going over there and some of my friends thought I was crazy,' she said. As time draws closer to her departure the people around Dr Stedmon have became more supportive and understand her need to go to West Africa and treat the local areas affected.

The virus was discovered four decades ago and is now said to be one of the deadliest, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) reporting 1,229 dead, most of the victims in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria; with an additional 1,848 people infected. Earlier this month an American aid worker in Liberia became infected with the deadly virus and was evacuated to an Atlantic hospital. Dr Kent Brantly survived the deadly virus and has now been released from Emory University Hospital.  In his bizarre first public statement, he thanked God rather than the scientists for saving his life. Dr Brantly thanked 'God for His mercy' and went on to say that he believes 'God often leads us to unexpected places'. Nancy Writebol,another American aid worker who also contracted Ebola in Liberia, was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. Her husband Brantly Writebol said 'as she walked out of her isolation room, all she could say was 'To God be the glory.'""

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . New laws designed to control invasive species such as grey squirrels and Japanese knotweed could end up harming British wildlife, experts have warned. The Government has proposed a series of laws which could compel landowners to take action to stop the spread of non-native species. But experts led by the Zoological Society of London have warned the new rules, which are proposed to be included in the Infrastucture Bill, are so badly written that they could hit projects to reintroduce extinct or struggling species such as beavers, cranes, rare bumblebees and uncommon butterflies. The new rules are intended to stop the spread of invasive species such as this grey squirrel . In open letter published last night in the journal Nature, 24 scientists warned that the laws could lead to an ‘irreversible loss’ of wildlife. The Infrastructure Bill defines non-native species as those that are ‘not ordinarily resident in, or a regular visitor to, Great Britain’. The experts warned that the definition covered species that had been native to Britain but had become extinct and wildlife that could go on to naturally establish itself in this country. Bizarrely, the Bill would also limit conservation actions for species such as barn owls and red kites, which are listed in a 30-year-old document drawn up prevent breeding of certain species without a licence – which conservationists was created for a completely different purpose. The experts’ letter said: ‘The current definition has serious implications for wildlife management. ‘Once a species is classified as non-native, it can also be classified as invasive - and would therefore be subject to invasive-species legislation. ‘If the Bill is passed in its present form, it could lead to an irreversible loss of native biodiversity.’ Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the RSPB, said last night: ‘The Government is absolutely right that non-native species pose an extreme threat to our economy and wildlife. ‘But as it’s currently drafted the Infrastructure Bill wrongly defines some species such as the red kite or barn owl as non-native. This is surely not the Government’s intention. ‘There have been many great projects involving species which have been lost from the UK, such as the short-haired bumble-bee, crane, large blue butterfly and white-tailed eagle - it would be perverse to define any of these species as non-native. ‘The current drafting could stand in the way of reintroduction projects involving these species and, in extreme cases, even some native could be removed. We trust the Bill will be more tightly drafted to allow genuinely native species to thrive. Grahame Madge of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, pictured, said the new legislation as drafted could threaten the future of species such as red kite and barn own which are deemed to be non-native . Butterfly Conservation chief executive Dr Martin Warren said: ‘Legislation on non-natives needs to be carefully drafted so that it does not impact on the conservation of species across their former and future geographic ranges.’ He said many species of butterflies and moths were arriving naturally from continental Europe in response to climate change and should be welcomed as additions to British wildlife. ‘Most of them are benign and will be losing their range further south so this shift will allow them to maintain their distribution range. ‘A very small number of species may become pests but these will have to be judged on their own merits. ‘In contrast, the introduction of non-native species from outside of Europe are likely to pose much bigger risks and should be the focus of attention.’ Officials, however, insisted the new laws would not be used when it was illogical to do so. A government spokesman said: ‘We want to use these control orders as a last resort to protect our wildlife and economy from invasive non-native species. They will not be used for species that are the subject of a legitimate reintroduction programme.’","Experts want to counter the menace posed by grey squirrels .

The Top Gear presenter still ‘doesn’t see the problem’ with using words like ‘n*****’ and ‘slope’ despite causing widespread outrage, TV controller Danny Cohen said. Mr Cohen said he personally found Clarkson’s behaviour ‘entirely unacceptable’ and warned the star that ‘no one show or person is bigger than the BBC.’ Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson is still unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows, the BBC's television chief has revealed. It comes after he was filmed using the 'n' word during an episode of Top Gear . But he declined to confirm that Clarkson would be fired if he made further controversial remarks. Mr Cohen ordered an internal investigation into the hit show after a string of controversies saw it criticised by communications watchdog Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules over a 'racial' term used by Clarkson. The regulator decided the comment, made by the star during the programme’s Burma special screened in March, was offensive. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, he said: ‘I was very, very clear in public and in private with Jeremy that I was incredibly unhappy with his language. ‘I made that really clear, Jeremy knows that that’s my position and that that’s going to impact on the way the show is thought about in future. ‘People have different views on Jeremy Clarkson. Obviously loads of people think that me being so angry about it is an overreaction.  I have heard lots of people say that. I don’t think it was an overreaction. ‘He disagrees too, by the way. He doesn’t see the problem with some of the language he used. I do. I think it was unacceptable, I’ve made that really clear to him, and we’ll go from there.’ Clarkson, 54, escaped the sack in May despite being forced to issue a grovelling apology for apparently using the word ‘n*****’ during a Top gear outtake. Unused footage from Top Gear emerged showing the £1million a year host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously racist children’s nursery rhyme. The Top Gear presenter still 'doesn't see the problem' with using words like 'n*****' and 'slope' despite causing widespread outrage, TV controller Danny Cohen said . In the clip, he could be heard chanting: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before apparently mumbling ‘Catch a n***** by his toe’. Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was ‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his fans. It came after he sparked outrage by making a racist joke during another episode of the hit motoring show, screened in March. While filming in Burma, he joked a bridge with an Asian man walking across it had a ‘slope on it’. Mr Cohen said he was ‘very, very unhappy’ with Clarkson’s language on both occasions. Asked why the presenter had not been sacked for his behaviour, the TV controller said: ‘I think it is like football clubs, no one is bigger than the club. That’s why I was so clear in public and in private that I was unhappy with it and wouldn’t accept it. ‘No one show or person is bigger than the BBC, and that includes me and anyone who works there.’ Mr Cohen was pressed on whether Clarkson would be fired if he is involved in another similar gaffe, but failed to answer the question directly. Instead, he replied: ‘As I said, he feels differently about it to me but I think it is very important when a member of the team, including on-screen talent, has done something unacceptable, you tell them.’","TV controller Danny Cohen said he was 'incredibly unhappy' with language .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Elderly people may struggle to sleep as well as they did during their youth because they start to lose part of the brain that helps them ‘switch off’, scientists believe. Researchers have identified a group of cells which blocks off conscious thoughts, allowing us to sleep.

Charles Price is being charged as an adult over the murder of his grandmother, Mary, who was found inside her home on Friday last week. Police believe the teenager stabbed the 76-year-old in an argument over the television's DVR. Crime scene: Charles Price is accused of stabbing his grandmother, Mary, to death in this Atlanta home . Horrific: Police found Mary Price covered in blood and two broken knives in the kitchen and living room of this house . When Price arrived at Therrell High School, a teacher and a police officer who spotted him in a corridor initially thought he had stabbed another student. He was described as being covered in blood, and allegedly said: 'I killed it,' and liked it, school officials said in their testimony. Teachers contacted the police, who went to the family's southwest Atlanta home, where they found Mrs Price and a trail of blood from the kitchen to the living room. Mrs Price had been stabbed at least 57 times, in what officers described as a gruesome scene. A broken knife was found in the kitchen, and another broken knife was in the living room, WSBTV reported. Alarmed: Teachers called police after Price arrived at school in bloody clothes . Investigation: Forensic science teams search the home where Mary Price was found on April 18 . One of the teenager's uncles told the court he believed the attack had been triggered by a dispute over the TV. Mrs Price, whose son is a police officer, died at the scene. The officer is not the father of Charles Price, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Price is being held without bond and is due to return to court later this month. He is charged with killing his grandmother, alongside at least four other charges.","Charles Price is being charged as an adult over 'gruesome' attack .

"By . Stephanie Linning . A tiger snatched a woman and dragged her into an Indian forest in front of her husband. The couple and a boat driver were trying to catch crabs in a shallow river in the state of West Bengal on Friday when the tiger pounced. The animal dragged the woman into the thick mangrove undergrowth of the Pirkhali Forest - an area known for tiger attacks - as her husband looked on helplessly. Attack: A bengal tiger pounced on a woman as she fished for crabs with her husband in the Indian state of West Bengal. The animal dragged her into thick forest as her husband looked on (file picture) After he reported the attack, forest guards searched for the woman, but couldn't find any trace of her, forest official Nabin Chandra Bahunguna said. The attack happened in the Sunderbans, India's vast and tangled mangrove forest where the Ganges River empties into the Bay of Bengal. It was the sixth tiger attack this year in the Sunderbans, where environmentalists say shrinking habitat is forcing tigers to venture farther in search of food. In June, a Bengal tiger dragged a man off a fishing boat in India and into a mangrove swamp as his children looked on in horror. Snatched: The woman was fishing for crabs in the shallows of the Sunderbans, India's vast and tangled mangrove forest, pictured. It was the sixth tiger attack in the area this year . The family were also understood to be crab fishing in a stream in the Sunderbans National Park when the animal jumped aboard the boat and attacked the man. India is home to more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world. Their numbers are also dwindling fast because of deaths at the hands of poachers, who target the creatures for their skin, bones, teeth and claws.","The couple were trying to catch crabs in a shallow river in West Bengal .
