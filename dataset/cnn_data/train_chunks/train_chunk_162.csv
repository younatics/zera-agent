On Thursday, Sanchez appeared on the XM Sirius radio program ""Stand-Up with Pete Dominick."" During the interview with Dominick, Sanchez called ""The Daily Show's"" Jon Stewart ""a bigot"" and then said that he was bigoted against ""everybody else who's not like him. Look at his show, I mean, what does he surround himself with?"" Dominick pressed for specifics, and Sanchez, who is Cuban-American, responded, ""That's what happens when you watch yourself on his show every day, and all they ever do is call you stupid."" Dominick, who was once the warm-up comic at Stewart's Comedy Central show and now has a spot on CNN's ""John King, USA,"" noted that Stewart is Jewish and so a minority himself. ""I'm telling you that everybody who runs CNN is a lot like Stewart, and a lot of people who run all the other networks are a lot like Stewart, and to imply that somehow they, the people in this country who are Jewish, are an oppressed minority? Yeah,"" Sanchez responded. The comments were widely quoted online and on social media.

"(CNN) -- For LeBron James the NBA records just keep on tumbling. The Miami Heat star notched up 20,000 career points against the Golden State Warriors Wednesday, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to reach the milestone. And the fact he swiped the title from the other undisputed megastar of the league, Kobe Bryant, will only have added to his satisfaction. James was the youngest to reach 1,000 and 10,000 points and now at the tender age of 28 years and 17 days, he's reached 20,000 over a year before his LA Lakers rival. Blog: How can Lakers rescue losing season? The two are set to go head-to-head on Thursday night as the Heat take on the Lakers in Los Angeles. A haul of 25 points in the Heat's 92-75 victory over the Warriors secured another slice of history for one of the finest players the NBA has ever seen. He took to social networking site Twitter to thank teammates and fans alike: ""I give everything to the game and I hope it continues to give back to me! Love you so much! ""More importantly I wouldn't be anything without my teammates over these 10 years! Thanks guys. You're the best."" James reiterated his thanks in quotes reported by the Miami Herald: ""It was awesome. They've given me an opportunity to be in this position because they trust me on the floor to make plays and make decisions. Both milestones are pretty cool."" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra paid tribute to James' tenacity after he was the victim of some roughhouse tactics from the Warriors. He added: ""Everybody was proud of him. It's a big moment. We gave him the game ball and then everyone took a shot at him -- a punch, a jab, an elbow, whatever they could get in before he started hitting back."" James also racked up assist number 5,000 in the same game, becoming the 13th player in history to reach 20,000 points and 5,000 assists.","Miami Heat's LeBron James becomes the youngest player in NBA history to reach 20,000 .

"(CNN) -- He had the firm backing of world No. 1 Rory McIlroy as well as Europe's Ryder Cup talisman Ian Poulter, and on Tuesday night it was made official -- Paul McGinley will captain the continent against the United States in 2014. Despite a late bid from successful 2010 captain Colin Montgomerie, who was keen to do the job on home soil in Scotland, player power won out as the Irishman was confirmed at a press conference in Abu Dhabi. The 46-year-old played in three winning Ryder Cup teams and holed the clinching putt for Europe during the 2002 clash at The Belfry, in England. McGinley was trumpeted for the role by McIlroy several times on Monday, and also by English duo Poulter -- one of Europe's heroes who inspired their dramatic comeback in Chicago last year -- and former world No.1 Luke Donald. McIlroy said Montgomerie -- an eight-time European Order of Merit winner -- had ""nothing to gain"" by reprising his role and McGinley told reporters he was proud to be the first ever Irish Ryder Cup captain. He said: ""I'm obviously absolutely thrilled and delighted to lead the team with the strongest, in-depth European Tour in history; to be leading the cream of the crop is a huge honor. ""I knew I had the strong backing of the players. I thought the more I would say the more my chances would lessen. I watched with interest in the last few weeks as my chances went up and down like a yo-yo. ""To be honest it is quite a humbling experience to be sitting in this seat. It's a week I'm really looking forward to. I've been there many times as a player and as a vice captain but I'm looking forward to being a captain."" Europe has won five of the last six installments of the biannual team competition, including a stunning comeback victory at the last meeting in Chicago last year, when McGinley was vice captain to Jose Maria Olazabal. Despite taking a big 10-6 lead into the final day singles matches, the U.S were stunned by a European comeback as the visitors won 14Â½ to 13Â½ in what has become known as 'the Miracle of Medinah.' McIlroy was one of the European stars, alongside Poulter, and McGinley said the backing he got from the world's best player was a big factor in him getting the job. ""Its humbling when the new star of world golf comes out in your favor,"" he said. ""That means a lot to me. ""There's a couple of good things that have happened for me in terms of getting this role. One of those is Rory and Graeme McDowell (2010 U.S. Open champion) played in the 2009 Seve Trophy, which was my first captaincy. ""I had the opportunity of captaining him, and Rory and Graeme were huge for me that week. I was fortunate I had that situation where Rory played underneath me and that's why he spoke with such authority on the subject."" After their painful defeat in Chicago the U.S. turned to one of the game's greatest ever players, Tom Watson, who was the last man to captain a winning United States team on European soil back in 1993. McGinley said he was honored to be squaring up against the eight-time major winner. He added: ""I'm relishing the thought of taking on one of my great heroes in Tom Watson. Not only is he a wonderful person, he's a great ambassador for the game of golf and has been for a long time. It's going to be a real thrill for me."" Players' Committee chairman Thomas Bjorn said they had listened to the voices of their members and that it became very clear early on in the meeting that McGinley was their preferred choice. European Tour chief exec George O'Grady added: ""It's a wonderful achievement for Paul. It was a unanimous decision of the players' committee and was testimony to the democracy of the process.""","Paul McGinley named European Ryder Cup captain for 2014 clash in Scotland .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Stung by an audit report this week that highlighted ""$16 muffins"" at a conference at the Capital Hilton in Washington, the hotel chain is fighting back, insisting the pricey pastries were not that expensive. Hilton Worldwide responded to the much-publicized cost of the muffins, disputing the $16 per muffin charge cited by the Justice Inspector General in an audit of costs incurred at Justice Department conferences in 2008 and 2009. ""The contracted breakfast included fresh fruit, coffee, juice, and muffins, plus tax and gratuity for an inclusive price of $16 per person,"" Hilton Worldwide said in a statement from corporate headquarters in McLean, Virginia. The Office of Inspector General said it stands by its report, noting investigators examined receipts submitted for the reception. But Hilton says ""dining receipts are often abbreviated and do not reflect the full pre-contracted menu and service provided, as is the case with recent media reports of breakfast items approved for some government meetings."" ""We made several attempts to reach the Capital Hilton during the course of the audit, and they were not responsive to our numerous requests,"" Jay Lerner, the spokesman for the Justice Office of Inspector General, told CNN late Friday. The report by the Inspector General noted the training conference for the Executive Office for Immigration Review held in August 2009 served 534 people. The conference attendees averaged a daily cost of $14.74 for refreshments over the five day meeting just above the $14.72 limit set by the Justice Department. The Inspector General agreed the reception provided the free items Hilton says were included. But the tussle in a teapot centers on the receipt for $4,200 for 250 muffins and $2,880 for 300 cookies and brownies. ""By itemizing these costs, we determined that with service and gratuity muffins cost over $16 each and cookies and brownies cost almost $10 each,"" the Inspector General report said. But Hilton says that simply doesn't provide the full picture. ""Hotel teams tailor these events to provide maximum value and ensure the best experience possible,"" Hilton said. The Inspector General's report indicates the Hilton ""provided meeting space without charge."" But the Inspector General office told CNN it does not know whether the food and beverage cost at that conference was in any way impacted by the ""free"" rental space. The story of pricey muffins struck a nerve because of a widely-held view that government officials spend taxpayer funds too freely. And it follows a report in 2007 by a previous Justice Inspector General which highlighted ""$5 meatballs"" at one legal conference. That led to tighter Justice Department rules to curtail excessive conference costs. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Hilton Worldwide says muffins were part of $16 breakfast .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, have sent an e-mail to family friends announcing a mutual decision to separate, a longtime family friend told CNN. ""We are announcing today that after a great deal of thought and discussion, we have decided to separate,"" the message said. ""This is very much a mutual and mutually supportive decision that we have made together following a process of long and careful consideration. We ask for respect for our privacy and that of our family, and we do not intend to comment further."" Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail but declined to comment further. The couple, married for 40 years, has four grown children and three grandchildren. Al and Tipper Gore's dramatic kiss on the podium of the Democratic National Convention in 2000 was credited for giving him a more human image in his presidential run. ""The sheer carnality of the kiss -- the can't-wait-to-get-back-to-the-hotel-room urgency, the sexual electricity flowing south -- was riveting,"" Time magazine's Lance Morrow wrote at the time. CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger described the kiss as ""one of the most memorable moments of the campaign."" ""For those of us who have watched political couples over the years, this is sad,"" Borger said. ""They are a real couple."" Since losing the 2000 presidential race, Gore has been active in environmental causes, but he has also pursued business interests. He co-founded Generation Investment Management, a company that promotes ""a new approach to sustainable investing."" Gore is also the chairman of Current TV, a cable and satellite television network he co-founded. He also serves as a director for Google and Apple Computer. His best-selling book about global warming -- ""An Inconvenient Truth"" -- was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary. After leaving Washington and returning to Nashville, Tennessee, Tipper Gore considered but decided against a run for a U.S. Senate seat in her home state in 2002.","Al and Tipper Gore e-mail friends about their separation .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Monday his $447 billion jobs plan is a common-sense approach needed right away, but House Republican leaders said they opposed Obama's intention to pay for it by ending tax relief for corporations and the wealthy. In a message accompanying the legislation he sent to Congress on Monday afternoon, Obama said his proposal ""is fully paid for."" ""The legislation includes specific offsets to close corporate tax loopholes and asks the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share that more than cover the cost of the jobs measures,"" Obama's message said. In addition, he said, the package increases the target figure of a special joint congressional committee working on deficit reduction by the amount his plan would cost. If the committee reaches the higher target in deficit-reduction measures, then the offsets in his legislation that cover the cost of the plan would be unnecessary and therefore eliminated. However, House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman said the White House's proposal on how to pay for the measure was unacceptable. ""It would be fair to say this tax increase on job creators is the kind of proposal both parties have opposed in the past,"" Michael Steel said in a written statement. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor echoed that stance, telling reporters: ""I sure hope that the president is not suggesting that we pay for his proposals with a massive tax increase at the end of 2012 on the job creators that we're actually counting on to reduce unemployment."" The Obama plan is part of the president's effort to resurrect a comprehensive deficit reduction deal with Republicans that would include reforms of the tax code and entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to accompany government spending cuts. With $900 billion in spending cuts already enacted, the special joint deficit committee created under last month's debt ceiling agreement has started work on finding another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction steps that Congress can pass by the end of the year. In the meantime, Obama is pushing his jobs plan as a package of immediate steps that can spur economic growth and job creation. ""This is a bill that will put people back to work all across the country,"" Obama told a crowd of teachers, veterans, small-business owners and others at the White House. ""This is a bill that will help our economy in a moment of national crisis. This is a bill that is based on ideas from both Democrats and Republicans, and this is the bill that Congress needs to pass."" With his poll numbers down as his campaign for re-election next year is beginning, Obama noted that ""there are some in Washington who would rather settle our differences through politics and the elections than try to resolve them now."" But the ""fact of the matter is the next election is 14 months away -- the American people don't have the luxury of waiting 14 months for Congress to take action,"" the president said. Obama made his pitch in the Rose Garden hours before sending the legislation to Capitol Hill, where it received a polite but mixed reception. Boehner, R-Ohio, released a statement immediately after Obama's remarks, promising prompt consideration of the proposal. At the same time, however, Boehner took a swipe at the 2009 economic stimulus plan backed by the administration. ""The record of the economic proposals enacted during the last Congress necessitates careful examination of the president's latest plan as well as consideration of alternative measures that may more effectively support private-sector job creation,"" Boehner said. ""It is my hope that we will be able to work together to put in place the best ideas of both parties and help put Americans back to work."" Obama has been touting the virtue of his plan on the road, stopping in Virginia last Friday and heading to Ohio and North Carolina later this week. Among other things, Obama's plan would extend and expand the current payroll tax cut -- a proposal estimated to reduce revenues by $240 billion. The current cut, which has cost $112 billion so far, allows employees to pay 4.2% instead of 6.2% on their first $106,800 of wages into Social Security. Obama wants to continue the break -- now set to expire at the end of the year -- while reducing employee contributions further, to 3.1%. At the same time, the president wants to halve the payroll tax that businesses pay -- to 3.1% -- on the first $5 million in wages. Obama's proposal also includes a new $49 billion extension of unemployment benefits, which were lengthened to the current 99-week maximum in 2009. Top Democrats argue that that money would immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending. Nearly 43% of America's unemployed have now been out of work for more than six months. In addition, the plan proposes $60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges, including the establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects. It is unclear whether the American Jobs Act -- consisting largely of targeted tax cuts, infrastructure spending and new job training assistance -- can win over enough skeptical congressional Republicans, particularly in light of Obama's falling approval ratings and the looming presidential campaign. Cantor, R-Virginia, made clear he opposed new infrastructure spending and some other aspects of the Obama plan. ""Anything that is akin to the stimulus bill is not going to be acceptable to the American people,"" Cantor said, arguing that the 2009 stimulus that aimed money at boosting public sector jobs didn't work. Instead, the GOP wants to target aid to small businesses, he said. ""The fact is we don't have the money and we've got to prioritize, and right now it's about getting people back to work,"" Cantor said. Cantor cited tax credits for employers, reforming aid for the jobless, and passage of the three pending trade deals as areas of possible bipartisan agreement. While he agreed that infrastructure projects were worthy of focus, he said Congress should not be adding new money, but instead streamlining the process for getting current resources to state and local governments. ""I do not think the president's all-or-nothing approach is something that is constructive,"" Cantor said, adding, ""let's not allow the things his bill that we disagree with to get in the way of producing some results."" Other provisions in the president's proposal include $25 billion to refurbish schools, $35 billion to avoid layoffs among teachers and first responders, and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long-term unemployed. Under the Obama plan, businesses could receive a tax credit of up to $4,000 for hiring workers who have been out of a job for more than six months. To pay for the bill, new limits would be set on tax exemptions and itemized deductions for families making more than $250,000 annually. So-called ""carried interest"" for investment fund managers would be taxed as ordinary income, as opposed to the lower capital gains rate. Additionally, a series of oil and gas industry tax loopholes would be closed, and depreciation rules would be changed for corporate jet owners. The total value of the changes, according to White House Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew, would be $467 billion -- approximately $20 billion more than the total cost of the plan. The special congressional deficit committee has until November 23 to approve more than $1.5 trillion in new deficit reduction steps, and Congress would then have to pass the plan -- unamended -- by December 23. If that doesn't happen, more than $1 trillion in automatic across-the-board spending cuts would go into effect, including funding for the military, under a so-called trigger mechanism intended to motivate legislators to reach a deal.

"(CNN) -- North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il arrived in Russia on Saturday to meet with President Dmitry Medvedev, authorities said. Kim is scheduled to visit Siberia and the country's eastern region, according to a statement on Medvedev's website. ""The meeting with Mr. Medvedev is the main event on his program,"" the statement said. The statement and North Korea's state media did not say what the two leaders will discuss. Earlier this month, North Korea  again called for the resumption of the so-called six-party talks without preconditions. North Korea pulled out of six-party talks in 2008. The six-party talks involved China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, North Korea and the United States. The goal was nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula. North Korea has called for the resumption of six-party talks without preconditions before. The United States and South Korea, however, have insisted on some tangible demonstration that North Korea is serious about denuclearization. Ahead of the the Kim's visit, Russia's foreign ministry announced Friday that it will send up to 50,000 tons of wheat to North Korea to alleviate some of that country's food shortage. The first shipment of Russian grain arrived Friday, and will conclude in September. ""We view this humanitarian operation as a contribution to the strengthening of traditionally neighborly relations between the peoples of our two countries,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- A naturalized citizen living in Portland, Oregon, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. The charge is related to the May 2009 bombing that killed 30 people at Pakistan's intelligence headquarters in Lahore, said Amanda Marshall, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. Reaz Qadir Khan, 48, faces life in prison if convicted. According to the indictment, Khan provided money and advice to Ali Jaleel, who was one of the suicide bombers in the attack. The Justice Department said in a statement that he was arrested Tuesday at his home in Portland. He is due in court Wednesday for a detention hearing. The indictment alleges that from December 2005 through June 2009, Khan conspired with others including Jaleel, a citizen of the Maldives. Jaleel was killed during a suicide bomb attack on the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence in Lahore, Pakistan on May 27, 2009. Prosecutors said Khan gave Jaleel approximately $2,500 to attend a terror training camp to get ready for the ISI bombing and promised to help take care of his family afterward. ""Khan allegedly provided Jaleel with advice to help him in his efforts to travel undetected from the Maldives to commit violent jihad and used coded language when communicating with Jaleel to avoid detection,"" according to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon. After Jaleel and two others attacked the ISI and were killed, a video was released by al Qaeda's media outlet showing Jaleel at a terror training camp that appeared to be located in the Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan. Prosecutors said the video also had a statement from Jaleel taking responsibility for the attack he was about to commit. Several days after Jaleel was killed, Khan wired around $750 via Western Union to one of the man's wives in the Maldives, according to the indictment. ""We will find and prosecute those who use this country as a base to fund and support terrorists,"" said U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall. Her sentiments were shared by Greg Fowler, the FBI special agent in charge in Oregon: ""The FBI will continue to focus on cutting off the flow of funds that help terrorists train, travel and launch their attacks.""

"(Financial Times) -- The Forbes billionaires list, seemingly designed to stroke the egos of the world's richest people, has pricked one of them in painful fashion, alleging that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal ""systematically exaggerates"" his wealth. Hours after the Saudi investor announced that he was ""severing ties"" with the benchmark of billionaires' bragging rights, the magazine published a lengthy investigation into his net worth. Forbes' estimate, up $2bn in the last year to $20bn, stands $9.6bn below the prince's own estimate. Almost all of the gap, it said, stems from a starkly lower assessment of his 95 per cent stake in Kingdom Holding, which houses his investments in assets including Four Seasons hotels, Citigroup and News Corp. Noting steep jumps in the stock before publication of the last four Forbes lists, the magazine said Kingdom's valuation ""rises and falls based on factors that, coincidentally, seem more tied to the Forbes billionaires list than fundamentals"". The magazine added that no other billionaire lobbies as hard as the prince does to affect his or her ranking. Prince Alwaleed's office reacted angrily to the ""completely unsupported and biased allegation based on rumours that stock manipulation 'is the national sport' in Saudi Arabia"", describing it on Tuesday night as an insult to Saudi regulators. Retail investors dominate the Saudi stock market -- the biggest exchange in the Arab world -- and investors say local rumours often drive share price movements rather than company fundamentals or public announcements. Yet of all the Gulf stock market regulators, Saudi Arabia's Capital Market Authority is seen as the most powerful. ""The market is regarded as one of the strictest regulated in the Gulf, they have cracked down in the past,"" says one Riyadh-based analyst. The questions surrounding Kingdom come as the country edges forward with plans to open the stock market to foreigners. Currently, international investors can only buy Saudi stocks through equity swaps. Scrutiny of Kingdom could be the first test for the new head of the CMA, Mohammed bin Abdulmalik Al-Sheikh, a former lawyer who was appointed president of the regulator last month. PwC, which replaced Ernst & Young as auditor to Kingdom after the 2010 audit, had no comment. Kingdom said it had had no disputes with Ernst & Young and noted that Saudi Arabia requires public companies to change auditor every three years. Bloomberg, which launched a competing billionaires ranking last year, puts the prince's net worth at $28bn. But it also applied a ""confidence rating"" of three stars out of five to its valuation -- as it often does in countries ""where transparent information is often unreliable"".

"(CNN) -- A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea on Saturday after winning the release of an American citizen who had been detained there, state media reported. The KCNA report did not say whether the team left with Eddie Yong Su Jun. Jun, a Korean-American businessman, was detained for ""committing a crime"" against North Korea after entering the country, KCNA had reported. Jun admitted his crime during an investigation, the North Korean news agency said, but it did not specify what crime he had allegedly committed. His release follows a visit by King, the special envoy for North Korean human rights, and Jon Brause, from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The group went there to assess food shortages that have left thousands starving after floods and harsh weather devastated North Korea's crops. King and Brause ""expressed regret at the incident on behalf of the U.S. government and assured that it would make all its efforts to prevent the recurrence of similar incident,"" KCNA said. The news agency also said former President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun. ""Taking all this into account, the ... government decided to set him free from the humanitarian"" standpoint, KCNA said. ""We welcome North Korea's decision to release Eddie Jun,"" said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. He added that King was able to visit Jun on Thursday, and that it was the Swedish Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in North Korea, that confirmed the impending release to the American government Friday. In King's discussions with his North Korean interlocutors, Toner said, King conveyed deep concern over the welfare of an American citizen in their custody, but said the purpose of King's visit was not related to the release of Jun. ""It's important to note and to clearly state that any decisions about food aid are not related in any way to any policy decisions if you will. It's a separate process all together,"" Toner said Friday. The assessment team traveling with King will continue its work on the ground and ""when they come back, we will look at their assessments, study it and compare to other assessments by other NGOs,"" and groups that have made similar trips, to make a decision on the amount of aid to extend, Toner said. Though he could not reveal a total readout of Jun's current physical condition due to privacy concerns, Toner said it was his understanding that Jun was in ""decent"" health. The Swedish government had ongoing access to Jun during his detention, Toner said. It was not known exactly when Jun would leave North Korea, but Toner said he would not be traveling with King. While the United States praised the North for its action, the two countries are still a long way from normalizing relations. ""There are a number of things we would like to see North Korea do in improving relations with South Korea first and foremost before we see other steps on other issues,"" Toner said. Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program. The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry them out -- calling the exercises a provocation. South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. That same month, it detained Jun. Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details, told CNN in April that Jun was a Korean-American businessman who had a visa to enter North Korea. The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected the donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need. North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. In 2010, Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who was fined about $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted suicide while in North Korean custody, was thought to be a Christian activist. Two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were arrested after entering North Korea in 2009. They were sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in August 2009 after an intervention by former President Bill Clinton.","Eddie Yong Su Jun is in ""decent"" health, says State Department spokesman .

"(CNN) -- One night, back when I was Robert Griffin III's age, I drank six glasses of grain alcohol mixed with grape-flavored Juicy Juice. My roommate Anthony said it was a bad idea. My other roommate, Chris, also said it was a bad idea. My closest friend, Daniel, insisted it wasn't merely a bad idea but the worst idea ever. ""You barely touch booze,"" he said. ""This won't end well."" ""Quiet,"" I replied. ""I can handle it."" That night, in room 102 of Russell Hall A at the University of Delaware, I vomited into a toilet for 45 straight minutes. Anthony, who was kindly holding up my head as the cool water reflected onto my face, repeatedly muttered, ""I told you so. ... I told you so."" Alas, I was but a child. I lacked the maturity and wisdom to know what was for my own good. Sunday evening, during his team's 24-14 playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Griffin, the Washington Redskins' star rookie quarterback, insisted on remaining in the game despite being tossed around like a Raggedy Andy doll with the stuffing yanked out of its legs. During the first half, Griffin reinjured his previously sprained right knee after falling awkwardly while rolling out of the pocket. He rose gingerly and moments later could be seen behind the Redskins' bench, having tape applied. This was nothing new for the kid. Earlier this season, in a December 9 game against the Ravens, Griffin sprained his lateral collateral ligament, missed the following week and returned with an awkwardly fitted black brace wrapped around the knee. SI: First slowed and then silenced, RGIII injury spells end for Redskins . This time, with the season on the line, Griffin and Mike Shanahan, Washington's coach, engaged in a halftime conversation. According to Shanahan, the quarterback told him, ""Coach, there's a difference between being injured and hurt. I can guarantee you I'm hurt right now. Give me a chance to win this football game, because I guarantee I'm not injured."" So Griffin -- in his ""six glasses of grain alcohol mixed with grape-flavored Juicy Juice"" moment -- returned. And was pummeled. His once Willie Gault-esque speed was gone. His tight spirals had been replaced by Ryan Lindley-esque ducks. It reminded one not of a football game so much as the 1982 heavyweight title fight between Larry Holmes and Randall (Tex) Cobb, the one where Cobb left the ring so bloodied and beaten that Howard Cosell never again worked the sport. Much like prize fighters, defensive football players are trained to locate an opponent's weakness and exploit it. If a guy's arm is black and blue, nail it with the crown of your helmet. If a linemen is having trouble seeing with his left eye, gouge the right. There Sunday, in the pummeled form of RGIII, stood a walking, talking weakness. A battered quarterback, defenseless without his tools. The Seahawks, rightly, exploited it. When Shanahan heard Griffin's plea, he should have looked across the locker room at his son, Kyle Shanahan, who serves as the team's offensive coordindator. Were RGIII his son (and not merely his quarterback), would he have sent him back on the field, sans a leg? Would he have forced Kyle to face one of the NFL's most vicious defenses without a full arsenal? Shanahan should have thought of all the retired NFL players who can no longer walk, can no longer drive, can no longer feed themselves, who -- in the name of toughness and staying on the field -- are pathetic shells of their former selves. It has been reported that, earlier in the season, James Andrews, the renowned orthopedist, never cleared Griffin to play against the Ravens, that Shanahan had ignored proper protocols in the name of winning a stupid football game. (Shanahan disputes this, however.) But if Andrews had not cleared Griffin to play, the Redskins organization should be ashamed. If that's the case, Robert Griffin III shouldn't be asking himself whether he can play. He should be asking himself whether anyone in power cares for his well-being. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: We do things when we're young and foolish; wiser heads try to stop us .

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was visiting China on Friday, a South Korean official said, according to state-run Yonhap news agency. The report contradicts earlier ones that Kim's son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Un, was leading the visit. It was unclear whether his son was accompanying him. According to Yonhap, the trip would be Kim Jong Il's third to China in a little over a year. The news follows last week's revelation that South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has officially invited Kim Jong Il to attend a nuclear security summit in Seoul next year. South Koreans pay close attention to the movements of the leadership of North Korea, perhaps the world's most secretive regime. North Korean state media is often slow in reporting the Kims' activities. Open Radio for North Korea, a South Korean non-governmental organization, said Kim was visiting China. The organization is partly staffed by defectors from the North. It maintains a network of informants in North Korea. ""I checked through my sources, and one had heard from a military officer working at the border yesterday that there was some kind of 'emergency' along the border,"" said Ha Tae-kyung, the organization's president. ""According to that military officer, it was Kim Jong Il who is going -- not his son."" His account and the South Korean news agency report could not be independently verified. The term of Chinese President Hu Jintao's term is set to expire next year, prompting some to anticipate greater diplomatic interchange between Beijing and Pyongyang as Kim seeks to forge relations with the incoming leader. It's clear that North Korea needs help, analysts said. ""Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations,"" said Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification. ""Kim wants to know what China is going to do for them."" Heavily sanctioned following several nuclear and missile tests, Pyongyang has been reaching out to South Korea in recent months -- experts say the hardline state is desperate for a resumption of food aid. However, its customary form of leverage -- provocations -- is being restrained by Beijing, And six-party talks, which would offer economic incentives in return for North Korean denuclearization, have been in limbo for more than two years. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited Pyongyang and Seoul last month, carried a message from Kim to South Korea's Lee, in which the North Korean leader said he was ready to meet with the South's president ""without preconditions."" Seoul's policy is to refuse high-level contacts until North Korea apologizes for two incidents last year that killed 50 South Koreans. South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. Last week, however, Lee invited Kim to visit South Korea. ""The South Korean government did deliver a message of our invitation to North Korea's leader to visit next year's Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul,"" the foreign press officer from the presidential office said. Few, however, expect Kim -- a virtual recluse whose political decisions are made behind closed doors and who is reportedly paranoid about personal security -- to engage in such high-profile, transparent statesmanship as an international nuclear summit, or to visit Seoul. The last two inter-Korean presidential summits took place in Pyongyang.","An South Korean official says Kim Jong Il is in China, according to report .

"New York (CNN) -- Al Qaeda's deadly attack on America 10 years ago solemnly reverberated Saturday on the eve of the anniversary, as  Americans remembered the trauma and police stood guard from coast to coast amid ongoing fears of terror attacks. President Barack Obama and the first lady visited Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington to pay their condolences to families mourning the loss of family members who served in the military. They visited a section of the vast cemetery where people who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. They embraced a young woman and walked hand in hand down a row of graves. Obama proclaimed this weekend, Friday though Sunday, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance and will be attending memorial services at the attack sites in New York, Washington and western Pennsylvania. He also called on Americans to honor the victims of the terrorist attacks through activities such as prayer, memorial services, the ringing of bells and evening candlelight vigils. ""They wanted to terrorize us, but, as Americans, we refuse to live in fear,"" Obama said in his weekly address Saturday. ""Yes, we face a determined foe, and make no mistake -- they will keep trying to hit us again. But as we are showing again this weekend, we remain vigilant. We're doing everything in our power to protect our people. And no matter what comes our way, as a resilient nation, we will carry on."" Obama said the ""United States must not relax its counterterrorism efforts in the weeks and months that follow."" A solemn memorial service at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York included the recitation of the names of 343 firefighters who died at ground zero. Patrick Mate Lyons, who was born Oct. 7, 2001, read an open letter to his father, Patrick, one of the casualties. ""I want you to know that Mommy is doing a great job of loving me and raising me in a happy home,"" Patrick said. ""I play flag football in the same league as you, and in the same position as you, as quarterback. In baseball, I pitch, just like you did. I really like it when people compare me to you."" Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said he recalled seeing a firefighter searching for his sister, who was killed. ""It was then that the magnitude of the loss ... really began to sink into me. I realized the victims and their loved ones formed a far wider community than just the fire department."" Retired New York firefighter Rocco Chierichella recalled then-President George W. Bush's visit to ground zero on Sept. 14, 2001. Chierichella yelled for Bush to speak louder to crews. ""I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you,"" Bush said to cheers. ""And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."" Chierichella told CNN that firefighters who arrived after the first World Trade Center tower was hit ""didn't know this was an act of war."" But they knew they were in a ""war zone"" after the second strike. ""These firefighters didn't know what to expect (next)."" Meanwhile, about 5,000 people joined hands in an unbroken chain along Manhattan's West Side waterfront to remember the attacks. ""I felt it was important to recall and celebrate the generosity of spirit that united our community, city and nation,"" event organizer Julie Menin said. ""I am delighted by the overwhelming and immediate outpouring of support by individuals and companies who contributed so generously to the success of this living memorial. Each participant is making a very personal statement. Yet by their individual presence, they are a multitude becoming one."" At the Pentagon, Bush and his wife, Laura, laid a wreath of flowers by the 9/11 stone. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen also attended. Bush also attended the dedication of the Flight 93 memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. He was expected to join Obama in New York on Sunday. Bush gave an emotional speech, retelling the story of how the passengers of Flight 93 made the decision to take on their captors, losing their lives so that others could be saved. He called their action the first great counteroffensive of the war on terror. ""One of the lessons of 9/11 is that evil is real. And so is courage,"" Bush said. Theirs was ""one of the most courageous acts in American history,"" he said. Former President Bill Clinton echoed Bush's sentiments. ""They saved the Capitol from attack, they saved who knows how many lives,"" Clinton said at the site. Also Saturday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie helped dedicate the Empty Sky Memorial at Liberty State Park in Jersey City. The memorial, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline and is in the shape of two rectangular towers, displays the name of 746 New Jersey residents who died in the attacks.","NEW: Retired firefighter recalls Bush visit to ground zero .

"(CNN) -- Eight months after being shot in the head outside an Arizona supermarket, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is considering doing her first post-tragedy TV news interview this fall on ABC, her spokesman said Monday. The program is scheduled to air November 14, the network said in a news release. That will be a day before the anticipated release of the couple's joint memoir, co-written by Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow and titled ""Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."" Giffords' spokesman, Mark Kimble, said Monday that the Arizona Democrat ""has not yet decided whether she will participate in an on-camera interview."" ""She will make that decision based on her progress,"" Kimble said. Her husband, Mark Kelly, ""will do an on-camera interview with Diane Sawyer,"" the spokesman added. ABC, in announcing the special program, said Giffords and Kelly ""will share their remarkable story for the first time since the tragic shootings."" Giffords was among 13 people wounded, in addition to six killed, in a shooting rampage on January 8 in a Safeway parking lot in her hometown, Tucson, Arizona. The congresswoman was gravely wounded that day, but made what doctors have called a miraculous recovery after intense rehabilitation in Tucson and Houston, Texas. In early August, Giffords received a standing ovation when she returned to the House floor for a critical vote on raising the nation's the debt ceiling. But except for a few statements from her office, she has remained out of the spotlight and has not spoken to the media since the shooting. Meanwhile, the man accused of trying to kill her, Jared Lee Loughner, is in custody and undergoing mental health treatment. Authorities will determine whether he is competent to stand trial. Giffords' husband, Kelly, was a combat pilot before joining NASA and becoming an astronaut. He commanded the final flight of the Space Shuttle Endeavour this spring, then announced his retirement from the space program and the U.S. Navy in part so he could spend more time with his wife.","NEW: Giffords will decide on a TV interview ""based on her progress,"" her spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Its official: Deep cuts in federal spending are under way, $85 billion over the next seven months. The question we should all be asking soon is: Where are the jobs? The reason given by Republicans and conservatives for the urgent need to drastically reduce federal spending was that mounting federal debt and big government was stifling private investment and economic output. Now, we will see whether that justification for the spending cuts was fact or fig leaf. The truth is that the reductions in spending that will take place over the next year will, at a minimum, have no positive impact on the economy. In the worst case, the cuts could lead to increased unemployment and slower, if not negative, economic growth. In fact, many experts estimate the cuts are most likely to cost jobs: more than 700,000 according to Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. In no case are the recently enacted sequester cuts likely to stimulate job creation and increased economic growth. There will, however, be a good deal of measurable and immediate pain for millions of American households directly affected by the cuts. Many of them will be families that have been teetering on the financial edge since the beginning of the recession, and many more will be those who have fallen permanently into ""barely getting by"" status. Already, even the modest recovery that is under way is not equally shared. As the Dow last week pierced the 14,000 level to flirt with an all-time high, fourth quarter GDP for 2012 was reported to have increased at an annual rate of a mere 0.1%. Although that estimate could be revised upward in the months ahead, the fact remains that wealthy investors are largely immune to the pain being experienced by a major share of the U.S. population. According to University of California, Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez, fully 93% of the increase in total U.S. family income in 2010, the first full year of recovery, went to the top 1%. Public policies such as stimulative Federal Reserve actions that are helping to inflate the stock market, and tax cuts for the wealthy, have combined to create a level of economic inequality not seen in the United States since the Great Depression. Further, according to Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, corporate earnings have risen at an annualized rate of 20% since the end of 2008, while household disposable income has barely moved, averaging an inflation-adjusted 1.4% annually over the same period. The recently enacted sequestration cuts will further fuel the disparity between corporate America, the wealthy and middle class, and the poor. The truth is that there is no debt crisis that was necessary to address with these cuts. As our economy grows and people get back to work, the debt and deficit will naturally decrease with a rising tax base, increasing consumer spending and the public investment that comes with greater revenue and improved consumer confidence and business sentiment. The most effective way to promote that result, particularly now, given the economy's current slow growth trajectory, is to invest strategically in the economy in a manner that will provide the incentives for new private investment, business growth and ultimately job creation. President Obama has repeatedly discussed the need to invest in the nation's infrastructure. Much of our infrastructure is aging and in dire need of repair or replacement. Investing in infrastructure could enhance market efficiencies, promote green jobs, improve the environment and provide needed employment opportunities in urban and rural communities, as well as on Native American Tribal Lands. Infrastructure investments could include bridge and highway construction and repair, new commuter and high-speed rail lines, upgrading communications systems, renovating or building new schools, community colleges and state-of-the art job training facilities, investing in dams, waterways and water treatment facilities, reclaiming key wetlands, and improving the basic livability of impoverished neighborhoods. For sure, large and growing federal deficits are a legitimate concern. But with 12 million workers searching for jobs, millions more working part-time but wanting full-time employment with flat or falling wages, nearly 13 million families owing more on their homes than they are worth; with a nearly 40% drop in net worth for the average American family, and GDP barely in positive territory, the economy is in need of a jump start, not a cutback. Pulling back on federal spending now is equivalent to an unemployed worker refusing to go on job interviews in order to save on gas or bus fare. Since the latter part of 2012, Washington policymakers have been fixated on federal budget reduction. Yet none of those conversations have led, nor are likely to lead, to the creation of a single job. The American public deserves better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carr .","Jim Carr: Forced spending cuts are now under way. Where will the jobs come from?
He says cuts will cause pain in U.S. households; economists say more than 700,000 jobs lost .
He says at the same time corporate earnings up, widening gap between rich, poor .

"(CNN) -- As China's super rich grow ever richer they need new toys to play with. Now, some are betting that superyachts will be the next big thing for those Chinese millionaires wanting to show off their bling. ""There's no question that Chinese have the appetite and the deep pockets for a thriving yacht culture,"" says Traugott Kaminski, China CEO for upmarket yacht firm Sunseeker -- which was one of the first to enter the then almost non-existent market back in 2003. Now the company says it is about secure a deal worth up to $33 million, selling five yachts to a mainland Chinese customer. And with recent figures showing that Asia's economic giant has over 875,000 millionaires there could plenty more orders to come. There's certainly ample room for growth. According to figures cited by state media, there are about 1,300 private yachts in China. This compares to 17 million privately owned recreational boats in the United States, the world's biggest yacht market, according to industry publication International Boating Industry. But where some see China as a yacht-seller's paradise, others are more cautious. ""In 2010 China only imported about 100 yachts -- that's not a lot when you consider the country's wealth and population,"" says Bart Kimman, Dutch CEO of Asia Yacht Services, a Hong Kong brokerage firm tailored to the growing Asian market. While Kimman stresses that demand has certainly increased from next to nothing only two years ago, he believes that the Chinese market is still strangled in a net of prohibitions. He argues that modern yachts need modern marinas, with properly trained staff -- ""But who wants to invest millions in a high-tech marina,"" he asks, ""only to find out that you have to rebuild the whole thing because of an obscure regulation?"" A 42% tax on imports of foreign yachts is also proving prohibitive, he says. ""OK, so a rich guy is a rich guy, but if he wants to buy a $5 million toy and he's facing the prospect of paying another $2 million in tax ... he's going to think twice!"" Dr. Keyu Jin is an assistant economics professor at the London School of Economics. She says trailblazing Chinese trend setters will need to take up yachting before it really takes off. ""How do you jump-start a hobby?"" she asks. ""It's like European wine in China -- in the beginning no one drank it, then a very few people started drinking a particular French brand, now finally there is a big market. It's a herd mentality."" she says. Jin adds that there are cultural barriers that may delay the yachting revolution. ""While some of China's rich are happy to spend their money on lavish things, others have a more traditional view about ostentatious displays of wealth,"" she says. ""'Big trees attract more wind' is the old saying, and the Confucian view that the more conspicuous you are the more risks you put yourself into still acts as a sort of restraint for many."" She adds: ""Unlike Brazil -- another emerging market for yachts -- Chinese people don't like beaches much, they don't like the sun and they're not interested in getting a tan."" But Kaminski is fully undeterred. ""Sure, Chinese will use the boat differently to their counterparts in the West,"" he says. ""In my dealings there is a greater emphasis on the safety and stability, and our customers prefer a hard-top roof to shield them from the sun. Karaoke rooms are also very popular -- this is all just a matter of different tastes."" According to the Sunseeker CEO, the Chinese market will eventually be bigger than the whole European market put together. ""You cannot expect this in five years -- there are still these problems with infrastructure and so on,"" he says. ""But once these issues are solved -- which they will be -- then the floodgates will open.""","Some boat makers betting yachting is next big thing for China's super wealthy .

"(CNN) -- Just days after signing a bumper multi-year deal with Nike, Rory McIlroy made an embarrassing early exit in Abu Dhabi along with stablemate Tiger Woods. The world's top two golfers were supposed to usher in a new era of dominance within the sport for Nike, but neither man made the cut on a disappointing day. The world No.1 finished on six-over, while Woods missed out after being hit with a two-stroke penalty for rules of infringement. Justin Rose finished top of the leaderboard on eight-under following a round of 69, but it was McIlroy and Woods who caught the headlines. Nike unveils Rory McIlroy: Tiger's heir apparent . McIlroy, playing with his new Nike clubs for the first time, had not missed a cut since the U.S. Open in San Francisco last June. But after starting the day well down the field following an opening round of 75, the Northern Irishman failed to battle back, despite reverting to his old putter. ""I just felt like the greens that I've been practising on are a lot faster than these,"" he told reporters. ""The Nike putter is great on that, but getting to here it's just a weight issue more than anything else. ""I can feel the head of the one I used today a little bit better, but the change was to no avail. ""I've got a few weeks off now to work at it and try and get my game in decent shape for the US."" McIlroy had vowed to improve on his opening round and hit three straight pars, but three bogeys in the next four holes left him floundering on six-over. Birdies at eight and nine allowed some respite, but bogeys on the 10th and 14th ended his chances of making the cut at the course where he finished second last year. McIlroy teams up with Tiger at Nike . He said: ""I knew it was going to be a tough week with everything going on, but I was just looking forward to getting to the golf course and getting back to what I do and what I'm comfortable with. ""It just didn't work out like that. I hit the ball really well last week in practice in Dubai and just sort of gradually got worse this week for some reason. Woods eyes long rivalry with McIlroy . ""But I'm going to spend the weekend here and practise and work at it with Michael (coach Michael Bannon) a little bit. ""It's very disappointing. You really want to get off to a nice start at the start of the season, but I've got to realise that it is only the start of the season. ""As long as I feel like my game is in good shape heading into Augusta (the US Masters on April 11-14) that's all I'm worried about."" What kind of Nike poster boy will Rory McIlroy be? Woods fared little better after he was hit with a two-stroke penalty for rules of infringement in the sand at the fifth hole. And after finishing one one-over for the day, Woods said he just fell short following a poor start. ""It's tough because I didn't get off to a very good start today and I fought and got it back,"" he told reporters. ""I was right there and I felt that if I had close to even par, I had a chance going into the weekend, being only eight back. Evidently it wasn't enough."" Meanwhile, world number five Rose, will take a one-shot lead into the third round after moving clear of Welshman Jamie Donaldson, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen and Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castro. ""I felt like my game definitely sharpened up,"" Rose said. ""When you have perfect distance control you know you are swinging it well.""","Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods both fail to make the cut .

"New York (CNN) -- A Queens man who faces charges related to five firebombings in the New York City metropolitan area is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, authorities said late Tuesday. The suspect was taken to a hospital in Queens after demonstrating irrational behavior, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner for the New York Police Department. Ray Lazier Lengend, who police said has confessed to the attacks, is charged with five counts of criminal possession of a weapon (possession of an explosive), one count of arson as a hate crime and four counts of arson. An Islamic center and a Hindu place of worship were among those bombed during Sunday's conflagrations, which involved several Molotov cocktails. New York City Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne noted that the man had ""a gripe with someone at each location."" A source with knowledge of the investigation offered details Tuesday about the grievances that allegedly preceded the weekend's attacks. ""In the case of the mosque, (the suspect) was mad at them because they wouldn't let him use the bathroom,"" the source told CNN. At the Hindu temple in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, which doubles as a residence, the accused arsonist allegedly had a dispute with someone who lived nearby or had worked there. At a grocery store set ablaze -- also in Jamaica, Queens -- the man allegedly told investigators that someone had thrown him out of the store for shoplifting, the source added. At a residence in Elmont, Long Island, the suspect allegedly told police that he was angry at an in-law who lived there. And at a torched Jamaica, Queens home, the suspect allegedly said that he was upset with someone who had sold him drugs. But, in that case, ""he accidentally set the wrong house on fire,"" the source added. No injures were reported in any of the incidents. Video released Monday by police showed a person lobbing a flaming object toward a building. A fiery explosion can be seen an instant later. The incidents have ignited alarm. An official at the Imam Al-Khoei Islamic Center has said some 75 community members were leaving the center when they spotted a fire near the front door. He said they found ""two Molotov bombs"" -- broken bottles containing flammable liquid. ""Thank God, nobody was injured and we're OK,"" said Maan Al-Sahlani, minister of religion at the center. ""It's not major damage -- maybe because of the rain, maybe because our people tried to put down the fire."" Gov. Andrew Cuomo condemned the attacks in a statement Monday, saying such acts ""go against everything we stand for as New Yorkers and Americans."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations urged police to increase security around mosques.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A few months ago, most South Koreans would have laughed at a question that now looms large in their minds: ""Will there be a second Korean War?"" Living for decades through missile launches, naval skirmishes and nuclear tests conducted by their troublesome neighbor North Korea, South Koreans learned to brush things aside and move on with their daily lives. Pyongyang became more like a bothersome brother than an enemy nation -- especially to a younger generation that had never seen battles fought at home. But that changed instantly on November 23, after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island killed four South Koreans. Grainy security camera footage showing people fleeing for their lives sent chills down people's backs. It showed them that North Korea remains an immense -- and nearby -- threat. The country was on high-alert as the South Korean military pursued a live-fire drill Monday near the same waters where the November attack took place. Gearing up to evacuate or hide in bunkers, islanders hoped for the best, but worried the conflict could swiftly spiral out of control. They said that the drills needed to happen, but noted that the timing might lead to another attack. ""Of course, it's better not to do them,"" said Paek Soon-nyeo, 84, as she headed toward what would be the last ferry out of the island before the drills. After the drills ended Monday, residents anxiously waited to see what would happen at a time when North Korea's next step was anyone's guess. Is war a possibility? Few people shrugged off the idea. The shelling of the Yeonpyeong Island was a wake-up call for people here, who realized they don't have the slightest clue of what to do if North Korea were to attack the country. What used to be a widely ignored practice was viewed in a different light. Average Seoul citizens took cover in subway stations and descended downstairs in office buildings in a simulated air-raid on that day. ""We actually don't participate very well, because nothing happened between North Korea and South Korea. But recently it has happened, so it's very serious for us to think about these kinds of events,"" said Chung Woo-sub, a university student who ducked into the subway station. In the minds of the younger South Koreans like Chung, dramatic images of North and South Korean leaders shaking hands in Pyongyang are fresher than old tales of war-torn memories. But recent developments on the peninsula might have changed that.","The younger generation has not seen Pyongyang as a significant threat .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has met in Beijing with Kim Jong Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Thursday. Kim was widely reported to have been in China, but both countries declined to formally confirm the visit -- even after grainy photos surfaced on websites that appeared to show Kim in China, North Korea's closest ally. Kim was on his third China visit since last May, the news agency reported. It quoted him as saying that China and North Korea have made ""extensive achievements in their trade cooperation in recent years"" and that they ""took a significant step forward in building a new cross-border bridge over the Yalu River."" Wen said ""it is a steadfast principle"" of the Chinese government ""to consolidate and develop"" a friendship between China and North Korea, the Xinhua report said. The news report added that ""both sides boosted substantial cooperation in trade and other areas, which have helped promote economic development and improve people's lives in the two countries."" Kim noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a friendship and cooperation treaty between North Korea and China, Xinhua reported. He also called on both nations to expand cooperation to ""usher in a new era of full-flourish trade cooperation,"" the news agency said. South Korean and Japanese media, whose journalists usually doggedly follow the North Korean ruler on such trips, had reported that Kim's special train crossed the border into China Friday. They said the leader started his journey with several stops in the northeast, including a tour at one of the China's biggest automakers. China usually confirms North Korean officials' visits only after they have returned home. With heavy sanctions still in place on North Korea after its nuclear and missile tests, analysts have said that the communist nation clearly needs help, especially in light of recent reports that an unusually harsh weather has ruined its winter crops. ""Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything, and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations,"" Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification has said. ""Kim wants to know what China is going to do for them."" As a U.S. government delegation traveled Tuesday to North Korea for a four-day trip to assess the food situation, China remained largely quiet on how it would respond to its isolated neighbor's aid requests. ""Over the years China, within its means, has provided some assistance to (North Korea) aimed at helping it improve its people's livelihood and developing its economy,"" said Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry.

"New York (CNN) -- The skirmish between North and South Korea over Yeonpyeong, an island in the disputed zone between the two sides, has brought new danger to a standoff that has been escalating for more than two years. It happened just two days after North Korea revealed a sophisticated uranium enrichment program to three American visitors from Stanford University, and in the midst of its leadership transition from Kim Jong Il to his son, Kim Jong Un. How can the international community respond in a way that will deter North Korea without pushing the situation into all-out war? None of the options is particularly attractive: Strong sanctions and displays of force have already been tried, and failed to stop the latest attack. Military retaliation could easily escalate into war involving the Koreas, the United States and possibly China, with devastating consequences. Negotiations, many would argue, have failed, too. But among the available options, a return to negotiation seems the least bad one. This would not be ""rewarding bad behavior,"" but trying to test North Korea to see what it would take to bring us back from the brink of war. Negotiation would have to be pursued multilaterally -- most likely through the Six-Party Talks among the Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan -- or perhaps even more importantly, bilaterally between the United States and North Korea. It is never possible to be sure what is going on within the North Korean regime, but its growing belligerence -- through nuclear tests, military muscle-flexing, and the demonstration of nuclear capacity to foreign visitors -- suggests that North Korea is trying to show the world it is a force to be reckoned with. Pyongyang has made it known that it wants to be accepted as a nuclear weapons state and wants to deal with the U.S. from that position of strength. This may in turn be related to the transition underway in the North Korean leadership: either Kim Jong Un himself demonstrating his toughness to his military, or groups within the military showing their loyalty to him by their forceful actions. The United States has stated repeatedly that a nuclear North Korea is unacceptable, especially because of the effect a nuclear North Korea would have on other would-be nuclear powers, above all Iran. But for now, a nuclear North Korea is a reality we must deal with. North Korea manufactured this crisis . Renewed dialogue between the United States and North Korea could reveal what combination of incentives might get the North to back down and eventually relinquish its nuclear capability -- and a nonnuclear Korean peninsula is the stated goal of all the parties in the six-way talks, including North Korea. China, which has its own interest in a stable Korean peninsula, must be brought into the negotiating process as well. The government of Lee Myung-bak in South Korea has promised ""stern retaliation"" over the Yeonpyeong attack, but knows its real options are limited. The Pentagon and State Department have strongly condemned the North Korean action but have wisely urged restraint. China has also criticized North Korea and called for a return to dialogue and a peaceful resolution of the current standoff. A space for common interest can be found among all sides with a stake in the Korean situation. What is required is the political courage, not least in Washington, to look beyond condemnation and to engage in the hard negotiations necessary to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Armstrong.","Charles Armstrong says North Korean attack confronts the world with difficult options .

"(CNN) -- Every day Phil Mickelson was on the verge of making PGA Tour history. Every day he fell just a little bit short. But it mattered not, as the veteran American led from start to finish to become only the fourth player to win the Phoenix Open three times. It didn't matter that his putt for a magical 59 lipped out in Thursday's opening round. It didn't matter that he missed the U.S. circuit's 36-hole scoring record after a double-bogey on Friday. And making the second best 54-hole total on Saturday was not a problem either -- it put him six shots clear going into the home straight. A final-round 67 was his worst of the tournament and left him on 28-under-par 256 overall, the joint second-best 72-hole total in PGA Tour history -- matching the mark set by fellow three-time winner Mark Calcavecchia at the same tournament in 2001. The 42-year-old came off the course at TPC Scottsdale beaming, having earned his 41st PGA Tour title ahead of next week's defense of his crown at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am -- the scene of his 40th win. ""I played really good golf,"" Mickelson said after claiming the $1 million first prize and moving into ninth place on the PGA Tour's all-time win list. ""This is how I've been playing for a while and it feels really good to get that golf out of me when I'm at a big tournament."" Mickelson, who also credited his new driver for his upswing in fortunes, is targeting a fourth Masters victory in April. ""It's important to start building momentum but it's more important what you do closer to Augusta,"" Mickelson said. ""You have got to deal with some of the greatest pressure you will ever deal with at Augusta."" Mickelson has now won a PGA Tour title in each of the past 10 years, the most of any active player. He has won a tournament in 20 different years, including in 1991 as an amateur -- putting him behind only Sam Snead (24 years of wins) and Jack Nicklaus (21). His closest challenger at Scottsdale, Brandt Snedeker, got within three shots but a dropped shot at the last extended Mickelson's winning margin. ""To be in the last group with Phil and kind of trade birdie for birdie and make up some ground was a lot of fun,"" said Snedeker, who was also second behind Tiger Woods at Torrey Pines last weekend. ""It's what we play for. I wish I could have put some more pressure on him and got a little closer than I did today, but I think I shot 12 under par on the weekend and made one bogey. ""Sometimes you have to tip your hat and say Phil played unbelievable and deserved to win, and that's kind of what this week was all about."" Scott Piercy closed with 61 to be third on 23 under, one shot ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore (65), while Ryan Palmer carded 62 for fifth on 19 under. Meanwhile, Scottish golfer Stephen Gallacher ended an eight-year wait for a second European Tour victory when he triumphed at the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. The 38-year-old's three-shot victory from South African Richard Sterne came 210 starts since he won his first at the Dunhill Links Championship, and put him inside the world's top 60 rankings. ""It's taken a long time but it's sweeter now. I'm maturing with age hopefully!"" said Gallacher, who fired a crucial eagle at the 16th hole -- his fifth of the week -- to move clear.","Phil Mickelson wins for the first time in a year at the Phoenix Open in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- As she approaches the fifth anniversary of the accident that paralyzed her, record-breaking Paralympic gold medallist Mallory Weggemann is in defiant mood. The 23-year-old is determined January 21 will not be a day tainted with bitterness; instead she will focus on the string of seismic achievements she has made since her life was irreparably altered. The current holder of 15 swimming world records refuses to accept the normal limits associated with disability, underlined by her latest conquest -- skiing. Growing up in Minnesota, Weggemann says she used to dread the complexities thrown up by heavy snow that sometimes lingers for months, but after taking to the slopes in Stratton, Vermont, she feels she's reclaimed another slice of independence. ""It's been fun to be out there on the snow again and not be confined to four wheels,"" Weggemann told CNN from the slopes in Vermont. ""I'm reaching my five year anniversary of my paralysis in January and I haven't been able to enjoy winter yet. I grew up in Minnesota, with snow all around for a good six months of the year. ""Five years ago when this happened I didn't obviously think I'd be up skiing on a mountain and I definitely didn't know what my life would look like five years from that point. ""I try not to look at the anniversary - January 21st - as a sad or depressing day, or look at it for what I lost. I try to look at everything I've accomplished and gained and all the opportunities I've had. ""I still truly believe the life I've lived since becoming paralyzed is far fuller than the life I may have lived if I wasn't paralyzed. ""I'd done a little bit of skiing before I was paralyzed and I wanted to be able to find a way to enjoy snow again, to enjoy the winter months. I used to dread them."" Weggemann was only 19 when she became paralyzed from the waist down. A routine epidural injection during a bout of shingles went wrong and changed the course of her life forever. Unbowed she has spent the last half decade smashing down the barriers most people assume are erected the instant such a tragedy occurs. Within four months of the accident, the 23-year-old was back in the pool and about to launch a new career that would see her claim 13 gold medals at the 2009 and 2010 World Championships. As well as her world records she also holds 34 U.S. records. Weggemann seems to take disappointment in her stride. Despite having her disability reclassified by the event's governing body on the eve of the Paralympics last year, Weggemann absorbed the blow and took her first gold medal at the Games in the 50m freestyle, also adding a bronze in the 4x100m medley. Her foray into the world of skiing is just the latest challenge she has overcome, as she works her way down a list that might deter even the fittest able-bodied athlete. Armed only with a mono ski, and two hand skis, Weggemann had completed just one day of training with Rob Willis -- an instructor at Stratton Mountain -- before she was let loose on the slope's quickest runs. Willis says the mental fortitude of his apprentice was unlike any he has come across before. ""Mallory is by far the best student I've ever had,"" he said. ""She's just a natural athlete. She's amazing and has the right attitude to go far. ""We were already on the top of the mountain on her second day of skiing. I think besides being physically in shape, mentality is the most important thing. Mallory's approach to it has helped her get the hang of it really quickly. ""She's absolutely amazing; I could only hope to be as dedicated as she is. She's the sort of person that if you put a barrier in front of her she'll go and smash it down. I think if people watch her and see what she does it can be an amazing motivator for them."" Weggemann does not just accept her position as a role model, she embraces it. ""I had a lot of people tell me about things I would never do again,"" she explained. ""It was one of those moments when I realized the only person who can put restrictions on me is me. ""I almost became a bit more hungry for life in general. All of a sudden my ambition changed, my drive, my passion, ever since that day I've had a change in perspective, to live everything to the full and take advantage of all these opportunities. ""There are a lot of things out there I want to try that I didn't know that I had the desire to do before I was paralyzed. One of the big things I want to do is to try and raise awareness, to show what individuals with disabilities can do. ""It's raising awareness that our life isn't any different and we as individuals are not different. I think our society puts that on disability and focuses on what people can't do, but we can do those things, we might do them differently, but we can do them. ""It's my hope in doing things like this, that I can encourage not only our society to feel differently but hopefully raise awareness so other individuals with disabilities can see the opportunities they have as well."" So now the skiing box has been ticked, what is next on Weggemann's to-do list? ""I'd love to find a way to walk with leg braces and arm crutches,"" she said. ""I don't have any function in my legs but I know there's a way you can do it using your abs, so walking is definitely on my list in this next year. ""I'm getting ready to go scuba diving in the spring for the first time since being paralyzed and down the road one of my really big goals is to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. ""My dad is an avid mountain climber and he's scaled various different mountains. I'd love to get my dad back on a mountain and do it with him. The list is quite long!""","U.S. Paralympic swimmer Mallory Weggemann conquers the slopes of Vermont .

"(CNN) -- In the past week sanctions have been handed down in both South Africa and Italy in relation to a growing trend that is fast becoming a stain on soccer's integrity -- match-fixing. But FIFPro, the worldwide players' union, are preparing a project to tackle fixing, that will include an education program and an online tool for their members to report illegal approaches. Match-fixing has proved a particular problem for Italian football in recent years. Napoli were hit with a two-point penalty that dropped them from third to fifth in Serie A as part of an ongoing investigation, though they vehemently deny any wrongdoing. Defender Paolo Cannavaro is appealing his six-month ban for failing to report an illegal approach. Juventus coach Antonio Conte recently returned from a 10-match touchline ban imposed for failing to report match-fixing while coach at Siena. In 2006, Juve were stripped of two league titles and relegated to the third division of Italian football -- before later being reinstated in the second tier -- for their part in the ""Calciopoli"" scandal. Elsewhere, the president of the South African Football Association (SAFA) and four other officials were suspended this week as part of an investigation into match-fixing ahead of the country hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010. It is alleged four friendly games were prearranged for the benefit of convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organization. FIFPro have European Union funding behind their 'Don't Fix It' project and will be working closely with Birkbeck University and European soccer's governing body UEFA. The initiative will be launched in nine countries: England, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Romania, Scotland and Slovenia. ""In the past few years, the football world has realized that match fixing is one of the biggest threats to the game, maybe even its biggest threat,"" FIFPro said in a stament on their website. ""It is not solely a problem of individual countries, as recent reports and incidents have proven that match fixing is widespread in numerous nations on all continents: from Finland to Zimbabwe, from Malaysia to Italy. ""In FIFPro's opinion, one of the ways to reduce the incidence of match fixing and the potential for match fixing in football is education of the players: the campaigns need to be taken into the dressing rooms of the clubs."" Once their online reporting method is up and running FIFPro estimate a total of 12,000 players and 20,000 people associated with the game will be able to disclose any bullying, intimidation, harassment, and inappropriate approaches.","Worldwide soccer players' union FIFPro launches project to combat match-fixing .

"(CNN) -- FIFA has imposed a worldwide lifetime ban from football on 41 players from Korea who became embroiled in match-fixing activities in their domestic league. In another episode that underlines the fight soccer faces to rid the sport of corruption, the game's governing body extended a ban handed down by the Korea Football Association (KFA) in 2011. Of those 41 players, FIFA have offered 21 who handed themselves in voluntarily a chance to return to the sport after a probationary period of between two and five years. The charges relate to match-fixing in Korea's domestic K-League competition and in all but one case were centered on offering or accepting bribes to throw matches. These latest sanctions add to a further 10 worldwide bans imposed on players from Korea in June last year. A FIFA spokesman told CNN: ""The K-League first issued the sanctions, which were then extended by the KFA in summer of 2011 to have national scope, and then subsequently FIFA extended them to have worldwide effect. ""FIFA announced 10 sanctions in June 2012 having received the case files from the KFA, and a further 41 Tuesday. There could still be further cases to follow, but we're not in a position at the moment to make any guess on numbers. ""Of the 51 cases, only one was for betting, whereas all the others were either for giving, or accepting bribes to fix matches. ""Of these 51 cases, 15 went to an appeal and an additional three persons (two players and one coach) committed suicide during the course of the investigations. ""Some of the 51 people involved have also been the subject of criminal proceedings in Korea, including jail sentences."" Soccer has been grappling with cases of match-fixing in recent years with Italian prosecutors conducting a wide-ranging investigation into some of Serie A's most high-profile clubs. Napoli were hit with a two-point penalty that dropped them from third to fifth in Serie A as part of the ongoing probe, though they vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- As Japan began its workweek Monday morning, the trains ran exactly on time, the elevators in thousands of Tokyo high-rises efficiently moved between floors, and the lights turned on across cities with nary a glitch. What makes this Monday so remarkable is that for the first time in four decades, none of the energy is derived from a nuclear reactor. Over the weekend, Japan's last remaining nuclear reactor shut down for regular maintenance. In the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, reactors have not been allowed back on. Japan is now the first major economy to see the modern era without nuclear power. Tomari Nuclear Power Plant's reactor 3 in Hokkaido shut down Saturday evening in a much-watched move by government, industry and environmentalists, who are waged in a public battle over the future of Japan's energy policy. ""I think it is not easy, but this challenge is worth fighting for,"" said Greenpeace Japan's Junichi Sato. ""There is an increased chance of earthquakes in Japan, so that has a significant risk to the Japanese people and the Japanese economy. The only way forward is to rapidly shift the energy source from nuclear to other sources of energy."" That's not the call just from environmental activists, but from a public suspicious of nuclear energy and its regulatory bodies since a tsunami and earthquake triggered nuclear meltdowns at three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011. Thousands marched through the streets of Tokyo on Saturday, celebrating the shutdown of the final reactor. The protesters waved colorful, traditional ""koinobori"" carp-shaped banners for Children's Day that became a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement. That movement grew from the grass-roots level in the wake of the disaster as the country watched tens of thousands of residents living within a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of the nuclear plant evacuated and the remaining area turn into a contaminated wasteland. Before the Fukushima disaster, Japan relied on nuclear for about 30% of its energy. As reactors have come off-line, the country has increased its imports of fossil fuels. Japan's government predicts it won't be able to keep up that pace, and the void will result in an energy crunch this summer, possibly leading to rolling blackouts. The national government's ruling party, the Democratic Party of Japan, has been urging local communities to allow reactors to return to operation. The party's deputy policy chief, Yoshito Sengoku, bluntly said without nuclear energy the world's third-largest economy would suffer. ""We must think ahead to the impact on Japan's economy and people's lives, if all nuclear reactors are stopped. Japan could, in some sense, be committing mass suicide,"" Sengoku said. Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, joined the plea in an April press conference. ""We cannot possibly agree to do the kind of energy saving yet again this year, or every year from now on,"" he said, referring to the country's efforts to turn off air conditioners and shift operation of production lines to weekends. ""The government must bring the nuclear power stations back into operation."" Economist Jesper Koll, managing director at JP Morgan, said Japan could avoid the economic fallout by defining a clear energy policy, something it has failed to do so far. ""The issue to the private sector of Japan is the government is taking its time in a very emotional, highly politicized debate. And the end result is very, very slow or no decision-making at all. After all, if you don't have an energy policy, you don't really have an economic policy because everything revolves around the energy,"" he said. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has promised a clear energy policy sometime this year, perhaps by summer. At a conference last month, the chairman of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum said the nuclear industry was committed to rebuilding the municipalities around the Fukushima plant, decommissioning that facility and pushing for increased safety measures at plants nationwide. ""We, the nuclear industry, will learn what should be learned from the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. Based on that, we will endeavor to restore the image and position of nuclear energy,"" Takashi Imai said. Nuclear energy must remain part of the government's policy, he said, ""in order for Japan to continue sustainable growth as a nation committed to trade based on science and technology."" But Yukie Osaki, who used to live in Fukushima, said she won't accept any policy that includes nuclear energy. ""Nobody believes the government anymore when it says nuclear plants are safe,"" she said. ""Japan is an earthquake country. It is already dangerous to have nuclear plants here. If we have another accident, we won't have anywhere to live in Japan anymore.""","Japan closes its last operating nuclear reactor over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt reacted with fury when major legislative pillars of his New Deal were declared unconstitutional by a Supreme Court anchored by four ideological conservatives. He lashed out at the justices, accusing them of practicing crass politics disguised as constitutional law. Seventy-five years ago last month, FDR proposed his ill-fated court-packing plan that would have allowed him to stack the court with new appointees sympathetic to the New Deal. Will history be repeated this term when the Roberts court decides the constitutional fate of President Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Health Care Act? The justices will hear five-and-a-half hours of arguments over three days, March 26-28, on the healthcare law and deliver their judgment by the end of the term. If the court strikes down all or part of the law, Obama, like FDR before him, will almost certainly denounce the court's decision. After all, he has already had practice in publicly criticizing the court. At his 2010 State of the Union address, with the justices sitting directly in front of him, he accused the court majority in the Citizens United decision of reversing a century of constitutional law to open ""the floodgates for special interests... to spend without limit in our elections."" Besides the willingness of both FDR and Obama to criticize the court, there are other parallels between the two Democratic presidents. Both came to office as liberal reformers who envisioned a large role for the federal government in promoting the nation's welfare. But in defending their policies, they revealed their very different political styles and temperaments. During his first term, Roosevelt, a supremely confident, aggressive politician, proudly brandished his liberalism as a blunt instrument against his sworn conservative enemies in the business community, whom he labeled ""economic royalists."" For most of Obama's first term, the cool, controlled president has downplayed his liberalism, seeking to bring conservative lawmakers to the bargaining table, without notable success. Only in the past few months has he been willing to aggressively confront his political opponents. There also are notable parallels between the two chief justices, Charles Hughes and John Roberts, separated by 75 years of American history. Both were brilliant lawyers appointed to the court by Republican presidents. And both inherited formidable conservative blocs of justices whose judicial opinions demonstrated a hostility to the policies of the Democratic presidents in office. In the 1930s, the four most conservative members of the court, known as ""the four horsemen,"" consistently voted to strike down far-reaching New Deal economic legislation. The Roberts court's most conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas, all appointed by Republican presidents, have voted together on polarizing issues (such as campaign financing in Citizens United) in favor of corporate interests. The conspicuous differences between FDR and Obama are matched by the leaders of the two courts, Chief Justices Hughes and Roberts. Neither Roberts nor, perhaps, anyone else who has served on the modern court, could rival Hughes in the breadth of his career. Hughes was appointed chief justice by President Herbert Hoover in 1930 after a distinguished career as a lawyer, investigator of special interests, reform governor of New York, Supreme Court justice and secretary of State. His only failure in public life was his narrow defeat as the Republican candidate for president in 1916 by the incumbent, Woodrow Wilson. More significantly, Hughes, unlike Roberts, could not be easily categorized by the interests he advocated. As a lawyer, he defended large corporate interests but also five Socialists who had been expelled from the New York legislature because of their political convictions. As chief justice, Hughes was a centrist, often appearing to split the difference between the two warring conservative and liberal factions on the court. He wrote opinions upholding some New Deal statutes, but also voted with the majority to strike down the National Recovery Administration and the Agriculture Adjustment Act. At the same time, Hughes burnished his longstanding reputation as a stalwart civil libertarian, writing groundbreaking opinions protecting freedom of the press and association. In contrast, Roberts earned a reputation as a fierce advocate on behalf of conservative causes before his appointment to the court by President George W. Bush in 2005. And as chief justice, he has aligned himself consistently with the most conservative members of the court. The balance of power on the Roberts court in closely divided constitutional cases has not resided with the chief justice, as it did with the Hughes court's centrists, the chief justice and Justice Owen Roberts. Instead, the pivotal vote has usually been cast by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who often, but not always, sides with his more ideologically conservative brethren. If the justices divide along conservative-liberal lines on the constitutionality of the federal healthcare law, Kennedy, not Roberts, will likely determine the outcome. Obama's recent boldness in confronting his Republican opponents, as FDR routinely did throughout his presidency, suggests that he, like Roosevelt, will attack the Roberts court if it throws out his major policy initiative, the Affordable Health Care Act. But however aggressive his attack, he is not likely to emulate Roosevelt in proposing a court-packing plan to add justices more to his liking. Most historians have rated FDR's court-packing plan as one of the worst mistakes of his presidency, a judgment that will not be lost on Obama, a careful student of American history. Even if the justices uphold the healthcare statute, the Roberts court may well be a central issue in the fall presidential campaign. Both Obama and his potential Republican opponents have said that the 2012 presidential election will be about the future direction of the country. The U.S. Supreme Court will play a prominent role in that future. The victor in the November presidential election may have the opportunity to appoint one or more justices to the Court (four justices are older than 70). If there are vacancies during the next presidential term, the president's appointments are likely to determine the future direction of the court and of the nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James F. Simon.","Supreme Court will hear case on Obama's healthcare law this month .

"(CNN) -- After a week remembering one of the most traumatic incidents in the club's past, Manchester United fans can now look forward to one of their biggest days in modern history. The English Premier League leaders will visit nine-time European champions Real Madrid -- and former player Cristiano Ronaldo -- on Wednesday safe in the knowledge that last season's nightmare may soon be erased. Alex Ferguson's team moved 12 points clear of rivals Manchester City after Sunday's 2-0 win over Everton -- the side who last season came back from 4-2 down to snatch a draw at Old Trafford and derail United's challenge for a record-extending 20th title. Having seen City lose 3-1 at Southampton on Saturday, Ferguson resisted the temptation to rest key players ahead of the Champions League trip to Spain and was rewarded as veteran Ryan Giggs and top scorer Robin van Persie sealed a crucial win. ""I was going to make about seven changes but when I got the result, I felt this was a more important game for us because it could give us a comfortable lead,"" Ferguson said. ""We can make changes later on in the season. It is realistic; we knew that if we got a good result today then we'd be in a positive position."" Before the match, United fans had unveiled a huge banner commemorating the 55th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, which killed 23 of 44 people onboard including eight United players. Ferguson, who was 16 at the time, said on Wednesday's anniversary that he had been affected by the incident ever since. The 39-year-old Giggs put United ahead on Sunday in the 13th minute from Van Persie's assist, and has now scored in the league for each of the last 23 seasons. ""His legacy lives on, he is a fantastic human being,"" Ferguson said of one-club man Giggs, who made his debut against Everton on March 2, 1991. ""He's up and down that pitch all day and has shown fantastic energy for the game, it is wonderful to see."" Van Persie doubled the lead at the end of the first half, beating the offside trap and rounding keeper Tim Howard before sliding in a shot that Everton defender Johnny Heitinga could only help into the net. It was the Dutchman's league-leading 19th goal this season and his 23rd in all competitions since joining from Arsenal for $38 million in August. Everton dropped to sixth after the weekend's results, losing ground in the race for Champions League qualification. At the other end of the table, Aston Villa moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win over midtable West Ham, ending a run of nine league matches without a victory. Belgium striker Christian Benteke broke the deadlock in the 74th minute from the penalty spot -- his 11th league goal this season -- after a foul on Charles N'Zogbia, who curled home a free-kick four minutes later. Paul Lambert's team then held on despite a late own goal from Ashley Westwood.","Robin van Persie and Ryan Giggs score in Manchester United's 2-0 win over Everton .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy produced a dazzling performance to clinch the World Tour Championship in Dubai. The world no.1 birdied the last five holes to pip Justin Rose by two shots and round off a phenomenal year. Beginning the day leading the field alongside Luke Donald, the Northern Irishman was forced to produce his brilliant best as his Ryder Cup teammate faded towards the end. McIlroy had fallen two shots off the lead following a bogey on the 13th as Rose bloomed in the Dubai sunshine. McIlroy to duel with Donald for Dubai glory . Rose, ranked seven in the world, set a new course record with a bogey-free round of 10-under par 62. But McIlroy, watched by tennis ace girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki, produced an exquisite run of form down the final stretch to finish on six-under 66 and 23-under for the tournament. And the 23-year-old, who came into the tournament having already won the Race to Dubai European Money List, was thrilled with his latest triumph. McIlroy clinches money list double . ""I just wanted to finish the season the way I thought it deserved to be finished,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""I've played so well throughout the year, and I didn't want to just let it tail off sort of timidly. I wanted to come here and finish in style. I was able to do it. ""Obviously going out today, myself and Luke (Donald) were tied for the lead, and we both didn't get off to the greatest of starts. ""And then Justin had that incredible back nine, shot 62, and I knew midway through the back nine I needed to do something special. ""Somehow I summoned up the energy from somewhere to make five birdies in the last five holes. It's just a great way to end this tournament, a great way to end the season, and I am already excited about 2013. ""It means a lot to me to win in this fashion, as well. I guess in a way, Justin gave me the opportunity to do what I did. ""I guess seeing a target there and shooting at something, it definitely makes you more focused."" The 23-under-par 265 recorded by McIlroy matched the lowest four-round aggregate in the four-year history of the tournament -- set by Lee Westwood in 2009. Will McIlroy join Tiger at Nike in $20M a year deal? He also equaled the Englishman's achievement of winning both the Race to Dubai European Money List and the World Tour Championship in the same season . Meanwhile, Rose was left to reflect on what might have been having gone close to making an eagle putt from 70 feet on the 13th only to miss by inches. He said: ""That was a lot of fun. The front nine was just as good as the back nine, and the back nine putts started going in, which is a nice feeling. ""But you know what Rory is capable of. Fair play to him for making all those birdies down the stretch."" Luke Donald, who led alongside McIlroy overnight, finished on 18-under for the tournament after making two bogeys on the final round having not made any over the first 100 holes of the tournament. He finished level alongside 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel.","Rory McIlroy wins the World Tour Championship in Dubai .

"Washington (CNN) -- A man who volunteered as a suicide bomber for a terrorist group intent on blowing up a U.S.-bound plane was working instead as an intelligence agent for Saudi Arabia, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing American and foreign officials. The double agent departed Yemen, traveled through the United Arab Emirates and gave the bomb and information about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to the CIA, Saudi intelligence and other foreign intelligence agencies, the newspaper said. The bomb, which was intended to pass undetected through airport security, was given to the FBI, which was poring over it, the newspaper said. The Times, citing officials, said the agent works for Saudi intelligence, which has ""cooperated closely"" with the CIA for years. The officials, who would not identify the man, said he is safe in Saudi Arabia, the newspaper reported. Citing a senior American official, the newspaper described the device as sewn into ""custom fit"" underwear and able to be detonated in two ways. That redundancy may have been an attempt to ensure that an attempt to blow up a jet over Detroit in 2009, which failed because the bomb did not detonate, would not be repeated. The primary charge in the latest device was high-grade military explosive that the Times, quoting an official, said ""undoubtedly would have brought down an aircraft."" A senior administration official told CNN that officials were debating whether to release photographs of the device to law enforcement agencies. On one side of the argument, Transportation Safety Administration screeners and law enforcement might more easily identify any similar devices made as part of the same plot, the official said. But officials were reluctant to do so out of concern that the photographs would be leaked to the news media and that the would-be bombers would learn what law enforcement knows -- and might not know -- about the bomb's workings. The news of the double agent might explain comments made earlier Tuesday by John Brennan, the chief White House counterterrorism adviser, who told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that U.S. officials were confident they were in control of the situation leading up to the seizure of the improvised explosive device, or IED. Brennan said that officials believe redundant security systems would have prevented any attempt at bombing a flight from succeeding, but analysts were studying the device to see whether security procedures should be adjusted. ""We're trying to make sure that we take the measures that we need to prevent any other type of IED, similarly constructed, from getting through security procedures,"" Brennan said. The device investigators were studying is more sophisticated than were previous ones and represents a disconcerting advance in al Qaeda bomb-making techniques, officials said Tuesday. ""It is a device similar to the underwear bomber of 2009, but an evolution to that,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. The device never posed an immediate danger to air travel or the United States, she said. But lawmakers said more such devices may exist, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said the release of information about the device could complicate an effort to seal the long-term threat. ""If something bad happens because it was leaked too early, that's a catastrophe and it's also a crime,"" Rogers told CNN. News about the device became public on Monday, about two weeks after U.S. intelligence agents thwarted the plot after receiving a tip from Saudi Arabia, a source familiar with the operation said. Information from the double agent proved key to a CIA drone strike Sunday in Yemen that killed Fahd al Quso, 37, a senior operative of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Quso was a suspect in the bombing in 2000 of the USS Cole in Yemen. The vehicle he was in was hit by a drone strike in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province, U.S. officials said. Al Qaeda's bomb-makers evolve, adapt . ""I was told by the White House they are connected; they're part of the same operation,"" the source familiar with the operation said. Al Quso hinted at the existence of another bomb effort in February, when he was asked whether the group had stopped exporting terrorism operations. ""The war didn't end between us and our enemies,"" he replied. ""Wait for what is coming."" Western officials describe AQAP as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate. U.S. Rep. Peter King of New York, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, expressed dismay that the news was public. ""It's really, to me, unfortunate that this has gotten out, because this could really interfere with operations overseas,"" he said. ""My understanding is a major investigation is going to be launched because of this."" Officials have provided few specifics about the device. But Rogers said it underscores al Qaeda's continuing efforts to carry out terrorist attacks. ""This is a device that was more sophisticated, had some fail-safes built into it, and it was something that concerns us because it tells us that they brought some very capable people together to build something,"" he said. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said authorities have ""no specific, credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the U.S. at this time."" Though the threat was foiled around the time of the anniversary of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, a second U.S. counterterrorism official said the two were not related. President Barack Obama was told last month about the plot, which ""underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad,"" the White House said. AQAP has been responsible for two of the most audacious attempts to target the United States in recent years: the attempted Christmas 2009 bombing and a 2010 attempt to load bombs hidden inside printer cartridges onto cargo planes headed for Chicago. In both cases, U.S. authorities believe the bombs were built by Ibrahim al-Asiri. Both devices contained PETN, a white, powdery explosive that conventional ""single-beam"" X-ray machines are rarely able to detect. In 2009, al-Asiri outfitted his brother, Abdullah al-Asiri, with a PETN-based underwear bomb in an attempt to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a top Saudi security official. The device killed his brother instantly but failed to kill its target. ""We are not ready to say the threat stream is over,"" a U.S. official told CNN. ""We believe external plotting continues."" The investigation involves a number of countries and is ""ongoing,"" King, R-New York, said on CNN's ""Starting Point."" He said the leadership of al Qaeda was intimately involved in the plot. Rogers told CNN International's Christiane Amanpour, ""I can confirm to you that, in fact, it was an al Qaeda core group that was responsible for the development and procurement and financing and putting together this particular bomb."" As the hunt continues for the mastermind bomber, a U.S. official said the assumption continues to be that al-Asiri is training others in bombmaking. ""They understand that Asiri is going to be killed or captured one day,"" Mustafa Alani, the director of security and defense studies at the Gulf Research Center, told CNN. Alani had been briefed on AQAP by Saudi counterterrorism officials. ""We're talking about a new generation of very skillful bomb builders and very committed people."" U.S. counterterrorism agencies have reached a similar conclusion. ""I think the fear is not just that he'll share his ability within his own circle, but rather more widely, and send it to other al Qaeda-sympathetic individuals or organizations,"" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN in March. Yemen's government has been fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for years with mixed results. Yemen president vows offensive against al Qaeda . Yemeni authorities appeared miffed by the revelations of the foiled plot, saying that Washington had shared no information with them. ""Yemen has been a key ally to the United States when it comes to fighting terror and cooperates in every way possible,"" said a senior intelligence official in Yemen who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""It's very sad to know that the United States did not share such critical intelligence information with Yemen. ""The United States cannot win the war on terror alone, and intelligence sharing must be bilateral if it expects complete cooperation from Yemen."" ""This was a key victory for us,"" King said. ""It also reminds us, though, that this war is not going to end in Afghanistan. ... Al Qaeda has metastasized and morphed. And they are constantly attempting to find new ways to get at us."" CNN's Barbara Starr, National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, Pam Benson, Elise Labott, Jessica Yellin, Nic Robertson, journalist Hakim al-Masmari contributed to this report.","Suicide bomber volunteer was instead working as an intelligence agent, NYT reports .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Imagine collecting thousands of empty plastic bottles, lashing them together to make a boat and sailing the thing from California to Australia, a journey of 11,000 miles (17,700 km) through treacherous seas. This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles. You'd have to be crazy, or trying to make a point. David de Rothschild is trying to make a point. De Rothschild hopes his one-of-a-kind vessel, now being built on a San Francisco pier, will boost recycling of plastic bottles, which he says are a symbol of global waste. Except for the masts, which are metal, everything on the 60-foot catamaran is made from recycled plastic. ""It's all sail power,"" he said. ""The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted. Everything will be recycled. Even the vessel is going to end up being recycled when we finish."" De Rothschild's vessel, scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April, is called the Plastiki. Its name is an homage of sorts to Thor Heyerdahl, the fabled Norwegian explorer who in 1947 sailed 4,300 miles across the Pacific on the Kon-Tiki, a raft made from balsa wood. De Rothschild is something of an adventurer himself. The scion of a wealthy British banking family, he is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps. In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology, an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues.  Watch how the boat is constructed » . Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage. The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii, Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney, a trip estimated to take more than 100 days. The plastic sailboat is taking shape in an old pier building not far from this city's famous Fisherman's Wharf. Here, thousands of two-liter soda bottles are being stripped of their labels, washed, filled with dry-ice powder and then resealed. The dry ice sublimates into carbon dioxide gas and pressurizes the bottle, making it rigid. The vessel's twin hulls will be filled with 12,000 to 16,000 bottles. Skin-like panels made from recycled PET, a woven plastic fabric, will cover the hulls and a watertight cabin, which sleeps four. ""This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles,"" said de Rothschild of the PET fabric. ""We actually wrap the PET fabric over the PET foam and then basically put it under a vacuum, heat it, press it and create these long PET panels. So that means the boat is, technically, one giant bottle."" Two wind turbines and an array of solar panels will charge a bank of 12-volt batteries, which will power several onboard laptop computers, a GPS and SAT phone. Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said. He declined to reveal how much it's costing him to build the boat. ""We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of,"" he said. ""The idea is to take the Plastiki, break it down [after the voyage], and put it back into the system. So, it may come out being a jacket, a bag, more bottles. It's infinitely recyclable."" The ultimate goal of the Plastiki voyage is not just to encourage people to embrace clean, renewable energy but also to see consumer waste as a potential resource. That's what this is all about -- showcasing cradle-to-cradle products rather than cradle-to-grave,"" de Rothschild said. Whether the Plastiki will successfully complete its unique journey remains to be seen. But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles, its symbolic message is a welcome one. ""Anything that gets in the news and makes people stop and think about plastic can be very helpful,"" said Betty McLaughlin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute. ""But it strikes me as a long way to go. I flew from Los Angeles to Australia once, and it took forever. This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous.""","An adventurer is building a sailboat out of thousands of recycled plastic soda bottles .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods are both accustomed to life on the road, but even the planet's two top-ranked golfers are not immune to the stresses and strains of the professional golf circuit. In an exclusive joint interview with CNN, McIlroy and Tiger Woods explained how the grueling calendar has forced them both to skip this week's lucrative $7 million HSBC Champions tournament in China -- which starts just three days after their ""Duel at Jinsha Lake"" exhibition match. McIlroy won that clash a day after finishing second at a tournament in Shanghai on Sunday, while Woods came straight from playing in Malaysia. ""For me, I'm fried,"" said the 36-year-old Woods. ""I've played a lot of golf towards the end of the year ... I have one more tournament for the year and then I'm done until next year."" A resurgent Woods has recovered from a loss of form and fitness which dates back to November 2009 and the scandal that ended his marriage. After dropping out of the top 50 of the world rankings in October 2011, Woods has bounced back in 2012 by winning three PGA Tour events and he is second on the U.S.-based circuit's money list behind its winner McIlroy. Woods, who has spent a record 623 weeks at the top of the world rankings since turning pro in 1996, will finish the season by playing at the World Challenge event that he hosts later this month. ""I looked at it, I wanted a break,"" Woods explained. ""I wanted a long extended break from competing and get back into training."" It has been a stellar year for McIlroy. He won the second major title of his career at August's PGA Championship, adding to his 2011 U.S. Open triumph, as well as helping Europe retain the Ryder Cup in Illinois thanks to a stunning comeback victory against a U.S. team including Woods. But McIlroy, who also leads the European Tour's ""Race to Dubai"" money list, is feeling the effects of a long season and is wary of playing too much. ""Someone needs a week off somewhere,"" the 23-year-old said. ""If I played HSBC, I would be playing five events in a row to finish the season. ""After such a busy summer, a Ryder Cup and everything which has gone on, there has got to be an event somewhere which has to be left out and this year unfortunately it was HSBC, for the reason that I wasn't a fan of the golf course and I needed a week off."" McIlroy is one half of sport's most high-profile love match with Danish tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki. But despite having a sporting girlfriend -- the couple have been dubbed ""Wozzilroy"" -- McIlroy admitted life on the tour can get lonely. ""You want to have guys you can go out for dinner with and have a laugh with in the locker room,"" he added. ""You're out there for 25 weeks a year, so you might as well make it fun."" The growing rivalry between McIlroy and Woods is proving to be a big drawcard for golf, as witnessed by the chaotically enthusiastic scenes in Monday's one-off clash between the pair. The confident McIlroy has not been shy in pointing out Woods' fall from his previous apparent invincibility, and the American compared their relationship to that of previous adversaries Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. ""I talked to Jack about it and Jack and Arnie didn't like each other at the very get go,"" Woods said. ""They just didn't see eye-to-eye. But now they are best of friends, so that does happen -- mutual respect, or mutual respect over time and getting to know someone."" One Ryder Cup player who will be lining up at Mission Hills in Shenzen for Thursday's opening round is Woods' U.S. teammate and great rival Phil Mickelson. The veteran formed a formidable partnership with Ryder Cup rookie Keegan Bradley as the Americans built up a 10-6 lead over Europe heading into the final day at the Medinah Country Club. But Europe, captained by Jose Maria Olazabal, launched a stirring comeback to win 8½ points on the final day and retain the trophy. Four-time major winner Mickelson admits bouncing back from the defeat has been one of the toughest tests of his career, but he is ready to roar into action in China. ""I think the first two weeks following the Ryder Cup was a really tough low, one of the biggest lows of my career,"" the 42-year-old told the European Tour's website. ""It was a very emotional time because we really thought we were going to win. We expected to win; we were playing well and we thought that we were going to do it on Sunday. ""I think that the disappointment will last a lot longer than a month. I feel that over the next two years, we'll still have the same disappointment from not winning this year's Ryder Cup."" Mickelson has won this event on two previous occasions when it was held in Shanghai, and he is confident of more success at its new home. ""I enjoyed our first time in Shanghai, but I think this golf course is wonderful, too,"" he said. ""The fact that the golf tournament is moving is nothing different than what we have amongst all of the big major championships in golf. This is a great site with a great golf course to host it. ""I played the course for the first time this morning; Keegan and I played a practice round and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was fun to play. (There is a) great mixture of holes and challenges, the greens are very fair and I think it's going to be a fun course.""","Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods will both skip this week's HSBC Champions event .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Part outsize beach resort, part culture capital, Sydney, Australia, exemplifies the art of relaxed cosmopolitanism. It's urbane but not pretentious; cutting-edge but not stressed-out. Now a handful of players is channeling that Aussie energy into new restaurants, hotels, and boutiques in some oft-overlooked (and distinctly chic) neighborhoods. Here, the local take. Shop . The city's fashionable heart is the corner of Oxford Street and Glenmore Road, in Paddington, where some of the most exciting Australian designers are conveniently clustered.

Inside Kit Willow's chic, bi-level boutique, Willow, you'll find flirty draped frocks in organza and tulle. Just up the block in the ornate, shop-filled Strand Arcade is Corner Shop, a Sydney stalwart known for its tightly edited international collections (Marc Jacobs, Isabel Marant, and Benah). Men shouldn't miss the downtown boutique of Brent Wilson, with its updated classics, including easygoing suits, shirts, and sweaters. For housewares, head to Surry Hills. Planet Commonwealth carries Ross Longmuir's streamlined beds, tables, and sofas, all made from Australian hardwoods (don't worry, they'll help with shipping). The lure at Koskela is Aboriginal craftwork, such as the one-off lampshades traditionally woven with bush string. Travel + Leisure: World's strangest buildings . Scene .

"(CNN) -- The owner of the Segway company has died, apparently in an accident involving one of his upright two-wheeled vehicles, police in England said Monday. The body of James Heselden, 62, was pulled from the River Wharfe in northern England on Sunday, police said. A Segway-type vehicle was recovered from the river, police said. The incident is not thought to be suspicious, police said. Heselden's family said in a statement that ""there is absolutely nothing to suggest it was anything other than a tragic accident. ""Our family has been left devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of a much-loved father and husband,"" the family said. ""The exact circumstances of the accident are still being clarified and will, of course, be the subject of an inquest."" Heselden was the chairman of Hesco Bastion, a company that manufactures protective walls used by military troops. He also owned Segway Inc. Hesco Bastion confirmed ""with great sadness"" that Heselden had died ""in a tragic accident near his home."" It hailed his charitable work, saying that a donation of 10 million British pounds (nearly $16 million) to a local foundation earlier this month raised his lifetime charitable giving to 23 million pounds (over $36 million). The British veterans' charity Help for Heroes was another beneficiary of his donations, the company statement said. CNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Family mourns ""much-loved father and husband""

"(CNN) -- This week the U.S. Justice Department accused an Iranian-American, who allegedly has ties to Iran's elite Quds Force, of attempting to hire a man he thought was a Mexican cartel hitman to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States. Some question the plausibility of the circumstances that prosecutors have described involving Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old used-car salesman from Texas. The alleged plot, if proven, would be but one of several terror schemes hatched by American citizens that were intended to occur on U.S. soil but were not carried out. Here are a few of those: . Iyman Faris . In 2002, Pakistani-American Iyman Faris worked as a truck driver in Columbus, Ohio. He was convicted of providing material support to al Qaeda for his role in a plot to attack the Brooklyn Bridge. WikiLeaks documents released this spring reveal more details about Faris' role in the war on terror. Faris pleaded guilty to providing material support to al Qaeda and was sentenced in October 2003 to 20 years in prison. He's now behind bars in Florence, Ohio. Ryan Anderson . In September 2004, then-26-year-old Ryan Anderson, a U.S. citizen and member of the Washington National Guard, was convicted of passing military information to American agents posing as al Qaeda operatives. Anderson, a convert to Islam, was arrested earlier that year at Fort Lewis, Washington. According to the News Tribune in Tacoma, Washington, which covered Anderson's story extensively, military prosecutors contended that Anderson had ""grown disgusted"" with what he viewed as ""the moral decay"" of America, and that Anderson disagreed with the war in Iraq. He was also upset that his Guard unit was being deployed. Kevin James . In 2005, authorities announced that they had foiled a plot, concocted in a California prison, to use proceeds from gas station robberies to carry out terror attacks. Planned targets included military recruitment centers, synagogues and the Israeli consulate. Kevin James pleaded guilty in 2007 to conspiracy to levy war against the government of the United States through terrorism, and to oppose by force the authority of the U.S. government. The danger of Islamic radicalization inside American prisons is ""real and present,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said in June during a controversial hearing on the subject. King is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. King weighed in on the alleged plot revealed this week, telling CNN that evidence in the case against Arbabsia is strong. Jose Padilla . Perhaps the most well-known American citizen convicted of plotting against the U.S. in the war on terror is Jose Padilla. In June 2002, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft said that the former Chicago gang member, who had converted to Islam, had been detained at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. At that time, Padilla was accused of plotting with al Qaeda to explode a radioactive ""dirty bomb"" in the United States. Three years later, a new indictment against Padilla was filed but made no mention of a dirty bomb. On August 16, 2007, Padilla and two co-defendants, Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country, conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists, and providing material support for terrorists. In 2008, Padilla was sentenced to 17 years and four months in prison. Hassoun was also sentenced to 15 years and eight months and Jayyousi to 12 years and eight months. In September 2011, the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Padilla's 17-year sentence is too lenient. Paul Hall . In April 2009, an American citizen born Paul Hall -- aka Hassan Abu-Jihaad -- was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In March of 2007, the former Navy sailor aboard the USS Benfold was arrested and charged with providing information to a London-based group called Azzam Publications in 2001 regarding the classified movements of his U.S. Navy battle group as it traveled from California to the Persian Gulf region. Azzam operated English-language jihadi Web sites. In March 2008, jurors in New Haven, Connecticut, convicted Hall of providing material support to terrorists and disclosing classified national defense information. Faisal Shahzad . In October 2010, after a New York judge sentenced a Pakistan-born U.S. citizen to life in prison for trying to detonate a car bomb in Times Square, Faisal Shahzad warned the court, ""Brace yourself. The war with Muslims has just begun."" Shahzad had an MBA and was at one point a financial analyst. He was living in Connecticut. On May 1, 2010, Shazad parked a vehicle in Times Square rigged with an explosive device that did not go off. Street vendors tipped off police to the abandoned car. He was caught aboard a flight about to depart from New York en route to Dubai. He allegedly confessed to the plot.","An Iranian-American has been accused of plotting a terror attack to occur in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Allison Janney was always on the move as a child. The ""West Wing"" actress played sports and enjoyed figure skating, so staying active was easy. But over the years, exercise took a back seat to Janney's evolving career. ""I think when 'West Wing' ended, I just went into a slump,"" she recently said. We all did, Ms. Janney. Thankfully the popular government drama is back, available for streaming on Netflix due to a new deal with Warner Bros. that sent fans to the couch in rerun ecstasy. And Janney has returned to her active lifestyle, dropping 20 pounds by focusing on her diet and daily hikes with her dogs. Janney's had more than one high-profile role since ""The West Wing"" ended: She played the dog-obsessed mom in ""Juno,"" a Southern socialite in ""The Help"" and Matthew Perry's crazy boss on ""Mr. Sunshine."" But Janney said White House press secretary C.J. Cregg will always be one of her favorite characters. ""I feel proud,"" she said. ""I feel like I can die happy; I did something good. Not that I'm planning on dying anytime soon."" That's good, especially considering Janney's newest role is spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women campaign. The campaign aims to spread awareness about the No. 1 killer of women: heart disease. Heart disease kills one woman every minute, according to the American Heart Association, and the gap between women's and men's survival rates continues to widen. Janney comes from a long line of ""cream and butter"" lovers, she said. Her family's history of heart disease -- including a grandfather who died of a heart attack -- led her to volunteer for the campaign. ""I feel if there was one cause that I actually had experience with, and a reason to step up for, it would be this,"" she said. ""I hope I can make a difference in someone's life."" CNN spoke with Janney about Go Red for Women, how she stays healthy and where she hopes her career heads next. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: I love the dress that you're wearing in the new PSA; that bright red color looks great on you. Allison Janney: I love it, too! Red has always been a great color on me, which is why I decided to do the campaign. (laughs) CNN: What does that color symbolize for women? Janney: It's blood. It's love. It's your heart. It's vibrant. It's alive. Red is just the most standout, powerful color I think there is. This famous costume designer I worked with ... said the woman who gets to wear the red dress is the one who's the most powerful. It's the perfect color to go with this campaign, because it's all about keeping women strong and healthy and vital. Survivor of heart failure dedicates birthday to educating others . CNN: Let's talk about the real reason you're working with the American Heart Association. Janney: I had a bit of a scary experience with my mother who, like most women I think, ignored the symptoms. She was driving, going to see the grandkids. She was in a motel and probably had what was a very small heart attack -- but a warning. She just thought she was having this unbelievable pressure and discomfort in her neck and shoulders. She drove 10 hours to Dayton, Ohio, and drove right to the doctor because she knew something was wrong. He just couldn't believe she drove all that way. She went right into the hospital and had emergency quadruple bypass surgery. I almost lost her. For that reason alone, I'm glad to be part of this campaign. CNN: You mentioned that many women feel like they have to tough it out and just ignore the symptoms. Why do you think that is? Janney: I think, as women, we tend to always put our own needs in the back seat to take care of our family or loved ones. My mother did just that. Women feel they need to take care of everybody, (but) they can't take care of anybody if they don't take care of themselves. Jennie Garth: Know your heart, know the risks . CNN: How did that experience, and learning more about heart disease, change the way you looked at exercise and nutrition? Janney: I've lost 15 (to) 20 pounds since the summer. I've been doing Pilates three days a week, and I have three dogs, which gets me out walking every single morning. It's been nice to slim down and bump up the exercise. CNN: Do you have any favorite foods that you've had a hard time giving up? Janney: I don't believe you have to give everything up completely. I am my mother's daughter. I like cream sauces. I like macaroni and cheese, all that comfort food. I love chocolate, but now I go for 88% and 90% dark, dark chocolate to treat myself. I go for Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream in a recipe. It's kind of a game to see how I can take a recipe and make it healthy and still make it taste good. It's a challenge I'm enjoying. CNN: So you like to cook? Janney: I do. I'm not the best cook, but I do like to get inspired -- you know, get the cooking magazines or watch cooking shows. Basically, I like to have people over to my house, because I usually hate going out to restaurants. So I'm trying to give them more reasons to want to come over to my house. Like, ""Oh, my God, Allison's a good cook."" CNN: What else is a staple in your diet? What do you have for breakfast? Janney: I've been doing juicing ... kind of an almond milk mixture. And then if I'm still hungry, I make steel cut oats or have oatmeal with some banana in it or a little agave to sweeten it. And that keeps me going. I eat a lot of salads. Whatever I eat is mostly 70% water. I eat tons of salads and greens and peppers and scallions and avocados, my favorite food on the planet. I've been eating a lot of soups and one-pot meals, with quinoa, with chicken breast and tomatoes and thyme. I really try to stick to that, and I find I feel better; I have more energy. I'm 50-something, and I feel better than I felt 20 years ago. So it works. CNN: What do you do for stress relief? Janney: I'm trying to learn to meditate. I haven't been able to achieve it successfully yet because I get impatient. I do these breathing exercises where if I start to feel stressed I breathe in for -- I start at a high number like eight -- and breathe in for eight counts and breathe out for eight counts, until I feel like I can go down to seven and then to six ... and it really does calm me down. Getting a dog I would highly recommend for anyone. Animals are great for stress. The morning comes, and you have to take those dogs out. And I feel better because I don't feel guilty. CNN: What would you like to tell women about heart disease? Janney: We only get to be here once; why not feel the best you can feel? Start making choices that are going to make a difference in your life and the people's lives around you. You just have to consciously be aware that we're not going to be here forever. This is not a dress rehearsal. This is it. This is all we have. And if you look down and you can pinch more than an inch, it's time to start taking it seriously. CNN: You've been called one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood. What haven't you done that you'd still like to do? Janney: Really? Wow. I just signed up for doing a series for CBS called ""Mom."" Anna Faris plays my daughter. It's a multicam series, the first time I'll be doing that sort of format where I'm performing in front of a live audience for television. I'm really excited about that. There are lots of types of roles that I'd like to do that I haven't done yet. I've always said I'd like to play action hero; a really physically demanding film role would be fun. I want to be challenged, work with great people and find better roles. Like the role that I found in C.J.; I like the women that I play who are inspiring to other women. That makes me feel good about what I do, that it has a lasting impact on the world. I want to do more Broadway. I want to continue doing film. I want to have this show (""Mom"") with Chuck Lorre be a great success. I just want to keep working, because that's where I'm happy, and I think that's what I'm supposed to do in this lifetime: keep working and keep experiencing and keep healthy and stay alive as long as I can.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of North Carolina voters hit the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots on a referendum that would constitutionally ban same-sex marriage, even though state law already does not permit such unions. Amendment 1 would alter the North Carolina Constitution to say that ""marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state."" Supporters argue that the amendment is needed to stop those trying to redefine marriage and to ward off possible future actions of ""activist judges."" It would also strengthen the state's position against same-sex civil unions, often considered a precursor to the marriage issue. Opponents say the measure is redundant and could result in jeopardizing domestic violence protections for women and affect couples' health benefits. Follow all the political news at CNN.com's Election Center . Several municipalities in North Carolina provide benefits to same-sex couples, state officials say. Duke University law professor Kathryn Bradley says those rights could be potentially lost if the referendum passes on Tuesday. Concerns over the measure also home in on the potential for unintended consequences, she said, affecting issues such as child custody and the prosecution of domestic violence among unmarried couples because of the narrow definition of the new statute. ""Before domestic violence laws, we relied on criminal assault laws, which don't always protect against things like stalking,"" added Bradley, who says the measure could also affect heterosexual couples. But Sen. Dan Soucek, one of the primary sponsors of the proposed amendment, said he doesn't ""believe those are legitimate concerns."" ""We looked at these issues extensively and tried to make sure that all of those concerns are addressed,"" he said. A simple majority is needed for the measure to be approved. It was passed in the state House and Senate last year. Both are Republican-controlled, the first time that's happened in North Carolina in the past 140 years, according to house officials. ""This bill's been 12 years in the making,"" noted Maxine Eichner, a law professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""But it's now made possible because Republicans control the legislature."" Should Amendment 1 gain approval, it would largely prevent the state's judiciary from overturning the bill by enshrining its language into the state constitution. Some 500,000 people had already cast ballots on the measure through early voting or absentee ballots. Polls are set to close at 7:30 p.m. ET. ""It could destroy our family unit,"" said Kelli Evans alongside and her partner of 17 years, Karen Wade. ""If they could see that it's a family they're affecting, maybe they could sit down and think about the issue before they vote on Election Day."" Others say the issue, if left unchecked, could one day undermine traditional notions of marriage. Evangelist Billy Graham endorsed the ballot initiative, a rare move for a preacher who has typically avoided political fights. Graham took out full-page ads in 14 North Carolina newspapers touting his support for the measure, saying ""the Bible is clear -- God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman."" Graham's website encouraged churches to download a poster that bears his image and the message ""Vote for Marriage May 8th."" On the other side, former President Bill Clinton opposed the amendment in a recording sent by phone to hundreds of thousands of North Carolina homes. ""So the real effect of the law is not to keep the traditional definition of marriage, you've already done that,"" Clinton says in the recording. ""The real effect of the law will be to hurt families and drive away jobs."" The only recent public opinion polling on the issue, derived from a group that does work for Democratic candidates and causes, indicates that a majority of North Carolina voters support the amendment. Nationally, according to a new Gallup survey, 50% of Americans believe same-sex couples should be allowed to wed, a markedly different position than in past years, suggesting a growing acceptance of same-sex marriages. Some 48% say they do not support same-sex weddings. Sen. Soucek described marriage on Tuesday as a ""time-tested building block of society that revolves around procreation."" But three days earlier, Vice President Joe Biden said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with the idea of same-sex marriage. ""I just think that the good news is that as more and more Americans come to understand what this is all about, it is a simple proposition: Who do you love? Who do you love? And will you be loyal to the person who love?"" Biden said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Biden did not mention the North Carolina initiative and added that it's the president, not he, who sets the administration's policy. President Barack Obama has taken the official position that his views on the issue are ""evolving."" Thirty states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a hetereosexual union. ""Of states without constitutional amendments on marriage, 45% (9 of 20) eventually recognize same-sex marriage, either by direct judicial decree, by legislative action, or by a ruling requiring that same-sex marriages from other states be treated as valid,"" a nonprofit political group called the National Organization for Marriage said in a statement. ""Among the 30 states with marriage amendments, none have been repealed."" Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June. Opponents there have pledged to block the bill and have also called for a referendum. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits same-sex couples to wed in that state as of January 1, 2013.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A record number of American women will hold U.S. Senate seats after Tuesday's election. In China, there is speculation over whether a woman will also make history by ascending to its top political core. No woman has ever held a post in the elite nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo that governs China. Thousands of senior Chinese officials gathered in Beijing this week and at the end of the conference next week, a new set of leaders will be unveiled. Some observers consider Liu Yandong a possible contender for the exclusive ruling committee. Liu is the lone female member of the Politburo, a 24-member body atop the Chinese Communist Party. If promoted to the standing committee, Liu would make a crack in the political glass ceiling. Even with the historic prospect of a woman joining the most powerful Chinese political entity, some are skeptical of the overall progress for Chinese women in power. ""I think women's participation in politics in China remains largely symbolic due to complicated social, cultural, and political factors,"" said Xi Chen, assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas-Pan American. Liu is the daughter of Liu Ruilong, the former vice minister of agriculture. She is also said to have strong family ties with former Chinese President Jiang Zemin as well as President Hu Jintao. She is part of the ""princeling class,"" the sons or daughters of revolutionary veterans who now number among the nation's elite. ""If Liu Yandong is appointed to the Politburo Standing Committee, it would be a milestone for female political representation in China and an indication that the Chinese government is ready to place a woman in a position of genuine power,"" said Leta Hong Fincher, doctoral candidate at Tsinghua University, who examines gender issues in China. ""But that move alone would not necessarily lead to an improvement in the overall status of women."" If chosen for the committee, Liu will most likely take the position of the ""propaganda tsar,"" according to Hoover Institution, which is based at Stanford University. The group described Liu as ""liberal minded."" Chinese data show that women lag in political representation. Only 2.2% of working women were in charge of the state offices, party organizations and other enterprises or institutions, according to the Third Survey on Chinese Women's Social Status, a national survey released last year. During the presentation of these survey results, officials from the All-China Women's Federation, a women's advancement organization affiliated with the government, was asked why the Chinese leadership lacked women. Song Xiuyan, the vice-chairman of the federation said the Communist Party of China and the government places ""great importance to empower women's issues, which our Constitution has clearly put forward the basic principle of 'gender equality.'"" The Women's Studies Institute of China, which is sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation, declined multiple requests for comment. ""The relatively small number of female politicians in China is a topic criticized by Western media,"" reported Xinhua, the state-run news agency in March. The news agency stated: ""However, the ratio of female national lawmakers stands at 22%, compared with only 17% in the United States."" China ranks 63rd in the world by percentage of women serving in a legislative house, compared with U.S. at 80th, according to July data compiled by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international organization of parliaments. That ranking may be out-of-date after the U.S. elections this week. Female candidates made huge gains and stand to occupy a record 20 seats out of the 100 in the U.S. Senate. Women in China have made important strides in recent years. Chinese women receive an average of 8.8 years of education compared with 2.7 years in 2000, according to the national survey. And studies find that women are outperforming men in universities, said Fincher of Tsinghua University. But their education does not translate to economic and political power. ""You see that in the workplace, there's a lot of systemic gender discrimination in the workplace, there's discrimination in hiring and promotion,"" Fincher said. ""There has also been a lot of evidence that the gender income gap has widened, especially in the very recent years."" Statistically, women's average annual income was 67.3 % of men's in urban areas and 56% in rural areas -- which reflected a decrease compared with the wage gap in 1990, according to the 2010 national survey. There are exceptions as some women have achieved the pinnacle of financial success. In the Huron Report's list of the world's top female billionaires, 18 out of 28 came from China. ""Of course China is the most populous country in the world,"" Fincher said. ""Of course you're going to have individual women who are incredibly successful. That doesn't say anything about the status of the vast majority of women."" For Chinese workers, gender-targeted job ads stipulate the age, height and desired physical attributes of female applicants, according to studies on the topic. And the recent survey results suggest that more people believe that Chinese women should focus on family, rather than getting involved in public life or careers. In the national survey, 62% of men and 55% of women agreed with this statement: ""Men should mainly focus on career and women should be family oriented."" The number of people who agreed with that statement increased by 7.7% and 4.4% for men and women, respectively, in the past 12 years compared with their views in 2000 -- signaling ""a resurgence of traditional beliefs about gender roles,"" Fincher said. Gender issues are sensitive in China, especially in a country dogged by a history of preference for males and sex-selective abortion that has resulted in a lopsided population. Male births outpaced female births 118 to 110, according to Xinhua.","No woman has been tapped to the 9-member standing committee to govern China .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California. I must have been the only one. U.S. Census Bureau data released this week confirm that, during the last decade, the tide was definitely going the other way. The Lone Star State was the undisputed winner in the 2010 population sweepstakes. Its prize: more congressional seats awarded through reapportionment than any other state. Texas added four House seats and increased its number of electoral votes to 38. That will be second only to California, which has 55 electoral votes. California, which grew rapidly through the 20th century, only increased at the national average in the past 10 years. It didn't add any House seats this year. The other winners in the census lottery include Florida, which picked up two new seats in Congress. Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Utah, South Carolina and Washington all picked up one extra seat. It is a much bleaker story in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Massachusetts, which lost seats. Why did you move -- or stay -- in the last few years? Tell us on iReport! It makes for quite a sea change. We are seeing the transfer of influence and prominence away from what has long been considered the power corridor of Boston, Washington and New York and toward the Sunbelt. Texas is the buckle in that belt. If you want to catch a glimpse of the future, you don't go to Alexandria or Syracuse or Worcester. You go to Austin, Houston or San Antonio. A generation or two ago, Americans left the Northeast and headed west to California in search of the Pacific, milder climate, bountiful farmland and a spirit of tolerance. Now, they're still leaving the Northeast -- but also leaving California -- to head to Texas in pursuit of lower taxes, less government regulation, lower home prices and a spirit of independence. I have plenty of friends and family in Texas, and they have good reason to celebrate this holiday season. After all, this is a place that is used to coming in second. Texas is the second-largest state in area, behind Alaska. And it's the second-most populous state next to California. But in terms of population growth, it's second to none. Texas is a beautiful and extremely livable state, with scenic vistas and hospitable people. But somewhere in its bloodstream, there is an inferiority complex. It's just as well that my friends in Dallas can fly to Los Angeles or New York in just a few hours, because the city is always aspiring to be thought of as being sophisticated as Los Angeles and New York. While some pundits are saying that this population shift to the Southwest is good news for Republicans, I'm not so sure that's true. Texas is still a red state, but there is some evidence that it's trending purple. Election results confirm that Dallas County and Harris County, which includes Houston, are home to more Democrats than they used to be. There is still a lot of red in the panhandle and western Texas, to be sure. But demographics don't lie. You can't talk honestly about population growth in Texas without acknowledging two things. First, much of it is coming from transplants from blue states such as California. They are packing up preformed liberal tendencies and taking them into the land of the blue bonnets. According to The Dallas Morning News, an average of 80,000 Californians moved to Texas each year from 2006 to 2008. Second, much of the rest of Texas' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the Hispanic population. That's another subset that tends to lean left politically. According to Bill Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, Hispanics made up more than half the new arrivals to Texas. The same goes for Arizona, Florida and Nevada. That's not surprising. The larger story likely to come out of the 2010 census is that the Hispanic population is exploding. The data showing the racial/ethnic breakdown of the U.S. population won't be released until February. But already there is reasonable speculation that the Hispanic population could be somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 million, or about 19 percent of the total U.S. population, which is now 308.7 million. And in Texas, Hispanics will likely account for nearly 40 percent of the state's population.

"(CNN) -- A few months after four East Haven police officers were arrested for allegedly targeting and harassing Latinos, Connecticut's state legislature passed a bill Monday to beef up safeguards against racial profiling. Titled ""An Act Concerning Traffic Stop Information,"" SB 364 mandates that local and state law enforcement agencies adopt their own ""written policy that prohibits the stopping, detention or search of any person when such action is solely motivated by considerations of race, color, ethnicity, age, gender or sexual orientation, and the action would constitute a violation of the civil rights of the person."" In addition, the legislation sets up reporting requirements for police whenever they conduct traffic stop, as well as a system for citizen complaints or for state authorities to collect and assess pertinent data from municipal departments. Initially passed by the state Senate on April 19, the legislation made it through the House of Representatives on Monday and is now expected to be signed by Gov. Dannel Malloy. ""I will continue to insist that every effort is taken to protect individual rights in every community and that racial profiling is eliminated,"" Malloy said Monday in a statement. ""This is a real problem that deserves a real solution, and my administration is committed to carrying out the spirit and letter of this law."" If and when the bill goes into affect, those pulled over after January 1, 2013, would get a copy of the ""standardized form"" filled out by police containing details about the driver and circumstances of their case. Those who feel they were profiled due to their race, color, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation can file a complaint, which must be reviewed by the local police department and be passed on to a state agency. The bill doesn't mention any locality or case specifically. But it follows the arrests, in January, of an East Haven police sergeant and three officers following a federal investigation into racial profiling. They all pleaded not guilty. A civil lawsuit has also been filed related to that case. According to a federal indictment, the four allegedly conspired to ""injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate various members of the East Haven community"" by profiling Latino residents during traffic stops, performing illegal searches and harassing Latino business owners and their advocates. The men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees, made false arrests -- including a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation, prosecutors said. The men also thwarted a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct, authorities said, calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators. ""They behaved like bullies with badges,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, assistant FBI director in New York. Many Latino residents of East Haven -- who make up about 10.3% of the town's roughly 29,000 people -- say that, for years, they have had to contend with an overly aggressive police force. ""They always come by and bother us,"" said Esdras Marin, a manager at La Bamba, a Latino-owned bar and restaurant named in the indictment. ""Police come in two or three times a month and ask everyone in the restaurant for their identification,"" he said. ""And if you don't have it, they threaten us and say they're going to call the immigration office."" The Rev. James Manship of St. Rose of Lima Church, a plaintiff in the civil suit , has accused since retired police Chief Leonard Gallo of fostering ""a racist and dishonest police force"" in East Haven.","Connecticut's House of Representatives passes an anti-racial profiling law .

"Rome (CNN) -- A cardinal from the Philippines, another from Austria and an archbishop from Ireland would be the ""least worst"" choices to be the next pope, according to a group representing the victims of abuse by priests. The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff. The three are Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines; Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria; and Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin, Ireland. Martin is not a cardinal, but SNAP noted that a man need not be a cardinal to be elected pope. Historically, the role has gone to cardinals, however. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, also a correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, wrote last month that Schoenborn ""certainly has the right pedigree for the job."" And Tagle has ""been a leader in pushing the church in Asia to take an aggressive stance on clerical abuse,"" Allen said in a series he wrote on the papal contenders. Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said. Wednesday, SNAP named its ""Dirty Dozen"" list of men it judged would be the worst candidates for pope because of their handling of, or comments on, past allegations of child sex abuse against clergy. The scandal has shaken global confidence in the church in recent years. A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday indicates that U.S. Catholics see it as the biggest issue the Vatican faces. Asked what they think is the most important problem, 34% of the U.S. Catholics questioned mention sex abuse, pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal. No other problem garnered more than 10% of the responses. A report for Italian news magazine Panorama on Thursday claims that the church hierarchy was alerted to the problem decades ago, in 1965 but buried the warnings. 'Absolutely key' Since Monday, the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious questions facing the church. The last of the cardinals summoned to choose the next pope, Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man of Vietnam, arrived at the Vatican on Thursday. No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. But Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, suggested that the announcement might not be far away in a tweet posted Thursday. ""Days of General Congregations reaching a conclusion. Setting of date for Conclave nearing. Mood of excitement prevails among Cardinals,"" he said. The 115 cardinal-electors -- those under the age of 80 who are eligible to vote for the new pontiff -- are taking time to prepare for what many see as their greatest responsibility. Although some may be wondering why it's taking so long to set the date for the conclave, Lombardi pushed back against the idea that the cardinals were dragging their feet. The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, since once the conclave starts there won't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas. The cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature, responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex issues, he said. ""The preparation is absolutely key,"" Lombardi said. Celibacy for priests a hot issue, not just for church leaders . U.S. cardinals muzzled? Italian media reports Thursday focused on the Vatican's move to end the news briefings held this week by American cardinals, amid concerns over leaks of confidential discussions among the cardinals. Sister Mary Ann Walsh, director of media relations for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote in a blog post that the decision Wednesday came after a media report in Italian daily La Stampa, which gave details of who had said what. ""I compared the shutdown to the old Catholic school style of one kid talks and everyone stays after school,"" she wrote, saying a similar thing happened before the last conclave in 2005. ""We'll continue briefings, but without cardinals, to help U.S. media especially cover this exciting moment in the church,"" Walsh added. It's been a week since Benedict XVI became the first pontiff in six centuries to resign from the role. Popes usually serve until their death. With Easter around the corner, many inside the Catholic Church would like to see a new pontiff in place to lead ceremonies. Watch for the smoke: How is a new pope elected? 'Mix and mingle' All the cardinals, including those older than 80, are entitled to take part in the closed-door general congregations. Lombardi said 152 cardinals met Thursday morning. A second meeting will take place in the afternoon, as the cardinals seek to pick up the pace before agreeing on the date for the conclave. Thursday morning's business included reports on the financial state of the Holy See, Lombardi said. He named the cardinals who delivered the reports but did not reveal their contents. The cardinals could continue their meetings on Saturday, Lombardi added, but are unlikely to meet Sunday when Mass may be held. Interactive: A look at possible papal contenders . Some of the discussions happen over coffee, as one Vatican spokesman revealed Monday, the first day of the general congregations. ""There's a coffee break for about 30 minutes at a special buffet area in the front part of the audience hall,"" said the Rev. Thomas Rosica. ""Cardinals have an opportunity to go down and mix and mingle."" ""They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who haven't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it,"" Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said. The electors also want to go into the conclave with pretty clear ideas about whom to vote for, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston said. They, too, have no interest in seeing it drag on, and there is no reason to believe that it will. The past 11 conclaves have lasted no longer than four days, the diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, wrote on its website. That wasn't always the case. In the 13th century, the election of one pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said. Catholics grew so angry at the cardinals' indecision from 1268 to 1271, when Gregory X was elected, that they boarded them up in their chamber and tore off the roof to expose them to the elements. The fiasco led to the creation of the conclave and its precise protocol -- partly to expedite the process. What's in a name? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Johannesburg doesn't have the stunning beauty of Cape Town or the seaside like Durban, but the energy in South Africa's largest city makes it an exciting place to be, says CNN South Africa correspondent and Johannesburg native Robyn Curnow. And in June, excitement will peak as ""Jozi"" welcomes soccer fans from all over the globe for 2010 FIFA World Cup matches. Curnow grew up, went to school and started her broadcasting career in Johannesburg. After working in Australia and London over the past 15 years, Curnow is happy to be home. ""CNN posted me back here three years ago, so it's wonderful to be a foreign correspondent reporting from my own backyard,"" she said. CNN.com asked Curnow for tips on her favorite Johannesburg spots. Where can you get the best view of the city? The bar at the Westcliff Hotel has a wonderful view over the treetops of the Northern suburbs, the Johannesburg skyline and, on a clear evening, the blue rim of the Magaliesberg Mountains. Which restaurant would you take a loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Wombles, in Parktown North, for delicious meat (Springbok carpaccio, anyone?), fruity South African wines and attentive service in a charming old house with a huge ""stoep,"" or verandah. Where is the best place for people watching? Shop or have a coffee in one of the piazzas in Melrose Arch, an open-air mall off Corlett Drive, if you want to ogle wealthy, sophisticated South Africans and their expensive cars. What is your favorite neighborhood? Parkhurst -- 4th Avenue overflows with pavement cafes, charming antique shops, a pub, coffee shops, two excellent bookshops and even a cupcake shop. How do tourists stick out and what's the best way to blend in? Besides the obvious mistakes -- wearing a money belt and having a camera around your neck -- don't wear shorts, T-shirt and flipflops in June during the World Cup. Remember it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere. What's the biggest misconception about your city? That it is a dangerous, scary place. I grew up in 'Jozi' -- it's bustling, green, friendly and, yes, has a slightly manic energy, which is understandable considering Johannesburg is the economic hub of Sub-Saharan Africa. Where do you go to relax? I go two hours north -- to the bushveld. The Waterberg, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, is malaria-free, has affordable safari lodges and plenty of wild African game. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? The Apartheid Museum is spectacular. A sobering but uplifting experience. Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? Gold Reef City is like Euro Disney -- expensive and cheesy. However, it gives you a good sense of what Johannesburg was like as a gold mining town over 100 years ago, and you get a chance to go down a mine, which is fun. Where was your most memorable meal? The ""egg basket"" breakfasts at Nice restaurant on 4th Avenue in Parkhurst are legendary. I go there at least once a week. The 'egg basket' is a perfect combination of poached eggs, crispy bacon, grilled Roma tomatoes and a bit of chili in a piece of folded toast . Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? With two small children, I can't remember when I last went out at night! I hear 7th Street in Melville still rocks. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? For the nondrinkers, Appletiser is a refreshing South African fizzy drink. For those who want a tipple, South African wines are excellent and well-priced, so experiment with all the different grapes and blends. As for food, there is always ""boerewors"" for those who want a real taste of South Africa. This is a spicy sausage best cooked on the ""braai"" (barbeque) What is a good local souvenir? A wire sculpture crafted by Zimbabwean immigrants, who sell their wares on the sidewalks.","CNN correspondent Robyn Curnow shares tips about her hometown of Johannesburg .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Babies lie side by side in warming beds or sprawled on blankets atop crude wooden tables. Many families at Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, seem resigned to the situation. Children with wounds and broken bones are carried in by their parents to wait on stiff plastic chairs. Outside, coughing youngsters squat on the pavement with their anxious families, waiting for care. And everywhere, parents clutch plastic bags containing bring-your-own medicines and supplies. For though they are all awaiting treatment at Afghanistan's only specialist pediatric hospital, the hospital cannot even afford bandages for its patients. The Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in central Kabul has to run on an operating budget of less than $1,200 a month, said Dr. Noorulhaq Yousufzai, the hospital director. The few supplies that he can buy have to be hoarded for emergencies, and he has to count on parents to buy what's needed to care for their children. ""In some cases, there is shortage of the surgical materials, and sometimes we don't have antiseptic to use,"" Yousufzai said. The United Nations says that more than $15 billion in aid has been sent to Afghanistan since the U.S.-led coalition overthrew the Taliban in late 2001. But still, the hospital cannot afford to help the hundreds of children who stream in every day, desperate for care and cures. The government does pay for salaries and sometimes for fuel, but there is often a shortage of even basic supplies like syringes. Doctors say they have to double up premature babies in incubators. And some of those incubators are compromised. On a recent day, a plastic surgical mask taped onto one machine was the only shield from infection.  Watch scenes from inside the hospital » . The parents waiting anxiously beside their sick children seem resigned to the situation in the hospital. One mother, who declined to give her name, said she spent the family's entire weekly income of $8 on an injection that did not help her baby. ""This is something that the hospital should be giving us, because we can't afford it,"" she said. The U.S. Agency for International Development says infant mortality has dropped by 22 percent since the overthrow of the Taliban but acknowledges that the health status for Afghans is among the worst in the world. One in every five Afghan children will die before their 5th birthday, often of a preventable disease, according to the Save the Children aid agency. The toll on the children and parents is clear to any visitor, and the strain hits the hospital staff, too. ""When you see a patient is very, very, sick and you cannot help, and they have to provide something for their children and they are not able to provide, it's also a stress for us,"" Yousufzai said. At the end of 2001, there were hopes that the hospital would be upgraded, but it is still waiting. It needs some acute care of its own, or it will continue to struggle to help the children who arrive at its door pleading for care.","Kabul hospital's operating budget is less than $1,200 a month .

"(CNN) -- There can't be many people whose image has sat side by side on a front page with Colonel Gaddafi, the now expired former dictator of Libya. But Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer's governing body FIFA, is one of the few to hold this dubious honor. It was June 2011, and The Sun -- a British tabloid newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch and known for its cheeky, salacious front pages -- ran one of its most memorable headlines. ""Despot the Difference,"" it screamed above a picture of Blatter and Gaddafi. ""Two deluded dictators continued to cling on to power yesterday as their corrupt regimes crumbled around them."" The ire directed at Gaddafi was obvious. But Blatter? Soccer's administrator in chief had become one of the most hated men in Britain. Blog: Time for football to tackle racism epidemic? A series of corruption scandals within FIFA, his botched re-election campaign -- where his only opponent was barred from standing after another corruption scandal -- and the failure of England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup to attract any interest in FIFA's corridors of power (despite having the best technical report) led to an outpouring of incredulity. Blatter was deemed arrogant and elusive. He became public enemy number two, after Gaddafi. Just over 18 months on and Blatter has fared slightly better than Gaddafi. But only just. This weekend he was vilified again for refusing to back the principle of AC Milan walking off the pitch when one of the Italian club's black players was racially abused by fans. It was seized as another example of Blatter's buffoonery and came after comments he made in a 2011 interview with CNN when he seemed to suggest there was no problem with racism in soccer, at least on the pitch. But is this foolishness, myopia or inelegance? I would say the latter of the three. His comments on the AC Milan incident were broadly correct. Whilst Kevin Prince Boateng should be applauded for his ""Rosa Parks"" moment, enshrining it in law would be highly problematic. As James Lawton in the British newspaper The Independent wrote this week in a piece criticizing UEFA for its weakness on tackling racism: ""Boateng has issued a significant threat, not just of uncomplicated outrage by black players, but situations which would create incentives for all kinds of connivance in the abandonment of vital matches in which one side had taken what looked like an impregnable advantage."" That soccer's governing bodies contributed to the situation by handing out paltry fines for previous transgressions is true too. Sure, FIFA is not without its problems, but the sound bites tend to obscure a much wider, more important truth: Blatter's largely positive influence on the game, especially in the developing world. Whilst he is parodied as an out of touch buffoon haphazardly directing affairs from FIFA's ""Death Star"" in Zurich, he has arguably done more in the modern era to spread the game globally than anyone else. This year I interviewed Blatter twice. On both occasions he talked about soccer being more than just a game. That it was also an agent of social change. His first act when elected president in 1998 was to fly into the Gaza Strip and welcome Palestine to the soccer family. It allowed the Palestinians to organize their own league, push for movement restrictions in the West Bank to be lifted, to build their own national football stadium, start a women's professional league and, in 2011, host their very first World Cup qualifier against Afghanistan. Sure, the Afghan government were not happy, but the team traveled and played in the West Bank, the first time a team from Afghanistan had done so. It was defacto recognition of both sides of this seemingly intractable conflict. FIFA became one of a tiny handful of international organizations to recognize the existence of Palestine, a full four years before a U.N. vote almost, but not quite, got to the same point. The Palestinians have cleverly used soccer as a way of both flying their flag and as a dry run for building and maintaining important civic institutions. Blatter should take credit for kickstarting that movement. The wider point here is that Blatter's tenure as FIFA president has been internationalist in tooth and claw. Under his watch the World Cup was hosted in Asia for the first time in 2002. It is a region that, in 50 years' time, will undoubtedly be the new power center of the world game. Blatter championed Africa's first ever World Cup, in South Africa in 2010, a remarkable vote of confidence in a country barely two decades out of apartheid. And, most controversially, Russia and then the Middle East will host their first World Cups in 2018 and 2022 respectively. No one should have been surprised by either move. Both regions are booming and have a deep love of the game. FIFA under Blatter has been aggressively expansionist and hosting a World Cup in England or even the U.S. would have added little new. Soccer is, now more than ever, a global game and deserves to be shared across the world. Europe may now be the most successful region both in terms of money and success on the pitch but the balance of power is shifting, to South America, Asia, the Middle East and the new Europe. Blatter recognized that shift and helped to drive it. Given that context it would be absurd to now think that the 76-year-old was someone unconcerned with the issues of racism. Now there are a new set of pressing challenges. The rise in racism needs to be tackled with financial penalties so stiff that clubs would have no choice but to take the issue seriously. Greater transparency within FIFA's decision making and finances need to be addressed. The corruption watchdog Transparency International cut its ties with FIFA in 2011 when two of its recommendations -- that the investigator charged with overseeing FIFA would be compromised if he was paid by FIFA and that he should be allowed to investigate old corruption scandals -- were dropped. The stain of corruption emanating from countries with poor records in transparency and openness is another issue. Why not publish the salaries and expenses of FIFA's leading members to combat that? But, when his tenure is up, the same question will be asked. Will Blatter leave the game in a better place than he found it? The game has been spread further and deeper than ever before. There is much that still needs reforming in FIFA. But in Africa, Asia and the Middle East he'll be rightly feted for seriously taking the game to the world, no matter what the headline writers think.","Sepp Blatter has been criticized for saying players cannot ""run away"" from racism .

UWIRE aims to identify and promote the brightest young content creators and deliver their work to a larger audience via professional media partners such as CNN.com. Visit UWIRE.com to learn more. (UWIRE) -- A Web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications. PostYourTest.com creator Demir Oral says the site is a tool for education, not for cheating. PostYourTest.com is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes, said Demir Oral, creator of the site. However, there are teachers who do not want their tests to be posted for every student to see. ""I would not be happy if a student who had taken a class of mine had taken an exam and posted it online,"" Sarah Hall, graduate professor of psychology at Penn State University, said. ""I know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class."" However, Mary Bojan, professor of chemistry at PSU, said she wouldn't mind if students posted her tests online. ""For my classes I always write new exams every time, and I wouldn't object because I have some old exams up online that I've posted myself,"" Bojan said. Currently, there are no tests online for Penn State University, because the site was developed on the West Coast, Oral said. ""Primarily the main audience is San Diego, but that's because I've only advertised around there,"" Oral said. He said he is looking into expanding the site more to include universities and colleges across the country. ""Also, although I am still focused on the United States, in the future I would like to go global,"" Oral said. ""I think it would be really effective worldwide."" While studying for an exam in the HUB-Robeson Center, Christal Cozier (senior-nutrition) said she would consider using the site. ""I think looking at an old exam helps -- it at least gives the student an idea of how the teacher poses questions,"" Cozier said. While she said she wouldn't go through the trouble of posting a test herself, Cozier said she didn't think students posting old tests online would be a problem. ""Most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway,"" she said. ""The only time I would think it would be a problem is if the teacher uses exams more than once."" In response to criticism of the site from professors, Oral said he wants people to know the site is a tool for education and not a tool for cheating. He added teachers can ban their exams from the site if they don't want students sharing them online. ""The first professor that banned his exams said he wanted to ban them because he was copyrighting them and publishing them in a book, and that made total sense to me,"" Oral said. Even with the option to ban tests, Tara Chismar said professors may not know the site exists and may not know to ban their exams from it. She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online. Bojan said the biggest problem she saw with students posting material online would be putting up tests the teachers wanted handed back in. ""Common sense needs to come into play with something like this because there's a student responsibility side to it,"" she said. ""Having access to an exam you're not supposed to is cheating."" Students shouldn't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher, Hall said. ""There are likely a lot of professors who would be happy to give students more of a sense of what the exam is going to be like -- maybe giving them sample questions,"" she said. Bojan warned students should use materials posted online wisely because looking at an exam may not always be the best way to study. ""One problem is old tests may not be the most effective study tool,"" she said. ""By just going off of old exams students aren't learning how to actually do the problems.""","PostYourTest.com was developed this year, has mostly California tests .

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara equaled a landmark cricket record but his side are in deep trouble after the opening action in the traditional Boxing Day Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

"(CNN) -- A day after launching airstrikes and mortar shells in a remote part of the island of Borneo, Malaysian security forces searched house-to-house Wednesday for gunmen from the Philippines who infiltrated the area last month and clashed with police. The group of Filipino men is believed to number between 100 and 300. It arrived three weeks ago on the east coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah, on Borneo, demanding recognition as representatives of an old sultanate that ruled the area. Efforts by Malaysian and Philippine authorities to persuade the men to return peacefully to their homes in the nearby southern Philippines failed, and the standoff descended into clashes last week that reportedly left 28 people dead, including nine police officers. Malaysian security forces said their offensive Tuesday, which involved fighter jets, mortars and ground troops, achieved its objectives. However, they did not disclose the number of Filipino fighters captured or killed in the operation, and the Filipino group said the Malaysian attack failed to inflict any casualties. On Wednesday, Malaysian police and armed forces combed the area around Kampung Tanduo, the village where the Filipinos had originally been holed up, in an attempt to flush out the gunmen, according to Bernama, Malaysia's national news agency. Alarm in Malaysia . The crisis in Sabah alarmed Malaysians over the ease with which the intruders entered the country from the nearby southern Philippines, where a number of Muslim rebel groups are based. It has also revived an unresolved territorial issue between the Philippines and Malaysia. The Malaysian forces' task of tracking down the gunmen has been complicated by the Filipinos' efforts to blend in with the local population, Ismail Omar, the head of Malaysian Police, said at a news conference Wednesday, according to Bernama. Ismail said one gunman was believed fatally shot early Wednesday after ambushing Malaysian security forces, but that the other attackers had retrieved his body. There are strong ethnic ties between many inhabitants of Sabah and the southern Philippines. People and goods regularly go back and forth across the porous sea border between the two. The Filipino men have called themselves the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, a former Islamic power in the region that once controlled parts of the Philippines and Borneo. Its influence has since faded, and it is now a clan in the restive southern Philippines. The sultanate's leadership has been driven by internal power struggles in recent decades, but the squabbling family members appear to have united in the recent decision to send their followers to Sabah and stake a claim to their former territory. 'No casualties' Abraham Idjirani, a spokesman for one of the sultanate's leaders in Manila, said he had spoken twice Wednesday with the leader of the armed group in Sabah, who reported that the men were in ""good condition"" and prepared for another possible attack. He claimed the group had suffered no casualties from the assault Tuesday because the Malaysian planes had bombed an area vacated by Filipinos. The sultanate is still open to talks, but the group in Sabah will not return to the Philippines, Idjirani said. The situation on the ground appears to be getting more complex with reports that other Filipino fighters, sympathetic to the sultanate's cause, are joining the group in Sabah, despite efforts by Malaysia and the Philippines to tighten sea patrols in the area. Idjirani said Tuesday that other people from the region were joining the sultanate's followers, although he didn't know who they were. And Nur Misuari, a founding leader of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a Muslim rebel group that signed a peace deal with the Philippine government in 1996 after decades of armed rebellion, said he believed former fighters from the organization were with the sultanate's followers in Sabah. He said if any current MNLF members had gone there, they had done so without authorization. A faded power . Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in Southeast Asia that at one point ruled Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's influence. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a ""dormant claim"" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. The Philippines claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal. Malaysia still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah.","Malaysian forces try to flush out Filipino fighters on Borneo .

"(CNN) -- From Warhol's silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe to Picasso's nudes, it has generally been easier for women to be the subject of paintings than to have their own work exhibited. In 1989, when New York feminist collective Guerrilla Girls began counting how many works in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art were by women, less than 5% of the artists in its Modern section were female. But the art world looks set to change its stubbly face, and shows increasing signs of recognition for the value and stature of leading female artists. Half of the nominees for Britain's Turner Prize are women this year, as are three of the four photographers shortlisted for Canada's $50,000 Grange Prize, and at this month's Frieze Art Fair, two of the five artists commissioned to make site-specific works were women. The chief curators of MoMA, the Whitney, the Met, the Guggenheim and the Centre Pompidou are all female, as are the directors of Tate Britain and the Uffizi Gallery. The world's biggest buyer of contemporary art, according to Art Newspaper is the Qatari royal family, whose purchases are directed by Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani. ""It is better than it has ever been for women at the emerging level,"" says one of the founders of Guerrilla Girls, Frida Kahlo. But, she warns, ""when one travels up the art world ladder of success, there is a crushing glass ceiling. Women only get so far, especially at the level of economics."" Historically, art made by women has struggled to fetch high prices at auction. So much so, that earlier this year, renowned art dealer Iwan Wirth told The Economist that ""women artists are the bargains of our time."" In Christie's New York's September 2002 auction of Post-War and Contemporary art, female artists comprised 15% of the lots auctioned, and only 10% of the total sales. Almost decade later at the same auction, in September 2011, works by women accounted for 22% of the lots auctioned, and 36% of the $8.4 million taken. Instead of being clumped around the bottom of the results table, four of the top 10 most expensive works were by women, including Japanese installation artist Yayoi Kusama, sculptors Louise Bourgeois and Lynda Benglis, and expressionist painter Helen Frankenthaler. By medium . Frankenthaler's inclusion is especially heartening because, with its centuries of tradition as the purview of men, gender bias seems more entrenched in painting than in other media. When New York critic Jerry Saltz took up Guerrilla Girls' cause in 2007, criticizing MoMA's male-heavy collection as tantamount to ""apartheid,"" he did note that it was exhibiting ""excellent groupings of work by women"" from its photography and drawing collections, and that ""the film-and-video and prints departments have long been virtually gender-blind."" That notion appears to be borne out by the entry of female art stars into the very uppermost echelons of printmaking, sculpture and photography. Until last November, Cindy Sherman held the record for creating the world's most expensive photograph. In the last decade, women have painted precisely none of Christie's London's 100 most expensive paintings but they created three of its most expensive prints; five of its most expensive photos (four were by Sherman), and six of the 100 most expensive sculptures. The highest price paid for a female artwork was for Louise Bourgeois' 1996 bronze sculpture ""Spider,"" which sold for $10.7m last year. Digital revolution . Simon Todd, British representative for Artnet, which provides pricing services for collectors, says when it comes to gauging the importance of women in the contemporary art market, auction turnover might not even tell the full story. ""The majority of the best of British contemporary art does not have the opportunity to appear at auction -- it is sold through galleries,"" he says, noting that sculptor and Turner Prize winner Rachel Whiteread has 191 auction lots logged with Artnet, ""but the vast majority are multiple editions."" One potentially democratizing force in the art market could come from online sales. Collectors can now shop for art online at e-commerce sites such as Exhibition A which sells limited-edition prints for under $1,000, Paddle8, which carries selections curated by guests such as performance artist Marina Abramovic, and Art.sy, a search engine that connects buyers with galleries. Three of Exhibition A's top 10 sellers are women -- former Sonic Youth guitarist Kim Gordon, Julia Chiang, and Aurel Schmidt who sold out one edition in an hour. Co-founder Cynthia Rowley believes online sales ""bring the decision making to the public based on imagery, and away from the hands of the male-dominated traditional art world."" Paddle8 cofounder Aditya Julka says female artists make up around a quarter of Paddle 8's sales activity, and has noticed particularly strong interest in established artists such as Cindy Sherman, Cecily Brown and Michalene Thomas. While Art.sy is still in beta mode, it says nearly half of its sales so far have been of works by female artists. Getting collected, displayed, reviewed . Of course, there are other indicators of success in the art world besides sales figures. Solo shows, when a gallery throws a great deal of its resources and floor space behind a single name, are one way to gauge the esteem in which an artist is held. Of five New York museums tracked by the Guerrilla Girls between 2005 and 2011, 28% of MoMA's solo shows and 16% of the Met's were by women. The New Museum in New York, founded in 1977 by former Whitney curator Marcia Tucker, had the most diverse roster, with 46% of its solo shows devoted to female artists. This year, it has surveyed knitting, painting German artist Rosemarie Trockel (""enfant terrible"" of ""a German art scene dominated by male stars"", according to The New York Times) and has also put on feminist artist Judith Bernstein's first solo show. And, besides touting emerging and established female artists, it also manages to include a healthy number of women in its retrospectives: Eight of the 23 artists (35%) in a current exhibition about the 1970s and '80s Bowery scene are female. ""Women have much better chances today, not only on the price circuit in the art market, but also to be collected, to be reviewed,"" says Heike Munder, director of Migros Museum in Zurich, and a judge of this year's Turner Prize. Some museums have initiatives dedicated to increasing the number of women artists in their collections, including the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Tate Modern in London, and Paris' Centre Pompidou. But Munder says the female directors she knows tend to be innately aware of striking a balance anyway. ""When I do my year's program, I never check if it's half women, half men,"" she says, ""but if I check it through the years, it's even, intuitively. I had one year when everyone was telling me 'What a great program, all these fantastic women.' I didn't do it on purpose. For me, it's organic."" If lingering economic disparity remains at auction, Munder says it is not something preoccupying today's female artists, many of whom consider themselves post-feminist. ""They know the importance of it but they don't like to stress it anymore, because if you stress it, it opens up that something's missing,"" she says. ""They just want to play the game on the same level, and you can only play the game on the same level if you don't unmask that something's missing."" ""Marlene Dietrich, Martina Navratilova and Madonna acted this way and have been interesting role models in this.""","At Christie's last contemporary art auction, four of the 10 most expensive works were by women .
Nearly a quarter of all lots were by female artists, who accounted for 36% of total sales .

"(CNN) -- He's ""the fastest man on no legs,"" or -- as his sponsor's high-profile advertising campaign put it -- ""the bullet in the chamber."" He is Oscar Pistorius, the ""Blade Runner"" who is changing the world's perception of what is acceptable on an athletics track. Born without a fibula bone in each leg, the South African is the first double amputee to run at the world championships, and next year he will be the first to race at the Olympics. ""I think next year's going to be quite a big year, as far as demand on my performances,"" the 24-year-old told CNN. ""I feel that the condition I'm in and the knowledge I've gained probably will definitely help me in achieving those times in the first half of next season. So I know next year is going to be a big year."" Pistorius qualified for the 400 meters with a time of 45.07 seconds in Italy in July, which is less than two seconds slower than Michael Johnson's 1999 world record and would have given him fifth place in the final of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Pistorius buoyant after Daegu breakthrough . He did not compete at the main event in China. Despite eventually reversing the decision by athletics' ruling body to ban the carbon-fiber prosthetic blades he uses, the Johannesburg native was unable to meet the qualifying mark. He did, however, run at the Beijing Paralympics that year, becoming the first athlete to win gold in the 100m, 200m and 400m. The International Association of Athletics Federations had at first decreed, after a series of tests, that the blades gave Pistorius an unfair advantage. He overturned that at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and maintains that he will be competing on a level playing field in London next year. ""If the legs did provide such an advantage that some of the people are claiming they did, then there would be a lot more amputees using the exact same prosthetic legs I have, running the exact same times I have -- and that's not the case,"" Pistorius said. Why Oscar Pistorius deserves to run . He reached the 400m semifinals at the world championships in South Korea in August, and then helped South Africa's 4x400m relay team reach the final after setting a national record. However, he is still disappointed at being dropped from the line-up that secured a silver medal -- he made way for hurdler LJ van Zyl after running the slowest split time as the lead-off runner. The IAAF ruled Pistorius had to start out of the blocks, the slowest leg of the relay, ""to avoid danger to other athletes."" Runners can come out of their lanes in the other three legs. ""It was very disappointing to me, because I know I worked very hard. I ran the second-fastest time I've ever ran in the semifinal on my leg. It's one of those things, unfortunately,"" he said. ""To walk away with a silver medal, although I didn't run in the final ... (it) was bittersweet to watch because I really felt I deserved to be on the team. ""But at the same time the other four guys are very close friends of mine. When they came down that home straight I was losing my voice I was shouting so hard for them. It's great to be a part of that."" The runner's coach Ampie Louw believes Pistorius -- who already has lucrative endorsement deals with Nike, Thierry Mugler perfume and Oakley sunglasses -- can be a success on the biggest stage. ""He's a champion, and champions are born. I know it, I've almost been going for 40 years in training and I can see it,"" Louw told CNN. ""He's got all the abilities of a champion and we did it gradually. It took us three months to get him out of the starting blocks, because he's got no feet and no balance to stand still. So we must do a four-point start. Pistorius makes 400m Olympic qualifying time . While Pistorius is determined to prove himself against able-bodied athletes, he will also defend his Paralympic titles. ""For me there is always a space for Paralympic sport. I am a very, very proud Paralympian and when I've had the platform or the opportunity to educate people about disability I've done so without hesitation and I'm very excited for the Paralympics next year,"" he said. ""I look at Beijing as one of the highlights of my career. I can't wait to run in next year's Games and I still feel there's a lot of recognition Paralympic athletes deserve that they're not getting, and I'm really fighting that."" Despite his difficult start to life, Pistorius was keen on sport from an early age and competed in waterpolo, cricket, tennis, triathlons and Olympic wrestling and boxing before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16. He took up track running as part of his rehabilitation, linking up with Louw. In his first year he was already running the 100m quicker than the existing Paralympic world record, and in 2004 he came to prominence by winning gold at the Athens Paralympics in a new best time. By 2005 he had competed against able-bodied athletes for the first time, at the South African Championships, and did so internationally in 2007 before the IAAF intervened. In February 2009, Pistorius suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident that slowed down his track progress. ""That was fairly difficult for me. It was kind of strange because I was in very good form -- and I was in hospital for a couple of weeks and then when I got home I couldn't train,"" he said. ""Through my recovery, it took me probably six to eight weeks where I wasn't able to train at all. It was just very difficult getting into the swing of things, it was the first season in four or five years that I hadn't run a personal best, but it was a bit of a learning curve I guess."" But after a life of overcoming adversity, the setback was just another step in his growth -- adding to an attitude best summed up on his website: . ""You're not disabled by the disabilities you have, you are able by the abilities you have.""","Oscar Pistorius will be the first double amputee to compete at Olympic Games .

"(CNN) -- Hertz has been forced to cut costs by 25% over the last four years as the global financial crisis continues hit one of the world's largest car rental companies. And Hertz boss Michel Taride believes the pain is likely to continue. Taride told CNN: ""I personally think the situation in Europe is going to last for a few years. The question for companies like ours is how we can grow profitably in a challenging environment."" The car rental industry, with its close ties to airline traffic and hotel bookings, is particularly sensitive to cross-border financial turmoil. U.S.-based Hertz -- which operates from 8,500 locations across 150 countries -- isn't just cutting expenditure to deal with the global slowdown. It is also moving away from ""bricks and mortar"" costs by investing in virtual rental kiosks, among other changes. Hertz has also launched the world's first global car club. Operating across Europe, the U.S., and Australia, it gives members access to vehicles parked in designated lots around town. 'It is growing extremely fast, even though it doesn't account for a huge part of revenue yet,' Taride said. Luxury cars are also buffering Hertz from the economic gloom. In the Middle East, China and Russia, hiring Aston Martins and Ferraris remains popular, Taride told CNN. At the other end of the glitz scale is Hertz's niche business of renting equipment to large construction firms. ""We're generalists. Renting is a competency of ours and once you know how to rent, buy, run, sell or manage assets effectively and do this with great service and great people then you can rent nearly anything,"" Taride said. CNN's Arvid Ahlund contributed to this report.","Car renting company Hertz has cut costs by 25% in four years, in part by introducing cost-efficient rental kiosks .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal admitted his knee injury continues to ""bother"" him after the Spaniard suffered double defeat in the final of the singles and doubles tournaments at the VTR Open in Vina del Mar, Chile. The clay court event was the former world No. 1's first tournament in seven months due to an injury to his left knee, which caused him to miss both the U.S. Open as well as the Australian Open. ""The knee is still bothering me, but you have to face adversity with the best possible face and look forward to keep working and enjoy what I like the most, to play tennis,"" said the 11-time grand slam champion told the ATP World Tour's website. Despite his discomfort and a 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 loss to Argentina's Horacio Zeballos, Nadal stressed the positives he had taken away from the event having played nine matches in six days. ""A week ago we didn't know how the body would respond,"" the 26-year-old Mallorcan. ""[Now] at least I know we can compete at a certain level. ""I think that was a positive week... I will try to keep improving my physical sensations day-by-day, which is the most important thing because I don't feel that my tennis level is bad. I need more time on court. World No. 43 Zeballos picked up his first career Tour title and became just the third player to beat Nadal in a clay court final, following in the foot steps of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. It was only Nadal's fifth defeat in 41 clay court finals. ""The tennis is important, but for me the best thing was to have the feelings I've had this week, with a full stadium and one of the best crowds I've ever had in my life,"" added Nadal. ""It's a place I won't forget because of the love people gave me. ""I was two points away from winning the title, but I said from first day that the result was not the most important thing, although I would've liked to win. ""My opponent won, he deserved it and I congratulate him. Still, to win four matches in a row is good news for me.""

"(CNN) -- Joyce Banda made headlines in April when she was sworn in as president of Malawi, becoming the first female head state in southern Africa and the third in the whole continent. More recently, she grabbed the spotlight again after deciding to sell her presidential jet and downsize the government's car fleet. Her move came as Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries, tries to cut spending and deal with its pressing economic challenges -- the government recently cut the value of its currency, the kwacha, by 40%, to restore donor funding by meeting conditions suggested by the IMF. ""The fact that we had to devalue by 40% at once means that Malawians are feeling the shock,"" Banda says. ""While that is going on, they need to see, us, the commitment on our part, particularly right at the top. The political will needs to go through this with the people, side by side."" Banda spoke to CNN's Athena Jones about why she believes repairing her country's relationship with the IMF was so imperative for its future and why the African Union Summit will no longer be held in Malawi. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: You've introduced some fundamental changes already in your country. When it comes to what happened before you, relations with the IMF and with donors had deteriorated significantly under the previous administration. What was the cost to the economy and to the people of Malawi? Joyce Banda: The bad news is that it's tragic that the former president refused to devalue the kwacha for four years. Because what that could have meant was maybe they could have devalued the kwacha by 10% a year. It would still have been 40% by now. But the fact that we had to devalue by 40% at once means that Malawians are feeling the shock, the impact of that huge devaluation and particularly rural people, the poor are the ones that are going to be most affected. That is why there is the austerity plan. CNN: Talking about the austerity plan, the presidential plane has been sold, the government's car fleet has been significantly down-sized, what other plans do you have to cut government spending? JB: What I have said to my team is that at a point such as this, with 40% adjustment in our currency, it means that Malawians are paying the price. While that is going on, they need to see, us, the commitment on our part, particularly right at the top. The political will needs to go through this with the people, side by side. And so it's not a luxury I need to have a presidential jet. I need to improve our relationships with our neighbors. It was a thing for me to do and I did it without any reservation. It's fine. We can make that sacrifice now and in the future we shall have a plane. It's not important. CNN: Are you sending a message with that? JB: I'm just sending a message to the poor, to show the people, to ordinary Malawians that we can do this together. CNN: These are some key moves that you've made in just a short period of time, but nearly 40% of your money comes from aid or donors. And that's very important to the development of the country. What about the future though? What about getting to the point where you need less aid? JB: What I am saying every day to Malawians is that time has come for us to move from aid to trade. We have picked several sectors that we think we can focus on immediately in order for us to grow our economy. So we have decided to diversify agriculture, we decided to develop our tourism sector, we have decided to develop our mining sector. So these are some of the things we're telling Malawians, we say this is what we need to do in order for us to get out of this total dependence on aid. And Malawians are ready. CNN: The IMF have just agreed to provide a loan of $157 million, relations have been restored with some of your biggest donors. What are your plans for getting the economy out of this cycle of receiving aid and into more self sufficiency? JB: What we decided to do was, as soon as I was elevated to this position, was to go back on track with the IMF. That was fundamental because it was going to influence all other decisions that were going to be made by all our partners that had withdrawn aid. I have been saying to all our donors that we have gone as far as we can. When there was resistance in Malawi to stay on course with the IMF program, what Malawians were being told is that this resistance is as a result of our belief that if we devalue or if we stay on course, Malawians will suffer. Now I came in and told them the reverse -- I said it's not true. It's when we go the other way, we pass this difficult part that everything should be fine. Now what Malawians need to see is that while we are making these sacrifices the international community is also moving in time to support us. CNN: The African Union summit was scheduled to take place in Malawi, now it's taking place in Ethiopia. And it's reported because you decided you did not want to allow Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir into the country. Do you think it would have been better to allow him to arrive into the country and then arrest him? JB: I want you to know that I don't have any right, Malawi has no right to stop any president from coming to an African Union summit because that is an African Union meeting. But six months ago we had COMESA summit in Malawi and the international community told us that we should not invite president Bashir to come to Malawi. The president of Sudan came to Malawi and attended the meeting. And we went from where we were, which was already bad enough to zero. CNN: In terms of donors you mean? JB: In terms of our donors was concerned. I didn't say that he shouldn't come but I made it very clear that we were not prepared to pay that price again. Now it is the African Union that has decided to withdraw the summit. The only concern that I have is that when he was going to attend the summit in South Africa, South Africa said if he comes he will be arrested and Uganda said the same. And the summits were not withdrawn.","Joyce Banda was sworn in as president of Malawi in April .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso believes all the pressure is on Sebastian Vettel as the title rivals head into their F1 championship decider in Brazil this weekend. Alonso trails the reigning two-time champion by just 13 points going into Sunday's final grand prix of the season at Interlagos but has tried to play down his own chances. ""The first priority is to be on the podium, which gives us a possibility to score more than 13 points and then we need to wait for the result from Red Bull,"" he told Thursday's official press conference. ""It is not in our hands, we have not much to lose -- the only possibility is to win something. If he (Vettel) wins, fine. We try again next year. ""There is always pressure but we have less than other occasions and less than leading the championship. We have nothing to lose,"" added the Ferrari ace. Red Bull's Vettel admitted that the pressure of expectation of an historic third straight title was real. ""It's obviously normal if you are in that position,"" he admitted. ""We are in a strong position, we can be happy with that, but we have to focus on every single step to get the job done here,"" added the 25-year-old German, who would be the youngest driver to achieve a hat-trick of world championships. Alonso said it was unlikely that his Ferrari would challenge the Red Bulls or McLaren in qualifying where he has been consistently off the pace. ""There is no magic that you can put in the car in five days. We were seventh in Abu Dhabi (qualifying), ninth in Austin, so those positions should be normal but hopefully we can do a better job."" Alonso battled through in Austin to finish an eventual third at the U.S. Grand Prix last Sunday to keep his title hopes alive behind winner Lewis Hamilton and second-placed Vettel. The Spaniard was helped by Ferrari's decision to enforce a gear box change on teammate Felipe Massa's car, dropping the Brazilian five places on the grid and moving Alonso up to a more favorable position at the start. Vettel, who could have clinched the title at the Circuit of Americas, said he was untroubled by the controversy surrounding the move. ""What they do is not in our hands. I didn't follow up whether Felipe had real trouble with the gearbox or not, but it is not our job to focus on these things,"" he said. ""It is a different approach compared to our team. That is how life is, everyone handles certain situation in a different way."" Hamilton is racing in his final grand prix for McLaren after a big-money switch to Mercedes and is desperate to sign off with a win. ""It's going to be a tough one, but we will try to push as hard as we can, as we did in the last race, to try to win. I've never won here before,"" he said. The race also brings down the curtain on the F1 career of former seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who is quitting for the second time after his largely fruitless return with Mercedes. ""I'm quite happy to finish here and go for a different life,"" he admitted.","F1 world title to be decided in Brazil GP this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Former world number one Rafael Nadal will end a six-month absence from tennis when he competes in an Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament later this month, the Spaniard has revealed. Nadal has been sidelined by knee problems following June's shock second-round exit at Wimbledon to 100th-ranked Czech Lukas Rosol. ""Can't wait to get back on court in Abu Dhabi at the end of the month,"" he wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages. ""I won the Mubadala World Tennis Championship in 2010 and 2011 -- would love to get my hands on the trophy again this year."" After his Wimbledon exit, the 11-time grand slam champion was diagnosed with Hoffa's syndrome, an inflammation of the fatty tissue in his left knee that has sidelined him on numerous occasions over the years. The injury meant Nadal was unable to defend his Olympic title at London 2012, with the 26-year-old dropping to fourth in the rankings after also missing out on the U.S. Open and Spain's Davis Cup final defeat to the Czech Republic in November. Having started training again late last month, Nadal will make his return in Abu Dhabi on December 28, 17 days before the first grand slam of 2013 -- the Australian Open in Melbourne. Earlier this month, he said it would be difficult to win the Australian Open after such a lengthy period off court, warning fans not to expect ""miracles."" Nadal has a first-round bye in Abu Dhabi, then plays the winner of the match between U.S. Open and Olympic champion Andy Murray and ninth-ranked Serbian Janko Tipsarevic. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will also line up in the six-man, three-day event. He will play either world No. 5 David Ferrer or Czech Davis Cup winner Tomas Berdych on the second day. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation has named Djokovic and third-ranked woman Serena Williams as its 2012 world champions. Djokovic received the honor for the second year running, as the Serbian retained the Australian Open and won the season-ending ATP championship but suffered the disappointment of losing the final at both Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows. ""I am proud to have been named ITF World Champion for the second successive year,"" said the 25-year-old. ""It was very difficult to follow up such a successful season in 2011, but it was extremely satisfying to win another grand slam title, reach two other major finals and finish the year at No. 1."" Meanwhile, Williams was in vintage form in 2012 as the 31-year-old tasted Olympic singles gold for the first time in addition to taking her grand slam collection to 15 titles, following this year's triumphs at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. ""It means a lot to be named ITF World Champion for the third time,"" said Williams, who finished the season with a WTA Tour-best seven titles. ""It has been such an amazing experience this year to win the Olympics and two grand slam tournaments, and I look forward to having an awesome 2013."" It is the second year in a row that the top-ranked woman has missed out on the ITF award -- last year Petra Kvitova headed off Caroline Wozniacki. This time Victoria Azarenka missed out despite leading the earnings list with more than $7 million in prize money and winning her first grand slam in Melbourne. The ITF World Champions will receive their awards at a dinner during the French Open in Paris next June.","Rafael Nadal to end six months of injury-enforced absence in Abu Dhabi later this month .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray fought off the tears to claim victory in the final of the Brisbane International following the news that one of his best friends has been diagnosed with a form of cancer. British tennis player Ross Hutchins, 27, is a former doubles partner of Murray's as well as a Davis Cup teammate. Murray, who overcame Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 6-4, dedicated his victory to Hutchins while holding back the tears, saying: ""I'd like to dedicate this victory to one of my best friends. He's back home watching -- you're going to get through it."" Hutchins has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cell found in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The most common symptom of Hodgkin's lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, normally in the neck, armpit or groin. Hutchins wrote on Twitter: ""Happy New Year to all! Unfortunately I will be away from tennis for a while as I was recently diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma. ""I am doing well, very positive with excellent medical support, friends and family around me. Looking forward to being back on the court soon!"" In a statement on the Lawn Tennis Association website, Hutchins explained further. ""Over the Christmas period I was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma. ""This came as a shock but I am ready to move forward with the necessary treatment. ""I have the best medical support at Royal Marsden and very close family and friends supporting me. ""I look forward to getting over this hurdle and getting back to the ATP Tour and full steam ahead with my tennis career."" Murray overcomes heat factor . Murray's victory, in which he came from 4-1 down in the opening set, enabled him to claim the 25th ATP title of his career. The British number one needed 87 minutes to see off Dimitrov and said he was impress by the standard of tennis on show. ""I thought the standard of tennis was good today,"" Murray said told reporters. ""There were a lot of high-quality rallies and I had to change a few things. He started the match off very well and was extremely aggressive. ""I needed to change things around a little bit and I managed to start dictating a lot of points and use my forehand well. So my ground strokes worked well today."" Serena off to a flyer in 2013 . Elsewhere, world number eight Petra Kvitova suffered a setback to her Australian Open preparations after going down 6-1 6-1 to Dominkia Cibulkova at the Sydney International. Kvitova, who was also knocked out early on at Brisbane by Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, admits she's suffering from a lack of confidence. ""I played really badly and I wish I knew what I could say but I don't know,"" Kvitova told reporters. ""I'm not feeling very well right now, in my confidence, but I'm always looking forward to playing grand slams and I hope everything will be better there than here."" Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki eased past Urszula Radwanska 6-1 6-2, while there were also wins for Russia duo Maria Kirilenko and Ekaterina Makarova.","Andy Murray wins Brisbane International following victory over Grigor Dimitrov .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso will battle it out for the Formula One title at the final race in Brazil after Lewis Hamilton's victory in Texas ensured the German must wait for his third successive championship crown. Hamilton secured back-to-back victories at the United States Grand Prix in front of a capacity crowd of 135,000, overtaking Red Bull's Vettel on lap 42 of 56 in Austin and relegating the 25-year-old to second in his 100th F1 race. Alonso kept his title dream alive by finishing third, and gained a controversial place on the grid before the race after teammate Felipe Massa broke the seal on his Ferrari's gearbox and took a five place penalty. It all points towards a dramatic climax in Sao Paulo, where Vettel will defend a 13-point lead over his Spanish rival, needing to finish fourth or higher to retain the world championship. Latest F1 standings . The race marked a triumphant return to the United States for Formula One after an absence of five years, with drivers and pundits impressed with the show put on at the newly built Circuit of the Americas. Though he didn't clinch the drivers' championship crown, Vettel's performance did ensure Red Bull won the constructors' championship for the third time in a row. But the German, who was heard to be angry on the team radio after Hamilton passed him, blamed Force India backmarker Narain Karthikeyan for slowing him down at a critical moment of the race. ""I wasn't too happy to send a nice big invitation to Lewis when I had to go through Karthikeyan,"" he said. ""He was right behind in the DRS zone. He took that opportunity, fair enough, down the straight and he passed me. I tried to defend, but I knew he would have so much more speed. ""I was obviously not too happy. Lewis had one chance and he took it. After that I tried to stay with him, but there wasn't much between us."" Vettel got to the first corner in front of the chasing pack off the grid and his teammate Mark Webber was able to steal a place on Hamilton and move into second. But after Webber retired with mechanical failure on lap 17 Hamilton began stalking Vettel until he engaged his DRS boost to flick past the German 14 laps from home, the pair's cars only a matter of inches apart. Can F1 rekindle its American dream? Alonso jumped a place after Ferrari's decision to invoke a five-place grid penalty for Felipe Massa, which meant he switched from the dusty, slower portion of the track to the clean side. The difference was clear as Alonso charged round the outside and gained three places going into the first corner. The Spaniard also benefited from Webber's retirement as he held on to third place. Massa battled his way up to fourth place while Hamilton's McLaren teammate Jenson Button claimed fifth. Hamilton, who will end his long association with McLaren after the final race of the campaign in Brazil, was elated with his victory, his second successive triumph in the States after winning the last US GP at Indianapolis in 2007. ""First-time winner! I'm so happy,"" he said. ""The fans were amazing, thank you. It was such a warm welcome and one of the best, if not the best, race of the year -- especially for me and the team. ""It's been a long time since we had a win. I'm so proud of the team and grateful for the support we've had.""","F1 title will go to the final race of the season after Lewis Hamilton wins US GP .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi has agreed a new contract with Barcelona, which will keep the Argentine at the Spanish club until 2018. The 25-year-old already had a deal that expired with the European giants in 2016, but that has now been extended by two years. Messi has been in sensational form this year, scoring 90 goals for both club and country to surpass the previous goalscoring record for a calendar year set by Gerd Mueller in 1972, when the German scored 85 goals. The 21-time Spanish champions have also verbally agreed new deals with midfielder Xavi, who will extend his contract from 2014 until 2016, while defender Carles Puyol, whose contract had been due to expire next year, will stay with Barca until 2016. None of the players has yet to put pen to paper on their new contracts but the Barca website says this will happen ""over the course of the next few weeks"". ""This news means that FC Barcelona has secured its ties with three of its most important players,"" the club said on its official website. While both club captain Puyol, 34, and Xavi, 32, are significant figures at the club, Barcelona officials are likely to look upon the extension of Messi's deal as the most important. Widely regarded as the best footballer in the world, the diminutive Argentina international has often spoke of the debt of gratitude he believes he owes the Catalan club. At the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency and neither his existing club in his home town Rosario -- Newell's Old Boys -- nor Buenos Aires giants River Plate were prepared to provide the money to treat his condition, which amounted to some US$1,000 per month. Instead, Barcelona, who had been made aware of his talents, offered to pay the medical bills of a boy who stood just 4ft 6in as long as he was prepared to move to Spain, a decision which Messi confirmed when signing his first contract with the club on the back of a paper napkin. The 13-year-old moved to Barcelona with his family in 2000 -- and the rest is (ongoing) history. Despite his tender age, Messi has amassed a staggering collection of trophies and records. Since making his Barcelona debut in 2003, he has collected three UEFA Champions League crowns, two FIFA Club World Cup titles, five Spanish league championships and two Copa del Rey medals. Along the way, he has scored more goals for the club in both the Spanish league and European competition than any other player in Barcelona's illustrious 113-year history. On a personal basis, he has won three consecutive World Player of the Year titles and is favorite to beat teammate Andres Iniesta and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to win this year's FIFA Ballon D'Or (as the award became known in 2010). Should he do so, Messi will become the first footballer to win the prestigious honor on four separate occasions -- a record that would be made all the more notable by the absence of a World Cup winner's medal in his cabinet. For despite winning the 1995 FIFA World Youth Cup and the 2008 Olympic Games with Argentina, Messi has yet to go past the quarterfinals of the World Cup -- and many commentators believe he needs to win that trophy if he is to lay claim to being the greatest footballer the world has ever seen.","Lionel Messi agrees two-year extension to current deal .

"(CNN) -- You love making snowmen and sledding. You hate the way the white stuff feels when it creeps into your boots and traps you inside for days. We all have a love-hate relationship with snow. There's even a Facebook page for it: ""I have a Love/Hate relationship with snow."" More than 43,000 people ""like"" it. ""As a former Northerner, I adored the snow because it made everything quiet and gentle-seeming,"" Emily Mishalanie told CNN. She grew up in New York. Now she lives in snowless New Orleans. ""But I despise the cold and the melt. Snowfall is glorious because it makes everything slow down or even stop, but then the melt is dirty and wet and gross,"" she said. CNN iReporter Alex Parziale thinks snow is pretty. But it makes a huge mess on his Leesburg, Virginia, farm, with two big wet dogs. ""My wife says she is going crazy staying inside,"" he said. As another massive storm moves in to the Northeast, lots of people are going to be stuck inside. Their driveways will be piled high with snow, and the kids will get antsy after getting bored playing outside. Boots will be soggy. These are the things that make for snow haters. ""I hate the snow,"" said Ruth Vesely. As a native New Yorker, Vesely is used to snow. But now that she's nine months pregnant, she finds that snow makes walking around very difficult, and she has almost slipped several times. ""I've gotten stuck in the driveway because when the plows go by, they leave a nice pile at the end of the driveway,"" she said. Take this with a grain of salt, but a 2010 poll from candy maker Nestle asked 1,000 people about their feelings about snow. Men actually like shoveling snow, the survey said. Women like making snowmen. We all grow tired of it as we get older, according to the survey. ""Sadly, it seems the excitement surrounding snow days wears off the older you are,"" the company said in a statement. ""Those older than 35 are 58 percent less likely to look forward to snow days as much as they did when they were younger."" But there are the people who embrace snow, no matter what. ""I love the snow. My wife loves it. We love looking at the trees and seeing everything covered with snow,"" said CNN iReporter Robert Herrera of Dayton, Ohio.

"(CNN) -- Israel was founded on democratic principles with the Jewish state's declaration of independence in 1948 including a commitment to the ""complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex."" It has remained a continuous democracy ever since. The 120-seat Knesset is the Israeli seat of government. The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset, the country's national parliament, located in Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital. The Knesset's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote. Knesset seats are divided according to each party's proportion of the overall vote. But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat. Participation in elections, including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population, has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout, according to Israeli government figures. Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters. Israel usually holds national elections every four years. But this year's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni's failure to form a coalition. Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim. Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself. Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition. Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections, including major parties such as Kadima, Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties. The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition. The prime minister-designate then has 28 days, extendable by 14 days, to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members. Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2.","Israel goes to the polls in national elections on February 10 .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Efforts to bolster a private New Orleans-area levee that had been in danger of failing because of Hurricane Gustav appeared to be working Monday night, the president of a parish said. Crews work to reinforce a levee on a canal in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on Monday afternoon. ""We have stopped the bleeding and I am very encouraged by what we are seeing,"" said Plaquemines Parish President Bill Nungesser. While water came over the top of other levees along the Mississippi River, the barriers were holding against the battering waves that Gustav brought to southeastern Louisiana. The private levee near Braithwaite, about 20 miles down the Mississippi from New Orleans, was the focus of concern after several small cracks were reported. Water also had been coming over the top of the barrier. Sheriff's deputies, firefighters, jail inmates and parish crews, backed up by a front-end loader, spent much of Monday afternoon piling dirt and sandbags in front of a bright blue floodgate that was leaking water. By Monday night, water levels had fallen some but crews continued the sandbagging effort, Nungesser said. The structure runs along the Caernarvon Diversion, separating it from communities such as Braithwaite and Scarsdale. About 300 to 400 homes are in the area, on the east bank of the Mississippi near the St. Bernard Parish line. Nungesser said he did not know how many people remained there despite warnings to leave. iReport.com: Gustav pounds Gulf Coast far and wide . The low-lying parish near the mouth of the Mississippi was heavily damaged during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Parish officials have tried to get the federal government to take the private levee into their system for several years, Nungesser said. In the meantime, he said, the parish raised the levee 2 feet and planted grass on top of it to prevent erosion. ""Obviously, 2 feet was not enough, but that's as high as we were able to raise it,"" he said. Gustav made landfall about 10:30 a.m. Monday near the coastal town of Cocodrie, Louisiana, roughly 80 miles southwest of New Orleans. In New Orleans, Gustav drove sheets of water over the protective levees around New Orleans' Industrial Canal early Monday afternoon, but the walls appeared to have held as the winds faded.  See where the water was coming over levees »  Up to 6 feet of water spilled into an industrial park in the Upper 9th Ward of New Orleans at one point late Monday morning, pouring through small gaps in the concrete flood walls before receding in the afternoon. Wind-whipped whitecaps curled over the top of the flood walls near the Claiborne Avenue railroad bridge while others poured across the levee in the Gentilly neighborhood, north of downtown. As the storm eased, inspectors from the Army Corps of Engineers and parish levee boards went out to check on the earthen walls and have found nothing to raise alarms, said Col. Greg Gunter, a Corps of Engineers spokesman. ""The levees all held up,"" said New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. ""I was hoping that this would happen -- that we would be able to stand before America and before everyone and say we had some success with the levee system."" But Nagin noted that the results only show the city's ability to withstand a Category 2 storm. He urged the federal and state governments to commit to completing the levee system's improvements as soon as possible. The Industrial Canal levee failed during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, devastating the Lower 9th Ward and neighboring St. Bernard Parish. The storm breached three levees and left more than three quarters of the city under water. A levee re-engineering and rebuilding project began after Katrina, but it is not scheduled to be complete until 2011. Among the improvements are concrete ""splash pads"" on the protected sides, meant to prevent the earthen levee from eroding around the base of the concrete flood walls that sit atop them. During Katrina, water pouring over the tops of some of the flood walls ate away at the levee beneath, causing the structures to fail. ""We're confident of those structures, although it's still very dangerous any time you're getting wave overwash like that, and wind and wave continue to press against those walls,"" said Maj. Gen. Don Riley, director of civil works for the Army Corps of Engineers. ""I think we're confident in resilience of these new flood walls."" Riley said Katrina damaged 150 miles of the 350-mile levee system. Rebuilding and improving the system is a slow process, he said. ""We're working this with a sense of urgency, but it does take time to do this properly,"" he said. CNN's Gary Tuchman, Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: Workers ""stopped the bleeding"" at levee, Plaquemines Parish president says .

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands has rejected an asylum plea by a gay Iranian teenager trying to escape possible persecution in his homeland. Mehdi Kazemi believes he will face persecution if he is made to return to Iran. Mehdi Kazemi, 19, had originally sought asylum in Britain, where he was taking classes on a student visa, because, he said, his boyfriend had been executed in Iran after saying he and Kazemi had been in a gay relationship. Britain's Home Office rejected his request, prompting Kazemi to flee to Netherlands. Tuesday's decision by the Council of State -- the highest administrative court in the Netherlands --means Kazemi could face deportation to Britain, which he fears will send him back to Iran. Council spokeswoman Daniela Tempelman said the council decided it must comply with the Dublin Regulation and return Kazemi to Britain.  Watch how teenager has lost his right to remain. » . Under the Dublin Regulation, European Union member nations agree that an application for asylum submitted in any EU country would be handled by that country alone. The regulation seeks to ensures that an asylum seeker is not redirected from nation to nation simply because none will take responsibility. Kazemi's initial appeal for asylum in the Netherlands, made in October, was rejected. He then appealed unsuccessfully to a regional court in December. His last appeal was to the Council of State in January. Tempelman said that in order for the Dutch court to consider Kazemi's asylum application, he needed to prove that Britain did not handle his asylum application properly, but he wasn't able to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the British government. Kazemi now has exhausted his chances for appeal in the Netherlands and, according to Tempelman, could be returned to Britain on a short notice. The British government about six months ago accepted the Dutch request to take him back. Kazemi's lawyer will have the option of taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights to request an ""interim measure"" that could allow Kazemi to stay in Europe until further notice. ""If anybody signs his deportation papers and says, look, he's got to be deported to Iran, that means they have signed his death sentence,"" said Kazemi's uncle Saeed, who asked CNN to withhold his last name over safety concerns. Gay rights activists in Europe and Iran are also researching Kazemi's case. ""When Britain is prepared to send a young man back to possible execution, that is inhumanity on a monumental scale,"" said Peter Tatchell, an activist for gay campaign group OutRage. ""And I hang my head in shame, as a British citizen."" In a written statement, Britain's Home Office said that even though homosexuality is illegal in Iran and homosexuals do experience discrimination, it does not believe that homosexuals are routinely persecuted purely on the basis of their sexuality.

"Guilford, Connecticut (CNN) -- Tom Pinchbeck never dreamed he'd turn his family rose farm into an employment center for people with autism. In 2008, faced with a sagging U.S. economy and fierce international competition from South American rose growers, Pinchbeck found himself priced out of the market. He had no choice but to do the unthinkable -- close the farm started by his great-grandfather. Shortly afterward, a college friend of Pinchbeck's, Jim Lyman, approached him with an interesting proposition. Lyman was looking for a way to address the very real problem that many young adults with autism, including his own son, Eli, face: How to transition successfully into adulthood as they grow beyond the cutoff age of built-in state benefits and supports. ""Lyman approached me with the idea of using the greenhouses as a background for vocational therapy for people on the autism spectrum,"" Pinchbeck says. ""I was still reeling from having to close the place down, and it seemed like an interesting way of putting together a really unique program from the ashes of Pinchbeck's Farm."" Now Pinchbeck is working with the group Ability Beyond Disability to put a dent in a staggering statistic: the group says 88% of American adults with autism are unemployed. ""Our program is really designed for people to come into the program, to learn the skills they need and to help place them in their community, help them find a job, hopefully find a career, and really be a productive member of society,"" says Joan Volpe, Ability Beyond Disability's vice president. ""That's really the goal of Roses for Autism is for folks to be a part of a work life that we really take for granted."" Helping achieve that goal is Lori Gregan, the farm's retail manager who's part cheerleader, part mom and part boss. ""I don't have the book knowledge on autism,"" she says, ""But I do have the people knowledge, the instinct."" She works with employees such as 29-year-old Ethel Bondi, who came into the Roses for Autism program struggling with anything outside her set routine. ""Ethel came, and anytime there was any change, anytime I asked her to do anything at all, it was like, 'I quit.' She would get her coat and she was gonna leave,"" says Gregan. ""I'm like, 'whoa whoa whoa, why are you quitting?' She's like, 'I can't do that.' It was always 'I can't.' Now it's like, 'I will. I can. And I am going to.' "" Bondi possesses a talent for making dried rose wreaths -- one of the farm's best-sellers. ""They were supposed to be for just Valentine's Day, but then people wanted them afterward, and they are still wanting them,"" she says. How does that make her feel? ""Proud,"" Bondi says, smiling tentatively. ""They are a big hit."" ""If I show Ethel she can make this wreath, she wins,"" says Bondi. ""She owns that, and now the next girl that comes in next to her, she can show her, and my job is done. She's a viable employee. There might be a quirk or two, but that's what makes us who we are, if all the stones in the river were the same, there would be no song."" Will Swartzell, a 19-year-old Roses employee with autism, thrives on the uniqueness that makes him who he his. And he hopes success stories like his can help shatter misconceptions that might make employers hesitant to hire people on the autism spectrum. ""We all stereotype,"" Swartzell says. ""But I think it's so important not to; to keep your mind open. Everybody's different. Nothing defines a person except themselves."" It's a sentiment echoed by his mother, Sandra. ""I think it's really important for these kids to have a place where they fit in and contribute,"" she says. ""They have so many great strengths, and I think people are focused more on their challenges more than their strengths. But a place like Roses can really allow them to celebrate who they are and at the same time learn important job skills that are so necessary for them to be productive members of our society. They are so capable of that. There is no doubt about it."" Working often makes adults with developmental disorders happier and more satisfied with their lives, says Dr. Max Wiznitzer of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland. It gives them a sense of purpose, and they usually do a good job, he says. They're often very focused. ""They follow the rules,"" says Wiznitzer. ""Autism is that way -- one of the diagnostic criteria is the desire for sameness. They're going to be punctual. They're going to show up every day. They have a lot of positive behaviors that employers like. It can be very beneficial both for the employer and the employee."" But there's somewhat of a downside, says Wiznitzer. They work several hours a day, and ""then they go back to where they're living, and they're somewhat isolated from everyone else and -- what do they do with their leisure time? We have to make sure they have time for the other stuff, too."" Looking across the retail center, where her employees are hard at work cutting, pruning, designing and packing, Gregan's voice fills with optimism. ""To see the change in my employees from day one to day 10, there are no words. I can see this going global. There are people who are autistic all over the world. They just need to know how they fit in and we need to give them those tools. "" With the help of a few charitable grants, Roses for Autism is doing just that -- helping young adults with autism fit in, find their strengths and improve their lives.

Other iReporters shared similar stories of hunkering down, even though nearly all of the 2 million people in coastal Louisiana and the New Orleans area cleared out ahead of Gustav. Fewer than 10,000 people were thought to remain in New Orleans, according to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.

They evacuated for Katrina, but decided that they were ""100 times more prepared for this one."" They've got a generator, lots of ice, water, coolers and dry goods. In Katrina, he says he spent most of the time on the road, and his house stood up fine. He looked at a friend's photos of the area from Katrina and thought he'd be fine riding out Gustav.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Real Madrid beat 10-man Manchester United 2-1 Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League 3-2 on aggregate after a pulsating match which turned on the controversial dismissal of Nani just before the hour mark. United had just gone ahead on the night through a Sergio Ramos own goal when the Portugal midfielder attempted to control a high clearance from his defense. But Nani's foot was high and his studs caught Real's Alvaro Arbeloa in his midriff as he moved forward to intercept the ball. Turkish referee Cuneyt CakÄ±r then stunned the Old Trafford by showing a red card to Nani as he recovered from the collision. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson charged down from his touchline seat to protest and as Nani eventually parted the field he was given a consolation pat by Real manager Jose Mourinho. It was the cue for Real, who had offered little in attack until then, to press forward and the man advantage soon paid in the 66th minute. Substitute Luka Modric found space outside the penalty box to unleash a curling and unstoppable shot past David de Gea, the highlight for sure of the Croatian's stuttering progress with the Madrid giants since his summer signing. Two minutes later and United's worst nightmare was complete as old boy Ronaldo, relatively quiet until then, connected with Gonzalo Higuain's clever cross to score at the far post. Ronaldo pointedly did not celebrate but his goal was decisive, meaning United had to score two more to progress. How Real Madrid won . They made a brave fist of it, Real goalkeeper Diego Lopez having to produce fine saves from Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie and Nemanja Vidic . Wayne Rooney, surprisingly left out of the United starting line up, also hooked a chance over, but at the other end fellow substitute Kaka rattled the home woodwork. At the end it was Real who were celebrating but Mourinho showed some surprising modesty in victory. ""The best team lost, independent of the sending off,"" he told ITV Sport. ""We didn't deserve to win and didn't play well."" Ferguson refused to attend the post-game press conference, because he had been left ""very distraught"" by Nani's dismissal, according to his assistant Mike Phelan. ""It was a great performance marred by the wrong decision,"" added Phelan. Ronaldo had received a warm welcome from home fans on his return to Old Trafford, while Ferguson sprang a surprise with the omission of Rooney, giving starts to 39-year-old Ryan Giggs, playing his 1,000th game for club and country, Nani and Danny Welbeck. It was Welbeck who shone in the opening half, with his darting runs causing the Real defense constant problems. He nearly scored on the follow up as Vidic's header hit the post and was later denied by Lopez again. The second half also started promisingly for United and it was Welbeck's flick which was deflected past Lopez by the unfortunate Spanish international Ramos in the 48th minute. His goal won the El Clasico clash against Barcelona Saturday, but once Nani had departed it did not take long for his teammates to be celebrating again and their fine recent run continues. In the night's other last 16 tie, Borussia Dortmund beat Shakhtar Donetsk 3-0 to progress 5-2 on aggregate. After a 2-2 draw in Ukraine three weeks ago in the first leg, the German champions were always on top through goals by Felipe Santana, Mario Goetze and Jakub Blaszczykowski. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp is bidding to emulate the achievement of the 1997 side who won the Champions League but is guarding against optimism. ""There are still lots of strong teams in the competition,"" he told gathered reporters ""We are just delighted with the result and I am proud of the team."" ""The whole Champions League campaign has gone like clockwork and this was an unbelievable 90 minutes from us.""","Real Madrid beat 10-man Manchester United 2-1 .

"(TIME.com) -- Forget chicken soup or hot tea. There are a new batch of home flu remedies -- and they don't skimp on the alcohol. When Jeni Britton Bauer, owner of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams in Columbus, Ohio, was young, getting a cold or the flu meant her mother and grandmother would mix up a cocktail of their own cure-all for the winter ills -- a syrup of honey, lemon juice and whiskey. She'd get a spoonful, or get to drink it in a hot lemonade before bed. So in 2004, as those around her sniffled and sneezed their way through a moderately severe flu season, Bauer thought she could help ease some of the suffering by adding her own twist to the family recipe, turning the syrup into a sorbet so the coldness would add a soothing touch as well. The frozen treat contains orange and lemon juices, honey, ""ginger, cayenne and liquid pectin -- because it makes it into a cough drop that lubricates your throat,"" Bauer says. TIME.com: Flu vaccine is 62% effective, say health officials . But the key ingredient is Maker's Mark. ""The whiskey relaxes you,"" she says. And there's a lot of it. ""Enough that it barely stays frozen."" When she debuted the treat in 2004, she also rolled out a kid-friendly version, using a cherry concentrate from a Michigan farm instead of bourbon. Jeni's Influenza Rx Sorbet weathered the H1N1 (""swine flu"") scare, and with this year's flu at epidemic levels, is now flying off shelves at $12 a pint in Jeni's 10 Ohio stores, forcing her team to extend production hours to meet the growing number of online orders. But can a sorbet beat the common cold or the flu? Doctors tell TIME that the ingredients don't have any anti-viral properties, meaning they aren't proven to reverse the course of the illness, or prevent you from getting infected. But they may give you temporary relief of some symptoms. Here's what experts say about the cocktail's potential benefits: . Orange and lemon juice. Both juices are high in vitamin C, but data does not confirm that consuming a lot of vitamin C will make a difference when you are actually sick. ""It's probably something that over a long period of time helps you maintain a healthy immune system, but if you take it when you're actually sick, it doesn't do anything to the virus itself,"" says Dr. Nicole Bouvier, assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Disease at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. 5 ways to beat the winter blues . Cayenne and ginger. These spices have anti-inflammatory properties that may make you feel less feverish and reduce the joint pain, headache, and muscle aches that accompany the flu — especially the ingredient capsaicin in pepper. ""It would be the same as if you took an Advil,"" says Dr. Seth Feltheimer, internal medicine physician at New York Presbyterian. Like any spicy food, the cayenne and ginger may also give you the impression that your sinuses are less congested, says Bouvier. Honey and pectin. ""Honey and pectin both provide a coating over the mucous membrane of the throat to soothe any irritation and inflammation,"" says Dr. Malcolm Taw, an assistant clinical professor at the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine. Honey has anti-bacterial properties and has been used as an antiseptic. In fact, says Bouvier, ""raw unpasteurized honey has been used for wound healing because it forms a water barrier and helps keeps moisture in the wound."" Pectin is also an ingredient in cough drops. Alcohol. Sorry, whiskey fans: the Maker's Mark is not going to cure your cold or flu, though it certainly can make you feel less miserable. The bourbon in Jeni's sorbet is a nod to another traditional alcoholic cold remedy, the ""hot toddy,"" a steamy mixture of whiskey or brandy, lemon, honey, and sometimes tea. The concoction can make you drowsy and help you fall asleep, which isn't a bad thing when you're sick because rest helps you recovery more quickly. Why alcohol? It's also an antiseptic, so people might have believed that the alcohol would kill the germs in your body. But ""flu is in a lot of places where beverages don't reach,"" says Bouvier. ""It's in your nose and in your trachea, and unless you accidentally snort the drink or inhale beverages into your trachea, the liquid is not necessarily going where the flu is infecting."" TIME.com: Achoo, it's you! Facebook app points the finger at flu spreaders . Still, there's something appealing — and marketable — about a homespun flu remedy, especially one that contains some booze. Restaurants, bars, and distilleries have started advertising special cocktails to help customers beat colds and flu and stay healthy. Gothamist reported that Qui Tequila, a premium tequila company, issued a press release claiming that doctors prescribed tequila to flu sufferers during the 1918 Spanish flu, suggesting that Qui Tequila, which is full of agave (a natural sweetener), when mixed with vitamin C-rich lime juice, can help relieve cold and flu symptoms. During the 2009 swine flu scare, nightlife news site UrbanDaddy reported that a NYC bar called Drop Off Service was offering a ""Flu Menu,"" which featured ""Cold-Eeze and Brandy,"" ""The Pomegranate Emergen-C Martini,"" and ""Airborne-Infused Shots"" (worth noting that the site partners with some alcohol beverage companies). And this year, Cocktail Bodega in New York City -- which is half juice bar, half cocktail lounge -- is serving up a ""Tequila Immune Booster"" made with tequila, ginger and carrot juice -- a good source of vitamin A, which can help maintain a healthy immune system. But it's worth remembering that although alcohol may numb you to some of flu's symptoms, it's also a diuretic, so indulging can make you lose more fluids than you take in. That can make you dehydrated and worsen your flu symptoms. No matter how healthy your drink is, staying out late can also tire you out and make you more susceptible to getting sick. On the non-alcoholic side, Taw adheres to a Chinese medicinal philosophy that maintains people with colds should consume warm things to make them feel better, not cold things — which supports the chicken soup and hot tea idea. ""My patients who have chronic sinusitis tell me that their symptoms get worse when they pass by the freezer section of a supermarket."" He recommends slurping hot broths with onions or scallions, which contain quercetin, an anti-inflammatory compound that can help to open up congested nasal passages (think miso soup). With all the home remedies now vying for your attention (and dollars), sometimes a simple strategy is best. When it comes to loading up on vitamin and herbal supplements, Feltheimer says, ""I don't go with anything that's expensive and sounds exclusive because if it's too good to be true, then it's too good to be true."" It all depends on what you expect out of your flu fixer: unfortunately, there isn't much that can make the misery go away completely. But if a natural cold and flu remedy makes you feel better and tastes good, enjoy it; just be realistic that it's not going to work miracles. ""If you have to have the flu, you might as well celebrate it,"" Bauer says. So if you want to try Jeni's Influenza Rx Sorbet yourself, you can order it online or make it at home: . Jeni's Influenza Rx Sorbet (makes a generous 1 quart): . 2 cups fresh orange juice (from 5 to 6 oranges) 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice (from about 2 lemons) 2/3 cup sugar . 1/3 cup honey . 1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger . One 3-ounce packet liquid pectin . 1/8 teaspoon cayenne . 2 to 4 tablespoons Maker's Mark bourbon (optional) COOK . Combine the orange and lemon juices, sugar, honey, and ginger in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat. CHILL . Add the pectin, cayenne, and bourbon, if using. Pour into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until cold. FREEZE . Freeze the sorbet just until it is the consistency of very softly whipped cream. (You can eat it now, if you wish; otherwise, proceed as directed.) Pack the sorbet into a storage container, press a sheet of parchment directly against the surface, and seal with an airtight lid. Freeze in the coldest part of your freezer until firm, at least 4 hours. TIME.com List: 31 healthy foods . TIME.com: Can the best ice cream in America be the biggest?

"(CNN) -- Let me start by saying ""Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is rated 'M for Mature' for a very good reason. There is more cursing in the game than at a Yankees/Red Sox playoff game and quite a bit of nearly full frontal nudity. Developers at CD Projekt RED have been very upfront about this title being for adult audiences and make sure people can't be surprised by the content. Even the storyline involving, monster-hunter extraordinaire Geralt of Rivia, is more in line with a plot from ""Game of Thrones"" with its political intrigue, backstabbing and power struggles, than your typical ""kill the monsters"" role playing game (RPG). ""Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" was released last year as a PC-exclusive title, but the game was recently ported to the Xbox 360 to open it up to console audiences. The ""Enhanced Edition"" for the Xbox 360 also offers new content, about four more hours of gameplay and many updates to the interface. Using the Xbox 360 controller to narrate the action can be quite the agility test. Each button, including the triggers and shoulder buttons, will be used constantly and, sometimes, in a hurry. Preparations for combat, which are almost always necessary, will require multiple button pushes to cycle through numerous menus for potions, oils and the like. If hacking and slashing your way through a campaign is your style, this game is not for you. Here, combat is largely about proper preparation before battle, then making sure to use the right combination of attacks -- depending upon your opponents. Fortunately, the action slows or stops when you try to access magic (""signs""), but that also requires a couple of button mashes, some joystick movement, then more mashing to get back to the action. While the PC version allows for hotkeys to make accessing abilities faster and easier, the console controller doesn't have that option. It takes some getting used to, but becomes second nature as the game progresses. As with most RPGs, there is a certain amount of hunting and gathering that goes on. All different kinds of herbs, trinkets and supplies are lying around, waiting for Geralt to pick them up and convert them into potions, armor or oils. Inventories will fill up fast, but you'll need every scrap to gain advantages in combat. Leveling up through earned experience allows players to augment certain abilities through skill trees. A training skill tree is unlocked at the beginning and lets players enhance abilities. The other three trees will help shape how Geralt plays and where his strengths will lie. A magic skill tree powers up spells and unlocks new mystical abilities. The alchemy skill tree boosts gathering and blending abilities as well as increasing the effects of potions and oils. The swordsmanship tree is all about the combat, boosting defenses and damage through different skills learned. Players will have to concentrate on one of the three specialty trees to really get the best abilities. Each level Geralt gains gives him points to unlock new abilities, and every ability has two levels to unlock its maximum impact. The environments are fabulously rendered and the lighting is superb. Buildings have their own individuality and subterranean areas don't just feel like recipients of a copy-and-paste tool job that some games appear to rely upon. Different races look and sound unique and the level of immersion is very deep and rich. The missions and side missions follow along a fairly laid-out path. For all the environmental splendor, there is little reason to go wandering around the countryside unless you just want to see how much work the developers put into the forests (hint: a lot; it is gorgeous). The story is all about king-killing, kingdom-making and political intrigue. Some of the dialog would probably play out very well in the halls of Congress (minus all the swearing, I think). Even though Geralt is a renowned monster hunter, there are very few true monsters to be slain. Yet, it is all done within the context of the story and accomplished very well. A few buggy moments slow down the game. Following other characters during missions can be hit and miss as the leader is stopped or slowed down by every rock, twig and bump in the road. However, it only bogs down the pace and never crashes the game. Overall, ""Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" does a great job of extending its legacy with a deep storyline, intricate combat and a level of immersion that keeps players interested and involved. The mature plot is handled very well, not getting bogged down in the minutiae of drama for drama's sake. Cursing and nudity aside, the mature themes are really aimed at an audience who is interested in living the lifestyle of another the era rather than just killing everything in sight. ""Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings"" is available now for the Xbox 360. It was previously released for the Windows PC in May 2011. It is rated M for Mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, strong sexual content, and use of drugs. This review was done with the Enhanced Edition for the Xbox 360.","The game was recently ported to the Xbox 360 to open it up to console audience .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hydrogen and electric vehicles might be leading the charge, so to speak, towards cleaner transport, but will cars powered by air and the sun ever surpass the sales figures of gasoline cars? MDI boss Guy Negre with his AirPods which start a six-month trial at two European airports in 2009. Click here to read about the latest hydrogen and electric cars . A BREATH OF FRESH AIR . It might seem ridiculous, but air -- yes, air -- can power a car. Compressed air, stored in a carbon-fiber tank and then released, expands to drive the engine's pistons in the same way that petrol gases do. A Luxembourg-based company, Motor Development International (MDI) is at the forefront of the air car's push to market. Former Formula 1 engineer and MDI founder Guy Negre has been working on the technology for almost two decades and is producing a fleet of different models including the OneCAT, the CityCAT and the AirPod. India's biggest car maker, Tata Motors, and a U.S. startup, Zero Pollution Motors, have both signed deals with MDI and hope to have air cars on the road by 2010. In the U.S. the starting price will be nearly $18,000. In October 2008, Air France and the Dutch airline KLM announced that they will be testing out MDI's ""AirPods"" for six months starting in spring 2009. The four seaters will ferry passengers around Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris and Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. MDI says one tank of compressed air will take you about 60 miles in the OneCAT, which has a top speed of 35 miles per hour. As you'd expect from a car that runs on air, there is zero pollution. VERDICT . Compressed-air engines are not new technology -- the French were powering trams with compressed air back in the 19th century. But the air car is highly unlikely to surpass the gasoline car and doesn't have enough oomph to seriously challenge new electric and fuel-cell vehicles. Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer from the UK's Oxford University, says: ""They are interesting, but the problem is that the specific energy -- energy per unit mass -- is very high in air cars."" Professor Paul Shayler from the School of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering at the UK's University of Nottingham says: ""It's an idea that's worth pursuing, but compressing air is both a strength and a weakness. The big advantage of conventional engines is that you can put fuel with a high energy content in a tank and get good range. With a compressed air engine the range is not spectacular."" SOLAR SYSTEMS . Solar cars harvest sunlight to drive an on-board electric motor. You're probably familiar with the solar cars that look a bit like a stingray on wheels, but those aren't commercially viable and are mostly entered into endurance races like the annual World Solar Challenge in Australia. A French motor company, Venturi, has produced an electro-solar hybrid. The Eclectic Concept -- a car with roof-mounted solar panels which power an electric motor -- was so popular, Venturi says, that they have adapted it into a commercial model. The Eclectic is yours to own for $30,000 and uses solar panels to collect energy to power an electric engine. It has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of 30 mph. The car is featured in the 2008 movie, ""Babylon A.D.,"" starring Vin Diesel. It is rumored that the Toyota Prius -- which passed the one million worldwide sales mark in 2008 -- has a new model due out next year that will be fitted with solar panels on its roof to power the car's air conditioning. VERDICT . Venturi has demonstrated that it is perfectly possible to produce solar powered vehicles. But they are expensive when you consider the level of performance they can deliver. Professor Shayler says: ""Solar power has a long way to go. At the moment you simply don't have the energy density to do anything special."" But McCulloch thinks that solar could assist the growth of electric cars. ""Your garage could have solar panels on its roof, store up energy during the day and charge your vehicle at night,"" he said.""And parking lots and the like could be fitted with solar panels. So there are ways that those two can play together."" THE FUTURE . John Turner, Research Fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, says: ""We are talking about a new paradigm here because we know the old paradigm is going to go away. ""For hydrogen, or any new fuel for that matter, to succeed there has to be a policy decision. At the moment it's not cost effective and it's not going to be cost effective until we get into the tens of millions of units per year. There is no way of getting around this. Politicians have to decide when they want to put a policy in place. It's not an economic decision, it's a policy decision."" But any major changes are going to take a long time, he says. ""The issue is manufacturing. Last year we made 60 million cars worldwide. That's two cars a second. That's the current level of production. It has taken many years to get up to that rate,"" Turner said. Click here to read about hydrogen and electric vehicles .","Is the gas engine about to be overtaken by a host of cleaner, leaner rivals?

"(EW.com) -- Jeff Garlin is an actor, writer, director, stand-up comedian, and, of course, Larry David's amoral manager on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (not to mention Susie Essman's ""fat f—"" of a husband on the same). Beginning this Thursday, the funnyman will add ""podcaster"" to his resumé when ""By the Way, In Conversation"" with Jeff Garlin debuts on the Earwolf Podcast Network. As its name implies, the show features Garlin yakking it up with a series of notable acquaintances, including Larry David himself, who guests on the first episode. Below, the jovial Garlin talks about his podcast, the future of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and why it is his patriotic duty to work again with Shakira. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You've been recording these conversation-shows at the L.A. club Largo for a while now. What exactly can people expect from the podcast? JEFF GARLIN: I've been doing these for a little over a year. We were recording them knowing we were going to do something with them but we had no plans. People kept on asking me, ""What are you going to do with these?"" And I always said, ""I have no idea."" And then Earwolf presented to me a great opportunity so I went with it. It's me and my special guest, whoever they may be, in conversation. It's not an interview per se, like you're interviewing me. When someone's career comes up — which it always does — it comes up in natural conversation, it's not specifically to promote anything. Are you saying you're better than me, sir? No. Different. [Laughs] I'm not an interviewer. That's not what I do. But I am good at conversation. And, at worst, the people who do my show are acquaintances. I've never had anybody that I didn't know. Actually, that's not true. Henry Rollins, which is one of my favorite episodes, I didn't really know him before I talked to him. No, they're great fun and we talk about so many different things. For me, it's really enjoyable and the audience seems to dig it too. 'Arrested Development' adding more episodes to new season . Was it easy to get Larry David to appear? As a fan of Curb Your Enthusiasm myself, I imagine him coming up with an endless stream of excuses to not do it. Well, if it wasn't me, odds are he wouldn't appear. He did this for me. He did Jerry Seinfeld's Internet show. But if you're not a close friend of his, the odds of getting him are pretty nil. I listened to a clip of the first show and was fascinated to learn that you once worked with Shakira on the ""Wizards of Waverly Place."" Yes. I worked with Shakira and she's a huge Curb Your Enthusiasm fan. That kind of blew my mind. She knew every single episode and she was nervous about meeting me. That was really a thrill. Who doesn't love Shakira? I have to say that I met her a couple of years ago and did fall slightly under her spell. Of course! That's what I'm saying. It was really quite fun to work with her. I hope I work with her again. I guess the way I could work with her again is if I cast her in something. 'Curb Your Enthusiasm': Jeff Garlin gives you five reasons not to miss the finale . I think that's what the public wants. [Laughs] ""That's what the public wants!"" That's really the point of our whole conversation — the fact that people want to see Shakira and I together. Who else do you have coming up on the podcast? We've got Lena Dunham, Jeff Tweedy... Wait, you've got Jeff Tweedy from Wilco? Yes. It went down great. I just love the guy. That was a great interview. He was nothing but witty. Who else? I've got Michael Moore. Mitch Hurwitz. Sarah Silverman. Judd Apatow. Garry Shandling. He was really funny. Hysterical. You mentioned Mitch Hurwitz. Rumor has it that you will be appearing in the revived Arrested Development. If I'm not cut out, I will be. The Hebrew Hammer is back! Adam Goldberg talks about the sequel, facing Hitler (and Mel Gibson?) Is that a serious fear? It's not a ""fear"" at all. But it happens. One of the biggest mistakes you can say to somebody is, ""Oh, I'm in this movie"" or ""I'm on this."" There's a chance always of being cut out. Did I film some stuff for Arrested Development? Yes, I did. So if it makes it, all the better. You wrote and directed the 2006 comedy I Want Someone To Eat Cheese With. Would you like to make another film? I have directed another movie. It's coming out in May from the good people at IFC. It's called Dealing with Idiots. It's about youth league baseball parents. What was the inspiration? The inspiration was my son playing baseball. I was like, I have to write a movie about this. So I did. Is there any news on a new season of Curb? I'd say it looks good but it won't be any time soon. Because I just finished my movie and [Larry's] finishing a movie that he did for HBO (the Jon Hamm-starring Clear History). So by the time he writes some more and says, ""Do you want to do them?"" the earliest we'd start filming, if we did, would be the fall. We'll see. But I think it's pretty good.

"(CNN) -- A visit to the whirlpool tub cool-down zone signals the endgame for Sunday's Super Bowl competitors. But for the furry beasts of the annual Puppy Bowl, a jump in the water pit means the competition for cuteness has only just begun. Prime time is playtime for the scamps who have provided alternative programming to America's biggest sports viewing experience for nine years. According to Animal Planet, the 12-hour Puppy Bowl marathon drew 8.7 million viewers last year. The broadcast's overload of adorable has included ""cheerleaders"" of various species; hamsters ""flying"" in the blimp over the Puppy Bowl stadium; Meep the bird, who, naturally, tweets from the sidelines (he got 21,000 followers on Twitter during last year's Puppy Bowl); and even a hairless Chinese Crested ""streaker"" puppy. You can thank executive producer Melinda Toporoff, who joined Animal Planet in 2001, for upping the cute factor with many of the above innovations. ""There's some sort of inherent, unspoken joy in seeing these little fluffy things being who they are,"" Toporoff said. ""Looking into a puppy's face ... there's something mesmerizing and calming. It just sort of soothes the soul."" This year's bowl will include new features like a slow-mo cute cam, snout-to-lens shots and lipstick cameras in the toys to get new points of view, she said. The puppies will also have the new watery cool-down zone. It's a setup that expands on the water bowl camera, with more splashing and even slow-motion shots of the puppies shaking off water. Referee Dan Schachner is back Sunday for a second year of calling ""personal fouls"" and ""unnecessary cuteness"" penalties on the furry players. The ""rules"" of the game are pretty loose. Mostly the puppies amble around a large playpen that looks like a football field, pouncing on squeaky toys or tugging on rope. There is never a clear winner in the Puppy Bowl. Still, viewers might choose one kind of puppy to root for, or even one particular player, Toporoff said. ""You root for them to be the MVP -- the Most Valuable Puppy -- of the show,"" she said. The cast of fuzzy beasties, all between 8 and 12 weeks old, comes from shelters across the country, Toporoff said. Some have even come from Puerto Rico. All the puppies, kittens, hamsters and Meep the bird are adoptable. Animal Planet normally films the frolicking in October in order to edit the show by Super Bowl Sunday, so many of the animals are already adopted by airtime. ""We have a pretty incredible track record,"" helping PetFinder.com find adopters for the puppies, Toporoff said. ""For this year, all but four have already been adopted."" A representative from the Humane Society of the United States is present during filming to make sure the animals are safe. Breaks for water and cuddling are mandatory, and puppies are never on camera for more than 20 minutes at a time. The casting of Puppy Bowl is all about the cuteness factor. ""These are desirable puppies,"" Toporoff said. ""They're camera ready!"" The cheerleaders, too, go through a casting process. Last year, piglet cheerleaders hammed it up during the show. This year, the cheerleaders are hedgehogs. Toporoff points out that if you want to adopt a hedgehog you'd better check with your state, because these unusual pets are not legal to own in all parts of the country. Back in the Puppy Bowl studio, it's a pet-lover's dream come true. ""Our staff can't keep their hands off our players,"" Toporoff said. She personally dognaps one of the puppies during filming and brings it into the control room. She confessed to being partial to ""superfluffy"" shih tzus. Who will you root for on Puppy Bowl Sunday?

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of South African troops are headed to the embattled Central African Republic, where they will work alongside members of that nation's military who are trying to quash a rebellion. South African President Jacob Zuma on Sunday announced the deployment of 400 troops ""to render support in fulfillment of an international obligation of the Republic of South Africa towards the CAR."" Read more: Diplomats seek progress on Central African Republic crisis . Despite fits and starts in the peace process, the insurgency in the Central African Republic remains an active and real threat to the government of President Francois Bozize. On Saturday, rebels attacked two more towns -- having already seized several others, as well as threatening to head to the capital of Bangui -- according to a government official. Zuma's directive does not indicate South African troops will fight rebels directly. Rather, the statement says they ""will assist with capacity building of the CAR Defense Force and will also assist CAR with the planning and implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes."" Read more: Central African Republic president seeks help against rebels . ""The employment of members of (South Africa's military) to CAR is one of the efforts that South Africa is making to bring about peace and stability in the region,"" said the South African statement, which was released through government spokesman Mac Maharaj. The crisis started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded he step down. They seized towns in the northern part of the landlocked country and threatened to march on Bangui. Bozize has called on the international community, including the United States and France, to help stave off the rebellion. The foreign ministers from the Economic Community of Central African States will meet Tuesday in Gabon's capital, Libreville, to set an agency for peace talks, said Placide Ibouanga Ndinga, a spokesman for the group. By Thursday, the talks were expected to include the Seleka, opposition party officials, private sector representatives, U.N. officials and Bozize, according to Ndinga. Read more: Rebels assault 2 towns in Central African Republic . Still, some in the Central African Republic questioned the utility of such talks, if they occur as rebels continue to wage attacks. ""How can there be peace if the rebels are looting, raping and abducting our civilians?"" said Jules Gauthier Ngbapo, a spokesman for Josue Binoua, minister of decentralization and territorial administration. Ngbapo said that around 1 a.m. Saturday, rebels attacked the towns of Alindao and Kouango, which lie between Bangui and Bambari, a town it already had seized. The rebels yelled to civilians, asking them to come out and promising that they'd protect them, the spokesman said. He accused the opposition fighters of ""shooting randomly, destroying properties and ... raping civilians."" ""Civilians are afraid, and most of them have fled the town and are now hiding in the forests,"" he added. ""But the rebels are still patrolling the towns, waiting for the innocent people to come out."" CNN was unable to confirm the government claims about the occupation of the towns. As the government scrambles to put down the rebellion, alarm is growing as children are separated from their relatives. ""Reliable sources have informed us that children are newly being recruited among their ranks. These reports are of serious concern,"" said Souleymane Diabate, the U.N. children agency's representative in the nation. Armed groups are forcing people younger than 18 to fight, carry supplies and serve as sex slaves, the agency said last Friday. Before the conflict started last month, 2,500 children were linked to various armed groups. That number is expected to rise as the recent conflict continues, officials said. About 300,000 children have been affected by the rebellion, including family separation, sexual violence, displacement and lack of access to education and health facilities. CNN's Michael Martinez and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","South Africa's president orders the deployment of 400 troops to the Central African Republic .

"(Financial Times) -- Egypt's efforts to secure a critical $4.8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund have run into fresh difficulty, possibly leading the government to seek emergency financing to avoid economic collapse. The IMF has expressed reservations over a government economic plan needed to seal an agreement that has been in the works, for almost two years, according to people familiar with the negotiations. At a time when Egypt's foreign reserves have reached $13.5bn -- below the critical level of three months of imports -- Cairo favours a gradual approach to reform even as it is forced to cut its imports of fuel and wheat. Another complicating factor in IMF negotiations is the fact that Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist president, is reluctant to introduce measures such as a sales tax ahead of parliamentary elections. The poll that had been scheduled to start in April but finish in June has now been further delayed. A court ordered the suspension of the election schedule until the electoral law is reviewed by the Supreme Constitutional Court, which could take several weeks. Fearful of provoking social unrest at a time of political instability, the Egyptian programme favours small and hesitant steps towards the implementation of austerity measures aimed at raising additional revenue for the state and reducing energy subsidies that eat up a quarter of the budget. The IMF, however, has informed Cairo that its proposed economic reform programme is not sufficiently robust. Masood Ahmed, director of the Middle East and Central Asia at the IMF, would not comment on the negotiations with Cairo, saying only that ""the IMF view is that the programme has to have the desired impact on confidence ... [and] needs to have strong measures to address Egypt's broader economic problems"". With the prospect of an IMF agreement receding, analysts say a bridge finance package might be put together by the IMF with other donors to tide Cairo over until after the elections.Ashraf al-Araby, the planning minister, played down the idea on Sunday, adding that broad structural measures were needed. Without a reform programme, bridging financing would in any case do little to restore investor confidence. ""Any extra funds will help Egypt buy time,"" said Mohamed Abu Basha, Egypt economist at EFG-Hermes, the regional investment bank. ""But the failure to agree an IMF programme will send a negative signal to all those investors waiting for hints of real action on the ground to reform the economy."" The much deferred agreement with the IMF was expected to unlock up to $9.5bn of additional finance from other external sources. The reform programme Egypt proposed to the IMF targets a reduction of the deficit from 10.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the current June fiscal year, to 9.5 per cent in the next year. According to Egyptian officials, the economic programme envisions immediate increases to the sales tax, but only on six items. These are cigarettes, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, telecoms, cement and steel. It aims to introduce a fully fledged value added tax by the spring of 2013. It stipulates raising the price of fuel to industry to international levels over three years. The government has already twice increased the price of diesel and natural gas to some energy-intensive industries, though prices to motorists and domestic consumers remain the same. Hany Kadry Dimian, a senior ministry of finance official, told the Financial Times that with the latest increases, the fuel subsidy bill for the June 2013 fiscal year would be about $15bn, but that if no further cuts were introduced, the cost of the subsidy next year would rise to $22bn. ""The programme deals with the short-term and immediate challenges and builds the foundations for more medium-term reforms,"" said Mr Dimian. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Egypt's efforts for a $4.8bn loan from the IMF have run into fresh difficulty .

"(CNN) -- The 1960s are stereotyped in the popular imagination as a decade of ""free love"" and sexual liberation. Yet, as late as 1967, to share a gay relationship in the UK was to risk arrest, imprisonment and life-wrecking public humiliation. Even after homosexuality in England and Wales was finally decriminalized that summer -- a month after the release of the Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" -- gay people in Scotland would have to wait until 1980 for the same right, and those in Northern Ireland two more years. This week, almost 46 years later, the House of Commons, the lower house of the UK parliament, took another landmark step towards granting full equality to gay people by voting in favor of a bill that would give them the right to marry. Civil partnerships, which effectively grant those in same-sex relationships the same legal rights as married couples, have been permitted in the UK since 2005. Tuesday's vote in London came at the same time that France's National Assembly was also debating a government-backed bill to legalize same-sex marriages. A key article of the proposed legislation, redefining marriage as an agreement between two people of the opposite or same sex, was passed emphatically, suggesting the bill is likely to eventually become law, even despite a raft of more than 5,000 amendments tabled by the opposition in an apparent effort to delay proceedings. Gay rights campaigners in London and Paris may have had cause for celebration, but their legislators were hardly ahead of the curve. Same-sex marriage is already legal in eight European countries, including the Netherlands and Spain, as well as in Argentina, Canada, South Africa and some states of Brazil. Meanwhile, the cause of gay rights in the U.S., where nine states and Washington DC have legalized same-sex marriage, received an historic endorsement in President Barack Obama's second term inauguration speech in which he declared: ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" Opinion: How U.S. leads the way on gay rights . With recent opinion polls in both the UK and France indicating solid majorities in favor of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, Roberta Sklar, a spokesperson for the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, said it appeared to be an issue with the power to appeal to many people's emotions. ""We have seen an increasing momentum towards the legalization of equality in marriage,"" Sklar told CNN. ""I think if you exchange the word love for marriage you immediately understand why. Love is a universal experience and in many place love is equated with marriage, so emotionally people come to understand love and marriage in that way."" That momentum has also prompted greater international solidarity between groups campaigning for gay rights, according to Andy Wasley, a spokesman for the UK's Stonewall charity. ""We work together with organisations worldwide to help challenge homophobia, and we've provided advice to campaigners in countries like Croatia and Slovakia, which are looking to learn from the progress we've made on equality in Britain,"" Wasley told CNN. Wasley said that growing recognition and awareness of the principles of universal human rights through institutions such as the United Nations and the European Union had also served the cause of gay rights campaigners. He cited the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights which recognizes the ""equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family."" Yet campaigners warn that the focus on advances towards gay marriage in Western nations risks distracting attention from more urgent efforts to secure basic human rights for gay people in many regions of the world where homosexuality is still illegal and homophobia is deeply entrenched. ""When I speak to my colleagues in these places they say, 'We are not concerned about same-sex marriage. We want our basic human rights.' The right to live safely, to gather with friends, to speak openly. These are things that in Western democracies we take for granted,"" said Sklar. Wasley also highlights continuing casual homophobia in the UK, citing Stonewall research suggesting more than half of gay, lesbian and bisexual young people have been bullied at school and Home Office records of 4,200 homophobic hate crimes in England and Wales last year. ""We've seen a lot of progress over the last 10 years but clearly there are still very big problems. Until everybody in society gets over problems with gay people there is still a lot of work to be done,"" he said. But while gay rights campaigners can increasingly look abroad for inspiration and common cause, their opponents are also mobilizing on an international scale, many of them united by religious faith. In his pre-Christmas message, Pope Benedict XVI rallied Catholics to oppose gay marriage by praising comments critical of gay marriage made by Gilles Bernheim, the chief rabbi of France, raising the prospect of an inter-faith alliance, according to many commentators. Meanwhile in the UK, the new Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby used his first public comments as leader of the worldwide Anglican community to reiterate the Church of England's concerns. Opponents of same-sex marriage argue that the equality argument made by gay rights campaigners is a false one and that there are real social risks involved in redefining the notion of marriage in ways broader than the traditional union of man and woman. ""Nobody wants to be seen as anti-equality and the gay rights lobby have been very effective in framing the argument as being one equivalent to ending slavery,"" Austen Ivereigh, a spokesperson for the Catholic Voices pressure group, told CNN. Ivereigh said that marriage in Western society had traditionally been understood as a ""conjugal institution with sexual difference at its heart."" To allow people of the same sex to marry was to downgrade marriage's importance by misunderstanding it as simply ""a domestic relationship between two people."" He also questioned whether public support for gay marriage in the UK and France was as strong as opinion polls have suggested, arguing that people were confused by the issue. He said anti-gay marriage campaigners in the UK had drawn encouragement from their French counterparts, who have taken to the streets in hundreds of thousands to oppose the government. ""There hasn't been a lot of co-ordinated international action yet but I can see it beginning to emerge,"" said Ivereigh. But Peter Kellner of the UK's YouGov polling agency said that opposition to gay rights legislation tended to be forgotten as soon as it became law, citing the examples of the UK's 1967 decriminalization of homosexuality and the changing of the law in 2000 to equalize the age of consent for straight and gay sex to 16. ""History tells us that measures to advance gay rights cease to be controversial almost as soon as they are passed,"" said Kellner. ""Ahead of the 1967 legislation... Gallup found that more people thought it should remain a criminal act than to legalise it. Afterwards, MPs across the spectrum agreed that there was never the remotest chance to turn back the clock. It's a similar story with the age of consent. Both times, opponents of reform folded their tents once the law was changed.""","The UK this week took another landmark step towards granting full equality to gay people .

"(EW.com) -- In the Day 1 press conference to open the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford struck back at a conservative Utah group that suggested last week that the state should reconsider its funding of Sundance because the festival's liberal leanings did not reflect the state's values. ""Sometimes the narrowest mind barks the loudest, and we've over time come to ignore it,"" said Redford, who also reminded Utahans of the $80 million the festival attracts each year to the local economy. ""We're also offering a wide spectrum of choices. It's up to the audience to choose ... So I would just say to these people -- we either ignore them or remind them that it's a free country and maybe they should look at the Constitution."" But Redford, who took questions alongside Sundance Institute executive director Keri Putnam and Festival director John Cooper did acknowedge that the entire Hollywood industry might need to reexamine the way it treats and markets gun violence, especially in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting. 'NCIS' First Look: Meet Abby as a kid! Citing a pair of roadside movie billboards that featured prominent positioning of firearms, Redford, who once famously played the Sundance Kid, said, ""My thought was [as I drove by], does my industry think that guns will help sell tickets. I don't know. It's not a question that I could answer. But it seems like a question worth asking my own industry. Maybe there's a reason that -- maybe yes. I don't know but it seems fair because I've noticed how often guns are used in ads as though there's something that translates in a positive way."" The trio also discussed the Institute's national and international outreach, seemingly doubling down on its ""cultural exchange"" in London but slamming the door on rumors that Sundance had eyes on a Brooklyn-based outpost.

"New York (CNN) -- Police on Tuesday busted a $7 million drug and prostitution ring that spanned three states, arresting 15 suspects and freeing two trafficking victims in Manhattan, according to the New York Attorney General. After a 16-month investigation, authorities say they broke up the alleged operation at a midtown Manhattan advertising agency called Somad Enterprises Inc., which maintains offices in Queens, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Philippines. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said the enterprise ""made millions of dollars by profiting off the exploitation of women."" The charges range from money laundering and falsifying business records to narcotics sales and prostitution. Authorities say they are still searching for four other suspects. A total of 19 suspects could each face up to 25 years in prison. ""All anyone has to do is open a copy of the Village Voice to get a good sense of how classified advertising and prostitution go hand in hand, particularly in the prostituting of Asian women,"" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, referring to a Manhattan newspaper. Somad Enterprises allegedly put forth print and television advertisements to ""knowingly and systematically promote prostitution."" From January 2010 to October 2012, it is accused of shelling out more than $3 million in advertising to promote the illicit business, while closely managing everything from the bookers to the drivers.

"(CNN) -- Whether or not you care about the big game on Sunday, if you have plans to visit New Orleans any time in the near future, you're a winner of Super Bowl XLVII. When the final seconds tick away on the scoreboard, New Orleanians and the some 10 million visitors likely to travel to the Big Easy this year will be left with a new-and-improved mecca on the Mississippi. Local officials say the process of putting its game face on for the Super Bowl helped push the memories of Katrina damage even deeper into the history vaults. ""This is probably the greatest example I can give you of resiliency. Here we are, seven years after Hurricane Katrina, the NFL has awarded us the biggest party and biggest celebration that they have,"" said Mark Romig, president and CEO of New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corporation. The 'new' New Orleans . The tourism marketing organization says the game inspired $1.3 billion in infrastructure improvements, including upgrades to downtown hotels, a total makeover at the airport, enhancements at the Superdome and repairs to area highways, streets, sidewalks and the streetcar line. Also funded were five new playgrounds that will be completed as part of the ""Super Saturday of Service"" the day before the Ravens and 49ers compete for the Lombardi trophy. Romig says the city used Super Bowl XLVII as the goalpost, timing-wise, for countless projects that have brought the city to a new level of post-Katrina recovery. Mardi Gras beyond bare breasts . The Louis Armstrong International Airport, many visitors' first and last impression of the city, has been noticeably lacking in authentic New Orleans food and flair. With the NFL and its entourage heading to the Crescent City, $356 million was dedicated to revamping the amenities and the aesthetics of the terminal buildings. Among the improvements that took flight: new restaurants, signage and runway approach lights. While the city surpassed pre-Katrina visitor spending in 2011 -- with $5.47 billion spent that year -- the actual visitor count has yet to rise above the bar of 10.4 million visitors, the number of arrivals in 2004. Romig says he doesn't like to speculate, but he's optimistic about 2013 being a record-breaker, especially with this three-week party kicking off the year. ""The Super Bowl footprint is very large. Then you have the added impact of Mardi Gras, which brings in several hundreds of millions of dollars on its own. So when you combine the two, it's a wonderful, positive, double whammy for the city of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana and the region,"" he said. His organization puts the economic impact for the three weeks of what's been dubbed ""Super Gras"" at approximately $730 million. Barry Kern, president of Mardi Gras World and co-chair of the Super Bowl Hospitality Committee, says the overhaul is ""just another building block to New Orleans being rebuilt and becoming a city of the 21st century where everybody would want to be."" Best bites in the Big Easy . Football frenzy . Even though their team isn't marching into the Superdome on Sunday, many Saints fans are still riding the high of winning the Super Bowl in 2010. Mavis Early, executive director of the Greater New Orleans Hotel & Lodging Association, is glad to see football filling the city's 37,000 hotel rooms, but she's even more emotional about what the sport has meant to her city, calling the Saints ""the true catalyst to the recovery of New Orleans."" It has been two years, but the euphoria still lingers. Having the Super Bowl at the Superdome calls to mind how the Saints' victory helped ""wash away whatever negative emotions people were holding onto from the impact of Katrina and the levee breaks,"" says Early. She says fans still looking for a room for the weekend should keep checking with their desired hotel for cancellations. She also recommends www.bbnola.com, where several hundred bed and breakfast listings can be found. Hosting this game ties New Orleans with Miami for the city that has been home to the most Super Bowls; the last time was in 2002. Kern says he's certain that if Hurricane Katrina hadn't struck, New Orleans would be alone in the top spot. ""Our hospitality is the biggest plus. I guarantee, you come to New Orleans and you're going to be treated better than you'll be treated anywhere else that you're ever going to go for a Super Bowl,"" says Kern, whose Mardi Gras World is a beehive of activity now, as workers put the finishing touches on hundreds of floats soon to be parading through the city streets. Mardi Gras day is February 12. The city spread out its annual Carnival celebration this year, altering the parade schedule to allow for a pause on the days immediately surrounding Super Bowl Sunday. If Baltimore and San Francisco fans get a taste of the city and hate the thought of leaving, Romig and other city leaders are urging them to stay for a parade or two. Kern is hoping that exposing the sports crowd to the joys of Carnival and Mardi Gras will help communicate the family-friendly reality of the event. Two smiling tourists from New York are proof that seeing is believing. ""Before coming here all we heard about was drunk people in the streets, but everyone's been friendly and not so crazy,"" said Yolanda Huang. Her friend Jeanne Hsu agreed, adding, ""It's really easy to get around. I feel very safe and it's cleaner than what I expected."" Another group of friends from Sao Paulo, Brazil, was enjoying an early Mardi Gras parade on Friday afternoon, dancing along with the Krewe of Cork. ""In Brazil, we play soccer. We don't know so much about the American football,"" said one of them, with a smile. ""But we are here for the Mardi Gras and the vacation."" Even before the kickoff for Super Bowl XLVII, city officials are planning their next mission. Kern has no doubt the Super Bowl will make a return trip fairly soon. And the tourism marketing corporation is strategizing for 2018. That's when New Orleans will turn 300 years old, or if you start over and count time forward from the storm -- as so many in this region were forced to do -- it will be in its 13th year of renewal. So who's going to win on Sunday? According to Romig, ""In the long term, the citizens of the area are the biggest winners because they're going to benefit from all these great things that have happened in the city."" 3 ways to enjoy the Big Easy on a budget . Ride a streetcar: For a mere $1.25, there are several options. The St. Charles line is one of the most popular, and this time of year, visitors will get to see trees and street signs draped in Carnival beads. Hop on where St. Charles hits Canal for a rewarding low-cost tour. Take the free ferry: The Algiers Ferry leaves every 30 minutes from the dock right next to the aquarium to cross the Mississippi. Get off at Algiers Point and walk around, or simply ride across and back while enjoying the view. Fans in town this week should go at dusk for the special treat of seeing St. Louis Cathedral lit up by the media crews. Browse the art co-op: From Jackson Square, follow the sidewalk behind Cafe du Monde (yes, the powdered sugar-covered treats are a must!) and just before you reach the colorful shopping bazaar that is the French Market, you'll discover the Dutch Alley Artist's Co-op. Browsing is free, but you're likely to find a unique souvenir that you can't live without -- and you might even meet the person who created it.","New Orleans' Superbowl and Mardi Gras excitement has been dubbed 'Super Gras'

"(CNN) -- At least one person was critically injured Tuesday in Venezuela when police clashed with opponents of the government of President Hugo Chavez. According to CNN affiliate Globovision, violence erupted in the municipality of Mario Briceno Iragorry, in Aragua state, when the opposition tried to stop officers from confiscating election documents including voter lists. A man who was run over by a police tow truck was taken to the hospital in serious condition, Globovision said. The TV news network also reported that the man in charge of the local electoral board was detained. Acting on a ruling earlier Tuesday by Venezuela's Supreme Court, Aragua police had confiscated lists of voters who participated in Sunday's primary elections. The court had ordered that the lists be confiscated so that electoral authorities could use them to investigate alleged irregularities during Sunday's elections. According to the Venezuelan government, the court acted after a candidate who participated in the primaries complained his rights had been violated. The Venezuelan Ministry of Communication identified him as Rafael Velasquez, a candidate for mayor in the town of Yaracuy. ""I have the right to ask for the voter lists to be reviewed,"" Vasquez said, according to a statement published by the ministry. ""I'm asking for what is right. There were irregularities. I saw a polling place where there were more votes cast than voters who showed up to vote."" But opposition leaders, including Bolivar state governor Pablo Medina, cried foul, saying the court's ruling was an effort by the Chavez government to intimidate voters who participated in the primaries. Medina called the decision to confiscate the voter lists tantamount to ""state terrorism"" and told Globovision it would not stop the opposition from defeating Chavez in the October 7 presidential elections. ""We're not afraid of what they may do,"" Medina said about government officials' possible reactions. ""Above their actions, above the Supreme Court, above the government, above those institutions that have been sequestered, we're going for total victory on October 7 in order to transform Venezuela into a democratic country."" Opposition leaders cited the publication in 2003 and 2004 of the names of thousands of Venezuelans who had petitioned for Chavez to be recalled. Many of the names of those who appeared in the so-called Tascon List were subsequently targeted by the Chavez government, the opposition leaders said. Luis Tascon was a pro-government legislator who posted on his website the names of people who had signed a petition to remove Chavez. His said his rationale was that a Venezuelan could look at the postings to determine whether his or her signature had been forged. But a study published last April in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics supported the concerns of the opposition. Lead author University of Chicago economist Chang-Tai Hsieh concluded that signers of the 2003 recall petition whose names were subsequently made public saw their earnings drop by 5% on average and their employment probability drop by 1.3% when compared to those who did not sign the petition. That finding ""is strongly suggestive that the main instrument of political retaliation"" was the widely circulated database that contained the list of signers, the authors concluded. Opposition attorney Omar Arevalo told Globovision that he was surprised when he saw the court's ruling. By law, Arevalo said, the voter lists are supposed to be destroyed as early as 48 hours after the election, which expired Tuesday. ""We had a commitment since before the February 12 primaries to destroy the lists by burning them. This was to protect the identities and the rights of (opposition) voters because our country has lived very regrettable situations like the Tascon List,"" Arevalo said. More than 3 million voters participated in Sunday's primary elections, twice as many as expected. Henrique Capriles Radonski, the 39-year-old governor of Miranda state won the primary with more than 60% of the vote. Capriles will run for the presidency against the incumbent Chavez, who has been in power for 13 years. In a statement, the opposition group Unity Venezuela said many of the records had already been destroyed. The group's executive secretary, RamÃ³n Guillermo Aveledo, said lawyers were ""already studying"" ways to oppose the Supreme Court's decision, which he called ""absurd, unconstitutional and disproportionate.""","At least 1 critically hurt when opposition tries to stop confiscation of voter lists .

"United Nations (CNN) -- It took decades to stamp out smoking inside the United Nations. Now the U.N. may have another vice: drinking. The United States ambassador for management and reform, Joseph Torsella, issued a rare public scolding, by U.N. standards, on personal behavior Monday. He warned the U.N.'s ""fifth committee"" panel that negotiating rooms ""should in the future be an inebriation-free zone."" U.S. diplomats say there has been excessive drinking surrounding traditional late-night meetings, especially during Christmas-time budget negotiations held by the fifth committee, which handles administration and budgetary matters. No countries were formally named. However, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin appeared to take some responsibility for his staff when he told CNN Wednesday ""there should be no drinking during business sessions. And I'm going to give very clear instructions to that effect to my delegations."" Several other diplomats denied witnessing drinking during work hours. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told CNN, ""Of course in diplomacy there are a lot of receptions ... people may have a drink, but it's never come into negotiations."" The United Nations headquarters isn't exactly a frat house, but the combination of diplomats, staff, press corps and long hours can spark a relaxed atmosphere. There used to be a bar inside a 'delegates lounge,' but because of building renovations in 2010, there are now few places to get a drink or eat after 3 p.m. It appears some delegates are bringing liquor into the building. A deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Eduardo Del Buey, said: ""I don't think it's up to the secretary-general to tell the member states how to behave. It's up to the individual governments of the member states."" The most famous drinking story erupted overseas nearly three years ago when a senior U.N. official under Ban went on a drunken spiel aimed at his boss during a dinner. He reportedly said ""I know you never liked me, Mr. Secretary-General; well, I never liked you either."" Sha Zukang, undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs, later apologized. Torsella, who issued the drinking warning, has also been on the warpath against excessive business-class travel by U.N. staff who travel overseas. He told his colleagues, ""Let's save the champagne for toasting the successful end of the session and do some credit to the committee's reputation in the process."" Asked about drinking after the meetings, Churkin replied with a smile: ""After is a private matter. We all have our private lives, don't we?"" U.N. demands Syrian rebels release peacekeepers .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top judicial nominee of President Obama's was denied a final confirmation vote on the Senate floor Wednesday after Republicans expressed concern that she would be an ""activist"" on the bench. New York attorney Caitlin Halligan is one of two nominees named in January by Obama to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seen by many as a professional stepping stone to the Supreme Court. A 51-41 cloture vote failed to achieve the necessary 60 senators to end debate on Halligan's qualifications, with Senate Democrats complaining she was being unfairly filibustered. Her third nomination to this judicial seat remains in political limbo. The president said he was ""deeply disappointed"" about the outcome. Halligan is general counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. She would fill the seat vacated by John Roberts, who joined the high court in 2005 and is now chief justice. ""Rather than debate the merits of her nomination and whether she has the legal ability, judgment, character, ethics and temperament to serve on the court, Senate Republicans resorted to smearing her distinguished record of service,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ""They have not been fair to this fine woman."" But Senate conservatives said Halligan met the ""extraordinary circumstances"" justifying a delay in a confirmation vote. ""Ms. Halligan has a well-documented record of advocating extreme positions on constitutional issues, pushing legal arguments beyond what I think is reasonable, including in cases involving Second Amendment gun rights, abortion, the death penalty and others,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, who's also on the Judiciary Committee. ""Her attempts to distance herself from her record were simply unconvincing. There is no question where she stands on these issues. She herself has said that the 'courts are the special friend of liberty ... the dynamics of our rule of law enables enviable social progress and mobility.' "" Obama is the only president in recent memory never to have successfully placed a nominee on the D.C. Circuit, which handles many high-profile appeals, including executive authority to fight terrorism and broader congressional power. There are four vacancies on that bench, and much of the debate on Halligan was whether the court's caseload was enough to justify filling the bench with more judges. ""As measured by the Democrats' own standards and their own prior actions, now is not the time to confirm another judge to the D.C. Circuit,"" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. ""And it is certainly not the time to consider such a controversial nominee for that important court."" Besides Roberts, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg served on the D.C. Circuit before assuming their current jobs. Judges Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg also served there, but their 1987 nominations by President Reagan to the high court did not succeed. Bork died in December. In a rare move, Senate Republicans voted in December 2011 to block Halligan the first time she was tapped for the appeals court, complaining that the 46-year-old Ohio native was too liberal and would bring her ""extreme"" political views to the bench. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday reiterated the view of many of his colleagues that Halligan met the ""extraordinary circumstances"" standard, under a 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases. McConnell complained about Halligan's legal positions on gun rights, detainee rights and immigration, and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court. But Obama said his choices were being held to a different standard. ""Today's vote continues the Republican pattern of obstruction. My judicial nominees wait more than three times as long on the Senate floor to receive a vote than my predecessor's nominees,"" he said in a statement. ""Until last month, for more than forty years, the court has always had at least eight active judges and as many as twelve. A majority of the Senate agrees that Ms. Halligan is exactly the kind of person who should serve on this court, and I urge Senate Republicans to allow the Senate to express its will and to confirm Ms. Halligan without further delay."" As a U.S. senator, Obama joined the unsuccessful 2006 Democratic-led filibuster of Samuel Alito to join the Supreme Court. That effort failed, and Justice Alito has since carved a consistent conservative record in the court. Democrats had defended Halligan as a ""superbly qualified nominee,"" in the words of Leahy. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who along with colleague Sen. Kristen Gillibrand spearheaded the nomination, called her a ""moderate"" and said Republicans have distorted her record. Also renominated for the D.C. Circuit is Sri Srinivasan, the principal deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department, who has argued more than 20 cases before the Supreme Court. He would be the appeals court's first Asian-American, if confirmed. Unlike Halligan, Srinivasan has not even had a committee vote, the procedural first step to getting final floor confirmation. Obama had nominated 33 people to the federal bench in January, including Halligan, saying at the time that many had waited more than six months for a vote. ""I urge the Senate to consider and confirm these nominees without delay, so all Americans can have equal and timely access to justice,"" the president said. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jay Carney expressed frustration about the confirmation process, particularly involving Halligan. ""When Republicans filibustered her nomination in 2011, several of them hung their objections not on her qualifications or her judicial philosophy, but on the D.C. Circuit workload. In essence, they didn't object to her as a judge, just that the seat did not need to be filled. But since then, there has been an additional vacancy,"" with 188 pending cases at the court. Republicans were criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president's first term in office. But the White House, too, has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies. Some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments. They say ongoing unfilled vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts, with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges.","Obama says his judicial nominees have waited too long, blames GOP obstruction .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has dismissed reports that Wayne Rooney could be leaving the English Premier League leaders as ""absolute rubbish"" and insisted Friday the striker would be at Old Trafford next season. Rooney, who has two years left on his contract at United, was surprisingly left on the bench for Tuesday's 2-1 home defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16, with Danny Welbeck preferred. Ferguson claimed the decision was ""completely tactical"" with the aim of blunting the creativity of Real midfielder Xabi Alonso and was not as a result of a rift with Rooney. ""We don't always get it right but I think we did get it right.,"" Ferguson told the official Manchester United website. ""Danny Welbeck is the best player we have in terms of operating in a double role."" He went on: ""There is absolutely no issue between Wayne Rooney and I. To suggest we don't talk to each other on the training ground is absolute nonsense."" United take on Chelsea in the quarterfinals of the English FA Cup Sunday and Ferguson confirmed the 27-year-old Rooney, signed from Everton in 2004, would play some part and was there to stay. ""Wayne will be here next year,"" he promised. ""You have my word on that. I have no issues at all with the player and he'll be involved on Sunday."" Rooney threatened to leave the Red Devils in October 2010, but was talked out of it by Ferguson, pledging his future to United with a lucrative new contract. He had been linked with a move across Manchester to arch rivals Manchester City, who pipped them to the EPL title last season. City manager Roberto Mancini appeared to rule out any attempt to sign Rooney this time around when he addressed reporters Friday. Mancini said: ""I don't know. I don't know this situation. I can understand Rooney would be upset if he didn't play but these are things that can happen in every team. After one week it is finished . ""I think that Rooney is one of the best strikers in Europe but I think it is difficult he can leave Man United,"" added the Italian. Meanwhile, Mario Balotelli, the striker let go by Mancini in the transfer window, continued his excellent start to his AC Milan career. Balotelli, a second half substitute for Gianpaolo Pazzini, who had put Milan ahead at Genoa Friday night, scored the second to seal the three points. It was his fifth Serie A goal in five games since joining Milan, who had to play the last 25 minutes without defender Kevin Constant, who was red carded. It leaves them two points behind second placed Napoli ahead of the weekend fixtures.","Alex Ferguson dismisses reports that Wayne Rooney leaving Man Utd .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama warned Tuesday of diminished emergency services, longer airport security lines and other problems if Congress fails to reach agreement on avoiding the harshest impacts of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts set to begin March 1. With firefighters, police officers and other emergency responders standing behind him, Obama said that ""people will lose their jobs"" if the forced cuts are allowed to take effect. The cuts -- known as sequestration in Washington jargon -- won't help grow the economy or achieve jobs, Obama said, calling those goals the top priority of his administration. He listed a litany of possible impacts intended to inspire public outrage at the potential new reality caused by the spending cuts, such as fewer police and firefighters on the streets, reduced military readiness, less border security, and criminals going free because federal prosecutors will have to close cases. ""Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, which means more delays at airports across the country,"" Obama continued. ""Thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off. Tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings."" However, top congressional Republicans shot back that Obama can prevent harmful reductions in essential services by targeting other areas that his party believes reflect bloated and inefficient government. ""To keep these first responders on the job, what other spending is the president willing to cut?"" House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio asked in a statement, echoing a theme also asserted by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""Surely the president won't cut funds to first responders when just last year Washington handed out an estimated $115 billion in payments to individuals who weren't even eligible to receive them, or at a time when 11 different government agencies are funding 90 different green energy programs,"" McConnell said in a statement. ""That would be a terrible and entirely unnecessary choice by a President who claims to want bipartisan reform."" At the White House, Obama said the mechanics of the forced spending cuts prevented such decision-making. ""If Congress allows this meat-cleaver approach to take place, it will jeopardize our military readiness, it will eviscerate job-creating investments in education and energy and medical research, it won't consider whether we're cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day,"" Obama said. ""It doesn't make those distinctions."" Senate Democrats have proposed replacing the imminent cuts with a combination of more tax revenue from millionaires, ending agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan. House Republicans, who control the chamber, reject any increased tax revenue as a solution, setting up another in a series of congressional showdowns over spending and taxes that dominated Obama's first term. Obama repeated his call from last week for Congress to agree to a temporary respite from the forced spending cuts while possible negotiations continue on a larger solution. He also complained that Republican ideas so far for avoiding forced budget cuts ""ask nothing"" from the wealthiest Americans or big corporations. He added that the GOP prefers having the reductions take effect instead of having ""a single tax loophole"" disappear for those who don't need it. ""None of us will get 100 percent of what we want,"" the president said. ""But nobody should want these cuts to go through because the last things our families can afford right now is pain imposed unnecessarily by partisan recklessness and ideological rigidity here in Washington."" Republicans were forced to concede on their steadfast opposition to increased taxes by agreeing in early January to higher rates on top income earners as part of a deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of what was known as the fiscal cliff, which included the forced spending cuts of sequestration as well as automatic tax hikes. That agreement put off action on the sequester cuts, which were mandated by a 2011 agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling. By the numbers: Automatic spending cuts . The purpose of the deep cuts to all discretionary programs and the military was to motivate Congress to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement that would replace them. However, such a deal has proved impossible, leading to the imminent application of $85 billion in spending cuts for 2013 and almost $1 trillion over 10 years. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other officials warn that the cuts will have a dire impact on government operations and military readiness. The Pentagon would absorb about half of the reductions. In a letter to Congress last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller said ""sequestration will require immediate and significant reductions"" to the agency and its operations. ""Because sequestration calls for across-the-board cuts, the FBI would be required to do less in all its programs, including against Al Qaeda and its affiliated groups, as well as the growing and sophisticated threats from cyber attacks, foreign intelligence, and national and transnational criminal activities,"" Mueller's letter warned. For example, he noted, sequestration would mean cutting 2,285 FBI employees. The GOP opposes any increase in tax rates or other steps to bring in more tax revenue, saying the nation needs to reduce the cost of government. ""We should close loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code, but that revenue should be used to lower rates across the board,"" Boehner's statement said. ""Tax reform is a once-in-a generation opportunity to boost job creation in America. It should not be squandered to enable more Washington spending."" To Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, the GOP stance means ""Republicans have shown that they would rather let the sequester go into effect, or make even deeper cuts to Medicare, education and medical research, than close a single wasteful tax loophole."" In their plan unveiled last week, Senate Democrats proposed replacing the forced spending cuts of sequestration through the end of this year, leaving time for possible negotiations on a broader deficit-reduction package that would eliminate sequestration entirely. They called for $54 billion in new revenue by implementing the ""Buffett rule,"" a principle by billionaire financier Warren Buffett that he shouldn't pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. Under it, anyone with adjusted income of more than $1 million after charitable deductions would pay a minimum 30% tax rate. Other revenue measures in the package include ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and closing tax loopholes for the oil industry. In addition, the package would cut military funding starting in 2015, following the planned end of U.S. combat operations next year in Afghanistan. It would also end agriculture subsidies for a total saving of $55 billion. Also Tuesday, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson proposed a new framework to cut the country's debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The real impact of automatic cuts . Bowles and Simpson were the co-chairmen of Obama's bipartisan fiscal commission in 2010, and their recommendations came to serve as a yardstick for other debt-reduction proposals. Since the fiscal commission disbanded, Congress and the White House have enacted about $2.7 trillion worth of savings that will occur over the next decade. The $2.4 trillion in deficit cuts in the new Bowles-Simpson proposal would eliminate the need for the forced spending cuts of sequestration. Bowles and Simpson called for tax reform that eliminates or reduces some write-offs and loopholes, reducing spending on Medicare and Medicaid and adopting a less generous inflation formula for entitlements and benefits such as Social Security. Other provisions in their new plan included curbing farm subsidies and increasing how much civilian and military personnel contribute to their health and retirement plans. If the forced spending cuts of sequestration take effect on March 1, federal workers could start facing furloughs as early as April, according to federal agencies trying to prepare for the worst. Daniel Werfel, a controller for the Office of Management and Budget, told a Senate panel last week that furloughs won't happen until after agencies negotiate with unions, and that's not expected to be finished until after March 1. After union bargaining, the agencies still need to give employees their official 30 days notice of impending furloughs, realistically pushing most furloughs off until April. However, some non-union employees could face furloughs in March. Unions usually have the final say on how the furloughs will be implemented, said Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). She said they get to bargain with federal agencies on issues such as how the furloughed days will be spread out.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The description of a Los Angeles street gang seems right out of Hollywood. In the square mile between the University of Southern California and an edge of downtown where an NFL stadium is being planned, a group of thugs called Harpys or Harpys-Dead End gang runs extortion rackets, ""taxes"" businesses, robs students and threatens to kill snitches, federal prosecutors allege. Authorities arrested 18 defendants Thursday named in three federal indictments as part of 2 Â½-year investigation called Operation Roman Empire, a play on words referring to imprisoned gang kingpin Danny Roman, spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. attorney's office said. In all, the indictments name 29 defendants. Five are fugitives or have yet to be fully identified, officials said. The remaining defendants are already in state custody on other charges, prosecutors said. Roman, now serving a life sentence without parole, allegedly controls Harpys and more than a dozen Latino gangs across south Los Angeles, but he is not charged in the indictments, prosecutors said. Roman is a member of the Mexican Mafia, and he allegedly gave orders from prison to his daughter and her husband, both of whom were arrested Thursday, prosecutors said. The couple visited Roman in Pelican Bay State Prison in northern California, and their orders allegedly included collecting ""taxes"" on businesses and gangs under the threat of violence and murder, prosecutors said. The money was allegedly funneled back to Roman in prison. The 18 defendants arrested Thursday were to be arraigned later in the day, prosecutors said. Among those regularly extorted were vendors at an indoor Spanish-speaking marketplace called the Alameda Swap Meet, which is in the territory of another unit allegedly controlled by Roman called the 38th Street gang. The indictment alleges that Roman's gang empire distributed methamphetamine, cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin; murdered a gang member who owed a debt; committed armed robbery against three USC students; and plotted to kill a state court witness against a member of another gang, prosecutors said. Roman's daughter Vianna Roman, 37, of Los Angeles, and husband Aaron Soto, 40, of Los Angeles, relayed the imprisoned leader's orders to a ""shot caller"" and other high-ranking members of Harpys, prosecutors alleged. The shot caller also allegedly enforces collection of taxes from other Latino gangs under Roman's control and allegedly delivers orders to the other gangs on drug sales and the use of violence, prosecutors said. During the investigation, officials seized about 8Â½ pounds of methamphetamine, a half-pound of heroin, a pound of cocaine, 23 pounds of marijuana and 22 guns, prosecutors said. During Thursday's arrests, two more firearms were seized and 10 children were removed from several residences by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services' Multi-Agency Response Team, prosecutors said. All except one defendant face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.","Harpys gang controls turf between USC and downtown Los Angeles, feds say .

"New York (CNN) -- Graphic violent sexual photographs and evidence of web searches on how to kidnap and cook women were found in the computer account belonging to a New York City police officer accused of conspiring to abduct women in a cannibalism plot, according to testimony in federal court Monday. Photographs saved in defendant Gilberto Valle's account on his wife's computer included images of women being bound and tortured during sex, and being roasted on a spit in a human barbecue pit, according to testimony. Valle, who was suspended without pay after his arrest last fall, is charged with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a law enforcement database illegally. The government concluded its case Monday, and the defense will call its first witness Tuesday. Prosecutors have argued that Valle was ""deadly serious"" about online plans allegedly to kidnap, rape, torture, cook and eat women. Defense attorneys have argued that their client's conduct was ""pure fiction,"" ""make believe"" and fantasy role-playing. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Testimony Monday from prosecution witness Stephen Flatley, an FBI forensic computer analyst who reviewed the content copied off Valle's wife's computer and hard drive, indicated the computer was used for various searches for ways to kidnap people and eat them. Valle's wife, Kathleen Mangan, handed over the computer to the FBI in September after she installed spyware under the suspicion her husband was looking at websites of a violent sexual nature. Screen shots used by prosecutors revealed conversations Valle had with others about kidnapping, torturing, raping, cooking and eating women. According to testimony, FBI analysis of the computer showed online searches conducted under Valle's account included topics such as ""What to look for in human meat,"" ""How to tie up a girl,"" ""Eat her for dinner cannibalism,"" and ""How do you give chloroform to girls."" The government entered into evidence a cached webpage from a site that included this message from a user to Valle: ""Looking forward to bringing over another girl to cook for dinner."" During cross-examination of Flatley, the defense revealed that Internet history from the computer account as shown in court was just a fraction of overall searches, which included topics such as Major League Baseball, fantasy sports, weight-loss programs, the Olympics and the New York Yankees. But prosecutors focused on the computer's contents, including a cataloge of 79 folders with women's names on them. The computer also contained cartoon images in which the faces of real women were superimposed on characters' heads. The three cartoons showed graphic sexual images, and referred to cannibalism. Photos found on Valle's account included images of women being tied up with duct tape, and two images that appeared to show a woman being roasted on a spit in a human barbecue pit. A video was found in the recycle folder of Valle's computer account titled ""Girl Being Burned."" It was played in court and depicted a naked woman with her hands tied and and with a scarf wrapped around her neck, screaming and moaning while a flame burns near her genitalia. As the government rested its case, the defense entered a motion for acquittal, saying the government failed to prove a kidnapping conspiracy. The defense argued again that the computer's contents depicted fantasy. The judge made no ruling on that motion. If the motion for acquittal is denied, it is possible Valle will take the stand, according to defense attorneys.

"(CNN) -- The decision to give Osama bin Laden's son-in-law civilian, not military, treatment has reignited passionate differences of opinion on which type of justice is appropriate for someone who wages war on the United States. Several Republicans insist that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the bin Laden relative who was also al Qaeda's chief spokesman, should be sent to the detention compound in the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Abu Ghaith pleaded not guilty Friday in U.S. District Court to charges of conspiring to kill Americans as part of terrorism. Civilian prosecution ""makes little sense, and reveals, yet again, a stubborn refusal to avoid holding additional terrorists at the secure facility at Guantanamo Bay despite the circumstances,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said of the administration's decision. President Barack Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, controversial for alleged human rights violations, including interrogation techniques that a 2006 U.N. report said ""amounted to torture."" ""At Guantanamo, he could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers,"" McConnell said. ""Abu Ghaith has sworn to kill Americans, and he likely possesses information that could prevent harm to America and its allies."" Federal prosecutors said Abu Ghaith gave investigators a 22-page statement after his arrest, but they didn't reveal any of what the terror suspect said. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, also said that Abu Ghaith should have been sent to Guantanamo. ""If you are that close to bin Laden,"" he said, ""we want to develop all the information that person has."" ""I think we (are) setting a new precedent that will come back to bite us,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told reporters. ""It's clear to me they snuck him in ... under the nose of Congress."" The U.S. Justice Department says it examined the nature of Abu Ghaith's alleged offenses and whether charges would better be served in federal court or through a military commission. ""In this case, the president's national security team examined this matter and unanimously agreed that prosecution of Ghaith in federal court will best protect the national security interests of the United States,"" department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said in a written statement. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration can bring Abu Ghaith to justice while obtaining intelligence from him. ""We're able to do both,"" Earnest said. From at least May 2001 to 2002, Abu Ghaith appeared with Osama bin Laden and his then-deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri and warned that attacks similar to 9/11 would continue, Earnest said. ""So, this is somebody who is going to be held accountable for his crimes,"" Earnest said. Evidence in the court case has been sealed, and prosecutors said they were reviewing classified evidence to see if it would be used in Abu Ghaith's trial. Abu Ghaith's 22-page statement could be admitted in federal court if he was given a Miranda warning, but military tribunals could allow the statement even if the warning wasn't given, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""So that's a clear difference"" between the two systems, Toobin said. Information obtained by torture, however, isn't admissible in a Guantanamo military tribunal, Toobin added. ""The government has said they will not attempt, even against major (terror) figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to use information that was obtained through water boarding,"" Toobin said. CNN security analyst Peter Bergen said Abu Ghaith appears not to have been involved in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Rather, he emerged as an al Qaeda figure after the attacks, Bergen said. ""He's really been a sort of bit player -- not to say that it isn't important that he goes on trial,"" he said. Military legal expert Eugene Fiddell said the conspiracy charge against Abu Ghaith is not a war crime and is outside the jurisdiction of a military commission. The U.S. Treasury Department has described Abu Ghaith as ""the official spokesman of al Qaeda since his appointment to that position after the attacks of September 11, 2001."" He has appeared in videos as ""the mouthpiece of bin Laden,"" the department said. In January, the State Department reassigned the special envoy dealing with the closing of the Guantanamo detention facility and has no plans to replace him, leaving the administration's timetable for closing the facility in question.","NEW: ""We're able to do both,"" Obama spokesman says of prosecution, intelligence .

He should be interrogated at Guantanamo for intelligence on al Qaeda, they say .

"(CNN) -- China's Li Na set up an intriguing final against defending champion Victoria Azarenka at the Australian Open after a comprehensive victory Thursday over world No. 2  Maria Sharapova. The sixth seed -- a beaten finalist in 2011 -- was in imperious form as she romped to 6-2 6-2 win over the Russian in just over an hour and a half. The 30-year old broke Sharapova's serve three times in the opening set and twice in the second to book her place in Saturday's final in Melbourne. ""Every time I'm back in Australia, I always feel something here,"" Li, the first Asian female to win a grand slam singles title, told reporters after the match. ""I always play well here. Everyone can be nervous in a final, so I have to enjoy it. I'm looking forward to the final."" Li credited a brutal training regime after she reached the final four in Melbourne for the third time in four years. She began working with Carlos Rodriguez, former trainer of seven-time grand slam winner Justine Henin, after deciding to end her professional relationship with husband Jiang Shan. ""We train every day for five, six hours, but not only playing tennis,"" she told reporters earlier this week. ""Tennis was like maybe two, three hours. Fitness was for two or three hours as well. First time I was training with him, I was so excited, but after three days, I was dying."" Li said ending her tennis partnership with her husband had caused many people to think they had also ended their personal relationship. ""He was doing a very good job,"" she said. ""But between husband and the coach, it is very tough. Sometimes, if he said 'we should do something' I was feeling tired ... That's why sometimes we have to fight."" Sharapova had lost just nine games coming into the match, a record for the tournament, but her game fell apart as she served six double-faults and made 32 unforced errors while failing to convert six of seven break points. ""She was certainly much more aggressive than I was, dictating the play. I was always on the defense,"" said Sharapova, who lost to Azarenka in last year's final. ""When I had my opportunities and break points in games that went to deuce, I don't think any of them really went my way today."" In the other semifinal, world No. 1 Azarenka ended the run of American teenager Sloane Stephens -- who famously knocked out one of the tournament favorites, Serena Williams. But the Belorussian was forced to overcome an injury scare on her way to a 6-1 6-4 win over her 19-year-old opponent, who saved five match points and broke back to 5-4 in the second set before Azarenka took a lengthy break for medical treatment. Azarenka raised suspicions of gamesmanship when she suggested in her on-court post-match interview that nerves had got to her. ""I almost did the choke of the year right now,"" she said. ""At 5-3, having so many chances and I couldn't close it out. I was a bit overwhelmed realizing I was one step away from the final. Nerves got into me, for sure."" The 23-year-old clarified her comments at her later press conference. ""I'm telling you honestly that my back was bothering me,"" Azarenka said. ""It took me too long of a time to call the trainer, which was my mistake. I took it to the point where I couldn't breathe, which was causing from my back problem, and I couldn't really figure out what was going on on the court. When the trainer told me that was the rib that was blocking that, my back, that's what happened. ""When you cannot breathe you start to panic. I was really panicking, not because I couldn't convert my match point. That's not the case. I mean, I'm experienced enough to go over those emotions. ""But when you cannot breathe, when something's really blocking you, the stress, that was the stress I was talking about. I just couldn't realize what was going on with me."" Stephens refused to criticize Azarenka, with whom she shares an agent. ""We actually are pretty good friends. I'm sure I'll see her and we'll talk about it,"" Stephens said. She will rise to a career-high 17th in the rankings after her best showing in a grand slam, while her popularity has also grown -- Stephens' following on her Twitter page has rocketed from 17,000 to more than 55,000.","China's Li Na beats Russia's Maria Sharapova in straight sets to reach final .

"(CNN) -- Tension brewed Wednesday between the United Nations and Syrian rebels after about 30 rebels detained 21 U.N. peacekeepers and refused to let them go. The U.N., in turn, is demanding they be released. The rebels contend that the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. The rebels say they suspect the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy, which is defending the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations confirmed the peacekeepers' detention and explained that the peacekeepers were on a ""regular supply mission."" The U.N. offered no further details of that mission but said it is ""dispatching a team to assess the situation and attempt a resolution."" Israel says it won't intervene in Syrian-U.N. incident . There are two videos rebels posted on YouTube that present the rebels' point of view. In one, a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until al-Assad's forces withdraw from the village of al-Jamlah, where there has been heavy fighting. ""We demand from America, U.N. and the Security Council to intervene and get al-Assad forces to withdraw, then we will release these detainees,"" the rebels say. The other video shows rebels walking near several U.N. trucks. ""This U.N. force entered Jamlah village to assist the regime ... and (the U.N. is) claiming that they are here just to stop the clashing,"" a rebel says. Members of the U.N. Security Council condemned the detainment and demanded the peacekeepers be released. The 21 peacekeepers are Filipino, the Philippine government said Thursday. ""The apprehension and illegal detention of the Filipino peacekeepers are gross violations of international law,"" Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario said in a statement. The peacekeepers are reportedly unharmed, and negotiations are underway to secure their safe release, the Philippine government said. The Department of Foreign Affairs said said it is coordinating efforts with the United Nations' peacekeeping agency. The rebels posted on Facebook a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States. ""What is happening (is a) genocide for the Syrian people with the world watching and listening (and) will lead to the gravest consequences,"" they wrote. ""The blood of the people of Syria will be a curse on the whole world if there"" is ""no effective action,"" it said. The letter pointed out that the city of Homs is under constant bombardment. There has been ""hardly a Syrian village spared from the regime bombing"" the letter said. ""This might be the last message to you,"" it warns. ""I call on you all to bear your international responsibilities before God and the people."" The letter is signed by Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, the president of the Syrian National Coalition, an umbrella body of anti-Assad rebels. Opinion: Syrian refugee crisis 'spiralling out of control' Deadly explosion hits rebel city . Violence continued to plague the country this week, as Syria marked the second anniversary of the war. At least 62 people died across the nation Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, a massive explosion ripped through the city of Raqqa, two days after rebels claim to have captured this provincial capital. ""Honestly, I cried when I saw the bodies. It's the first time I witnessed such ugly images,"" said Ahmed Tayar, a writer and resident of Raqqa who saw the aftermath of the mysterious blast. Tayar, 50, told CNN he saw 19 burned bodies at the scene of the blast. An uncut, six-and-a-half-minute amateur video of the immediate aftermath of the explosion showed panicked rebel fighters and civilians racing to pick up several wounded and apparently dead men. In the video, two middle-age men lay bleeding in the street next to scattered oranges and tomatoes that they appeared to have been carrying. Smoke billowed in the distance from a burning car. The entire facade of a nearby three-story building appeared to have been blown off by the force of the blast. It's not clear what caused the explosion, but supporters of the opposition were quick to blame the Syrian government for the blast. ""I thinks it's the regime who killed those people, and that is because the regime wants to take revenge against Raqqa because that it's the first province that was fully liberated,"" Tayar told CNN. On Tuesday, eyewitnesses told CNN residents were fleeing rebel-controlled Raqqa, as government war planes bombed targets in the city. ""While we were there, there were two MiG fighter jets running above us that were throwing down missiles,"" said Ibrahim Olabi, an activist with the Aleppo Media Center, after he visited Raqqa on Tuesday. ""There were no ground clashes,"" he added, ""but only airstrikes from above."" Read the latest news on CNN.com .

"London (CNN) -- In the 23 years since he tried to break up a robbery in central London, Ian Semmons hasn't spent a day without severe pain. The fight left Semmons with multiple fractures, including a broken back and two shattered ankles. He had a head injury so severe, doctors put him in a coma and kept him there for a month to control the swelling in his brain. ""I spent nine months in hospital and then 12 months in a rehabilitation center, where I was basically rebuilt,"" Semmons says. ""But nothing was done to treat my pain."" His regular doctor, a general practitioner with Britain's National Health Service, offered little for the pain despite his complaints. At the time, patients in Britain's government-run system such as Semmons weren't able to switch to another doctor. Unlike patients now, he was stuck. Three years went by. Then Semmons moved a few miles away -- as it turned out, far enough for him to be assigned to a different doctor. During their first meeting, Semmons' new physician asked if he had been to a pain clinic for treatment. ""I said 'What's that?' "" Semmons recalls. ""When he explained to me what it was, and said he was going to send me in to it, I discovered that it was in the very hospital where I had been treated. I had no idea it even existed."" Semmons' experience highlights a reluctance of many UK doctors to treat pain aggressively, including a reluctance to prescribe painkillers, especially opiates -- the rampant use of which in the United States is widely described as an epidemic. Prescription drug deaths: Two stories . Overdoses from prescription painkillers, usually involving alcohol, recently overtook car crashes as the No. 1 cause of accidental death in the United States. Despite making up less than 5% of the world's population, U.S. patients consume about 80% of all prescription pain medication. That's enough each year to give every man, woman and child a dose every four hours for three weeks straight. It's true that wealthier countries tend to use more pharmaceuticals overall. Despite a similar standard of living, on a per-person basis, patients in the UK receive less than half the pain medication as their U.S. counterparts, according to the Drug Control and Access to Medicines Consortium, a UK academic research group that studies issues related to medicine and drugs. And while the approach may anger patients like Semmons, British physicians say it's helped their country avoid the wave of misuse and overdoses that plagues the United States. The National Health Service runs roughly 300 pain clinics, and official guidelines from the British Pain Society, a group of professionals, state, ""In most situations, for most patients and most pains, opioids should not be considered as first-choice treatment."" Other treatments, including physiotherapy, acupuncture and massage are widely used. While U.S. doctors are also supposed to consider alternatives to medication, many are swayed by insistent patients, says Dr. Anthony Ordman, who runs the long-term pain clinic at London's Royal Free Hospital that he founded in 1997. By contrast, Ordman says, ""The physician (in the UK) has a salary ... that takes away certain influences that the patient may have on the physician's thinking. I don't necessarily have to be liked by my patients."" Ordman says the decision on whether to prescribe an opioid is complex, and only made after at least one long interview with the patient. ""I tell (patients), 'You must please stick to the dose I prescribed for you and you must not escalate it without medical permission. You must keep the medication locked up and safe. You must please not lose your prescriptions, because I'm not going to replace them,' "" Ordman says. ""You begin to see we're almost building up a contract between physician and patient."" But the process takes time. Patients need to be referred to pain clinics by their primary doctor. On average, it takes 18 weeks for a patient to be referred to Ordman's clinic, although he says in extreme cases he can sometimes find time to see a patient as soon as the next day. According to Semmons, many patients don't even know that they can ask for a referral. ""There is a general lack of awareness of what there is out there to help (people) with their chronic pain. People don't know the right questions to ask."" After finally getting his pain under control, in part with the use of painkillers, Semmons founded the advocacy group Action on Pain to try and help other patients. ""What we tend to find is a lot of frustration,"" he says. Some people say their doctors think they're faking simply to receive powerful drugs. Others may feel intimidated. ""There's the fear that if (people) go public with a criticism, (the doctors) will give you a tough time,"" Semmons says. Gupta: Let's end the prescription drug death epidemic . Just as powerful opioids are tightly restricted in the United Kingdom, so are painkillers to which most Americans don't give a second thought. While you can walk into virtually any U.S. drugstore and pick up a bottle of ibuprofen or acetaminophen with 400 or 500 tablets, the largest size on UK shelves contains just 16 pills. If you consult a pharmacist and he or she approves, you can purchase 32 pills. ""We have to protect the patient,"" says Howard Silver, a pharmacist at Gateway Chemist in London, who notes that even a moderate overdose of Tylenol can cause liver damage and even death. Shown a typical 400-count bottle of acetaminophen from a U.S. drugstore, Silver shook his head with dismay. ""I'm astonished,"" he says. ""That's a bottle of death."" While that may sound alarmist, 12 million Americans in 2010 reported using opioid painkillers they might not need, or using them without a prescription. For all that, the stark differences between the two countries may be starting to blur. In some areas of the United States, doctors are shifting to a stricter approach. Last month, New York City announced that patients at public hospitals would no longer be able to receive more than a three-day supply of medicines such as Vicodin and Percocet. Lost or stolen prescriptions will not be refilled. Another example is Washington state, where an educational course for anyone who prescribes opioids is required by law, and a so-called ""pain contract"" to accompany any prescription. Meanwhile, the number of painkillers prescribed in the UK is on the rise. One factor may be recent changes to the National Health Service allowing people more flexibility in choosing a doctor. Semmons still walks with two crutches. Like the weather, his pain is always there, even as it changes from day to day. ""It's a constant nagging pain and then it alternates up to a really sharp, needly pain, a stabbing pain,"" the 63-year-old says. On good days, he can stand to be philosophical. ""I'm in pain every day. It's just a part of life."" CNN's Stephanie Smith contributed to this report.","Britain's Ian Semmons dealt with pain for years and didn't know options were available .

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN)  -- If Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin thought her decision to step down might end ethics accusations against her, she quickly found out she was wrong. One dismissed claim cited Gov. Sarah Palin's decision to wear an Arctic Cat logo during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest. Just days after her bombshell resignation announcement, a new ethics complaint was filed  with state authorities arguing that she should not be able to claim per diem funds when she stays at her Wasilla, Alaska, home instead of Anchorage or Juneau, where she has offices.  The complaint says she was charging the state when she stayed in Wasilla and commuted to her offices. The governor's mansion is located in Juneau. Palin claims she is the target of the ""politics of personal destruction,"" as she and some staff members face 19 filings regarding allegations of ethical violations. ""It doesn't cost the critics anything to file frivolous lawsuits or ethics violation charges. It costs our state such a great deal -- thousands of staff hours, millions of dollars in public resources that aren't going to things that it should be going to,"" Palin told CNN. ""We haven't violated the ethics code."" The pressure and financial cost of such ethical investigations are a major reason cited by the governor in her decision not to finish her term. She said her family is facing more than $500,000 in legal fees and has set up a legal defense fund to help defray the costs. Many of the complaints have been dismissed. But Palin last month reimbursed the state more than $8,000 for travel expenses for nine trips, accompanied by her children, after the state paid for them. Another inquiry led to some new ethics training for a staff member. In all, state officials say they have spent $1,963,840 to answer records requests from the ethics filings and to respond in other ways to them. Records show that since January 1, 2008, the state has spent $296,043 on such investigations. Of these inquiries, the one that cost the most and drew the most attention was centered on whether Palin inappropriately fired the state's director of public safety. This complaint had been filed weeks before Palin's run for vice president. The public safety director claimed he was let go because of his refusal to fire a state trooper who was Palin's former brother-in-law and who was locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor's sister. Palin and her supporters argued it was because the director was insubordinate. An independent counsel found she had a right to fire him, but in doing so had violated a state ethics law. It found she had abused the powers of her office by pressuring employees to get the trooper fired. Although the governor and her supporters have criticized the investigations, Andree McLeod, who has filed four complaints against Palin, thinks they are entirely appropriate. ""I don't really care what other people think. I am holding the governor accountable. Other people's ignorance is not going to stymie me,"" McLeod told CNN, surrounded by stacks of state documents she has collected from filing information requests and ethics complaints. ""I am exercising my right to get these public records to discover what Sarah Palin is up to,"" McLeod said. McLeod, a registered Republican, has filed four complaints, including one alleging a friend of Palin's was given preferential treatment in getting a state job. That filing was dismissed by a state board which investigates the claims. McLeod has also filed two lawsuits, including one regarding whether it was appropriate for state business to be discussed using private e-mail addresses. When ethics complaints are filed against the governor or her staff, the state has to hire an independent counsel to investigate the claims to avoid conflict of interest. Among other claims against Palin cite her wearing an Arctic Cat logo on a piece of clothing during a snowmobile race as a conflict of interest and another contending an interview she did after the presidential election in her state office was inappropriate. Those were dismissed. James Muller, a political science professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage, told CNN that, ""Some of [the complaints against Palin] are clearly fanciful, farcical. ""I think most of these ethical complaints are trivial. Almost all have been dismissed by the various levels of review that have taken them on,"" Muller said. Any filings already in process before she leaves office will be concluded. Palin had signed a law making it easier to file such complaints. ""She'd been pushing for that even before she was governor. To have it used in this way, to have it abused in the manner that it was is shameful. It's much like the boy who cried 'wolf,' "" Thomas Van Flein, Palin's attorney, told CNN.","Latest complaint: Palin charged the state when she stayed in Wasilla and commuted .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The center-left coalition headed by Pier Luigi Bersani appears to have won a narrow victory in elections for Italy's lower house of parliament, according to final figures released by the Interior Ministry. Bersani's coalition won 29.54% of the vote cast for the lower house, less than half a percentage point more than the center-right coalition headed by controversial three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which garnered 29.18% of the vote. Final results for the Senate showed the center-left winning with 31.63% of the vote, compared with the center-right's 30.72%. Can the anti-Berlusconi pull Italy out of the mire? ""It's by no means done, but it is exceptional. This is the first time ever that Italy has had a hung parliament,"" said James Walston, a professor at The American University of Rome, before the final results. ""The center-left was not able to put forward a clear picture; they lack leadership. And Berlusconi, who was trailing way behind before Christmas, ended up putting together, reconstituting, a new center-right coalition,"" he said. Voter turnout was lower than anticipated on Sunday, the first day of balloting, down from 62.55% in 2008 to 55.17% this year, the state-run ANSA news agency reported. Weather, in part, appeared to cause the lower voter turnout, the news agency said. It was snowing in portions of northern Italy and raining in the southern part of the country. The candidates and their alliances . Sampling polls were banned within two weeks of the elections, but the most recent ones had Bersani holding on to a slender lead over Berlusconi. Former comedian Beppe Grillo was a distant third. All the candidates, with the exception of Grillo, cast their ballots Sunday, ANSA reported. Italy's political system encourages the forming of alliances. Beppe Grillo: Clown prince of Italian politics . For example, the Democratic Party has teamed with the more left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party. The center-left alliance is dominated by the Democratic Party, led by Bersani. Bersani, 61, comes across as ""bluff and homespun, and that's part of his appeal -- or not, depending on your point of view,"" said Walston, the analyst. He described Bersani, a former communist, as a ""revised apparatchik,"" saying the reform-minded socialist was paradoxically ""far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right."" At second place in the polls was the center-right alliance led by Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, or PdL, in coalition with the right-wing, anti-immigration Northern League. Berlusconi has given conflicting signals as to whether he is running for the premiership, indicating that he would seek the job if his coalition won, but contradicting that on other occasions. The septuagenarian playboy billionaire nicknamed ""Il Cavaliere"" has been campaigning as a Milan court weighs his appeal against a tax fraud conviction, for which he was sentenced to four years in jail last year. The verdict will be delivered after the elections; however, under the Italian legal system, he is entitled to a further appeal in a higher court. Because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire this year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Why are elections taking place now? Italian parliamentarians are elected for five-year terms, with the current one due to end in April. But in December, the PdL withdrew its support of the reformist government led by Mario Monti, saying it was pursuing policies that ""were too German-centric."" Monti subsequently resigned, and the parliament was dissolved. CNN's Hada Messia and Chelsea J. Carter and journalist Tim Hume contributed to this report.","Results for the Senate showed the center-left winning with 31.63% of the vote .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- On the 16th floor of a nondescript building in lower Manhattan, a group of tech-savvy staffers clad mostly in jeans and T-shirts is changing the way Americans watch TV election coverage. CNN's John King uses the ""Magic Wall"" to illustrate and explain election projections. Perceptive Pixel is a high-tech startup company. You may not have heard of them, but you've probably seen their most famous product: an interactive, Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall better known as CNN's ""Magic Wall."" Throughout the 2008 primaries and the general election, John King, CNN's Chief National Correspondent, has stood before the now-familiar electronic wall map, zooming in and out of battleground states with a few pokes of his fingers. The big map allows King to instantly tally electoral votes, shift swing states from one candidate's camp to another's and highlight red swaths of John McCain turf alongside blue pockets of support for Barack Obama. ""Multi-touch is a whole new way of working with the computer where you can actually use more than one finger at a time. That means both hands, that means all ten fingers, that might mean multiple users in front of a screen,"" says Jeff Han, founder and chief scientist of Perceptive Pixel. ""Never have you been able to manipulate this many objects, with this many degrees of freedom, at the same time.""  Watch the wall in action » . The inspiration for the multi-touch technology came from a decidedly non-digital event: Han was drinking a glass of water. He noticed the way light was interacting with his fingers as they touched the glass, and an 'Ah ha!' moment was born that put him straight to work. ""After you get an inspiration like that you run back to the lab where you have a lot of spare parts and all of a sudden, literally within days, you can start going to prototype, "" he says. ""It was pretty neat."" In 2006, Han became the darling of the tech world after unveiling his multi-touch tricks at the annual technology, entertainment and design conference known as TED. In front of some of the industry's biggest movers and shakers, Han zigged and zagged his way across the screen, using both hands to manipulate images, draw cartoonish figures and toss around digital vacation photos like Polaroids. By the time TED ended, Han knew his technology was a hit. But he never expected that CNN would take his product mainstream. Han was exhibiting his multi-touch screen at a military trade show when he bumped into some executives from the cable news network who saw a groundbreaking use for the technology. That meeting marked the birth of King's eight-foot-long electronic sidekick, which has gotten almost as much air time this year as Wolf Blitzer. In recent months the ""Magic Wall"" has been parodied on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" and NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" on which cast member Fred Armisen played with the map like it was a toy. David Bohrman, CNN's Washington Bureau Chief, praises the Magic Wall for giving viewers ""both deep and clear information""  in a visually interesting way. ""Here is a perfect example of how effective it can be: During our coverage of the Indiana primary, we were able to zoom in, county-by-county, to voting returns, and even though some of our competitors had already called the race, we were able to explain why we weren't able to do so,"" Bohrman says. ""John King was able to show the votes outstanding, the votes in Gary, Indiana, and how the race could have gone for Obama or [Hillary] Clinton, with a slight difference in that county's results. We were actually able to show viewers a lot more information and make the story clearer."" On Election Night, Bohrman anticipates the Magic Wall will allow King to display and interpret county-by-county votes for every state across the country. ""So if we're able to project or not project a race, we will explain to viewers why,"" he says. New additions to the Magic Wall also will allow it to illustrate balance of power scenarios in the Senate, Bohrman says. Other television networks have since added similar products to their news coverage. Han declines to reveal the workings of his technology, but he believes the screen will have an impact on much more than the nightly news. ""We're just scratching the surface of what's possible with it,"" he says. ""We see huge growth in diverse areas such as creative applications, architecture, in education, in collaborative brainstorming, ideation processes -- which starts to cover a huge range of companies."" Han is tight-lipped about Perceptive Pixel's current clients, although he tells CNN, ""most of our customers are three-letter agencies, classified work, a lot of secret stuff."" As his touch-screens have risen in popularity -- Han says there are still some obstacles in getting people to understand how they work. Han's multi-touch screens are undeniably cool, with a seemingly magnetic effect on users and audiences alike. One of Han's presentations has been viewed on YouTube over 250,000 times. But he says he doesn't get too caught up in their revolutionary potential. ""I don't see one kind of interface, multi-touch or whatever it is, [replacing] the traditional keyboard and mouse,"" he says. ""When the mouse came about, the keyboard didn't go away.""","A New York startup developed the technology behind CNN's ""Magic Wall""

"New York City (CNN) -- A suspect in a weekend hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their unborn child pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident, his lawyer said. Julio Acevedo, 44, faces three counts of each. He was previously charged with vehicular manslaughter, but the Brooklyn District Attorney's office dropped that charge, according to defense attorney Scott Brettschneider. ""The overreaction everyone has taken in this case frightens him and he's ready to deal with it,"" Brettschneider said. ""It was an accident. It's a tragedy, but an accident."" Acevedo was remanded at his arraignment Thursday night and the case will now be presented to a grand jury for indictment. He was arrested Wednesday in nearby Bethlehem in connection with the Sunday wreck that killed Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21. Raizy Glauber was pregnant, and the couple's boy was delivered by cesarean, but died the next day, police said. Acevedo ran away from the scene, police said, and it wasn't immediately clear how investigators identified him as the suspect. He was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a convenience store in Bethlehem, New York, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. During Thursday morning's hearing, he said he is unemployed and living with his mother in Brooklyn, Judge Kelly Banach said. He was sent back to New York earlier in the day, after a brief hearing in Allentown, Pennsylvania. His next court appearance is scheduled for Wednesday. CNN's Julie Cannold and Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Julio Acevedo, 44, was previously charged with vehicular manslaughter .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The case of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbesset al Megrahi is ""closed,"" Libya's transitional justice minister told reporters. ""The entire world knows that Abdelbesset al Megrahi was tried in the Lockerbie case and he was convicted and then his case was appealed and he was convicted again,"" Mohammed al-Alagi told reporters Monday. ""Then the Scottish authorities and the British government decided later to release him for humanitarian reasons. ""As Libyan justice minister, I believe this case is closed and a man can't be tried twice for the same alleged crime,"" al-Alagi said. Al Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. All 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground were killed when the Boeing 747, bound for New York from London, crashed in the town of Lockerbie, Scotland. Scotland's justice minister granted al Megrahi an early release in August 2009 after his attorneys and Scottish authorities said he was dying of cancer and only had three months to live. He received a hero's welcome in Tripoli, enraging many in the United States and Britain. And with the recent overthrow of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi, politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have called for al Megrahi to be sent back to prison. ""They have assured us that they understand the sensitivities surrounding this case and they will give the matter the consideration it richly deserves,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters after a meeting with Libya's transitional leaders in early September. Jamal Ben Noor, a senior official with Libya's Justice and Human Rights Ministry, said Tuesday the government has not received any official request from Scottish authorities regarding the case. But he said Libya will cooperate if such a request is received from the Scottish or British government to reveal documents or provide access to individuals. Late last month, CNN's Nic Robertson found al Megrahi under the care of his family in his palatial Tripoli villa. He was bedridden, comatose, and surviving on oxygen and an intravenous drip.","Al Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 .

"(CNN) -- The truth about the bombing of a PanAm airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 will come out ""one day, and hopefully in the near future,"" the only man convicted the bombing told Reuters in an interview aired Monday. ""In a few months from now, you will see new facts that will be announced,"" Abdelbeset al-Megrahi told Reuters. ""I don't want to speak about that because there are people who are looking after that themselves."" Al-Megrahi's comments come about five weeks after CNN's Nic Roberston visited al-Megrahi's home, where his family said he was in a coma and near death from terminal prostate cancer. At the time of his late August visit, Robertson found al-Megrahi in a metal hospital bed, attached to an IV drip and cared for by an elderly woman that the family said was his mother. He was, Robertson said, ""paper-thin, his face sallow and sunken."" Reuters: Megrahi says his Lockerbie role exaggerated . ""Clearly he is in a better condition than when I saw him a month ago,"" Robertson said Monday. In the Reuters interview, which the news agency said was recorded Sunday, he remained in bed and at one point was given an oxygen mask to wear, but he appeared lucid. He spoke about his disease and Libyan affairs, and appeared to claim innocence by protesting that he was the victim of the Scottish court that set up at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. military base, as part of an international agreement to try him and a second man. ""Camp Zeist Court is the smallest place on earth that contains the largest number of liars,"" he told Reuters. ""I suffered from the liars at Camp Zeist Court more than you can imagine."" Robertson said al-Megrahi's family told him they believe al-Megrahi was the victim of both international justice and the regime of ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who they say used him as a scapegoat. While al-Megrahi told Reuters that he had been treated badly since his return to Libya, Robertson said Monday that his family is building a ""huge new house in a very upmarket part of Tripoli."" Given Gadhafi's ouster, Robertson said, it's not clear why al-Megrahi isn't speaking out now about what he knows about the bombing, but it's clear he has answers that many people would like to hear. The court convicted al-Megrahi of murder in the 1988 bombing of PanAm Flight 103, which fell from the sky after the explosion, killing 259 people on the airplane and 11 people on the ground. Prosecutors said al-Megrahi, the former chief of security for Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta, brought the bomb to Malta. A second man was accused of placing the bomb aboard the plane. The court acquitted him. The Scottish government granted al-Megrahi a compassionate release in 2009 for medical reasons. He was said to have had only months to live when he was released two years ago. His family told Robertson that al-Megrahi hadn't seen a doctor since they rescued him from a hospital before Tripoli fell to rebel forces, whom he said looted the medicine from their home. ""We just give him oxygen,"" his son, Khaled, told Robertson in August. ""Nobody gives us any advice. And some food by injection (drip). ... If you see, his body he is weak."" In the Reuters interview, al-Megrahi said he is still having trouble obtaining the medicine. He also said that he hopes the violence in Libya ends soon. ""I wish from God that I will see my country united, with no fighting or war,"" he told Reuters.","""New facts"" will come out within months, the convicted Lockerbie bomber tells Reuters .

"(CNN) -- NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan has been off the court for years; now, he's off the market. The sports star is getting married again, his publicist Estee R. Portnoy confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Jordan and longtime girlfriend, Yvette Prieto, got engaged on Christmas Day, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. The couple has been seen at various high-profile public events in recent years, including the Kentucky Derby, golf outings and vacations. Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six championships -- two three-peats -- in the 1990s, before finishing his career with the Washington Wizards in 2003. He retired twice -- the first time to play baseball, the second time to be with his family. Jordan and then-wife Juanita divorced in 2006 after 17 years of marriage. In 2007, Forbes Magazine listed Jordan's divorce as the costliest in celebrity history with a severance package exceeding $150 million. Viewed widely as the world's greatest basketball player, Jordan, 48, today is a cigar-chomping golfer and socialite. In 2010, he became the first former player to be a majority owner of an NBA team, buying the Charlotte Bobcats. Instead of a basketball wife, Prieto enters the engagement largely as a golf wife, judging from her public appearances. In 2009, during opening ceremonies for the Presidents Cup, she was seen alongside Nicki Stricker, the wife of PGA Tour star Steve Stricker, and Elin Nordegren, then-wife of Tiger Woods. Since his hoops days, Jordan has continued lucrative endorsement deals with corporate giants such as Coca-Cola, Hanes and Nike, which houses a subsidiary with his namesake, Jordan Brand. Jordan's name has been in the news recently. His new Air Jordans caused a shopping frenzy around Christmas. Several incidents of violence were reported near shoe stores that sold the expensive sneakers. A wedding date for Jordan and Prieto has not been announced. CNN's Jason Durand contributed to this report.","Couple has been seen at various high-profile public events in recent years .

"(CNN) -- As they meet for the first time Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexico's President-elect Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto will be operating in a landscape of U.S.-Mexico relations that has changed profoundly since Mexico's outgoing president, Felipe Calderon, took office six years ago. Illegal immigration is at the lowest level in four decades, and organized crime violence, which has driven much of recent cooperation between the two countries, is finally declining. Violence remains a critical issue, but economic issues -- bilateral and global -- have risen to the fore as both countries struggle to emerge from the global slowdown. The two leaders will need to give greater emphasis to economic issues, including job creation. But this is also an opportunity to strengthen cooperation on global issues. In most trading relationships, the United States simply buys goods or sells them to other countries. With its neighbors Mexico and Canada, however, the United States actually co-manufactures products. Roughly 40% of all content in Mexican exported to the United States originates in the United States. Opinion: To-do list for Obama and Mexico's new president . The comparable figures with China, Brazil and India are 4%, 3% and 2%, respectively. Only Canada, at 25%, is close. The U.S. and Mexican economies are so deeply linked, growth in one country benefits the other, and lowering the transaction costs of goods crossing the border helps put money in the pockets of workers and consumers. To do this, it will be important to improve border ports of entry by investing in infrastructure and staffing, as well as implementing new risk management techniques to speed up trusted shipments across the border. Pursuing an Open Skies Agreement between the two nations' airlines and making the cross-border trucking pilot program -- in which Mexican truckers can carry goods deep into the United States and vice versa -- would also strengthen competitiveness. Although these are generally seen as border issues, the benefits accrue to U.S. states that depend on exports and joint manufacturing with Mexico, including Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Georgia. Mexico also has abundant oil reserves and one of the four or five largest stocks of shale gas in the world. Mexico's new government will probably pursue major energy reform over the next couple of years that could spur oil and gas production in dramatic ways. If that happens, it is certain to detonate a cycle of investment in the Mexican economy and could significantly contribute to discussions on possible North American energy security. Opinion: Mexico's misconceptions . Obama and PeÃ±a Nieto's administrations also offer a time for critical opportunities in education. With an ambitious but inexpensive public and private venture to spur educational exchange, Mexico could train its next generation of engineers, scientists and medical professionals in U.S. universities while American students enjoy access to Spanish and other cultural competencies in Mexico that they need to compete in the global economy. Without doubt, security cooperation will also remain a critical part of the relationship between the nations. With most of the largest drug trafficking organizations crippled, it is time to focus on strategies that lessen violence and build the rule of law. The U.S. government can still do a great deal more to reduce money laundering and arms trafficking, and the Mexican government has its work cut out to reform its police, prosecutors and courts. These efforts can be far more effective if the nations work together to benefit the safety and security of citizens in both countries. Migration is the one issue the two leaders will talk about Tuesday that matters a great deal to both nations but does not lend itself easily to a bilateral agreement. But the enormous drop in Mexican immigration to the United States -- most studies show that illegal immigration has dropped to net zero and may be negative -- allows the two countries to think seriously about what Mexico might be willing to do to police its borders if the United States undertakes a major overhaul of its immigration laws. Finally, as Mexico continues to grow economically, it will be increasingly possible for the two governments to focus on global challenges. This has already started. Mexico hosted the G-20 earlier this year and also joined the talks for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which led to extensive discussions between the two governments on global economic issues. Opinion: Latin America's challenge . Trade, security and migration will undoubtedly remain the most important topics as the two leaders meet. But as the bilateral relationship develops, relations between the nations might one day resemble those between the United States and Canada, in which global issues can be equally important. A balanced and wide-ranging U.S.-Mexico agenda -- one that seeks creative and collaborative approaches on topics ranging from local gangs to global terrorist networks and from regional supply chains to international finance -- promises significant benefits to people in both nations in the coming years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers; Obama and Mexico's next president meet in opportunity for improved ties .

"(CNN) -- I'm proud to be the honorary chair of the National Day of Service happening this Saturday, inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and legacy. It's the perfect way to kick off the inauguration weekend because anyone can participate, and we know that when we work together, we will achieve more than one person could on his or her own. President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, members of Congress and their families will be rolling up their sleeves at service projects in our nation's capital. But you don't have to be in Washington to get involved. From repairing fire-damaged homes in Colorado and cleaning sidewalks in Detroit to spending time with children with disabilities in New Orleans, every state will offer opportunities to volunteer. All these projects have one big thing in common: They're making a community, our country and our world better. That's part of what makes service special. Whether it's volunteering time, skills, ideas or resources, we all can make a difference. Impact Your World: A life celebrated through service . When I was growing up, my parents and grandparents taught me that engaging in service, helping our neighbors and building strong communities are all part of being a good citizen and a good person. My grandmothers, Virginia and Dorothy, embodied that conviction. They both had hard lives growing up during the Depression and World War II, but despite the obstacles they faced, they found time to volunteer at their churches and community centers and later, their kids' schools. They created families full of love, support and service. My parents instilled their mothers' values in me from early on. In Little Rock, Arkansas, we went to church on Sundays, and afterward, conversation often turned to what volunteer project we could do together. Favorites were deciding which books to donate to the church or library and cleaning up parks together, something my father always managed to turn into a game. When we moved to Washington, service remained an important part of my life. In high school, I helped head the service club, and in college, I volunteered as an America Reads tutor and in the art therapy room at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in California. I loved talking to my grandmothers about my volunteer work, and I agreed with them: I received more than I could ever possibly give. Some volunteer work, such as removing debris after hurricanes, is undeniably hard, physically and emotionally. But a lot of activities, such as chaperoning school field trips, helping a sick child make a collage, reading to older people who have lost their eyesight or participating in an AIDS walk with friends, can be lots of fun. The work is also elevating and powerful. This Saturday, as I join thousands of Americans coming together to do their part, I'll be thinking about my grandmothers, just like I do every day. I know they'd be proud of our country, that in cities and towns across America, people are lending their neighbors a hand, just as they taught their children and grandchildren to do. But as exciting as the National Day of Service will be, it will be even more powerful if it is just the beginning. Already, people are going online to pledge to make giving back a part of their lives, not just for a day or for a week, but all year round. If everyone who pitches in this weekend keeps up that commitment throughout the year, think about how much good we can all do. Lots of small acts add up to big change. Nineteen years ago, my father proudly signed the bill making Martin Luther King Day a time dedicated to serving others. At the speech he gave to mark the event, he reminded us of what King once called, ""Life's most persistent and urgent question: What are you doing for others?"" There are countless right answers to that question -- the only wrong one is to do nothing. As we think about the future of our communities and our country, we each have the ability and the responsibility to participate. I hope you can join me, the first family and our entire American family this Saturday as we make this country that we love even better. You can learn more, find an event near you, and pledge to serve here, at the National Day of Service site. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chelsea Clinton.","Chelsea Clinton heads National Day of Service on Saturday, will kick off inauguration weekend .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a sharp turnaround, House Republican leaders Monday dropped a key demand that the cost of extending the payroll tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. The decision removes a major obstacle to passage of the tax cut extension for the rest of the year -- a move that has been in question. Democrats called the GOP decision welcome news -- a ""major breakthrough,"" according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations -- because the tax cut, which would otherwise expire February 29, is a key part of President Barack Obama's economic recovery strategy. For Republicans, the move trims a thorny political issue. After nearly blocking an extension of the payroll tax cut late last year over concerns about how to pay for it, Republicans acknowledged they had angered voters. The top three Republican leaders in the House released a statement saying they were prepared to remove the contentious payroll issue from a bill that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a fee cut to Medicare doctors -- known as the ""doc fix"" -- in order to ""protect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats' political games."" ""Unfortunately, to date, Democrats have refused virtually every spending cut proposed -- insisting on job-threatening tax hikes on small businesses and job creators -- and with respect to the need for an extension of the payroll tax cut, time is running short,"" said the statement from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California. In the past, House GOP leaders have often struggled to get rank-and-file conservative members to go along with their decisions on spending issues -- particularly when related to negotiations with Democrats. The fact that all three leaders issued the statement was seen by aides in both parties as a sign that they expect to be able to pass the bill without conservatives who might break with the leadership. House Republicans will meet in closed session Tuesday to discuss the proposal, which could be voted on in the House by the end of the week, the leaders said. Aides in both parties said they expect negotiations to continue on the so-called ""doc-fix"" and unemployment benefit extension. But they said removing the payroll issue from those talks should make it easier to reach agreement on them. Those talks would also include potential cost offsets for the payroll tax cut extension, even if it has already passed, the GOP leaders said in their statement. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who heads the Senate Republican election effort, said the decision removes a political hurdle for Republicans as they head into what's expected to be a hard-fought election. ""I think we all recognize that the president's playbook is one to run against Congress and claim we're the problem,"" he told CNN. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted Monday there was time for Congress to work out a comprehensive agreement that would extend both the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance. However, Carney stopped short of saying Obama would oppose the House proposal to separate the payroll tax provision from the other issues under negotiation. ""This is a hypothetical proposal put out that they said they might do if conversations with folks on Capitol Hill don't progress according to the way they want,"" Carney told reporters. ""Let's just see how this process plays out. Extending unemployment insurance as well as the so-called 'doc fix' is equally important -- certainly very important, and very important for our economy. So the president supports extending all of it, and doing it in a way that is easily achievable if folks put ideological and partisan positions aside.""

"Washington (CNN) -- There's good news for drivers hitting the road this Memorial Day weekend: Gas prices are falling. Regular unleaded dropped to a national average of $3.71 per gallon this week, 23 cents below an April high of $3.94, according to the federal government. But will less pain at the pump undercut GOP attacks against President Obama? The answer is unclear. Earlier this year, there was rampant speculation that national gas prices could top $5 or even $6 per gallon. Republicans seized on the issue, sensing new political vulnerability for the president. ""American families and small businesses are continuing to struggle, and one of their big struggles these days is the rising price of gas,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in February. ""If the president's serious about working with (Republicans) to expand energy production in America and to deal with the rising oil prices, it's time for him to lay his cards on the table."" In March, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called on Obama to fire the heads of the Energy Department, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, blaming them for earlier price spikes. Cardona: How to take long holiday from high gas prices . Republicans also bitterly criticized Obama's decision last winter to temporarily block an extension of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. GOP leaders call it a blown opportunity to create jobs and cut prices. Now, gas prices are trending down, but Republicans aren't yielding on the issue. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, spent Friday touring an offshore oil drilling platform in the Gulf, a not-too-subtle way of criticizing the administration's energy development policy. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding two hearings next week to keep up the drumbeat. One of the hearings, according to a committee news release, will ""examine administration policies and regulations that hinder the production and use of oil, natural gas, and coal as energy sources."" CNN on Friday asked Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, whether declining gas prices are blunting the GOP's political message. ""We haven't stopped talking about it, because the need to solve the problem is still there,"" Stewart said. ""This administration is hostile to domestic energy production. ... I don't think you'll find anyone out there who thinks that, even at $3.70 a gallon on average, that it's no longer something to work on."" Top Democrats on Capitol Hill were skeptical of the GOP's ability to gain traction on the issue. ""On gas prices, I would say ... that yes, (the GOP's) attempts to capitalize on gas prices have fizzled,"" said a senior Senate Democratic leadership aide who asked not to be identified. ""But even before prices went down, I think the Republicans' attempts to exploit the issue was coming off as pure politics and thus not gaining much traction anyway."" A CNN/ORC International survey from late March, when gas prices were still rising, showed serious public concern over the issue. Roughly one in five Americans called pump pain the most important issue facing the country; seven in 10 said higher gas prices had caused hardship for them. There were indications, however, that political fallout from rising gas prices was limited. The poll showed that most Americans blamed oil companies for the price increases, not the Obama administration. Congressional Republicans received almost as much blame as the White House, and foreign oil-producing countries got more blame than politicians of either party. ""Republicans seemed to think they had a big weapon to use against Obama. Now, it's not so clear that they will,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Americans don't worry about gas prices as much as they worry about gas shortages. The energy crises of the 1970s that arguably had some effect on elections were really due to long lines and rationing. If those return for any reason, Obama would face a big problem. But if prices are high and gasoline is still easy to acquire, the public would probably not view that as a crisis."" Oil industry experts argue that politicians, including the president, have a very limited ability to affect short term prices one way or the other. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Maryland-based Oil Price Information Service, said the recent price drop is due primarily to investors misreading the global oil market earlier this year, less recent focus on the nuclear standoff with Iran and Europe's economic woes. Policy changes such as increased domestic drilling wouldn't affect prices ""one way or the other"" right now, Kloza said. Changes to automobile mileage standards or Gulf drilling permits could affect prices in about five to 10 years, he estimated. ""Nobody can take credit (for the short-term changes), and nobody can take blame,"" he said. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Gas prices have dropped 23 cents per gallon since peaking in April .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Uhuru Kenyatta, indicted for alleged crimes against humanity and the son of Kenya's founding father, had an early lead Wednesday in the presidential election. With a little more than 40% of the vote counted, Kenyatta was ahead at 53% to 42% over his main rival, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, according to the election commission website. If Kenyatta wins, he will find himself in an unusual quandary. He has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for allegedly inciting a local militia to conduct reprisal attacks in the last election. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges at The Hague. Both have denied the charges. Kenyatta said that if he is elected, the indictment will not affect his ability to do his job. ""I don't think that's an issue that anybody should be concerned with,"" said Kenyatta, a deputy prime minister. ""I have been a member of the government and I've still been able to execute my duties. I still believe I will be able to execute my duties as president once selected."" The international community should respect the will of Kenyans, he said. ""If they do decide it's me, that's a domestic issue left to the sovereign democratic will of the people of Kenya,"" he said last week. ""Any friend of Kenya must recognize that and must take it in their stride."" 'Skype government' But Odinga has raised concerns about the indictment, saying his opponent plans to run a ""Skype government"" from The Hague. Kenyatta has maintained a lead since polls closed after Monday's election, but it is still too early to declare a winner. Analysts have raised the possibility of a runoff. The election carries significance far beyond its borders. As the largest economy in East Africa, Kenya is a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent and provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Kenya is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations. 'Hiccups here and there' As Kenyans eagerly await the outcome, glitches with the new electronic voter system are affecting the tallying, officials said. Counting has slowed down after the electronic systems failed, forcing officers to manually deliver paper copies of vote tallies, according to Odinga's campaign team. The election commission urged citizens to be calm and patient, hoping to avoid tension and distrust in the system, which contributed to post-election violence in December 2007. ""Sometimes a couple of computers would get kind of out of whack and would slow the process down,"" said Abdullahi Sharawi, a commissioner of Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. ""Definitely, there is going to be some hiccups here and there, but I think, when you assess the whole, then we think the work, so far, is very good,"" he said. United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon urged Kenyans to maintain peace. ""I have been encouraged thus far by the largely peaceful and orderly process, despite some incidents of violence and some technical problems,"" he said. Eager to avoid violence . Kenyans are eager to avoid a repeat of the 2007 election. At the time, the nation plunged into ethnic violence after Odinga disputed results that declared the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki, as the winner, alleging the election had been rigged. Protesters took to the streets, where supporters of both camps fought one another. More than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced -- the worst violence since the nation gained independence. Clashes ended with the formation of a power-sharing government with Kibaki as president and Odinga as prime minister. While the poll has been relatively peaceful this time, authorities said at least 10 people were killed in isolated incidents on the coast. Complicated election . Leading up to this election, the candidates declared they would settle any voting disputes in court and urged their supporters to avoid bloodshed at all costs. After the 2007 voting disaster, the government set up an ambitious new constitution, making this election one of the nation's most complicated polls since the country gained independence from Britain in 1963. It also revamped various political systems, including the electoral process and the judicial system. But analysts say the real test will come after the results are announced: Will the loser bow out gracefully to avoid stoking tensions? Read about the main players . Millions cast ballots . About 70% of the 14.3 million eligible voters voted this week, according to election officials. Eight contenders are vying for the presidency. The winner must secure more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff tentatively scheduled for next month. Nima Elbagir and Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, and Faith Karimi reported from Atlanta.","Counting slows down after failures in a new electronic voting system .

"Oberlin, Ohio () -- A day after students at Oberlin College put down their books to focus on how to respond to a spate of hate messages targeting blacks, Jews and gays on campus, classes resumed Tuesday amid tension. The messages included graffiti with swastikas, posters containing racial slurs and other derogatory statements targeting various student communities and fliers bearing racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic language. A student's report on Monday that she had seen someone on campus dressed like a member of the Ku Klux Klan led the school to suspend classes for the day. ""I saw someone in what seemed to be KKK paraphernalia walking on a pathway, like, a pathway that leads to South Campus,"" the student, Sunceray Tavler, told CNN affiliate WJW. ""Just seeing that and having that sink in, this is something that's real, that actually happens."" Police said they received a report of a student wearing a blanket on his or her shoulders but could not say whether the incidents were related. Two students have been identified as being involved in the postings from February and will be subject to college disciplinary procedures, Oberlin police said. Oberlin President Marvin Krislov said he was not able to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation. ""It is a law enforcement matter,"" he told CNN. He praised Monday's campuswide focus on the matter, calling it ""an educational moment."" The students ""feel inspired because this institution has the courage to talk about these issues and to confront concerns and that that is part of our educational mission,"" he said. As he spoke, a group of students behind him chanted, ""No bull****!"" Appearing rattled, Krislov ended the interview abruptly. The events have left some students on edge. ""I was pretty horrified to hear that somebody was dressing as a member of the KKK, because that's something I've only seen before in the movies, on TV,"" said student Yangran Chang. ""It's really unsettling."" ""I didn't so much feel threatened for myself, but I felt threatened for the community that I live in,"" said Joshua Blue, a freshman. ""Because Oberlin has such a reputation for being a very open and accepting place where people of any walk of life can come and live, that someone was threatening that way of life was kind of scary."" The report led to Monday's one-day suspension of classes. ""All of the students came together to rally against these things,"" Blue said. ""It wasn't so much of a rally of trying to lash out at the people that committed these acts, but almost a rally to come together and show our support for each other."" Meredith Gadsby, associate professor and chairwoman of the Africana Studies Department, said she had seen ""isolated events"" during her 13 years at the school, ""but I've never seen the concentration of bias incidents that I've seen over the last four weeks."" She said she felt anger but did not feel threatened, ""in some ways because I'm a grownup and have experiences beyond Oberlin."" But students may have handled the incidents differently. ""They have had their faith shattered a little bit because they expected to come here and escape some of these larger issues. I'm not quite so idealistic. I do not feel unsafe, but I understand why they do."" The incidents have resulted in more than a teachable moment. On Wednesday, the school is offering a workshop for faculty to support their efforts to address the issues in the classroom. ""Students are coming to class with an eagerness and also a desire to make connections between the events going on in their lives and what they are studying in their history or literature classes or other places on campus,"" said Dean of Arts and Sciences Sean Decatur. The school prides itself on being progressive and inclusive. This college of 2,900 students was a center for abolitionists and a stop on the Underground Railroad.

"(CNN) -- Sentencing testimony begins Wednesday in the case of an Iraqi man who was convicted of running over his 20-year-old daughter because she allegedly had become ""too Westernized."" A Maricopa County, Arizona, jury convicted Faleh Hassan Almaleki, 50, on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the 2009 death of Noor Faleh Almaleki. It also found him guilty of aggravated assault, for causing serious injuries to Amal Edan Khalaf, the mother of Noor's fiance, and two counts of leaving the scene. Almaleki, an Iraqi immigrant, was acquitted of more serious first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder charges. He could receive up to 22 years in prison on the murder charge alone. Noor Faleh Almaleki died in November 2009 at an Arizona hospital, nearly two weeks after being run over by a Jeep in a parking lot in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria, authorities said. Faleh Hassan Almaleki believed his daughter had become ""too Westernized"" and had abandoned ""traditional"" Iraqi values, Peoria police said. The family moved to the Phoenix area in the mid-1990s, and Almaleki was unhappy with his daughter's style of dress and her resistance to his rules, they said. Khalaf testified that Almaleki made no effort to stop before she and Noor Almaleki were struck, according to CNN Phoenix affiliate KTVK. Defense lawyers said Almaleki was trying to spit on Khalaf, but swerved and ended up running down both women, KTVK reported. Almaleki chose not to testify. After the incident, Almaleki drove to Mexico, abandoning his vehicle in Nogales, police said. He then made his way to Mexico City and boarded a plane to Britain, where authorities denied him entry into the country and put him on a plane back to the United States.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Libya has paid $1.5 billion to the families of terrorism victims, overcoming the final obstacle to full relations with the United States, the State Department said Friday. Police officers survey the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The payment ends Tripoli's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation. President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer. David Welch, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, who negotiated the agreement, called Libya's rehabilitation from a terrorist nation to a U.S. ally ""historic."" The pact closes the book on a contentious period in U.S.-Libyan relations, which began in the 1980s with a series of attacks involving the two countries, including the bombings of Pan Am flight 103, a German disco and U.S. airstrikes over Libya. U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya, a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure. This summer, the United States and Libya signed a deal for the State Department to create a $1.8 billion compensation fund to finalize the claims for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1986 bombing of La Belle disco in Berlin, Germany. It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s. Congress unanimously adopted the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, which cleared the way to end the feud and created the victim compensation fund. Under the agreement, Libya pays more than $500 million to settle remaining claims from the Lockerbie case and more than $280 million for victims of the disco bombing. It will also set aside funds to compensate victims of several other incidents blamed on Libya, although Libya has not accepted responsibility. In exchange, Libya will now be exempt from legislation passed this year enabling terrorism victims to be compensated using frozen assets of governments blamed for attacks. Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families. An initial payment of $300 million was received this month, after the opening of a U.S. trade office in Libya and a historic visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Another $600 million was received Thursday and the remaining $600 million Friday, Welch said, adding that the families could start receiving payments within days. The remaining $300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986. Libyans say dozens of people died in the U.S. air attack, including an adopted daughter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. President Reagan ordered the attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi after two U.S. soldiers were killed and 79 Americans were injured in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Of the dead, 259 people died on board the plane and another 11 on the ground. Libya has paid 268 families involved in the Pan Am bombing $8 million each of a $10 million settlement. But it withheld the remaining $2 million owed to each family over a dispute regarding U.S. obligations to Tripoli. A group of relatives of Pan Am victims said in a statement Friday that they applauded Libya's fulfillment of the agreement. ""The Pan Am 103 families deeply appreciate Sen. Lautenberg's work to urge the administration to take every step to bring the agreement to fruition,"" spokeswoman Kara Weipz said in the statement. ""While our loved ones will never be forgotten, we are glad this chapter in our efforts is finally over."" Ties between the two countries began to improve in 2003, when Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program and began compensating Lockerbie victims. But lingering lawsuits prevented the two countries from fully normalizing ties. The State Department has said the deal was pursued on a ""purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party."" Senior State Department officials said the formula was designed to respect Libyan sensitivities about compensating victims for incidents for which it hasn't taken responsibility and also allow Libya to settle outstanding claims for the air strikes on Tripoli. Donations to settle Libyan claims were placed in the ""voluntary"" fund, from which each country involved in the claims draws the money to pay its citizens. Welch would not say exactly where the money came from but stressed that no American taxpayer money would be used to compensate Libya. The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya, including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador, which was held up until the payments were made. Lautenberg applauded the payment Friday. ""American victims and their families have waited decades for Libya to pay for its deadly acts of violence and today they have received long-overdue justice,"" he said in a statement. ""I am pleased that our relentless pressure and support for terror victims has led to this historic moment."" Rice's visit in September, the first by a secretary of state since 1953, was hailed by both countries as a breakthrough. It followed months of negotiations between the two countries.","Payment is part of multitiered plan to normalize relations between the two countries .

"Baltimore (CNN) -- Shortly after becoming the nation's 112th Supreme Court justice, Elena Kagan by tradition was presented with a silver cup, engraved with the names of those who preceded her in that particular seat. Speaking Tuesday evening before an audience at a synagogue here, Kagan recalled one name standing out in her mind: Louis Brandeis, the nation's first Jewish justice. ""His nomination was controversial, and it took some courage for the president to name him to the bench,"" she said. ""He later faced prejudice on the bench. Justice (James Clark) McReynolds would turn his back on Justice Brandeis when he spoke from the bench, and refused to shake his hand or have his picture taken with him."" Ninety-five years and three justices removed in that seat she now occupies, Kagan said her Jewish heritage barely attracted attention when she was nominated last year. ""There are three Jews on the court, but nobody talks about that. It doesn't matter, times have changed,"" she said. Kagan addressed a mostly Jewish audience of Beth Tfiloh Congregation, celebrating its 90th anniversary. She was asked if her faith affected how she approaches certain cases, especially those involving religion. A case the court will hear early next month involves the State Department's decision to currently list only Jerusalem as the place of birth on Israeli or Palestinian passports, deliberately leaving out the country name in that disputed region. An Israeli couple sued the government, and the issue is whether courts can intervene to overturn such executive and diplomatic decisions. ""I don't think the fact I'm Jewish will matter with respect to the Jerusalem passport case, and it shouldn't, "" she said. ""Anyone who comes before the court should expect impartial justice, and getting the same kind of treatment."" Kagan deflected suggestions the court's religious makeup -- three Jews and six Catholics -- would somehow undermine public confidence. ""It sometimes requires effort to put your feelings aside,"" she said. ""We are all the sum of our experiences, but we (justices) all understand the role of the judge is to step back from any personal proclivities and look just at interpreting the law."" The 51-year-old justice noted her colleagues also share other things in common: all attended either Harvard or Yale law schools, and five, including Kagan, come from the New York City area. The justice was introduced at the Baltimore event by Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Maryland, a longtime member of Beth Tfiloh. Cardin also sits on the Judiciary Committee, which held confirmation hearings for Kagan last year. Kagan grew up in the west side of Manhattan, and describes her family's religious journey as ""wandering Jews."" ""My mother never really found a rabbi she liked, so we joined several synagogues when I was growing up: Conservative, Reform, modern Orthodox."" The family settled on the Lincoln Square Synagogue, where Kagan was a pioneer of sorts, becoming the first girl to have a bat mitzvah at the Amsterdam Avenue facility. She was the one who insisted on it, after her older brother had his bar mitzvah. ""It was the great Jewish experience of my youth,"" she remembered. ""It was a completely natural thing"" to want to have a bat mitzvah. ""I had to negotiate myself with Rabbi (Shlomo) Riskin,"" who had never before performed the coming-of-age rite with a 12-year-old girl. Compromises were made at the modern Orthodox synagogue: her ceremony took place on a Friday night in May 1973, not the usual Saturday mornings boys enjoyed. The star student at her Jewish school read from the Book of Ruth. ""It was good, not great,"" she said of the ceremony. ""It was not exactly what my brother had done, which is what I wanted. But the experience shaped my life, negotiating with Rabbi Riskin. It was a formative experience, and I guess I've always been a striver."" That drive led her to the job that she says ""is now my life's work,"" a place she expects to stay for some time. Despite never having been a judge before, Kagan said the transition has been in some ways easier than she expected. ""Was I nervous, sure,"" she said of her first days on the bench. ""But then I just starting speaking (during oral arguments) and I noticed, oh look, words are coming out of my mouth, and I think I'm making sense. I can do this."" Her colleagues too, she said, have been enormously supportive, and have even opened new worlds for her. She recalled paying a courtesy call on Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, shortly after her nomination to the court by President Barack Obama in May 2010. Risch asked her about gun rights, and remarked she may not realize how important the issue is to some Americans, especially in his home state. She admitted never having owned or fired a gun before. ""But I told the senator if I was fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would go hunting with Justice Scalia."" And she has, joining her conservative colleague on an excursion to a Washington-area shooting range and on several hunting trips, until now never reported. Her host at the synagogue event was surprised. ""You're Jewish,"" deadpanned Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg. ""Yeah, but it turns out, it's kind of fun,"" said Kagan, laughing.","Justice Elena Kagan talks about her life, her faith and her time on the Supreme Court .

"Washington (CNN) -- The uproar last week over a proposed campaign ad highlighting President Barack Obama's former pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, lit up political circles before organizers finally backed off the idea. And Mitt Romney came under fire from evangelicals before his speech to Liberty University in Virginia earlier this month because some at the traditional Christian school still believe Mormonism is a cult. Two very different candidates joined by similar, yet hollow, attacks on their faith illustrate the intense mix of identity politics simmering just beneath the surface of the presidential race. When it comes to faith and race, there are some who want to paint both candidates as outside the mainstream, not members of the traditional American club. They want to paint them as ""others."" Both Obama, the nation's first black president, and Romney, a Mormon, have found that their shared status as members of minority groups and political pioneers, in many ways, has also changed the rules of this presidential campaign cycle, said Nancy Wadsworth, co-editor of the anthology ""Faith and Race in American Political Life."" ""It's the elephant in the room,"" Wadsworth said. ""On the Democratic side, the liability of raising (Romney's) Mormonism and putting it under closer scrutiny means they will be accused of religious intolerance. If (Republicans) bring up Jeremiah Wright, they'll be accused of using the race card."" So both presidential campaigns are adhering to a tenuous, unwritten hands-off agreement when it comes to race and religion even as they themselves struggle to navigate those waters. But the same rules may not neccesarily apply to their supporters, third-party groups and well-heeled super PACs. Romney condemned the Wright ad proposal pitched to billionaire Joe Ricketts and his conservative super PAC. Likewise, senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod reiterated to Candy Crowley on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that critiques of Romney's Mormonism are ""not fair game."" The success or failure of the two campaigns' attempts to remove these topics from the table could speak volumes this fall on how far the nation has come on divisive race and religion-based debates in the political sphere, political experts say. Opinion: Why Obama vs. Romney is becoming a dogfight . It won't be easy. Outside groups, such as the conservative website ""The Daily Caller,"" have criticized Obama for eating dog meat as a child growing up in Indonesia. Republican Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett is demanding Hawaiian officials authenticate Obama's U.S. birth certificate, or he may remove the president from the ballot. Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, recently questioned whether female voters could back Romney, because his father was ""born on a polygamy commune in Mexico."" According to a recent Gallup poll, Democrats were far more likely than Republicans -- 27% to 18% -- to vote against a Mormon candidate. Some Democrats struggle to contend with Obama's race. Vice President Joe Biden was recently dispatched to Democratic stronghold Jefferson County in the important swing state of Ohio, in part because Obama barely eked out a win over John McCain in the predominately white, working-class community. Some Republicans wrestle with Romney's religion. During the primary and caucus season, several social conservative and religious leaders secretly met in Iowa to find and support any other Republican candidate besides Romney, citing his faith as a major issue. ""There will be a number of Republican evangelicals who stay home because of Romney's Mormonism,"" said Clyde Wilcox, a government professor at Georgetown University. Hundreds of evangelical alumni and students at Liberty University, an institution founded by Rev. Jerry Falwell, balked on Facebook when the school invited Romney to speak at commencement. Rev. O'Neal Dozier in Florida and Scott Thomas in Pennsylvania, prominent Rick Santorum supporters, made derogatory comments about the Mormon faith. The claim is that Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim, Wadsworth said. The reason that it works is it signals through code his otherness, he said. ""Race is always there."" ""Obama can never get out from under his racial difference. He has to position himself as not 'other'. Race serves Romney because his whiteness reads him as insider. But on religion, he has to tell a story about how his Mormonism is an American religion and coincides with his conservative base."" On both fronts, Obama and Romney are still trying to find their footing. Obama has faltered a bit in the past while navigating the thorny issue of race. He made what was seen as a historic speech on race in March 2008 in the aftermath of the Wright controversy. However, Obama's remarks in 2009 that a white Cambridge, Massachusetts, police officer acted ""stupidly"" in arresting Henry Louis Gates Jr., a black Harvard professor, and his administration's hasty firing of Shirley Sherrod in, a black former Department of Agriculture official, after her comments about a white farmer were taken out of context in 2010, were seen as missteps. Obama's delayed response after unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin was shot indicated the president and his advisers were ""gauging the cultural landscape,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and the author of several books, including ""New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity."" For his part, Romney in previous campaigns has weathered insults about his religion. In a February interview with conservative Fox host Sean Hannity, Romney criticized comments that he saw as Obama saying ""we must be a less Christian nation."" And Romney, through appearances with his wife and family, is carefully honing a narrative that seeks to make him seem more like the rest of the nation, Wadsworth said. ""The fact that the leading GOP candidate is a Mormon has changed the dialogue,"" Wadsworth said.","Both Romney and Obama have suffered attacks because of their faith .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Darryl Williams and Benjamin Kline were shivering before the speech even started, their black umbrella no match for the steady rain and brisk Philadelphia wind. Even as water hit their faces, though, they were smiling, excited at the thought of seeing Ron Paul. Williams and Kline are true believers. They are two men who in spite of political reality and weather still come out to support their ""ideal candidate."" They don't care that many have crowned Mitt Romney the presumptive nominee or that it is now mathematically impossible for Paul to win the Republican nomination before the convention. They just know who they support. ""We believe he is the best candidate,"" Williams said. Not everyone agrees, though, and the electoral math is against the 12-term congressman from Texas. On Tuesday, Romney swept Paul in all five states that voted. And even if Paul were to win every single delegate from now until the convention he wouldn't be able to win the nomination, according to analysis by CNN Political Research Director Rob Yoon. CNN Election Center: Ron Paul's vote totals . To Paul's most passionate followers, though, it doesn't matter that Paul has earned only an estimated 76 delegates (although his supporters challenge that number), compared with Romney's 841. It doesn't matter that Paul has yet to win a single state. It doesn't matter, said Kline, ""with or without [Paul], the movement is going to carry on."" Kline and Williams are just two of the hundreds of thousands of Ron Paul supporters across the country -- hairstylists, chiropractors, sailors and students -- who have been energized by the congressman from Texas' third run for the White House. Now, as his chances have all but evaporated -- he is still hoping to challenge the presumptive nominee Romney at the GOP convention in Tampa this summer, but party rules may not even allow his name on the ballot -- a core of fans continue to turn out at rallies, flood internet comment boards and gather in big cities and small towns, to keep the movement alive. They still believe. Paul has already announced that he is retiring from the House this year. If he fails to win the presidency, his political career, a career that started in the late 70s, is over. That has left his followers grappling with their unabashed support for the 76-year old doctor and their commitment to the movement. Once a Democrat, now a Paul fan . Standing under an awning at the Philadelphia rally is Kathy Cahalan, a woman from Clearwater, Florida who for 33 years voted as a Democrat but was so moved by Paul that she re-registered as a Republican so she could vote for him this year. Though she voted for then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, she said she regrets it now. Cahalan one of a few people who follows the Paul campaign around the country, going to different events in different primary states. Dave Wilcox, a 22-year veteran of the Navy, had met Cahalan earlier in the campaign. As they talk, a young group of supporters walk by chanting ""End the Fed,"" a slogan that has become a staple at a Paul event. To Wilcox and Cahalan, Paul has become the conduit for a message. Do they respect and admire him? Absolutely. But both say that the movement is bigger than him and will continue when he bows out of politics. ""We are trying to educate the GOP. That is the main message. Once we get back to the Constitution, it doesn't matter who the banner carrier is,"" Wilcox said, gesturing to the chanting students. ""It could be anybody, as long as they hear this message."" Borderline hero worshipers . That attitude contrasts with the eager exuberance of Anastasios Hatzakos, a chiropractor from Easton, Penn. Listening to Hatzakos talk about where he agrees with Paul is like listening to the candidate's greatest hits album. Ending the Fed, cutting the deficit, no foreign entanglements, repealing the National Defense Authorization Act -- Hatzakos mentioned all of them. He went on to say there is not one policy that he disagrees with Paul on. Should he not make the ballot, Hatzakos said, ""I would write him in. I would never vote for anyone else, because they are all the same."" While Paul's base is a wide spectrum of support, there are a number of people who would fall into the category of hero worshipers. In an interview with CNN, Paul says that sort of support makes him uncomfortable. ""I think they over-praise me at times,"" Paul said. ""I keep saying maybe they have been over starved because I don't see my qualifications quite the way they do. They over-praise. It makes me uncomfortable, but obviously it pleases me."" Though many see Paul as the figurehead attached to the movement, Paul says he sees his role in a lesser light. ""I am sort of like a spokesman for them,"" Paul said. ""I don't call them followers. I call them partners in this because they understand the same thing that I understand."" The 'movement' will go on . And Paul believes it is a good thing that the future of the movement is open ended. He says that while he may have truly awakened the movement in 2008, it has been stirred decades ago. ""I don't think anyone knows where it is going and it is good that I don't know that,"" Paul said. He added that while the movement's future may be unknown, he feels validated by the fact that he draws large, politically diverse crowds in most places he goes. ""It verifies what I believe in, and I am convinced of, that freedom brings people together,"" Paul said. ""How we use our freedom, your personal lifestyle may be different, but freedom brings us together."" Like other presidential candidates who have sparked intense passions before him -- Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, Barry Goldwater -- Paul supporters often take what he says as gospel. Walking around a Paul campaign event is somewhat like a lesson in American political constituencies. Though Paul is a Republican with Libertarian ideals, many of his followers do not fit that mold. There are common Republicans and Democrats who find Paul engaging and of course you find Independents and Libertarians. But you also find a large group of people who identify as members of the Constitution Party, the Green Party and many with no party affiliation. He has appealed to actor Vince Vaughn -- ""his principles are based in fact and logic which is rooted in the foundation of America,"" said Vaughn -- and singer Kelly Clarkson -- ""I love Ron Paul,"" tweeted Clarkson. Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, an independent, said, ""I want somebody that will shock the status quo, and Ron Paul will do that."" As the primary season rolls on and Paul is still looking for his first contest win, the odds of a Paul presidency look bleak. Paul is also up against an RNC rule, Rule 40, that states a candidate must have received a plurality of votes in five states in order to even be considered at the convention. Paul has yet to receive a plurality in one state. If not Ron Paul, then who? Last time around, on June 12, 2008, Paul dropped out of the 2008 presidential race, leaving his supporters to find another candidate. Though Paul went on to support the Rev. Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party, his followers dispersed -- some voting for Obama, some for McCain and some not at all. Looking to the general election, Paul's supporters are skeptical of whom to vote for if Paul doesn't win the nomination. ""If tomorrow Ron Paul says, 'I changed my mind and let's go with Mitt Romney,' I will not do that,"" said David Chen, a hairstylist from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ""I really can't say right now,"" said Daniel Osoreo, a graduate student at New York University. ""It is a very difficult choice because I am very loyal to Dr. Paul."" Back near the stage, Williams and Kline are even more soaked than they were before. When asked about the political diversity in a Paul crowd -- his campaign enthusiastically estimated about 4,300 people were at the Philadelphia rally, but on the scene, it appeared the real number was about half that -- Williams says that is the point of Paul's appeal. ""We are too focused on dividing ourselves into little pockets,"" Williams said. ""We are all hyphenated Americans rather than being just Americans. We focus too much on what makes us different."" In George Washington's farewell address, the first president touched upon a trend he was observing in American politics -- the formation of political parties. He saw America dividing into factions, so he warned against it. ""The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissention, which in different ages & countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism,"" Washington said. In the eyes of his supporters, Paul is now playing that role of checking the domination by one party over another. ""I think the fire he has ignited is still going to keep burning in the hearts of people who love liberty and this country and are really tired of both sides of the political spectrum behaving in such an extreme fashion,"" Williams concluded. Even though the odds are long, the rain is hard and the nomination process is becoming a slog, Paul supporters have their candidate. They may vote for someone else if he drops out, but while Paul remains a presidential hopeful, hope will spring eternal.","Ron Paul's supporters are avid, even though his chances now are practically zero now .
Paul has yet to win a state contest and has amassed only an estimated 76 delegates .
Still, supporters believe in the principles and movement he represents ."

"(CNN) -- In Pennsylvania, Tyler Dix, a 16-year-old movie buff, is wide awake by 7 a.m. to cook breakfast for his younger siblings. Moranda Hern and Kaylei Deakin started Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs, or battle dress uniforms. In Georgia, Tucker Simmons, a 14-year old novice guitarist, prepares ice packs for his mother whenever her chronic lower back pain kicks in. In California, Kaylei Deakin, an avid 17-year old rock climber, disciplines her little sisters when they act out. Tyler, Tucker and Kaylei are three teenagers from across the country who have very different interests, but one experience that bonds them: They grew up fast -- sometimes too quickly -- to fill the shoes of mom or dad when their parent was shipped off to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the death toll from the two wars has risen over the last eight years, the fight has also affected a growing number of children left at home to cope without a parent. Whether it's raising their siblings or getting an after-school job, teens with parents in the military feel pressure to step up. ""These teens are expected to take on the responsibility the deployed parent used to take care of,"" said Mary Carolyn Voght, director of programs for Our Military Kids, a nonprofit organization that provides support to children with a deployed parent in the National Guard. ""There's usually the expectation that they will pitch in and help out more."" More than 30,000 teens between 12 and 18 have at least one parent in the National Guard deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense. When all military branches are taken into consideration, the American Psychological Association estimates about 700,000 children under the age of 18 have a parent deployed overseas for military duty. Playing mom and dad . ""This is nothing,"" said Tyler Dix modestly, describing his daily task of taking his 9-year-old sister Tayana to ballet and violin lessons and being a crying shoulder for his 13-year-old brother, Tevin, when he misses dad. ""It's a lot of responsibility, but I don't really have a choice. My dad told me I am the man of the house, and I have to act like it,"" he said. Last December, Tyler's father, Darryl Dix, was called to serve in Iraq. The family had a tearful goodbye at the Olive Garden, his father's favorite restaurant. Tyler talks to his father by phone, from once a week to several times, updating him on how the rest of the family is doing. If military teens adjust well to deployment, they can be more adaptive and resilient than their peers, said Angela Huebner, associate professor of human development at Virginia Tech. The wars have changed the military course for National Guard members, many who joined under the slogan ""one weekend a month, two weeks a year."" Guard member families say they anticipated their loved one would be gone occasionally to help with domestic disasters, but not to an international war that has lasted this long. Reserve Guard members are serving for longer periods of time -- up to 15 months -- and sometimes have multiple deployments. ""Multiple deployments have multiple effects,"" said Darrell Partee, chief of the service support division in the Georgia National Guard. ""It's not like this is a latchkey kid or a parent who is traveling on business. We may not know for a long time what kind of impact these deployments are having on our children."" Fifteen-year-old Tucker Simmons'  father was sent to Iraq in 2007 for three months, and will leave again next month. While his father was gone, he learned to fix leaky plumbing in the house. He comforted his younger sister Julia when the family cat passed away, holding her hand all the way home from the vet. Tucker says he missed hanging out with his father, joking around and playing Xbox games together. ""We chose the perspective that it's our duty to share our daddy,"" Tucker's mom Joy Simmons said. ""That feels much better than being sad all the time. But of course we miss him."" Coping without a parent . Deployment can cause a child to become depressed angry and isolated, some studies show. Last year, Department of Defense documents showed a spike in the number of military children who have undergone out-patient counseling since 9/11. Dealing with a parent's absence is no easier for teenagers, who are already confronting the growing pains of adolescence. ""All across the board, these kids are carrying an enormous burden,"" explained Patricia Barron, who runs the youth initiative programs at the nonprofit National Military Families Association. Kari McLevy of Jacksonville, Florida, recalled going through trouble after her mother, a single parent, was deployed to Iraq in 2007 for a year. Kari, 16 at the time, and her younger sister were sent to live with a family friend. Kari became reclusive and confused. It didn't help that the media was blitzed with images of war. Just a few months after her mother left, she was arrested for shoplifting. ""I pretty much realized I had to stop being a child,"" said Kari, who has graduated from high school. When her mother was at war, she got a job at a deli, saving up money to get her own apartment and attend community college. ""I can't just rely on my parents and I have to learn to do it myself."" The Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs . Having a parent in the National Guard comes with its own challenges. National Guard members live civilian lives, so their families are often geographically isolated from others like them -- but the children of career military members live near and attend school with other kids whose parents may be sent overseas. High school student Kaylei Deakin of California remembered being teased when she wore her father's jacket to school after he was deployed to Afghanistan in April 2007. Jokingly, students without parents in the military asked her, ""Was your dad shot at?"" Kaylei felt alone, thinking no one could understand her, especially when her mother became depressed shortly after her father left. But Deakin said she kept busy babysitting her sisters, 8 and 3 at the time. ""I was emotional but I tried not to be in front of my sisters,"" Kaylei said. This summer, while their friends were busy deciding what to wear to the pool, Kaylei and Moranda Hern, another 17-year-old California teen with a father deployed to Afghanistan with the National Guard, created the Sisterhood of the Traveling BDUs, short for ""battle dress uniform."" They've planned a 2010 conference that will bring together 400 military girls from across the state to address the issues of being a military child. In organizing the conference, the two assumed responsibilities many college students have yet to experience: filling out tax exemption forms, developing a curriculum for participants, soliciting donations from major companies. ""If you pass by us, we don't really have a normal teenage conversation,"" said Moranda in a high-pitched bubbly voice. She's been working on the project the entire summer. ""We sound like 35-year-old businessmen.""","Children of parents deployed to wars overseas assume adult responsibilities .

"(CNN) -- There's a reason the city of Portland looks so inviting on the hit IFC show ""Portlandia."" ""We film only during the summer so it appears particularly sunny and bright, though I will tell you it is not that way always,"" co-creator and co-star of the show Carrie Brownstein told CNN. ""It's a pretty special place and there is such fondness for me for the city."" The city seems to love Brownstein and her creative partner Fred Armisen right back, as evidenced by an award they received from one of the travel boards in Oregon. After all, they have helped draw plenty of fans with their quirky sketch comedy series, which returns for its third season Friday. Brownstein recently spoke with CNN about the changes fans can expect this season, her dream guest stars and ""the hipster method of acting."" CNN: How will season three of ""Portlandia"" be different? Carrie Brownstein: First and foremost when we were going into season three we were thinking about other shows and what drew us to those shows and kept us coming back. We realized that it was character and developing some type of relationship with a character. We realized that we had only introduced characters in the first two seasons, but hadn't really explored who they were or that much about their lives or their relationship to the city. We really started focusing on the characters in the third season so there will be a deeper exploration of the people on the show. I think that definitely makes for a richer and more intriguing season. It feels like a more fully actualized show to me now. CNN: Since the series has been so character-driven, have there ever been any characters that you tried but had to abandon? Brownstein: There have been plenty of one-off characters that haven't worked out, but I couldn't even name them now 'cause they are done. Any character that we have had a fondness for or feel like we can explore are the ones that come back. CNN: Is it at all challenging having a show tied so closely to a specific locale? It's as if Portland is its own character in the show. Brownstein: I agree. We've intentionally made Portland a character on the show. I like the notion of place in any narrative. People's relationship to where they live, and the idea of an internal landscape that people possess has always been fascinating to me whether it's in fiction, song writing or in television. I love how ""The Wire"" and Baltimore are so intrinsically tied. I think that in terms of the narrative landscape, really having place be distinct helps define shows. So it's not a challenge. I actually think it really grounds the show and provides a reality that we can spring off of. Soundcheck: Brownstein and her Wild Flag band members . CNN: The show has been very successful in luring a variety of stars to appear in cameo roles (several celebs including Jack White, Edward James Olmos, Selma Blair, Gus Van Sant and Sarah McLachlan have had bit parts). Who are your dream folks that you haven't had on the show yet who you would love to see appear? Brownstein: A couple years in a row we've tried to get Cate Blanchett, which is crazy. Werner Herzog, the director, we have tried to get on the show. There is always this pie in the sky list, but each and every time I feel happier and luckier with the guest stars that we do get, so I would consider them dream casting as well. At the beginning of the year you think you are going to end up with every Oscar-winning actor or actress and that's not usually the case. CNN: Why Cate Blanchett? Brownstein: She's just so enigmatic. When I think of the film ""I'm Not There"" where she plays Bob Dylan, she just has this kind of boldness about her and she's very interesting. We always kind of want her for a slightly malevolent type of role. She's just a great actress, and we would love to work with her. CNN: I've always wanted to see Quentin Tarantino on the show. Brownstein: You know, we asked him to be on the show. A lot of times people want to do it, but it's scheduling issues and such. People are very gracious in declining. CNN: How long do you envision ""Portlandia"" going on, because fans would like for it to be on forever. Brownstein: Ha! You say that now, but I don't think it's true. I feel like shows have a time and place. I'd like to think of it as coming to existence, hopefully being something that people are drawn to and feel a connection to and then kind of leaving before we wear out our welcome. Ideally I think five seasons would be the perfect amount of time ""Portlandia"" should exist in the world. That's not to be self-defeating; it just feels like we can tell a story and get to the places we want to get to in terms of writing in that amount of time. But you never know whether we are getting another [season] or not, so maybe it will be three. CNN: You and Fred [Armisen] recently voiced the characters of Terrance and Emily, a couple from the Pacific Northwest who settle in Springfield on ""The Simpsons."" Do you feel like you guys are kind of locked into the hipster method of acting? Brownstein: Hopefully not. I'm not even sure what that is, but I like your description of it that way. I just think that ""The Simpsons"" had that episode percolating for awhile, but I don't think we are limited to just that. There was certainly some crossover between ""The Simpsons"" and ""Portlandia"" that seemed natural.","""Portlandia' returns for its third season on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Not so long ago, TV shows like ""Firefly,"" ""Wonderfalls,"" ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" and ""Dollhouse"" were mourned by science fiction fans as having been canceled before their time, due -- as it always is -- to low ratings. Another thing each had in common: They aired on Fox on Friday nights. So observers of the TV world were surprised Thursday to learn of the network's renewal of the series ""Fringe"" for a full fourth season after two months in a Friday timeslot. Adding to the surprise: It was picked up in March, much earlier than many other shows with ""on the bubble"" status -- an equal chance of cancellation or renewal -- would traditionally find out their fates. (One week earlier, NBC renewed two of its ""on the bubble"" series with a passionate fanbase: ""Community"" and ""Parks and Recreation."") Fans and many TV critics feared that the show's cancellation was imminent when it was moved from a Thursday slot to Friday. Despite encouraging words from Fox, fans rallied support for the show on social media, and star Joshua Jackson even got involved, reminding the ""Fringe"" faithful not to rest on their laurels. The show's ratings started out on par with what they were on Thursday but then started to drop, eventually hitting a series low six days before it was renewed, which begs the question: Did fan support and other factors count for more than the show's raw viewership? Fox's news release announcing the pick-up of the show, about a war between an alternate universe and our own, certainly gave the fans plenty of credit. ""The series' ingenious producers, amazingly talented cast and crew, as well as some of the most passionate and loyal fans on the planet, made this fourth-season pickup possible,"" said the network's entertainment president, Kevin Reilly. ""Ultimately, I think Fox is making a decision not based purely on ratings but based on (fan) commitment and dedication,"" said Jovana Grbic, editor and creative director of ScriptPhD.com, who is contributing a chapter to an upcoming book examining the science behind the series. ""This is an unprecedented level of support for a show with a small but dedicated fanbase, something that sci-fi in particular has had a very difficult time attaining on network television."" Dennis Acevedo, creator of FringeTelevision.com, attributes it to DVR viewing, especially considering its current timeslot. ""It consistently ranks as one of the highest shows in DVR viewing,"" he said. ""And people who like it really like it."" Acevedo quoted a recent interview on TheDailyBeast.com in which Executive Producer Joel Wyman said, ""Not everybody likes licorice, but people who like licorice really like licorice. We're happy being that."" But is being ""licorice"" really all it takes to make a show successful today? "" 'Fringe's' ratings looked very decent for a Friday,"" said Robert Seidman, who follows TV viewership very closely as co-founder of TVBytheNumbers.com and found the renewal's timing ""a little odd."" ""The ratings that matter most are ones nobody sees, the 'C3' rating that measure commercial viewing live plus three days of DVR viewing,"" he said. ""All that DVR viewing is great for Fox's PR department, but it doesn't add much extra advertising revenue."" Indeed, the anonymous Twitter user who claims to work for Fox, known as the Masked Scheduler, recently tweeted about an improvement in ""Fringe's"" ratings the night after its renewal: ""Supporting shows by viewing live helps more than u know."" Another possible factor: Science fiction shows typically bring in audiences with higher household incomes. ""Seeing that kind of data was what got me interested in doing the website to begin with,"" Seidman said. ""However, that data does not flow freely at all."" So, despite the advent of DVRs and full episodes streaming online, have there been any other major changes since the days of ""Firefly"" that would add more weight to the passion of a show's fanbase? ""There are now more people watching cable instead of broadcast. The broadcast ratings are lower now than they were when 'Firefly' was on,"" Seidman said, meaning that some shows do, in fact, stay on the air with ratings that might have gotten them canceled in years past. As for whether fan efforts can consistently make the difference between cancellation and renewal -- in the way it seemed for shows like ""Chuck"" and ""Jericho"" in the past -- Seidman said, ""It can't hurt, but I'm not really sold on that. I am sold to some degree: Fans' passion about a show does register with the networks. But I don't think that's enough to save a show if the ratings aren't any good."" No matter the reason, fans understand just how fortunate they are to have the show last this long. ""As a sci-fi fan, expert and writer, the renewal and network backing pleases me because it sends a message to writers and developers of future science fiction television that there is a place for intricate, intelligent shows with a multilayered plot on network television, that the risks are worth taking, and that networks are beginning to recognize the value of the niche as a fan base,"" Grbic said. ""I think Fringe is just a really unique situation. It's been this experimental show at Fox since the beginning,"" Acevedo said. ""And so far, it's gotten through everything thrown at it.""","Sci-fi series ""Fringe"" was renewed early for a full fourth season on Thursday .
Recent move to Friday worried fans and some TV critics alike .
Fan devotion alone usually isn't enough to keep shows on air but doesn't hurt ."
"(CNN) -- Twenty-one U.N. peacekeepers being held by rebels in Syria were taken from an area near the Golan Heights for their own safety due to fighting there, Syrian opposition coalition President Moaz al-Khatib said Thursday. Al-Khatib told CNN's Christiane Amanpour he wants the Red Cross to pick them up. ""There was a U.N. convoy at risk"" in an area under bombardment for seven days when the rebels took the peacekeepers Wednesday, al-Khatib said. The rebels are ""ready to release them on the condition that the Red Cross come and receive them from the border,"" al-Khatib said. Injured civilians, including women and children, should also be rescued by the Red Cross, he added. The 21 peacekeepers are Filipino, the Philippine government said earlier Thursday. ""The apprehension and illegal detention of the Filipino peacekeepers are gross violations of international law,"" Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario said in a statement. The peacekeepers are reportedly unharmed, and negotiations are under way to secure their safe release, the Philippine government said. The Department of Foreign Affairs said it is coordinating efforts with the United Nations' peacekeeping agency. A spokesman with the U.N. peacekeeping department said the agency was still waiting Thursday for the release of its forces. The mission has spoken with the peacekeepers over the phone and confirmed they are unharmed, the spokesman said. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters Thursday that decisions on withdrawing peacekeepers from the Golan Heights rest with the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force. ""The security conditions on the ground are not easy and we have said so in recent days,"" Nesirky said. ""It's for the commander of UNDOF to be able to assess the security situation with regard to the mission and patrols they carry out."" A video posted on the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights' YouTube website shows six of the peacekeepers sitting in a room. CNN couldn't immediately verify the authenticity of the video. In it, one peacekeeper gives a statement to the camera: . ""We are here safe in this place. We are here because while we are passing through position (unintelligible) to Jamlah, there were bombing and artillery fires. This is why we stopped and, civilian people tell us, for our safety, and distributed us in different places to keep us safe. And they give us good accommodation and give us food to eat and water to drink."" The rebels have said the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. The rebels said they suspected the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy -- the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations said the peacekeepers were on a ""regular supply mission."" Two other videos that rebels posted on YouTube present the rebels' point of view. In one, a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until al-Assad's forces withdraw from the village of al-Jamlah. The other video shows rebels walking near several U.N. trucks. ""This U.N. force entered Jamlah village to assist the regime ... and (the U.N. is) claiming that they are here just to stop the clashing,"" a rebel says. Members of the U.N. Security Council condemned the detention of the peacekeepers. An Israeli official said Israel, which controls the Golan Heights, would not intervene in the situation. ""It's happening in Syria. We are following it very closely,"" the official said."" We can't and won't interfere in the events on the other side of the border. We have offered UNDOF (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force) any kind of assistance they might require and we hope this ends quickly with no harm to anyone."" Earlier this week, al-Khatib posted on the rebels' Facebook page a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States. ""What is happening (is a) genocide for the Syrian people with the world watching and listening (and) will lead to the gravest consequences,"" he wrote. ""The blood of the people of Syria will be a curse on the whole world if there"" is ""no effective action,"" it said. There has been ""hardly a Syrian village spared from the regime bombing,"" the letter said. ""This might be the last message to you,"" it warns. ""I call on you all to bear your international responsibilities before God and the people.""

"(CNN) -- It is a Sunday night in Bridgetown, Barbados. Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing -- cricket. On this night, locals gather at historic Kensington Oval, which hosted the 2007 World Cup final. There are no national teams on display this time, but there is a local trophy up for grabs. It's enough to draw a large crowd of boisterous fans. In the concourse, a familiar face makes his way through the crowd. He is Franklyn Stephenson, and he is the best to have never played for the West Indies, all because of one decision he and his teammates made 30 years ago. It left each of them -- forever -- branded a rebel. In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world. Team captain Clive Lloyd, from Guyana, had led them to back-to-back World Cup victories in 1975 and '79. Contact 'Branded a rebel' presenter Don Riddell on Facebook . Overflowing with talent, the islands of the West Indies could have fielded at least two teams of world-class players. But with all the hype and success, money did not follow. Playing international and club cricket was not enough to earn a living. At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid. Its government's policies had split life into different classifications for whites and so-called non-whites. Such oppression against the non-white population intensified into violence, landing young protesters like Nelson Mandela in jail. Thousands more were arrested or killed. As the world tried to pressure South Africa's leadership, sanctions were applied, and sport was no exception. In 1970, the International Cricket Council banned South Africa from international competition, leaving the country's cricket-mad fans deprived of the sport they loved, and their cricketers of the careers they dreamed of. ""You're always optimistic,"" said former South African cricketer Clive Rice. ""The stupidity that existed would change and South Africa would change much quicker, and we'd be back playing international sport. But it hung on and hung on."" 'Rebel tours' To save cricket in South Africa, the sport's administrators knew something had to be done. So, in secret, they began planning ""rebel tours"" -- inviting various teams from around the world. It was a bold move to defy the ICC's ban by offering lucrative contracts. In March 1982, the first rebel team from England arrived in Johannesburg. ""From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world,"" said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers. ""We wanted to show them off to the world so they would see it the same as we saw it."" Later that year, a team from Sri Lanka followed. And it wasn't long before many began suspecting South Africa was also targeting a team from the West Indies, the dominant force in world cricket. ""You heard a lot of whispers around the place that perhaps these guys were going to South Africa,"" recalled broadcaster Tony Cozier. ""But at that time, we couldn't believe that they could assemble a team of West Indies players given the whole background to the anti-apartheid movement."" Many big-name West Indies stars were outspoken in their refusal to play in apartheid South Africa. Captain Clive Lloyd said no amount of money could get him there. Future captain Viv Richards called it ""blood money."" But other players were tempted. The offers from South Africa were more than they would likely see in their lifetimes -- estimated to be between $100,000 and $150,000 per player. It was enough to draw in names like batsmen Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran, fast bowler Sylvester Clarke and wicketkeeper David Murray -- one of the best in the game. Also agreeing to take part was Collis King, hero of the 1979 World Cup. ""I made the decision because I wasn't getting treated right as far as the West Indies (team) was concerned,"" said King. ""And I said to myself, 'Well, cricket is my job. You're not picking me, I'll go play cricket someplace where people will see proper cricket.' And that's why I went."" More than just cricket . Rising star Stephenson was only 23 in 1983, with a promising career in front of him. He had repeatedly turned down offers to play in South Africa. But the day the team left, Stephenson had a change of heart. ""I knew the tour was more important than being just cricket,"" Stephenson said. ""I believe that cricket can make a difference, and I'm going to be a part of that team."" On the plane, Stephenson recalled, some of the players began having second thoughts. But it was too late -- they were on their way to South Africa, to face apartheid head on. ""When we got to South Africa, I realized that separation, and it wasn't only black and white,"" he said. ""It's the language that you speak, the area that you live in, and it's what you're allowed to do, and where you can go. So the divisions were very real when we got there."" Unsure of how they'd be received by the country's mainly white fanbase, the West Indies rebels prepared for their first Test match. But their worries soon proved unfounded -- in droves, crowds came out to see the famous cricketers. ""We packed them in,"" said Murray. ""We turned out 20,000 in Pretoria, the heart of apartheid."" As the tour went on, the players began to believe something more important than just cricket was taking place. Young kids -- white kids -- were begging them for autographs. It seemed South African fans couldn't get enough of the black cricketers from the West Indies. ""For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites,"" said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa. ""Here was a country in which no black man had ever seen a black person in competition with a white person, and beating them. To me, that was where the real victory was."" 'Destroyed as cricketers' But critics of the tour disagree. They say the presence of a team of black men in South Africa did not help end apartheid, but instead strengthened and supported it. Even within the country itself, non-whites protested the West Indies rebels. Back home in the Caribbean, the reaction was worse. A deep sense of betrayal cut through the Caribbean. Cricketers who were once viewed as heroes were now seen as sellouts. When the month-long tour was over, the rebel players knew they would have to face the repercussions of their decision back home. ""I felt sorry for them,"" said Gilkes, ""because I knew that they would never outlive what they were returning to."" The fate of their cricketing careers rested with the West Indies Cricket Board of Control. The players were aware they might face a ban -- after all, England's rebel team had been banned for three years; Sri Lanka's was banned for 25 years. But they did not expect to be banned for life. ""Many of them were destroyed as cricketers,"" said University of West Indies Professor Hilary Beckles. ""Their cricket careers came to an end."" Murray, once a star, is now drifting, unable to hold a job in Barbados. In the years after the tour, he eventually lost more than just his career. His wife gave birth to their baby daughter in Australia, while Murray was playing in South Africa. They faced being deported from Australia for his role in the rebel tours, and were unwelcome back in the Caribbean, too. They had a newborn, and nowhere to go. ""They didn't want me to return,"" Murray said. ""Politics got into it."" When asked if his current situation resulted from his decision to go, Murray answered: ""Most likely."" Mercenaries? For Stephenson, the once-rising star, his cricketing past is behind him. He is now a golf instructor at a country club in Barbados. But he still finds a way to connect to the sport he loved at the cricket and golf academy he started near his home. There, a photo of his rebel team sits proudly on the shelf. It is not the memories of the tour he wants to forget, but what came after. ""Nobody looked out for us,"" Stephenson said. For the players, their lives defined by this single moment in sport history, each day is a reminder of what they lost by going to South Africa. But they gained something, too -- strong bonds forged on a tour condemned by the rest of their world, cherished by the participants. And to this day, they hold strongly to the belief that being in South Africa in 1983 made a difference in disbanding apartheid, less than a decade after the West Indies players were there. Gilkes wrote a seven-part series about the tour. In the last article, he stated the trip might have started with the players being viewed as mercenaries, but he saw them as missionaries ""who converted white South Africans to accepting that blacks were their equals."" ""I know I went there as a missionary,"" King said. Murray agreed. ""I don't see the mercenary part of it or whatever. We were just professional cricketers. You've got work to do."" ""What do mercenaries do?"" Stephenson asked. ""They go and fight somebody else's cause. ""Well, yes I was a mercenary for black people's cause, because wherever I've been, I've been an ambassador for my country, my race and the game of cricket. So if that's being a mercenary, then yes I was.""","West Indian cricketers shunned after touring apartheid-era South Africa .

"Washington (CNN) -- Predictions of super PAC-fueled campaign ugliness seemed to come to reality on Thursday when reports broke of a potential conservative group's ad campaign aimed at tying President Barack Obama to a controversy many thought put to rest nearly four years ago. But conservative billionaire Joe Ricketts decided against a recommendation from GOP strategists that would bring up once again Obama's association with the controversial Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a super PAC director said. Wright, who once ran the church that Obama attended in Chicago, became a central figure in the 2008 election when videos emerged showing some of the pastor's provocative statements involving race relations in the United States. Obama was eventually forced to distance himself from Wright to help spare his political image. The proposal to bring Wright back into campaign dialogue, a plan first reported by the New York Times, quickly became the story of the day. After hours of backlash from both Republicans and Democrats, Ricketts, commissioner of the ad campaign and founder of the brokerage firm TD Ameritrade -- and whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team -- said the plan was merely one of several proposals his group was considering. Brian Baker, who heads the conservative super PAC supported by Ricketts, said Ricketts would not approve the scheme, as it ""reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects."" ""Mr. Ricketts intends to work hard to help elect a president this fall who shares his commitment to economic responsibility, but his efforts are and will continue to be focused entirely on questions of fiscal policy, not attacks that seek to divide us socially or culturally,"" Baker said in a written statement. If the super PAC, Ending Spending Action Fund, had taken up the plan, it would have attempted to link the president with Wright's philosophy, the Times reported. Titled ""The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,"" the ad campaign was to play off racial undertones and called for what the proposal described as an ""extremely literate conservative African-American"" as its spokesman, according to the Times. The spokesman would make the case that Obama misleadingly portrayed himself in 2008 as a ""metrosexual, black Abe Lincoln."" The campaign would ""do exactly what (Sen.) John McCain would not let us do,"" the Times reported the strategists writing. When McCain ran against Obama in 2008, the Republican nominee famously refrained from pursuing the Wright angle and called out supporters at campaign events who mocked Obama's middle name, ""Hussein."" On Thursday, McCain's former campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, told CNN he was ""never prouder"" to work for McCain than when the senator refused to go after Obama over Wright's comments. ""It wasn't useful. It would have backfired. And more importantly it's wrong,"" Schmidt said. CNN contributor Roland Martin agreed, saying Thursday such an attack would open up a can of worms for Republicans. ""If the GOP, if they want to do that, then guess what, you're now putting Mormonism on the table,"" he said, referring to Mitt Romney's Mormon faith -- a factor that has largely remained on the sidelines of this year's election. The presumptive GOP nominee's campaign also came out against such attacks when asked to respond to the report. Team Romney argued the economy should remain the primary issue in the race. ""Unlike the Obama campaign, Gov. Romney is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy, and we encourage everyone else to do the same,"" Romney's campaign manager Matt Rhoades said in a written statement. In a press conference later Thursday, Romney said he ""repudiates"" any efforts of ""character assassination,"" arguing Obama's campaign has already attempted to take on such tactics. Hitting back, Team Obama blasted Romney's camp for not releasing a stronger statement about the proposed ad campaign. ""Once again, Governor Romney has fallen short of the standard that John McCain set, reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party,"" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in a written statement. White House spokesman Jay Carney later pointed to comments, not only from Democrats but also Republicans, suggesting that ""to launch a multimillion-dollar divisive attack campaign is not what the American people want, and I think there are moments when you have to stand up and say that is not the right way to go."" Thursday's super PAC dust-up calls to mind some of the more nasty campaign tactics used in the Republican primaries earlier this year and poses the question of just how involved outside groups will be in stoking the already-heated fight between the Romney and Obama camps. A relatively new addition the political game, super PACs were made possible by a 2010 Supreme Court case, known as Citizens United, that ruled in favor of allowing corporations and unions to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as they do not coordinate with the campaigns they support. This cycle, super PACs have quickly become one of the defining markers of 2012, as the groups have played a pivotal role in doing the so-called dirty work for campaigns. Groups supporting Romney and former presidential candidate Newt Gingrich especially made waves in the Republican primaries and caucuses. The pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future released a flood of scathing attack ads against Gingrich ahead of the Florida primary in late January, less than two weeks after the former House speaker won the South Carolina primary. Gingrich blamed the super PAC blitz and the Romney campaign ads for his eventual loss in the Sunshine State. The pro-Gingrich group, however, had performed its own share of heavy-hitting when it produced a 30-minute special about Romney's history at Bain Capital. Paul Sracic, chairman of the political science department at Youngstown State University in Ohio, wrote in a CNN op-ed this week that while most commentary about Citizens United has been focused on conservative groups, Democrats will also reap benefits from the gorge of spending. ""Citizens United also freed up unions to spend unlimited amounts of their money to directly advocate for the election of labor-friendly candidates, usually Democrats,"" Sracic wrote. He added: ""Whereas conservative leaning groups have so far mainly used their money to fund campaign advertising, the AFL-CIO and other unions have made it clear that their money will be spent on grass-roots get-out-the-vote activities."" Indeed, Obama's campaign also realized it could benefit from super PAC money, despite the president's vocal opposition to the 2010 Supreme Court decision. The campaign made headlines when it announced in February that it would begin encouraging donors to give to Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Obama's re-election bid. ""This decision was not made overnight,"" one campaign official said. "" The money raised and spent by Republican super PACs is very telling. We will not unilaterally disarm."" Priorities USA has reported spending $2.1 million this cycle, according to Federal Election Commission reports, and co-purchased an ad buy last week on a negative spot tying Romney to big oil. While the presidential candidates themselves have been relatively quiet about the role of super PACs this year, former candidate McCain has railed hard against outside spending. Calling Citizens United the ""worst decision in the last 50 years,"" McCain said the Supreme Court ""basically unleashed -- without transparency and without accountability -- huge amounts of money from these so-called 'independent campaigns.'"" And earlier this year on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" McCain said, ""Now it's the system under which we operate, which leads to this kind of campaigning and will lead to corruption and scandals. I guarantee it."" CNN's Jim Acosta, John Helton, Ashley Killough and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Conservative billionaire Joe Ricketts nixes a controversial ad campaign .

"London (CNN) -- Former London mayor Ken Livingstone paid tribute to his ""friend and comrade"" Hugo Chavez, calling him the first Venezuelan president to ""put his people before the interests of American oil companies."" Chavez, who died Tuesday, used some of Venezuela's vast oil wealth to bankroll huge social programs for the poor during his 14-year presidency. Critics, on the other hand, say much of the country's oil riches were squandered by a corrupt administration more focused on consolidating political power than lifting people out of poverty. Livingstone, nicknamed ""Red Ken"" for his socialist leanings, struck a controversial deal in 2007 with Chavez to fuel London's buses with discounted Venezuelan fuel, in exchange for advice on how to develop Venezuela's urban infrastructure. While Livingstone used the £14 million ($21m) fuel discount to subsidize buses for the poor in London, his critics say the deal exploited and further impoverished the poor people of Venezuela. His successor, Boris Johnson, promptly cancelled the deal upon taking office in 2008. Livingstone dismissed criticism of the deal, saying the advice he and his associates gave Venezuela would have cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" from the private sector, and insisting Chavez only ever had the interests of Venezuelans in mind. ""It's very few world leaders who remain unchanged,"" Livingstone told CNN. ""And it's hard to think of anyone who has been in power that long who's carried on looking after the ordinary population rather than enriching themselves."" The former mayor first met Chavez during the Venezuelan leader's 2006 visit to London and said Chavez's offer of discounted oil for advice was characteristic of a man who saw himself as more than just the president of Venezuela. He said: ""Chavez saw clearly that his job was to look out for the people of Venezuela, but he also saw that it was a global struggle between the great corporations and the vast mass of the people who get screwed by them."" Livingstone, who would end up travelling to Caracas in 2008 to deliver the advice he promised as part of the oil deal, was taken aback by the ""proper welfare state"" Chavez had created through his initiatives. ""I found it amazing the number of 40-year-olds wandering around with braces on their teeth, because there hadn't been a dentist when they were a kid,"" he said. ""There were little old ladies carrying around copies of the constitution which they could read, because [under Chavez] everyone got access to literacy programs."" Calling him a ""pleasure to be with,"" Livingstone said Chavez told him he never planned on being a politician - and that Chavez only became more radical following the failed 2002 coup attempt, which he blamed on the U.S. The coup fell apart within 48 hours and ""El Comandante,"" as he is affectionately known in Venezuela, was restored to office. Livingstone, who called Chavez a man with great tales, says the South American leader's ""best story"" was his version of events during the coup. Livingstone said Chavez told him that the generals who sprung the coup didn't want to kill the president themselves, so Chavez claimed three Americans whom he did not identify were flown in to kill him instead. ""Chavez told me that the three Americans were ushered into the room where a sergeant with a machine gun was guarding him. And the sergeant, who wasn't stupid, realized that after they killed Chavez they'd kill him as a witness. And so he turned his gun on the three men and said 'you leave the room or I'll kill you',"" Livingstone told CNN. A State Department official categorically denied Chavez's ""ridiculous"" claim and told CNN the U.S. had in fact alerted Chavez to a ""credible assassination plot"" on his life in the days before the coup. Souring U.S.-Venezuela relations reached their nadir when Chavez called George W. Bush ""the devil"" in a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly. WATCH: Chavez calls Bush ""the devil"" at U.N. ""Coming so close to death [in 2002] really pushed Chavez to the left,"" Livingstone said. ""If you think George W. Bush has authorized your assassination, you're not going to be very friendly about the U.S. after that.""","Livingstone calls Chavez's death a ""sad loss,"" calls him a ""friend and comrade""

"Cairo (CNN) -- Throngs of people crowded into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday in an effort to inject new life into Egypt's revolution and push the country's ruling military council to prosecute the former president, Hosni Mubarak, who stepped down under immense popular pressure on February 11. Compared with previous weeks, the protesters' ranks swelled, in part due to the addition of Egypt's long-banned Muslim Brotherhood movement, which had chosen not to participate in recent Friday protests. There was another addition to the protest movement, one that marked a direct challenge to Egypt's military rulers. Fifteen Egyptian soldiers and mid-level army officers joined the demonstration, flouting a ban issued Thursday by a military spokesman. Several of the military personnel took to one of the stages erected in the crowded square and called for the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to be dissolved and replaced by a civilian presidential council. The Supreme Council assumed legislative and executive authority over Egypt after Mubarak resigned. The military personnel remained in the square into the evening. An army lieutenant colonel and a military police officer late Friday tried to walk to the center of square, but they were surrounded by demonstrators who chanted ""get out, get out."" Within moments, members of the crowd began pushing the officers and knocking their hats off their heads. The officers, apparently frightened, started running and were pursued out of the square. Earlier this week, several military officers took to the internet, recording video statements accusing the chairman of the ruling council, Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi, of protecting Mubarak from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement. ""If they really wanted to prosecute these corrupt officials they would have done it immediately. That's why we are here today,"" one of the protesting officers, told CNN. On Thursday, Supreme Council spokesman Maj. Mohamed Askar told CNN that any military personnel who appeared in Tahrir Square in uniform would be immediately arrested and taken before a military tribunal. On Friday, activists in Tahrir Square encircled the 15 protesting officers and soldiers as they walked through the crowd, protecting them from arrest or possible attacks. One of the officers spoke on stage to the crowd, acknowledging he risked arrest but urging demonstrators to repeat the tactics of January and February by staging an overnight sit-in in Tahrir Square. Egypt's interim government has investigated and arrested a growing number of officials from the former Mubarak regime in recent days. A former housing minister and Mubarak's long-time chief of staff, Zacharia Azmi, were both placed under arrest this week on corruption charges. ""All of these ministers you see, its nothing!"" said Talat Sadat, a former parliament member and critic of Mubarak. ""The revolution wants the president himself! Wants his wife, his son, his daughter!"" Mubarak has been living on his estate at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh since he stepped down from office. The Egyptian military rode a wave of popularity after troops refused to fire on pro-democracy protesters during 18 days of street protests. But in the weeks since, the secretive 20-man council has come under increasing criticism from different portions of the Egyptian political spectrum, amid complaints of human rights abuses and lack of transparency in its decision-making process. Last week, more than 10,000 demonstrators peacefully protested in Tahrir Square, many of them heaping criticism on the ruling military council. But this week the numbers were boosted by Egypt's long-banned Muslim Brotherhood movement. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is joining the protest to support the demands of all the Egyptians who started this revolution, because we want to finish what we began,"" Dr. Jamal Nassar, a senior official in the Brotherhood, said Thursday. ""We want the army to speed up the trials of all those involved in corruption from the Mubarak regime.""","NEW: Two Egyptian officers are forced to leave the square, a witness says .

"(CNN) -- Amid all the jockeying of the primary debates, President Barack Obama's 2013 budget was a breath of fresh air that underscored the priorities we should have as a nation. Sure, politicos may call it a campaign document, but even if you view it as only that, it is a much needed reminder of just what we should be focusing on. For Latinos, there is plenty in this budget, especially coming on the heels of the president's State of the Union speech a couple of weeks ago, to remind us that there is still reason to be hopeful. Obama's call for greater income equality on taxes, his focus on job creation, including focusing on key elements of his American Jobs Act (supported by 78% of Latinos), his renewed call for DREAM Act legislation in the State of the Union, and yes, his commitment to environmental and public health protections, as well as for the expansion of a clean energy economy. While not a ""typical"" Latino statement, the plan to create more clean energy jobs and more responsible energy development is just what the doctor ordered, as far as they are concerned. Although it is down in the latest jobs numbers, Latino unemployment continues to hover near 11%, and with many of the Latino community's job losses stemming from the slowdown in the housing market, they need this boost now. Interestingly enough, even just a few years ago, environmental issues did not register with Latinos as top concerns for their families. That has changed. Majorities of Latinos support strong environmental protections, especially since many communities happen to be in historically unsafe and polluted environs. So the president's statement -- ""We don't have to choose between our environment and our economy"" -- which is reflected in his budget, really hits home for Latinos. And that's not what we've been hearing in the news these days. We hear an unrepentant tirade from GOP pundits that regulations are nothing but ""job killers."" But Obama is telling us they save lives and create jobs? Well, that not only happens to be the case, but GOP pundits also conveniently disregard the fact that there were fewer regulations put in place in the first three years of the Obama administration than in the first three years of the George W. Bush presidency. But let's look at the facts that underscore why Latinos care about this issue. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are already at work in clean energy jobs. More than 100,000 people already work in the solar industry, according to the National Solar Jobs Census. Installing solar panels cannot be outsourced and fits the bill for many construction workers struggling to get by, and is a tremendous opportunity for many Latino entrepreneurs, who already have a strong foothold in the construction industry. The president has also spoken of jobs that Latinos might get on farms -- wind farms, that is - thanks to the growth of wind power, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says now employs 85,000 Americans. More than 150,000 jobs are already out there in the clean car industry â€” for workers making parts and assembling hybrid and electric cars. And the shift to more advanced vehicles means more opportunity in the coming years. We keep hearing about these ""job killing regulations,"" but for millions of Americans and especially minority and low income communities, clean air protections are ""life-saving regulations."" This is another big reason environmental issues are registering on the minds of many Latino families, especially Latina mothers, a key swing vote group in the upcoming elections. Low income communities overwhelmingly suffer the worst impacts of pollution nationally. Cleaning up our communities means protecting our health and creating jobs (after all, someone needs to build and install the equipment necessary to protect us from polluters). Clean air safeguards generated approximately $1.3 trillion in public health and environmental benefits in 2010 alone for a cost of $50 billion. For Latino families, who often lack health insurance even if they are employed full time, these savings can make the difference between home ownership and foreclosure. So as you listen to the politicians shouting at each other in Washington, they are drawing a very bright line and letting you know what really matters to them. Ask yourself, ""Who has my and my family's best interests in mind?"" The folks looking out for public health or the folks representing polluters who don't want to invest in America, or in their employees â€” not to mention the facilities that are now finally being forced to live up to the law? The folks who see opportunities to bring manufacturing back to America as we shift to cleaner energy or those working to keep things just the way they are â€” no matter the price? The answer is pretty clear. And that is what we need right now. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- It may not have been a great game until after the lights went out and came back up, but the Super Bowl showdown Sunday night created quite a few memorable moments on the field and off, even before kickoff. There were powerful performances, including a much buzzed-about halftime show by superstar Beyonce. But there was also a lack of electricity in the stadium and in some of the commercials. And San Francisco 49ers fans are sure to get emotional over that last play they ran on offense, when two players met in the end zone and, despite interference, the referee did not call a penalty. Here are the five moments you can expect your coworkers to talk about Monday morning. Grrrl Power . The men may have duked it out during the game, but when it came to the non-football entertainment at the Superdome, women ruled the day. First up was Jennifer Hudson with a stirring rendition of ""America the Beautiful."" The choir backing her was composed of students from Sandy Hook Elementary, the Connecticut school where 20 students and six school staff were shot dead in December. Players on the sidelines and fans in the stands wiped away tears. ""Our wish is to demonstrate to America and the world that 'We are Sandy Hook and We Choose Love,'"" the choir said in a statement. Next, Alicia Keys belted out the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" as the children, in white polo shirts with green ribbons pinned to them, stood with their hands on their hearts. ""It's football. But I just cried,"" tweeted actor Brian Baumgartner about the Sandy Hook performance. The big show, however, came once the 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens got through the first half. Welcome, Beyonce. For 12 minutes, she rocked the stage clad in above-the-knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress. Powered by an all-female backing band, there was little doubt Beyonce sang live -- unlike during President Barack Obama's inauguration last month where she admitted singing along with a prerecorded track. And as if that wasn't enough girl power for the night, Beyonce was joined by her Destiny's Child bandmates, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. ""Watching the #SuperBowl with family & friends. @Beyonce was phenomenal! I am so proud of her! -mo,"" tweeted none other than the first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. She wasn't the only one. Beyonce's performance generated 5.5 million tweets! Lack of power . For the first two quarters, the Ravens seemed unstoppable, steamrolling the 49ers and building a 28-6 lead. But then, half the lights in the Superdome went black. Monitoring equipment sensed an abnormality in the building's electrical system and cut power to some sectors to isolate the issue. Power utility Entergy said the problem was a ""customer issue."" The NFL released a statement saying it was ""investigating."" The power company said it was not to blame and that electricity in the rest of the city was fine. The outage left players, coaches and fans to wait, wait and wait some more. Social media lit up. After 35 minutes, when the lights slowly went back on, so did San Francisco -- prompting many to wonder if the break in play played to the 49ers advantage. Running back Frank Gore felt differently. ""You have to wait. Football is a game of adjustments. The elements don't matter,"" he told NFL.com. ""I've been saying it all year, the elements don't matter in football. You've just got to learn how to make adjustments."" The real MVP? Quarterbacks often get the glory in the Super Bowl, but wide receiver Jacoby Jones had a strong case for Most Valuable Player. He lost out to Joe Flacco. Jones scored on two of the most incredible plays in Super Bowl history, including a record 108-yard kickoff return. It took him just 11 seconds on the clock to slice through the 49ers coverage team. ""Jacoby's been a blessing to this team,"" said Ravens coach John Harbaugh. ""We're grateful to have him on this team."" Jones, who grew up in New Orleans, also caught a 56-yard touchdown pass -- his only reception. He fell, got up, decked a defender and sprinted at an angle toward the goal line, beating two 49ers into the end zone. ""Everybody dreams of scoring a touchdown in the Super Bowl. But two of 'em? That's what's up!"" Jones told NOLA.com. ""It was always a goal to win a Super Bowl. To come home and do it, that's the icing on the cake."" Jones is definitely the MVP for some Baltimoreans who bought furniture this weekend at a Baltimore store. The Baltimore Sun reported Gardiners Furniture promised to wipe out the charges for anything purchased on Saturday or Sunday if the Ravens returned a kick for a touchdown to start a half. Probably seemed like a good bet at the time. Grading the ads . Some of the Super Bowl commercials -- 30 second ads that cost upward of $4 million -- made us weep for different reasons. There were quite a few that played on our sentiment, from Budweiser's ""Brotherhood"" to Jeep's Oprah-narrated ""America Will Be Whole Again"" to Dodge's ode, ""Farmer."" Then there was the racy GoDaddy ad that made us want to cry, burn our eyes out and have the Men in Black wipe out our memories. In it, model Bar Refaeli shares a long kiss with a red-cheeked ""nerd"" that prompted its own hashtag: #NoDaddy. ""Oh my gosh those kissing noises,"" tweeted Chicago college student Grace Barnes. A no-call to rue . Niners fans will tell you they were robbed of a possible win when referees failed to call a penalty. In the final quarter, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick attempted a pass to the Niners' Michael Crabtree in the end zone. What happened next depends on who's doing the talking. Niners' fans will say Smith deliberately interfered with Crabtree, making it impossible to catch the ball. Ravens' fans will say it doesn't matter, the ball was too high for Crabtree to catch. Niners' fans will say a penalty call should have given the team a first down and a great chance to take the lead with less than two minutes left in the game. Ravens' fans will say the ball was uncatchable -- that it sailed way over Crabtree's head. But if you ask New England wide receiver Donte Stallworth, there should have been a penalty flag, even if the ball seemed like it was too high to catch. ""For all y'all saying that ball was uncatchable for Crabtree in the endzone... DUH!! Because dude held thee sh*t outta him..."" he tweeted. Crabtree told Yahoo Sports it was ""a missed call."" ""I don't want to talk about it,"" he said. ""I don't want to think about it."" That's OK, the 49ers fans will likely do it for him. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","The game came down to a controversial play in the end zone .

"(CNN) -- The recent closure of 32 privately owned radio stations and a proposed law to punish ""media crimes"" are signs that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is moving to quash criticism of his government, according to a recent U.S. intelligence report. A group of pro-Hugo Chavez rioters beats Venezuelan journalists in downtown Caracas on August 13. Chavez's government is ""moving forcefully to silence critics,"" said the unclassified U.S. analysis prepared by the Open Source Center, a U.S. government office that translates and analyzes reports from foreign news organizations. The relationship between privately owned media in Venezuela and the leftist Chavez has never been rosy. Chavez has accused private television stations of supporting his brief ouster in 2002, and the president was a driving force behind denying a license renewal in 2007 to one broadcaster he said cooperated with the opposition. But the decisions this month by the Chavez government to close 32 radio stations and two television broadcasters and to support legislation that would create prison sentences for people who commit ""media crimes"" have created a new level of scrutiny from outside Venezuela. ""The media crimes bill is the most blatant example of the government's steady encroachment on media freedom in an effort to establish a media monopoly and stifle freedom of expression,"" said the unclassified intelligence report, dated August 3. The Venezuelan government denies that the media crimes law and the closure of the radio stations are related and maintains that each initiative was grounded in Venezuelan law. ""As usual, much disinformation has shaped the debate surrounding these developments,"" the Venezuelan Embassy said in a fact sheet about the developments. At the same time Chavez was extolling these two measures, supporters of his government attacked the Globovision television studio, one of few remaining networks that gives a voice to the opposition. In the August 3 attack, more than 30 members of a pro-government party threw tear gas at the studio and injured three people. The leader of the attack, ardent Chavez supporter Lina Ron, was arrested. Chavez condemned the incident, but last week, people alleged to be among his supporters attacked a group of journalists who were passing out leaflets in the street. The leaflets that journalists from the private media conglomerate Cadena Capriles were passing out criticized an education bill that they said would hamper press freedom. According to local news reports, a group of assailants threw the journalists to the ground and kicked them, sending 12 to the hospital. The intelligence report coincides with numerous critical statements against Chavez by press freedom organizations. ""The harassment (of journalists) is a permanent condition,"" Carlos Lauria, Americas program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told CNN. The shuttering of the radio and television stations and media crimes law are part of a larger strategy that Chavez has followed since he was briefly deposed in a coup in 2002, he said. Chavez's goal can be described as a three-point strategy, Lauria said: to control the flow of information, stop critical reports and disseminate pro-government propaganda. Much of the pro-government propaganda comes through Chavez's use of state-owned media outlets, critics say. The media crimes law in particular was an escalation from previous measures aimed at the press, Lauria said. Chavez has used the media as a scapegoat, the intelligence analysis said, but ""he may be willing to give this up in order to clamp down on the negative news reporting and commentary, which have been hammering away at the country's economic problems and Chavez's increasing authoritarianism for the past year."" The media crimes law met resistance from the National Assembly and was tabled for the time being because of opposition to it. Chavez's government defended the draft of the bill, as well as the recent closure of the broadcasters, as being within the law. The radio stations that were ordered off the air were all violating the law, either by operating with expired broadcasting concessions, failure to renew such licenses or illegally holding a concession, the Venezuelan government's fact sheet said. According to the document, ""neither the regularization of the situation of radio and television (stations) that have been operating outside the law in Venezuela, nor the development of a law to clearly regulate subsequent imposition of liabilities in the case of serious media abuses are measures that limit freedom of speech in Venezuela."" Chavez's intervention with the press is also worrisome because of Chavez's influence over other leaders in the region, including the leaders of Ecuador, Bolivia and Nicaragua, CNN was told by Robert Rivard, chairman of the Inter-American Press Association's Committee on Freedom of the Press and Information. ""Freedom of expression in general, for everyone, is under attack in these countries,"" Rivard said. ""They all have a deep, abiding distrust of journalists and freedom of the press."" Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa was only days behind Chavez in seeking to close radio stations for technical infractions, Rivard said. Chavez ""has clearly been alienated by a free press and has seen it as a threat and a target,"" he said. Not only journalism advocacy groups have been vocal against Chavez. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization this month released a statement expressing concern about the closure of the radio stations. ""There can be no freedom of expression, or even democracy, in the absence of media pluralism,"" UNESCO Secretary-General Koichiro Matsuura said in a statement. The divisions over the media measures run deep, both locally and internationally, but on a trip this week to Ecuador, Chavez continued to pitch his plans to other leaders. He has faced strong opposition before, and he has weathered it.","32 radio stations closed; law proposed to punish ""media crimes""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's a historic event taking place on an international stage that's been seven years and $40 billion in the making. The National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, is shrouded in smog on opening day of the 2008 Olympics. Opening ceremonies last week of the 2008 Olympic Summer Games were lauded as the most spectacular in history, with pyrotechnics blasting from the top of Beijing, China's National Stadium and a synchronized fireworks display firing off across the capital. What has been mostly absent from Beijing, however, are protests. Although a unified China is the image that country's government is eager to portray, many human rights groups allege that China has orchestrated a massive cover-up. Beyond human rights, questions remain about whether China has kept its promises to the world to improve in two other major areas of reform: freedom of the press and pollution cleanup. Human rights . ""In the run up to the Olympics, it seems that Chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of 'stability' and 'harmony' ... that they have really come down quite hard on human right's activists and lawyers,"" said Sam Zarifi, Asia-Pacific director for Amnesty International. In its report ""The People's Republic of China: The Olympics Countdown -- Broken Promises,"" Amnesty International details what it calls a systematic persecution of dissident voices in Beijing and throughout China. ""The Chinese authorities have used the Olympics and the cleanup before the Olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re-education through labor,"" Zarifi said. ""What that really means is that they're punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson ... and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the Chinese government have instead been rounded up."" The Amnesty report cites other human rights violations leading up to the Olympics. Amnesty accuses the Chinese government of using surveillance and detention to pursue family members of activists and blocking protesters from traveling to the capital city from other areas, such as China's Sichuan province, which was devastated by an earthquake in May that claimed the lives of nearly 70,000 people. The Chinese foreign ministry criticized the Amnesy International report, saying it had a biased attitude toward China. Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao was quoted by China Daily in a news briefing saying, ""We hope [Amnesty International] can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see China in an objective way."" Beijing secured the Olympics in 2001 amid some controversy, with a tacit acknowledgment of concerns over its record on human rights, press freedom and environmental pollution. Even the day before the host city was announced, Wang Wei, then secretary general of the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee, said China was committed to change. ""We are confident that the games coming to China not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions, including education, health and human rights,"" Wang said. ""We will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to China."" Press freedom . However, it was quite a different story for reporters as they arrived at the Olympic press center in Beijing. They discovered that many Web sites had been blocked, such as those with information about Tiananmen Square protests, Tibet, Taiwan or the Dalai Lama. Internet sites are severely regulated throughout China, and limited access to some of the sites was granted only after reporters complained to the IOC. The same official who assured the international media of ""complete freedom"" in 2001 took a somewhat different tone last week. ""Yes, we promised to provide free access to the Internet, except for a few [Web sites] that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people,"" said Wang, who is now the executive vice president of Beijing's Olympic organizing committee. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Wang said, ""As in any other country, there are some kinds of limitations ... however, I think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games."" Critics of China's policy on a free press said the problems run much deeper than the lack of access to some Web sites from the Olympic Village. ""China's political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable ... this goes for the Chinese people and the foreign journalists,"" said Xiao Qiang, director of the China Internet Project at the University of California, Berkeley. ""[China] is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself, the Chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened."" Foreign journalists in China for the Olympics complain that access to report on anything that extends beyond sporting events has been severely limited. Xiao points to the recent beating and detention of two Japanese journalists who were investigating an alleged terrorist attack in northwestern China as a sign of a government that is not used to a free press. ""They also feel since they got the Olympics, the world is coming anyway by this point, they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior,"" Xiao said. Chinese officials later apologized for the beating incident. Pollution . A third major commitment by China in its Olympic bid was to clean up pollution in Beijing. Although government readings on pollution have gone down in the years since China won the bid, they still routinely far exceed World Health Organization guidelines. And at least one American-based environmental consultant believes that China has purposely manipulated its own pollution statistics to give a false impression that more progress has been made. ""Beijing's public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign,"" said Steven Q. Andrews, author of a scientific report on China's air quality and two opinion-editorials on the topic for the Asian edition of The Wall Street Journal. Andrews cites the closure of two air quality monitoring stations in heavily trafficked areas of Beijing in 2006 as the reason why the number of ""Blue Sky days"" increased in the past two years. The Blue Sky program was instituted by the governments in major cities across China as a system to measure acceptable levels of pollution. The criteria for a ""Blue Sky day"" are still below what many industrialized countries consider good air quality. When the program was launched in 1998, Beijing had only 100 ""Blue Sky days,"" but last year, that figure rose to 246, a report the Chinese state media hailed as a major improvement. When asked about the allegations that air quality monitoring stations were shut down, Du Shaozhong, the deputy head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, said, ""this phenomenon does not exist,"" according to Time magazine. Chinese officials did not respond to CNN's request for an interview. Despite official assurances that the air is safe for competition, athletes and fans have expressed concern over the thick smog covering the entire city. The American Lung Association went so far as to issue a warning to those attending the games. ""Individuals traveling to the 2008 Olympic Summer Games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in Beijing ... [and] limit or avoid outdoor exercise,"" it said. Beyond highlighting the discrepancies between China's promises and actual reform, critics interviewed by CNN about all three major areas shared one common sentiment: disappointment. ""This is really a significant opportunity lost for the Chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people ... a sign of a China that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world,"" said Amnesty International's Zarifi.","China has spent $40 billion, seven years planning for 2008 Olympic Games .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN)  -- A Yemeni freighter has become the latest commercial vessel to be attacked in the pirate-plagued Gulf of Aden, a Kenyan maritime official said Tuesday. A French frigate shadows a commercial ship leaving Djibouti harbor on its way to the Gulf of Aden. The last contact with the ship was late last week, and it was unclear exactly when the hijacking took place, said Andrew Mwangura, the head of Kenya Seafarers Association. No further details about the ship, its crew or cargo were immediately available, said Mwangura, whose organization keeps tabs on the welfare of sailors captured by the pirates. Dozens of ships have been attacked in the Gulf of Aden by pirates based in largely lawless Somalia in recent months. This has led to calls from commercial ship owners for a military blockade along the coast of Somalia to intercept pirate vessels heading out to sea. Peter Swift, managing director of the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, said stronger naval action -- including aerial and aviation support -- is necessary to battle rampant piracy in the region.  Watch more about the growing piracy problem » . At present, warships from a number of countries patrol an international maritime corridor, escorting some merchant ships and responding to distress calls in the area. But the navies involved say it is virtually impossible to patrol the vast sea around the gulf. Meanwhile, a spokesman for pirates holding a Saudi supertanker loaded with crude oil has told the BBC they have not set any ransom figure. He said the group has only spoken to intermediaries of the vessel's owners but he described them as untrustworthy. The pirate identified himself using only one name, Daybad, when he spoke late Monday to the BBC. Pirates seized the Sirius Star on November 15 in their most audacious hijacking to date. The vessel is carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $100 million. Elsewhere, the head of U.S. military operations in Africa has said he does not have any evidence that Somali pirates are connected to al Qaeda. The Africom chief, Army Gen. William ""Kip"" Ward, told The Associated Press Tuesday that the chaos off Somalia's high seas is a reflection of the country's political chaos. Asked about alleged connections between pirates and al Qaeda, he said: ""I think that's a concern that we all would have."" But he added that he doesn't have ""any evidence that pirates have links to al Qaeda.""","Last contact with the Yemeni freighter was late last week .

"(CNN) -- There was no Zlatan Ibrahimovic, there was no David Beckham and for a while, it appeared that there might not have been any more Champions League football in the French capital. But Paris Saint-Germain, without the suspended Ibrahimovic and benched Beckham, booked its place in the quarterfinals for the first time since 1995 following a 1-1 draw with Valencia. The result, which sends PSG through to the last eight 3-2 on aggregate courtesy of its win in Spain three weeks ago, had been in some doubt following Jonas' fine strike. Beckham shows he can still cut it . Valencia had looked finished in the first leg, trailing 2-0 before a last minute effort enabled it to cling on to the possibility of producing an unlikely comeback. That outcome appeared possible soon after the interval when Jonas lashed home a powerful effort to stun the home crowd. With Valencia needing just one more goal to progress, PSG began to awake from its slumber with the introduction of striker Kevin Gameiro. And it was the substitute who made the difference, running through the Valencia defense before the ball found its way into the path of Ezequiel Lavezzi, who slotted home his fifth goal of this year's competition. PSG has invested heavily in the transfer market in recent seasons, spending a reported $260 million bringing in the likes of Javier Pastore, defender Thiago Silva, striker Ibrahimovic and Lucas Moura along with several others. The arrivals of Lavezzi, Marco Verratti and the highly publicized acquisition of David Beckham has bolstered the PSG brand, which is heavily backed by a subsidiary of the government of Qatar. And with his team top of Ligue 1 by two points and through to the next stage of Europe's elite competition, it looks like money well spent by manager Carlo Ancelotti. Beckham to donate PSG wages to children's charity . ""We deserved our qualification over the two legs,"" he told reporters. ""We didn't play in a relaxed manner in the first half, but paradoxically it was after Valencia scored that we started to play and cause them problems."" Valencia coach Ernesto Valverde was left disappointed with the result but admitted that he could not criticize his players for their performance. ""It was a hard-fought game,"" he said. ""We wanted to score the first goal and make them nervous, but in the end it wasn't to be. ""I am satisfied with the way the team played, even if I'm not happy to be out."" Juventus leaves Celtic's Champions League dream in tatters . In the night's other game, Juventus cruised past Celtic 2-0 to complete a comfortable 5-0 aggregate win. Alessandro Matri and Fabio Quagliarella were both on target as Juventus secured its place in the last eight for the first time since 2006. Messi's left foot -- yours for $5.25 million . Celtic, which had beaten Barcelona in the Group Stage of the competition, rarely threatened and was comprehensively outplayed over the two legs. But manager Neil Lennon refused to be downcast, instead preferring to concentrate on his side's run to the last-16. ""The support of the club is amazing and it is a privilege to manage them. It has been a fantastic experience,"" Lennon told Sky Sports. ""We have been brilliant in the league. I do not like losing. As you get older, you learn from other managers. ""Even the greatest managers lose their temper from time to team. We want to see our team perform all the time and we are under scrutiny all the time. I would rather be managing here than at other clubs. ""You do not know the circumstances of next season, I may never get to do this again. The two games against Barcelona were titanic and I will take them in the memory bank. I hope we have plenty more of those to come."" Real sinks Man Utd . Meanwhile, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and his players are facing disciplinary action from UEFA after refusing to speak to the media following the team's controversial defeat Tuesday. United, which was beaten 2-1 by Real Madrid at Old Trafford, was angered by the sending off of Nani by Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir. Ferguson did not attend the mandatory press conference following the contest, while players did not talk to media in the mixed zone.","Paris Saint-Germain through to quarterfinals of European Champions League .

"(CNN) -- The Texas prosecutor shot to death in broad daylight outside a courthouse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, according to a Dallas attorney describing herself as his friend. Colleen A. Dunbar told CNN that she spoke with Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse on January 24, and he told her he began carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse on a daily basis. Hasse was gunned down in the parking lot while going to work Thursday. Investigators on Friday were reviewing his caseload for possible clues about what led to his killing. Dunbar described Hasse, whom she had known for 31 years, as a lifelong gun owner and firearms lover. ""He told me he would use a different exit every day because he was fearful for his life,"" she told CNN. She said that Hasse offered no specifics on why he felt threatened, but only that he did. Dunbar said she had shared her conversation with Hasse with law enforcement, and that she was ""shocked"" by the killing. When told of Dunbar's statements, Chief Deputy Rodney Evans of the Kaufman County Sheriff's Department was unaware of the information. ""But,"" Evans told CNN, ""we've got 50 people here taking phone calls so somebody may know something I don't."" There were no significant advances in the case, Kaufman Police Chief Chris Aulbaugh said Friday, but that doesn't mean investigators weren't busy. ""We've fielded numerous tips coming in from the public. We are following up on every one of them,"" he said. Police say they believe one or two people committed the crime, but there are few descriptive details because they hid their faces. Police are looking for a gray or silver older model sedan in relation to the case, Aulbaugh said. Hasse was shot several times after ""a very small, very short confrontation,"" police said. Investigators are looking into whether Hasse's killing was retribution for any of the prosecutions he led. Hasse was one of 13 prosecuting attorneys in Kaufman County, each of whom handled between 380 and 390 cases. Authorities hope that an ever-growing reward for information will reveal more leads. Donors in the area have raised $64,500 to be used as reward money, and the police chief has asked for more donations. The Texas Rangers, the FBI and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined the manhunt.

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas GOP upstart Ted Cruz claimed victory Tuesday with a familiar tea party rallying cry. ""Millions of Texans and Americans are rising up to reclaim our country, to defend liberty and to restore the Constitution,"" he told supporters. Cruz claims victory in Texas runoff . A 41-year-old, first-time candidate, Cruz walloped the well-funded Republican establishment candidate, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, in Tuesday's GOP Senate primary runoff. He did so by vowing to stand by his tea party principles. ""Politicians cut deals; principled conservatives deliver,"" is the way a Cruz television ad summed up his message. Democratic Senate leaders reacted to Cruz's primary win with a warning: If he wins the general election in November, gridlock in the Senate will be even worse than it is now. ""Anyone elected to the Senate who starts off by saying 'I won't compromise' isn't going to help us,"" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told CNN. The tea party movement is a good foil for Democrats, but the reality is Cruz's vote probably wouldn't make that much difference, because he's replacing Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, and she votes with the GOP 90 percent of the time. Still, Democrats do have a point that Cruz, like any senator, would have a lot of power to grind business to a halt. ""You know what the Senate is like,"" said Durbin. ""One senator stands up and says no, we stop the train, until we figure out how to bring that senator around."" And Cruz wouldn't be the only possible new senator willing to do that. In Indiana, Richard Mourdock beat veteran Republican incumbent Sen. Richard Lugar, vowing confrontation over compromise. Lugar's loss further polarizes Senate . ""What I've said is, and what I continue to believe, certainly, is one side or the other must prevail. And I'm hoping this candidacy will help move the Republican Party forward to become a permanent majority,"" Mourdock said the day before his GOP primary win in May. The Senate was already bound to be a more polarized place next year because so many moderates chose to leave. Nearly half a dozen from both parties are retiring this year, including Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine; Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska; Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota and Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia. Snowe retirement a blow to Senate's 'sensible center' Still, it's an open question whether tea party rhetoric on the campaign trail translates into action in office. Ron Bonjean was a Senate Republican leadership aide for years, and he said history shows leaders can never be sure what rank and file firebrands like Cruz will do. ""Ted Cruz is going to be a new voice, and he's going to be a variable that we don't know what to expect (from) yet,"" said Bonjean. ""He can hold everything up if he wants to or he can go against the Senate Republican leadership."" Two years ago, a handful of successful tea party-backed Senate candidates promised to hold their own leadership's feet to the fire to slash spending, shrink the government and protect civil liberties. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah; Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; and others beat party favorites by vowing to shake up the Republican establishment once in Washington. But once they became senators, uncompromising demands were rare. Last year, Paul sounded off against his GOP leadership and held up Senate passage of a bill extending parts of the Patriot Act. But, by and large, the so-called tea party threat of halting business to make a point didn't often bear itself out. ""If you look at conservatives across the board, in the past year or so, there hasn't been a whole sea change that we thought would happen,"" said Bonjean. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, is a sort of tea party kingmaker. Much to the chagrin of his party leadership, in 2010 he helped defeat GOP candidates across the country that Republican leaders supported. That streak continues this year with Cruz. DeMint told CNN the political action committee he started and still advises gave Cruz $2 million in addition to critical help with the conservative grassroots. DeMint argues the more tea party movement-backed senators, the less gridlock. ""(When) Ted Cruz comes in ... I think he can help empower some of the Democrats to make those hard decisions,"" DeMint told CNN. The South Carolina lawmaker believes the more staunch conservatives in the Senate, the more Democrats will be forced to compromise and come the GOP's way. ""I think there are enough Democrats, if we have a strong mandate election, who will work with people like Ted Cruz and (Sen.) Marco Rubio and (Sen.) Pat Toomey and these senators here, in a sensible way to change the course of our country,"" said DeMint. ""The good news is this: because the rest of the world is in such bad shape, if we make a few hard decisions about fixing our tax code, fixing our entitlements so that we're on a sustainable course, America could be the best place to do business overnight."" One thing is clear: if the GOP succeeds in winning back control of the Senate, expectations will be a lot higher and pressure on the Republican leadership will be a lot more intense not to give in on the ""stick-to-our principles"" sensibilities driving voters towards tea party-backed candidates like Cruz. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is the man in charge of electing enough Republicans to the Senate to take the majority. In a Capitol hallway conversation, even he nodded and smiled in agreement with the notion that it's a lot easier to coordinate and control the caucus when you're in the majority. It's a problem he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, the current Senate minority leader, relish having.","Tea party favorite Ted Cruz won the Texas GOP Senate primary runoff Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a unique way to engage with their fans via social media -- but for Germany's most successful soccer club it turned into the ultimate public relations own goal. Bayern Munich, who can boast 22 German league titles and have four times been crowned champions of Europe, revealed they would be unveiling a ""spectacular"" new signing on Thursday -- a snippet of news to excite any fan. But when the announcement was made, on their official Facebook page, it turned out to be a new marketing tool that displayed users of the social networking site as the new signing. The gimmick immediately led to a backlash from angry supporters, who bombarded the club's Facebook page with over 5,000 largely negative comments -- forcing Bayern into a hasty retreat, complete with an apology. According to one sports PR expert, Bayern's concept was clever, but their execution undoubtedly missed the target. ""The idea of enticing people online is a nice one but the fundamental problem is you don't do that so they end up feeling disappointed,"" Jason Madeley, founder of communications agency Hatch PR, told CNN. ""What Bayern have failed to understand is the passion football fans have for their team and their excitement about getting a new striker. ""They feel like they've been taken for a fool and what you can't do with fans is take them for a fool, you need to respect them as integral to the club and that brand. They've not thought it through very well."" Within hours of their 'announcement' Bayern had posted the following statement on their Facebook page: ""Sorry dear fans, as we see from your numerous comments, you are very upset about today's action. ""It was not our intention to disappoint you with the new app. Rather, we wanted to provide you with this action and thus show how important each fan is for Bayern Munich."" Most of Europe's top clubs have a Twitter account and a Facebook page, and are slowly grappling with how best to utilize them to interact with fans and grow their brand. But though Bayern's brainwave is novel and they can certainly claim to have got their message out to the masses -- it appears like they have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Madeley added: ""We all say you've got to be part of the conversation; with fans it is so important to have an equal understanding of their views so you're part of that conversation."" So what is the expert's view on the best way for Bayern to extricate themselves from this public relations mess?

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney spent the presidential primary campaign trying to convince conservatives of his right-wing credibility on immigration issues. He labeled rivals Newt Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry as soft on illegal immigrants for suggesting some leniency for specific categories, such as students or long-time community members. He rejected the DREAM Act that would provide a pathway to citizenship for some young illegal immigrants. He called part of Arizona's controversial immigration law a model for the rest of the country. Now Romney's stance of a few months back is under scrutiny as the certain Republican presidential nominee seeks support from the mainstream electorate, including the increasingly significant Hispanic population. President Barack Obama's recent move to halt deportations of some DREAM Act-eligible immigrants and Monday's Supreme Court ruling against key provisions of the Arizona law brought fresh attention to immigration issues, causing obvious discomfort in the Romney camp. Analysis: Five things we learned from Supreme Court ruling . The situation requires a delicate political dance, and so far, the former Massachusetts governor has appeared determined to sit this one out as much as possible. At a campaign event Tuesday, Romney touched on the topic by faulting Obama for failing to enact comprehensive immigration reform, which he said created a ""muddle"" that Arizona tried to address with its own law. Romney said Monday that he supported state-based solutions, noting the Supreme Court ruling in the Arizona case went in the other direction, and he promised broad immigration reform if elected president. However, he provided no details, leaving his surrogates to struggle with interviewers pushing for specifics on Romney's immigration policies. Mitch McConnell, the normally tough-talking Senate Republican leader from Kentucky, sounded subdued Tuesday when asked by reporters about his stance on the Obama administration's halt in some deportations. ""Discussions are underway both inside the Republican conference and with the (Romney) campaign about that issue,"" McConnell replied, adding that Obama's move had put the topic on the ""front burner."" He then turned the microphone over to a GOP colleague. The day before, Romney spokesman Rick Gorka repeatedly stuck to noncommittal responses when grilled for several minutes about the candidate's stance on a controversial provision in the Arizona law requiring police to check the immigration status of crime suspects. Such equivocation concerns Republicans seeking more leadership from Romney on an issue that resonates with Latino voters. ""I'm getting increasingly frustrated as a Republican Hispanic not seeing him engage,"" said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. Obama's failure to deliver on immigration reform in his first term leaves the president vulnerable, Navarro argued Monday night on CNN, but only if ""Romney puts on the gloves and engages."" Immigration reform: Back to square one . ""For some reason, he's been unwilling to do so,"" Navarro continued, noting Romney ""dug himself into a hole during the primaries. He's got to proactively dig himself out of that hole. Telling us that Obama is bad is not enough. He's got to tell us that he's good and what his plan is."" Republican Rep. Ben Quayle of Arizona also advised Romney to be more aggressive, saying the candidate should challenge the Obama administration's failure to fully enforce existing immigration laws by halting some deportations and other steps. ""Gov. Romney should be up and talking about this and really hammering it home, saying, 'Look, we're a nation of laws, we need to enforce our laws, and we can't let the president go around Congress and disregard how our legislative process is supposed to work,' "" Quayle told Fox News on Monday night. To Democrats, Romney painted himself into a corner by embracing conservative immigration policies in the primaries to court the political right wing. ""He cannot hug and kiss the tea party and then try to hug and kiss the Latino community,"" former White House adviser Van Jones told CNN Monday night. ""That's why he's hiding."" The Arizona case illustrated the differences between the candidates, Jones said. ""What Alabama was to black folks in the last century, Arizona has now become"" for Hispanics, said Jones, who is African-American. ""This president is clear. He does not agree with the direction of Arizona. Where is Mitt Romney? Mitt Romney is being a profile in cowardice. And he's losing Latinos now on both sides of the aisle over his cowardice."" Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, cited the stark differences between Obama's immigration move versus conservative ideology that opposes any leniency for illegal immigrants. ""The Republicans can't win by attacking this policy because they're attacking people who are innocent of any crime -- just being with their parents,"" Schiller said last week about the administration's halt in deporting some young immigrants who came to America as children and were good students or served in the military. ""How can you support a policy that would break up families? You can't."" Obama, meanwhile, took a ""major, major step toward cementing the bond between the Latino community and the Democratic Party in an active way"" by stopping the deportations, according to Schiller. ""This could be the single act by Obama that brings Latinos to the polls in record numbers in 2012,"" she said. Navarro, however, said an Obama victory in November would not automatically mean further immigration reforms. ""Obama's going to come in, if he wins a second term, as a lame-duck president from day one into a Congress that is now a poisoned well"" because of his unilateral move to halt some deportations, she said. ""We have got one candidate, Barack Obama, who makes big promises, talks real pretty, and then doesn't deliver,"" Navarro added. ""And then we have got another candidate who talks without saying anything and really not making any specific promises. So for Latinos, it's not much of a choice.""

"(CNN) -- When I was a boy, my father used to take me by the hand to visit the ruins of the ancient metropolis on the outskirts of our town. We would always stop by to visit the huge winged bulls that guarded the gates of the ancient city of Nineveh. I was scared of the winged bulls, but at the same time, they excited me. Through them and the site, I learned the stories of the civilization that lived along the Tigris River in what was now Northern Iraq. Many decades later, I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3-D laser scanning system and cloud of points software. The systems we developed were extremely fast and could rapidly collect millions of points with very high accuracy and very high resolution. A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day. These new systems would produce something like 10,000 points a second. As you can imagine, this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction businesses, as well as in the reality capture industry. TED.com: Experiments that hint of longer lives . In 2001, Cyra Technologies was acquired by Leica Geosystems. Right around that time, a terrible tragedy happened: The magnificent 160-foot-tall Buddhas in the Bamiyan Valley in Afghanistan were blown up by the Taliban. They were gone in an instant. Unfortunately, there was no detailed record of the site. This devastated me, and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls, and the fate of heritage sites all over the world. My wife and I decided to start a project to digitally preserve world heritage sites. We called the project CyArk, which stands for Cyber Archive. CyArk is now an international nonprofit organization. With the help of a global network of partners, we've completed more than 50 projects to date, including Chichen Itza, Rapa Nui, Babylon, Rosslyn Chapel, Pompeii and Mount Rushmore. CyArk uses 3-D digital documentation, archiving and the dissemination of the data to tell the story of the sites and engage the public. We are losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them. Natural phenomena take their toll, but it has become clear that human causes are a significant part of the reason for their destruction. TED.com: How algorithms shape our world . We're fighting a losing battle. Not only are we losing the sites, we're losing a significant piece of our collective memory. Imagine the human race not knowing where we came from. Because of the accelerated pace of destruction, we created a project we call the CyArk 500 Challenge -- to digitally preserve 500 world heritage sites in five years. To me, the 500 is really just the first 500. To sustain our work, we take the technology to local universities and colleges. They then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites, and at the same time, they get the benefit of learning a technology they can use in the future. Two years ago, we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site, a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda, the Royal Kasubi Tombs. The work was done successfully in the field, and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the CyArk website. Last March, we received very sad news. The Royal Tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson. A few days later, we received a call: ""Is the data available, and can it be used for reconstruction?"" Our answer, of course, was yes. Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it's our collective treasure. We owe it to our children, our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Kacyra.","Ben Kacyra: World's most historic, treasured sites are always at risk of destruction .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is trying to shift into high gear, but elections experts say his campaign seems to be stuck in second. With just weeks before the nominating conventions and his national debut before a broader electorate, Romney's struggles to make the case that he is best equipped to pull the nation out of the economic doldrums could derail his quest for the presidency. Romney's biggest challenge? Turning the conversation back to the weak economy and poor job growth and away from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign's attacks on his tenure at private equity firm Bain Capital and refusal to release more tax records. Romney has stalled at this. Given the ailing economy, Romney should be faring much better, political experts say. ""One way to measure this is -- given the conditions of the country and the economy -- one would think the challenger would be ahead and he's not,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. His tax plan, the release of which was intended to offer a punctuation mark on how he'd handle the economy, was criticized by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The plan would provide large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes. It would make it tough to recoup lost government revenue, according to the Brookings study. And those campaign attack ads from Obama's campaign and those supporting it aren't helping. According to a CNN/ORC International poll of likely voters released Thursday, Romney's unfavorable rating jumped to 48% from 42% a month ago, a drop which followed a period in which the Obama campaign hammered the GOP presidential hopeful with a deluge of advertising and news stories about his time at Bain and calls for Romney to release more of his tax records, which he has refused to do. Obama now leads Romney by seven percentage points in the poll with 52% of registered voters questioned in the survey saying that they'd vote to re-elect the president and 45% backing Romney. Worse, political experts say, is the somber news for Romney that only 45% of those polled by CNN said that the economy would get better if Romney were elected -- two percentage points below Obama's number. A recent Fox news poll has Obama garnering 49% of the vote and Romney 40% if the election were held today. Obama's lead in that poll comes from an 11% lead among independent voters. In a Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times swing state poll released recently, more than 50% of voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio said they do not feel Romney ""cares about the needs and problems of people"" like themselves. More than 50% of voters polled in those two states said Obama cares about their needs and problems. ""I think the Obama campaign is outmaneuvering the Romney campaign. They've kept him on the defensive on his taxes and on Bain, which is a key foundation for his campaign,"" Gergen said. ""This rat-a-tat of advertising, this avalanche of advertising has taken a toll."" And in some cases, Romney has also been his own worst enemy, said Marc Hetherington, political science professor at Vanderbilt University. ""Romney hasn't helped himself by not putting these issues to bed with the tax situation and has allowed these issues to linger,"" Hetherington said. ""This could have been a two-day story. That's time we're spending not talking about what Romney wants to talk about, which is the economy. He's put himself in a tough box here."" Romney will have to pull out all the stops if he wants to change the narrative the Obama campaign has crafted, political experts say. ""He has to capture the agenda back and remind people, 'I'm the businessman who made a lot of money, and I can help you make lots of money,'"" Hetherington said. ""If he doesn't do that soon these ideas people have about him will harden. ""Every step Romney makes â€” including his running mate â€” has to be getting back to where Obama is weak, and that's the economy."" But there are pitfalls in Romney's choice. ""(Former Alaska Gov. Sarah) Palin is a classic example,"" said Matthew Continetti, author of ""The Persecution of Sarah Palin: How the Elite Media Tried to Bring Down a Rising Star."" ""You see a motivating force for conservatives. Palin was electrifying. The downside is, is the candidate ready to have the spotlight shined on them? Are they ready for the tough questions such as Palin with Katie Couric? Are there holes in the biography that can be filled in by myth?"" Romney's best bet to help him shore up his conservative bona fides and flagging support is to choose someone who appeals to middle-class white voters without college degrees who understands them, Continetti said. The types of voters who have been hard hit by the economic downturn live in swing states and are the target of the Obama campaign's ads on what it casts as the human costs of Romney's financial success. It's a big task. The Obama campaign has tried to define Romney before he's had a chance to do it for himself. As a result, Romney's convention speech will be more important than ever, Gergen said. ""It's going to be his first chance to introduce himself to the country in terms of values and lay out his plan for the future... He's got to do that to close up this gap,"" Gergen said. ""It's now clear that Romney can't win this election by default. It's not an apple that's going to fall into his lap because the economy is weak. He's got to take it away from (Obama)."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, CNNMoney's Charles Riley and the CNN Political Unit contributed to this report .","GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's campaign has struggled to gain traction .

"Washington (CNN) -- For one week in August, the Republican Party will have a guaranteed place on prime time TV and, it hopes, voters' undivided attention. For many watching, the Republican National Convention will provide the first glimpse of a political fight that has been brewing for more than a year, presenting the GOP with a new opportunity to argue that it's best prepared to take over after November's election. ""The convention is about unifying the party behind the presumptive nominee,"" said Matt Burns, communications director for the 2008 GOP convention and currently a managing director with global communications firm Burson-Marsteller. ""Speaking slots are often a way to heal old wounds after bruising primaries."" Burns also pointed to a speaker's prominence -- or their status as a ""rising star"" -- as another factor in determining who to put on the convention stage. The decisions on who will front the party, then, are loaded with opportunity -- but also the chance for pitfalls. ""The speakers have been chosen because they make the best possible case to elect Mitt Romney and to show the American people the various positions and diversity of the Republican Party,"" GOP strategist Ron Bonjean said. ""They're the ones that have served in the trenches in the primaries and have supported Mitt Romney."" ""The ones who are left out are the ones who took shots at him,"" Bonjean said. ""Either challenged or took shots at him, and they may not make the best case for his presidency, or they might try to overshadow him."" Not every convention speech puts the party's best foot forward. Pat Buchanan's ""Culture War"" speech at the 1992 GOP convention was met with consternation from moderates, who regarded the address -- which included opposition to gay rights and women in combat -- as unnecessarily polarizing. Bill Clinton's speech introducing 1988 Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was so long that people actually cheered when it was over. The convention -- set to begin August 27 in Tampa, Florida -- has already put together a roster of speakers that features both the party's establishment and its up-and-comers. Sen. John McCain, who accepted the party's nomination at the 2008 convention, will deliver remarks, as will former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is another well-known Republican who will have a turn at the podium. Other establishment picks, however, will sit this year out. George W. Bush said he was taking ""time off the political stage,"" and his father, George H.W. Bush, won't attend for health reasons. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who received a heart transplant earlier this year, will also not appear onstage in Tampa. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and one-time 2012 GOP presidential candidate, will hold daily policy workshops for delegates in Tampa rather than occupy a prime-time speaking spot. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum will speak in Tampa, but other Republicans who challenged Romney for this year's GOP nomination -- including Rep. Michele Bachmann and former Godfather's Pizza chief Herman Cain -- have not been announced as convention speakers. Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman and Romney supporter whose commitment to the ""birther"" movement that challenges Obama's place of birth leaves many Republicans queasy, said through a spokesman last week he would have a ""memorable"" role at the convention, but that it wouldn't include a prime time address. Sarah Palin, who delivered a warmly received convention address at the 2008 event, won't speak in Tampa either, saying, ""Everything I said at the 2008 convention about then-candidate Obama still stands today."" Julian Zelizer, a CNN contributor and professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, wrote in a CNN Opinion piece last week that the conventions ""create a forum to showcase the talent of the future on a national stage."" They also give parties the opportunity to control what that future might look like. On Tuesday, the Tampa lineup was updated to include New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the keynote slot, a high-profile role meant to rally the party behind the nominee. Then-Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, launching him onto the national political stage and into the White House four years later. ""The keynote speaker is someone that millions of Americans are going to watch, and they have to make the best possible case for Mitt Romney to be president,"" Bonjean said. ""That speaker is extremely important. The campaign is relying on Chris Christie to carry their message to the world who will be watching."" Christie told USA Today he was on the fourth draft of a speech that would include ""some very direct and hard truths"" about the state of the country -- a glimpse of a straight-talk speech that Republicans have come to expect from the straight-talking Christie. Many Republicans encouraged Christie to run for president and he was seen by many as the best bet for the No. 2 spot on Romney's ticket. ""Speakers who are known for an ability to energize the base receive more prominent roles,"" Burns said. ""Chris Christie is a good example."" Christie's famous swagger excites many Republicans, who like seeing the anger they feel toward bigger government and out-of-control debt reflected in their elected representatives. But his relatively moderate social views, which line up with the state he represents, turn off some in the GOP party base. Another chance to craft the party's image comes in the person chosen to introduce the nominee. This year that honor goes to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who will draw cheers from delegates aligned with the tea party, which helped vault Rubio past a mainstream Republican rival in 2010's Florida GOP primary and into the U.S. Senate. To put that into context, Clinton, a Democratic elder statesman, will put Obama's name into nomination at the Democratic National Convention the next week. Putting Rubio, as well as Texas U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (also tea party favorites), in prime-time speaking roles at the convention also signals the GOP's push to bring in Latino voters, who overwhelmingly went for Obama in 2008 and polls show going the same way this time around. Martinez and Rice, along with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, will also use their convention roles to try to close the gender gap that polls show persists between Obama and Romney. Ultimately, Burns said, putting together a lineup is about finding people who represent -- and can rally -- the base. ""Fundamentally, convention speaking lineups are meant to represent a cross-section of the party's faithful -- and I expect the 2012 Republican and Democratic conventions to be no exception,"" Burns said.

"(CNN) -- The African Union plans to host a delayed summit Thursday to raise funds for famine victims amid mounting criticism over the continent's weak response to the disaster. The meeting originally planned for August 9 was postponed this month even as the organization called on urgent aid to the drought-struck Horn of Africa region. ""Urgent humanitarian assistance is crucial to alleviate the impact of the drought, which has deprived people from water, sanitation, health, basic food and nutritional needs,"" the 54-nation body said in a statement announcing the delay. It did not give a reason for postponing the meeting, which will be held at its headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A drought in the Horn of Africa region straddling Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia has left nearly 12 million people in need of assistance. Somalia is especially badly hit, with a famine declared in some parts of the nation. Relief efforts in Somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between Islamist rebels and the transitional government, which holds little sway beyond Mogadishu. Aid agencies have urged the international community to ramp up help as thousands flee Somalia each week in search of food and water -- many walking for days in the sweltering sun to refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. The meeting comes as aid groups urge the continent's leaders to step up their efforts. ""The African Union has so far pledged only $500,000 for the aid effort, and most key governments have pledged even less or nothing at all,"" Oxfam said in a statement this month. Only a handful of African nations have donated to the effort, according to Oxfam.","The meeting originally planned for August 9 was postponed this month .

"(CNN)  -- Four years since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake spawned massive walls of water that swept across the Indian Ocean, leaving more than 230,000 dead according to a United Nations estimate, improvements can be seen in many of the devastated areas, humanitarian groups said. Laborers work on a construction site in a fishing village in Indonesia's Aceh on December 21. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and jobless after the tsunami, and poor and isolated communities were left even worse off. Today, new schools have been constructed, and armies of workers -- many of them volunteers -- have cleared and rebuilt homes and towns, and helped get people back to work. ""The tsunami, despite being a horrific event, also provided a lot of opportunities for those countries,"" said Jonathan Cauldwell, chief of UNICEF's Tsunami Transition Support. ""It brought a peace dividend within Banda Aceh (Indonesia) where you still see peace in an area which had long term localized conflict in place. It allowed those areas to be built up as well, to have investments in the infrastructure in the social sectors ...,"" he added. Agencies such as UNICEF said that while the immediate emergency was over, they remain committed to improving the lives of millions of children across the region. ""The lessons of the tsunami will never end. The funding will end, we can complete the construction, we can complete the project, but the intervention never ends ...,"" Cauldwell said. Oxfam International, which said it will close its response to the tsunami at the end of December, said it has provided housing to tsunami survivors in Aceh, helped restore the livelihoods of people in India and Sri Lanka, and funded the reconstruction of eight tsunami-affected secondary schools. ""The money we received allowed us not only to help meet the immediate emergency needs of tsunami-affected populations, but also to try to address the factors that made them vulnerable: not least poverty and a lack of influence over their own lives,"" Barbara Stocking, chair of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund Board, said in a statement. ""What has been achieved is astounding. Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in better conditions than they were in before the tsunami ...,"" she added. UNICEF said the basic needs of children affected by the tsunami have been met -- more children are going to school as a result of improved facilities, and better nutrition, post-natal care and other life-saving interventions are helping those countries worst hit transition to developing regular services and programs. But long-term improvement of water and sanitation is critical, the agency said, and so is building new schools that are better able to withstand earthquakes. According to UNICEF and Oxfam, the response to the tsunami and the lessons learned have changed the way they deal with such emergencies. It highlighted the need for better coordination among partners and other organizations, and contributed to reforms in the way humanitarian relief is delivered.","The devastation of the 2004 tsunami stretched across the Indian Ocean .

"(CNN) -- Separate blasts rocked the capital of Kenya on Monday, killing at least one person and injuring 20, officials said. The second explosion took place at a crowded bus station in downtown Nairobi. One person was killed and eight wounded, according to the Kenyan police and Red Cross. ""This is a time when a lot of people would have been going home from work -- more or less rush hour,"" said Robert Nagil, a journalist in Nairobi. Charles Owino, a deputy police spokesman, confirmed the explosion and said he was awaiting more details. Initial reports say the blast killed one person and wounded eight, according to Carol Nduta, a spokeswoman for the Kenyan Red Cross. The attack happened just two or three blocks from the site of a separate blast that injured 12 people at a nightclub earlier Monday. ""We have not yet linked attacks to anybody as we are still investigating,"" Owino said. The explosions came two days after the U.S. Embassy in Kenya warned it had credible information of an imminent terror attack. The embassy did not offer details on who might carry out such an attack but said it had limited official U.S. government visits and urged citizens to consider deferring travel to Kenya. The attack was likely to target places that foreigners congregate in Kenya, including malls and night clubs, the embassy said. Kenya has been on edge since it sent troops across the border into Somalia to pursue militants with Al-Shabaab, an Islamist group that the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization. Kenya sent troops into Somalia after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement. Al-Shabaab has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia. Owino, the police spokesman, said the nightclub attack ""could be Al-Shabaab or an individual.

"New York (CNN) -- This could have caused a major blast from the past. Workers cleaning a cannon, last fired more than 200 years ago, were shocked to find Friday that it was still loaded with gunpowder, wadding and a cannonball. The preservation workers from New York's Central Park Conservancy were removing rust from the antique cannon, which once fired munitions aboard the British warship HMS Hussar, when they made the explosive discovery, New York police Detective Brian Sessa said. Dena Libner, a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, said the workers found the munitions after removing a concrete plug from the mouth of the cannon. Workers immediately called 911, and technicians determined that the gunpowder was still active. Authorities removed about 1.8 pounds of black gunpowder from the scene and took it to a gun range for disposal, the detective said. Libner said the cannon was a gift from an anonymous donor to the city in 1865 and was stored for a period of time because of vandalism concerns. It is now part of the organization's restoration program, she said. ""We silenced British cannon fire in 1776, and we don't want to hear it again in Central Park,"" New York police said in a statement to CNN affiliate WCBS. The loaded artillery piece was one of two Revolutionary War-era cannons being stored at the park's Ramble shed, near the 79th Street transverse, according to the affiliate. ""This was an amazing surprise,"" John Moore, author of the upcoming book ""The Secrets of Central Park,"" told WCBS.

"(CNN) -- Brian Adkins, a newly assigned American diplomat in Ethiopia, was found dead last weekend at his home in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, an embassy spokesman and a senior State Department official told CNN. U.S. Embassy press officer Michael McClellan identified Adkins and said he was from Columbus, Ohio. He was 25 at the time of his death. ""He was found dead over the weekend and a criminal investigation is under way,"" McClellan told CNN on Thursday. ""The Ethiopian federal police are investigating it."" Adkins, who would have turned 26 on Monday, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from George Washington University, according to the school's newspaper, the GW Hatchet, which reported his death. According to the newspaper, Adkins joined the State Department after receiving his master's degree in 2007. A State Department official, who declined to be named because of the ongoing investigation, said it was the diplomat's first tour of duty as a foreign service officer. There were no apparent threats against him, and investigators were trying to determine whether he was the victim of a random crime. Adkins' father, Dan Adkins, told CNN affiliate WBNS that his family worried about him, but Adkins assured them he would be safe at a guarded compound. His sister, Tiffany Cooper, said the family was struggling. ""It is hurting us. There is no closure. We have no idea how our brother died,"" Cooper said. The GW Hatchet reported that Adkins moved to Ethiopia as part of a Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship, after studying the local language and culture for nearly a year. A GWU student and friend of Adkins described him as ""selfless, hardworking, confident, funny, charming, articulate, a scholar and a gentleman,"" according to the newspaper. ""The world has lost someone who had so much to offer. I miss him tremendously,"" senior Michael Geremia told the newspaper. ""When I received word of his death on Monday, which would have been his 26th birthday, a piece of me died in Ethiopia.""

"(CNN) -- In Eritrea, as in most of east Africa, football -- or soccer -- is a passion. But so dire is its economic and political situation that its best players, in fact the whole national team, defected in 2009 while at a tournament in Kenya. A leaked U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks uses ""the beautiful game"" to describe an ever uglier situation in this small but strategically important state in the Horn of Africa. In a dispatch from December 2009, then-Ambassador Ronald McMullen wrote: ""Many dusty streets in Asmara are filled with urchins kicking an old sock stuffed with rags back and forth between goals made of piled stones. Senior government and party officials are avid fans of the British Premier League and sometimes leave official functions early to catch key matches."" As for the missing national team, he writes: ""Only the coach and an escorting colonel reportedly returned to Eritrea. (One wonders why, given their likely fate.)"" The government denied any players had gone missing. Eritrea has only known one leader since winning independence from Ethiopia in 1993 - Isaias Afwerki. And the cables assert that his mercurial and dictatorial ways are largely to blame for the country's parlous state. In its short life, Eritrea has been involved in a ruinous border war with Ethiopia that cost thousands of lives, and is regularly accused by Western governments and the United Nations of supplying arms to Islamic militants in Somalia -- a charge raised by the ambassador with Eritrean officials. One cable quotes a leading businessman as saying Isaias is mentally ill: ""The worse things get, the more he tries to take direct control--it doesn't work."" Another cable from earlier in 2009 says bluntly: ""The country's unhinged dictator remains cruel and defiant."" ""The regime is facing mounting international pressure for years of malign behavior in the neighborhood. Human rights abuses are commonplace and most young Eritreans, along with the professional class, dream of fleeing the country, even to squalid refugee camps in Ethiopia or Sudan,"" according to another dispatch. According to the cables, the government's stock answer was to blame America ""and its puppet Ethiopia"" for all its troubles, with President Isaias at one point claiming that the CIA was trying to lure Eritrea's youth abroad. There was apparently a brief initiative to improve relations soon after President Barack Obama's election, with Ambassador McMullen describing an unusual picnic he attended at the invitation of a senior Eritrean official. ""Lunch was served in a rocky gulch beneath a thorny acacia tree. The ambassador and his wife were treated to grilled sheep innards served with honey and chili sauce (but no silverware), washed down with a sour, semi-fermented traditional drink called, aptly, ""sewa."" But Eritrea's alleged support for the Shabab militia - an affiliate of al Qaeda - didn't help matters. One cable quotes the ambassador as telling Eritrean officials: ""Eritrean support for Somali extremists obviates closer ties and Eritrea will be held accountable for any al-Shabaab attack on the United States."" ""How do you think we would react to a major al-Shabaab terrorist attack against the United States?"" the ambassador asked. ""This seems to have driven home the point to our Eritrean interlocutors."" Another cable scoffs at the idea that mining gold will come to Eritrea's rescue, describing recently-discovered seams as like ""Neapolitan ice cream, with a thin layer of gold atop thicker layers of copper and zinc."" In a country whose exports were worth just $14 million in 2008, even that might help. But the ambassador concludes: ""In short, there is no help on the immediate horizon for Eritrea's faltering economy."" One leaked cable also described tensions within the military, with a conference of colonels deteriorating into a serious row. ""The bone of contention? Perceived differences in the quality of the villas (often confiscated from the original owners) given to the colonels by the regime to maintain their allegiance,"" the cable said. However, the cables suggest President Isaias may be in power for some time to come. One from November 2009 concluded: ""Isaias is clever, very good at operational security, and two decades younger than Mugabe,"" -- the Zimbabwean president who has been in power for thirty years. ""While many in Eritrea long for change, few are in a position to effect it,"" it said. As for the Eritrean people, the cables suggest that their long fight for independence has made them resilient. ""Eritreans remain fiercely patriotic,"" it said. ""In the face of deprivation and oppression, the time-tested best practice is to shut up, hunker down, and pray for rain.""","Cable: Key government officials are avid fans of British Premier League games .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A fuel pipeline exploded in a densely populated Nairobi slum Monday morning, flattening homes, reducing some bodies to dust and forcing a massive evacuation of the area amid fears that big pools of leaked fuel could ignite, police and Kenya Red Cross officials said. At least 75 people died in the explosion and fire, said Charles Owino, a spokesman for Kenyan police. Police and Red Cross officials expected the death toll to rise. The fire erupted around 10 a.m., possibly as a group of people were siphoning fuel from the pipeline in the Sinai slum, officials said. Coming to a precise accounting of the toll may be difficult because so many of the victims were found huddled together and severely burned, said Carol Nduta, a Kenya Red Cross emergency medical instructor and dispatcher who traveled to the scene. Some of the bodies were burned to dust, she said. ""Almost the whole place blew up,"" she said. Charred bodies were strewn throughout the wreckage. Some bodies were still bobbing in a stream that passes through the settlement Monday afternoon. Red Cross officials said it would be Tuesday before they could all be recovered. Images from CNN affiliate Kenya Television Network showed flames shooting from metal-roofed buildings as firefighters and people in civilian clothing rushed to the scene and picked through the flattened remains of structures. A total of 118 people were admitted to Nairobi hospitals for treatment, police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. Authorities set up counseling centers at a stadium in the city as hospital officials made an urgent appeal for blood, saying that many of those admitted to Nairobi hospitals suffered extensive burns and would require blood transfusions to survive, state broadcaster Kenya Broadcasting Co. reported. The precise cause of the accident remained unclear. Police suspect the pipeline was punctured, possibly in an effort to steal fuel, Kiraithe said. KBC quoted Prime Minister Raila Odinga as saying the incident occurred after a mechanism on the pipeline failed, allowing fuel to spill into a drainage ditch, where it then ignited. He said the explosion was the worst energy-related disaster in the country's history. Fatalities from fuel leak accidents are common in Kenya. Scores of residents scramble to scoop up fuel whenever there is a leak or a tanker is involved in an accident. In 2009, more than 100 people died in a fire after an oil tanker overturned in Molo, in western Kenya. In that incident, someone trying to take some of the fuel lit a cigarette, starting the fire. A 2009 article in a Kenyan newspaper, The Daily Nation, discussed concerns of such a fire in the Sinai slum, where residents built shanties and even a church next to or even on top of the pipeline, according to the Daily Nation. ""I don't think there will ever be a fire, but you never know,"" the newspaper quoted one resident who it said had refused to move away from the pipeline despite eviction notices from Kenya Pipeline Company. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta pledged the government will do its best to aid victims and investigate the cause of the incident, according to KBC. ""As Kenyans we feel a collective sense of loss and grief,"" KBC quoted him as saying. ""As leaders we ought to feel a collective sense of responsibility."" CNN's Andreena Narayan, Faith Karimi, Lillian Leposo, Helena DeMoura and Kim Chakanetsa contributed to this report.","The confirmed death toll rises to 75 after a Nairobi pipeline explosion .

"(CNN) -- The 103 Chadian children whom six French charity workers were convicted of attempting to kidnap will soon be reunited with their families, the United Nations' children agency said Friday. Some of the 103 children who were nearly abducted by a French charity, pictured in Abeche in November 2007. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche, in eastern Chad, since late October. Chadian authorities arrested the Zoe's Ark aid workers as they earlier tried to leave the central African country with the children on a Paris-bound plane, the United Nations Children's Fund said. The charity had said the children were orphans from Sudan's war-torn Darfur region and were being taken to foster families in France. However, other charities determined that most of the children were from Chad, not Sudan, and had at least one living parent. Beginning next week, a UNICEF team will travel to Abeche, Adre and Tine to facilitate reuniting the 21 girls and 82 boys, aged 1 to 10, with their families. Chad's government has approved the move, UNICEF said. Interviews with the children indicated that the majority were from villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border, according to a November statement from the Red Cross, UNICEF, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The kidnapping scandal attracted international attention, with French authorities reacting angrily to the charity's trip, calling the group's actions ""illegal and irresponsible."" However, French President Nicolas Sarkozy intervened on the six's behalf after a Chadian court sentenced the six aid workers to eight years of hard labor in Chad, and the central African nation handed them over to France to serve their sentences. In late January, a French court sentenced Eric Breteau -- the group's leader -- Emilie Lelouch, Alain Peligat, Philippe van Winkelberg, Dominique Aubry and Nadia Merimi to eight years in a French prison.

"(CNN) -- Brian Adkins, a newly assigned American diplomat in Ethiopia, was found dead last weekend at his home in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, an embassy spokesman and a senior State Department official said Thursday. U.S. Embassy press officer Michael McClellan identified Adkins and said he was from Columbus, Ohio. He was 25 at the time of his death. ""He was found dead over the weekend and a criminal investigation is under way,"" McClellan said. ""The Ethiopian Federal Police are investigating it."" Adkins, who would have turned 26 on Monday, received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from George Washington University, according to the school's newspaper, the GW Hatchet. According to the paper, Adkins joined the State Department after receiving his master's degree in 2007. A State Department official, who declined to be named because of the ongoing investigation, said it was the diplomat's first tour of duty as a foreign service officer. There were no apparent threats against him, and investigators are trying to determine if he was the victim of a random crime. The GW Hatchet reported that Adkins moved to Ethiopia as part of a Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellowship, after studying the local language and culture for nearly a year. A GWU student and friend of Adkins described him as ""selfless, hardworking, confident, funny, charming, articulate, a scholar and a gentleman,"" according to the newspaper. ""The world has lost someone who had so much to offer. I miss him tremendously,"" senior Michael Geremia told The Hatchet. ""When I received word of his death on Monday, which would have been his 26th birthday, a piece of me died in Ethiopia."" As a student, Adkins was active in the Knights of Columbus and the Newman Center, which are organizations run by the Catholic church, the paper reported.

"(CNN) -- Hunger is stunting hundreds of millions of children in the developing world, and more than 90 percent of them live in Africa and Asia, UNICEF says. Poor nutrition is one of the main killers of young children, the U.N. Children's Fund says in the new report ""Tracking Progress on Child and Maternal Nutrition."" ""The report we have launched draws attention to the fact that 200 million children under the age of 5 in the developing world suffer from chronic undernutrition,"" said Werner Schultink, UNICEF's associate director of nutrition. A lack of food can impair physical, mental and social abilities, the report says, adding that proper nutrition is important for mother and child. The 1,000 days from conception until a child's second birthday are the most critical for development, according to UNICEF. Undernourished children ""will perform less well in school, they will be able to do less well as an adult and, even worse, their health situation in adult life may be negatively affected,"" Schultink said. ""They are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes."" UNICEF says nutrition supplement programs have helped deliver vitamin A and iodized salt to vulnerable children in developing countries, boosting childhood mortality. Mothers also are being urged to breast-feed their children for at least the first six months to provide key antibodies and nutrients. Reducing and eliminating malnutrition is feasible, according to the report, which calls on the international community to provide urgent help or face the consequences. ""Global commitments on food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture are part of a wider agenda that will help address the critical issues raised in this report,"" said Ann Veneman, UNICEF's executive director. ""Unless attention is paid to addressing the causes of child and maternal undernutrition today, the costs will be considerably higher tomorrow.""","Poor nutrition is one of the main killers of young children, UNICEF report says .

"(CNN) -- In television dramas like CBS' ""Criminal Minds,"" serial killers are apprehended swiftly and surely. In real murder cases -- as in the investigation and recent capture of a suspect in the so-called ""Grim Sleeper"" killings on the south side of Los Angeles, California -- it can take years, even decades, to bring a suspect to justice. Police are now saying that the arrest of 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. closes the book on at least 11 unsolved murders that occurred since 1985. Unlike most homicides, which are solved in a matter of days, if not hours, crimes committed by a prolific serial offender present a daunting challenge to investigators. There is an element of self-selection: Only those perpetrators who possess the right level of skill, street savvy or cunning can remain at large long enough to amass a large victim count and, therefore, achieve the status of serial killer. A careless wannabe would likely be stopped long before that point, and certainly before reaching double digits as did the Grim Sleeper. However, the difficulties that homicide detectives confront when searching for unidentified serial murderers are not so much about their being ""master criminals"" -- as most are not -- but about their usual offense pattern and modus operandi. Several factors common among serial murderers and their crimes work in their favor and tend to keep their identity a mystery: . 1. Serial murderers usually target strangers -- those who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and who are selected either out of sheer convenience or because they fit the killers' fantasies and murder script. Thus, the standard investigative approach used by homicide detectives of assembling a list of likely suspects (friends, neighbors, and co-workers, anyone with a reason to kill the victim) doesn't help in the least. The killer could be just about anyone with whom the victims came in contact. And when the victims live off the streets, like some of the women slain by the Grim Sleeper, the list of possible suspects can be endless. 2. Serial killers generally dispose of their victims' bodies in remote or otherwise hidden places -- a river, a wooded area, or even in large garbage bags tossed in trash bins. As a result, the police don't have an evidence-rich crime scene (where the victims were assaulted) to scour for clues. The disposal site tends to yield very little in the way of physical evidence, especially if it is exposed to the elements or wildlife. 3. Serial killers tend to be ordinary in appearance, looking above suspicion. Like the man arrested in connection with the Grim Sleeper murders, they just don't fit our stereotype of a vicious killer. People are usually incredulous when they learn the allegation of their neighbor's hidden activities. In fact, the seemingly trustworthy veneer that aids serial killers in attracting victims into their grasp also serves them well in appearing anything but suspicious. In addition, their detailed planning process often includes conjuring up a host of plausible alibis should the police come knocking at the door. 4. Serial killers, like the Grim Sleeper, tend to prefer vulnerable people as targets, especially prostitutes, drug users or other marginal types whose disappearance will not generally bring a massive police effort or strong community response. Also, those on the street who might be in a position to witness the abduction of a prostitute or drug user do not generally make for cooperative and reliable witnesses. For all of these reasons, serial killers, when eventually discovered, are often captured because of luck -- bad luck on their part and terrific luck for the rest of us. In the Grim Sleeper case, police used a discarded slice of pizza to get Franklin's DNA, which they linked to evidence at some of the crime scenes, sources told The Los Angeles Times. And sometimes, serial killers just get a bit too overconfident after years and years of eluding law enforcement and begin to see themselves as unstoppable. At that point, they frequently become careless and take unnecessary risks. Ultimately, their own arrogance becomes their downfall. Despite the challenges that serial murder cases pose for homicide investigators, there are certain strategies that can maximize the chances of solving a case, even when the trail grows cold with passing years. Although DNA evidence did not produce any direct hits to a suspect, the Los Angeles police went the extra mile by checking indirect familial DNA matches. After linking genetic material to a prisoner, circumstantial evidence led investigators to the inmate's father -- Lonnie David Franklin Jr. -- the Times reported. But often the secret to success is nothing as intricate or intriguing as the various scientific tools featured on CSI-Wherever. Rather, it entails old-fashioned approaches such as canvassing the neighborhood, interviewing witnesses and preparing detailed investigative reports. Most of all, successful serial murder investigations require skilled management of personnel and information. When the body count rises, so does the volume of leads that need to be pursued and number of officers involved in the manhunt. The key to solving a seemingly unsolvable crime often comes down to administrative efficiency, as well as to that little stroke of welcome luck. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Alan Fox.","Serial killers often elude capture for years due to nature of their crimes, says James Alan Fox .
He says they are hard to identify because they lack obvious ties to the victims .
Fox says in many cases there is no crime scene available for analysis .

"(CNN) -- The medical aid charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres, is pulling international staff out of Somalia after three of its members were killed. MSF says hundreds of thousands of Somalis need urgent aid. The group -- sometimes known as Doctors Without Borders -- said 87 non-Somali staff have been withdrawn from 14 projects across the country. ""As a mark of our respect and given the lack of clarity surrounding the circumstances of the attack, for the time being MSF has suspended all international staff presence,"" the group said in a news release. U.N. officials have described the situation as a humanitarian crisis requiring worldwide efforts. MSF said it believes the ""organized attack"" Monday -- a mine explosion along a road in Kismayo -- targeted its members. ""We find this attack against one of our teams absolutely intolerable and a serious violation of the humanitarian action to which our late colleagues were so committed,"" Dr. Christophe Fournier, international council president of MSF, said in the news release. The MSF members killed were Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor; Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician; and a Somali driver named Billan. Hassan Kafi Hared, 36, a journalist working fro the Somali National News Agency, and a fight person, so far not named, also died in the attack. Initially, four people were reported dead. The attack ""comes at a time when the country is facing a critical emergency with escalating violence, massive displacement and acute unmet medical needs,"" MSF said Friday. ""Mortality rates in several areas are far beyond emergency thresholds. Hundreds of thousands of Somalis are struggling to survive and are in urgent need of immediate assistance from the international community. They are the indirect victims of such attacks on humanitarian workers."" In recent months, Somali government troops backed by Ethiopian forces have battled Muslim militants daily, with the northern section of the capital Mogadishu hardest hit. Many of the militants are aligned with the Islamic Courts Union, which controlled much of the country before being deposed in Ethiopia's December 2006 invasion. The United States accuses the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures and did not protest Ethiopia's invasion. In a written statement earlier this week, a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said he condemned the attack and ""demands a thorough investigation by the authorities.""

UNICEF and others are supplying food and water, emergency health kits, cooking pots, water purification tablets, and student and teacher kits, the agency said. But ""it is reported that access to some camps for internally displaced persons within Sri Lanka has become restricted,"" UNICEF chief Veneman said, prompting her call for full access. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Monday vowed to erect an additional 10,000 shelters to accommodate people streaming from the combat zone. It reiterated its request for the Sri Lankan government to set aside land for the construction of emergency shelters, water and sanitation facilities and public buildings in Vavuniya, Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi. And it called on the government to improve conditions at 42 sites already hosting displaced people and to ensure they be adequately cared for. But the United Nations said its access to the sites in Vavuniya had been curtailed in recent days ""and this affects our ability to monitor and distribute aid to the displaced. We hope this ends quickly."" Suresh Bartlett, Sri Lankan director for aid agency World Vision, said, ""The conventional war may be over, but the real challenge now is to foster an environment where fractured and displaced Tamil communities can heal and have a real chance at creating a future for themselves and their children."" Among the pressing issues, he said, is getting people as quickly as possible back to their land and homes. In some cases, that will require that land be demined and buildings be repaired, he said. About 80,000 of the displaced -- a third of the people in camps -- are children, who need emotional, psychosocial and educational support in addition to physical aid, he said. Estimates put the number of civilians killed in the conflict at 70,000 to 80,000 since it began in July 1983, but Bartlett acknowledged that the true number may never be known.

"(CNN) -- Ten villages in western Niger have publicly denounced the practice of female genital mutilation, according to a UNICEF report. Representatives from the West African nation's Tillabery region have called for all people living there to end the practice, the report said. ""We have decided to definitively put an end to female genital mutilation in our villages and to continue sensitizing neighboring villages so they also give up the practice,"" said N. Babobou Pana, leader of one of the villages. Heading the call was Kompoa Tamkpa, a former traditional practitioner. ""I have given up the bad work, because it does not bring anything to our village,"" she said. ""We thought it was good for women, that it was going to bring them success. But we found out that it does not bring anything."" Female genital mutilation, which is also called female circumcision, is commonly performed on young girls without anesthesia, and is extremely painful and traumatizing, UNICEF said. The practice involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and can result in prolonged bleeding, a higher risk of HIV infection, infertility and even death. The procedures are based on religious and cultural beliefs, including efforts to prevent premarital sex and marital infidelity. ""UNICEF is extremely pleased with this public declaration to end female genital mutilation in this part of Niger, as it is seen by Nigerian authorities as a severe violation of the rights of women and young girls,"" said Akhil Iyer, a UNICEF representative in Niger. The rate of genital mutilation in Niger dropped by more than half between 1998 and 2006, from 5.8 percent to 2 percent, according to a government survey released last year. But about 66 percent of women in the west of the country are still subjected to the practice, the report said. The practice is most common in western, eastern and northeastern regions of Africa, as well as in some countries in Asia and the Middle East, and among certain immigrant communities in the United States and Europe.","10 villages in Niger, West Africa, denounce practice of female genital mutilation .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Yemen are taking on Islamic militants on the land and from the air amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. Yemeni government forces are trying to wrest the southern town of Zinjibar from Islamic militants, and an American official said U.S. military-led airstrikes have resumed and top insurgents have been killed. U.S. drone strikes had been conducted in the past in Yemen, but they had paused amid the unrest. CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, a former Bush Homeland Security adviser, said the current airstrikes are an ""indication of the strength and confidence"" President Barack Obama has in the CIA, which directs the strikes. ""I think it's a resumption,"" Townsend said of the airstrikes."" And I do think it appears to be an intensification. Some of that may be based on the threat environment and better intelligence."" Widespread tumult has engulfed Yemen for months, with thousands of demonstrators who oppose the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh urging the president's departure. In recent weeks, anti-government tribal forces have battled with troops, and last Friday, the presidential compound was attacked, injuring Saleh and other senior officials, who were taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment. A six-nation Gulf Arab alliance has tried to broker a government-opposition agreement that would lead to Saleh's departure, a move that could end the conflict. That initiative has fallen through, but efforts have re-emerged to end differences. State-run TV reported on Thursday that ""the deputy ministry of information calls upon the brethren in the opposition to arise to a level of positive thinking that will heal the wounds and restore the trust among all the players of the political process."" But Saleh long has been mired in another struggle -- the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabia Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and he has been a key ally of the United States in the fight against the militant group. ""The Yemeni government has a strong partnership with the U.S. government, especially in the field of counterterrorism,"" said a Yemeni government official who has asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Both Yemen and the United States have envisioned a nightmare scenario of AQAP taking advantage of the civil strife and exploiting the absence of Saleh and other top officials. A U.S. military official with knowledge of the Yemen campaign told CNN that U.S. military-led air operations recently resumed after a pause of some months and a top militant may have been killed. Abu Ali al-Harithi, ""described as one of the most dangerous al Qaeda commanders in Shabwa province,"" has been killed in Yemeni security operations, state-run TV reported Thursday, citing an official military source. The New York Times reported Thursday that American jets killed al-Harithi in an airstrike last Friday. The U.S. official also said the United States believes it probably killed al-Harithi in an airstrike in southern Yemen in recent days. But he cautioned its ""very difficult"" to confirm the killing. That official said the United States had paused airstrikes because it ""didn't have faith in the information available,"" to target individuals in Yemen during that time. But the official could not say what led to the improved intelligence picture. Last month, a U.S. drone strike attempted but failed to kill Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical Muslim cleric who moved to Yemen and has become a key figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That attack came after the U.S. military swooped into a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, and killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Townsend said AQAP is dangerous and the administration is rightly concerned, noting that the chaos in Yemen ""benefits our enemies and not us."" The official Yemeni source cited by state TV reported other deaths in security operations, such as ""the killing of various commanders and members of al Qaeda in Abyan province."" People killed in operations included the ""media official of the organization, Ayman Al-Masri, and the terrorist Ali Saleh Farhan, the commander of the organization in Marib province."" Meanwhile, fighting continued in Zinjibar, an Abyan province town that had been taken over by militants. The state TV report said the government had ousted militants from the town. ""The heroes of the armed forces and with the help of the noble residents managed to clear the city of Zinjibar and caused al Qaeda serious losses in lives and weaponry,"" the state-run TV report said. Earlier, a senior security official loyal to the Yemeni government told CNN that nine Islamic militants and four Yemeni soldiers were killed in clashes overnight in Zinjibar. Medical officials in Razi hospital near Zinjibar said Thursday that more than 40 people entered the hospital, all with wounds from bullets of explosives. ""Dead bodies are still in the streets of Zinjibar, but residents have evacuated the city, leaving those injured with no one to take them to the hospital,"" a medic at the hospital said. Recently, a U.S. official told CNN that AQAP is trying to position itself for greater power and influence, a sign of an evolving power struggle in the militant group since the killing of Osama bin Laden. ""They are using the death of bin Laden as a way to bolster their own image,"" the U.S. official told CNN. The source declined to be identified because of the sensitive intelligence information that has led to this assessment. There's a strong AQAP presence in Abyan, and the United States has long felt that the group is a growing threat. ""They are clearly trying to improve their capabilities,"" as they were even before bin Laden's death, the official said. He noted the death of bin Laden, coming on the heels of the growing civil unrest in Yemen, gives the group the opportunity to both bolster its image and operate more freely. ""We have seen a steady progression of al Qaeda presence in Yemen and efforts by them to organize and become more efficient,"" the official said. As for Saleh -- wounded when the mosque at the presidential compound in Sanaa was attacked during Friday prayers -- Tareq al-Shami, the ruling party spokesmen, said the president will be back in Yemen ""within days and is now in very good health."" The future of Yemen's government remains in question. ""We don't know who will emerge in power,"" said Anthony H. Cordesman, who holds the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""We don't know what kind of power vacuum will exist"" and how much it can be exploited, he said. ""We're not likely to see a stable Yemen in the near future.""

"Editor's note: Ann M. Veneman is the executive director of UNICEF and former U.S. agriculture secretary. Last week, UNICEF released its annual report on the State of the World's Children 2009. To learn more about the report, visit www.unicef.org. Ann Veneman says the lack of basic necessities makes pregnancy and childbirth fatal to millions. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Every day in the United States, thousands of women and families experience one of the most joyous occasions in their lifetime -- the birth of a child. That joy is certainly not as often the case in many parts of the world. Women in the least-developed countries are 300 times more likely to die in childbirth or from complications related to pregnancy than women in developed countries. Half a million women die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications every year. The lack of the most basic necessities such as a doctor, nurse, clean water, supplies or even a medical facility is robbing precious innocence and devastating families. Such services are often sorely lacking in the poorest regions of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia, which account for the vast majority of all worldwide maternal and newborn deaths. Conflict, HIV and AIDS, migration and a lack of investment in public health services have made this devastating situation even worse. In my travels to these regions, I have seen firsthand the impact of these challenges. It's heartbreaking to hear how women have to walk miles while in labor to reach the nearest hospital, only to arrive finding that there are no doctors available or that the conditions are unsanitary. In many cases, both the mother and newborn lose their lives. Unfortunately, stories like these are not uncommon. I recently visited Sierra Leone, the country with the highest rate of under-5 mortality in the world. One reason for this is that the vast majority of women do not breast-feed their children. The women I talk with say it is custom to feed their children rice water. This provides little nutritional value and leaves children susceptible to disease and death. However, it is illustrative of the challenges we face in reducing child mortality rates. Educating women, particularly young girls, about critical health issues is a priority for UNICEF. The younger a girl is when she becomes pregnant, the greater the health risks for her and her baby. Other factors such as sexual violence and other gender-related abuses pose tremendous challenges and increase the risk that adolescent girls will drop out of school. This, in turn, entrenches the vicious cycle of gender discrimination, poverty and high rates of maternal and neonatal death. A child born in Sierra Leone has more than an one in four chance of not living to see his or her first birthday. That country also has the worst record for prenatal care. Regular immunizations, vitamins, rehydration for children suffering from diarrhea and the use of bed nets to protect from malarial mosquitoes are simple and effective ways of keeping women and children alive. Though the challenges to reach the most vulnerable are high, we are seeing important progress made through international support. However, more can and must be done. Through proven interventions at key stages in life and pregnancy, millions of women and children can be saved each year. We know that the vast majority of maternal deaths are preventable when women have access to essential maternity and basic health-care services. The most vital need is for more skilled professionals and medical facilities throughout pregnancy, birth and postnatal care. UNICEF continues to work with other international agencies to bring more resources to accelerate progress. These efforts are designed to reduce these deaths, and we are seeing some remarkable improvements. In 2007, while I was in Ethiopia helping open a clean water processing facility, a woman stood up and told me her story. Every day, she would spend up to 10 hours in search of clean water to ensure her children could drink and eat. With clean water now in her community, she can focus on keeping her children healthy and ensuring they are receiving a good education. She knows, like so many women around the world in her situation, that the key to ending this suffering is through greater education, awareness and resources to help improve the lives and care of women and children. By doing so, we can significantly reduce and eventually end this horrific loss of life. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Ann Veneman.","Ann Veneman: In America, childbirth ends in joy for a very high number of families .
She says that's not true around the world, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa .
Veneman: Often, deaths occur due to lack of basic medical care and supplies .
She says progress is being made, but more must be done to save lives ."
"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs' yacht was unveiled in a Dutch shipyard on Sunday, where the unusual boat designed by Jobs and famed minimalist designer Philippe Starck was christened ""Venus,"" after the Roman goddess of love, beauty, sex, fertility, prosperity and victory. According to Dutch website OneMoreThing, the finished ship was launched at shipbuilder Koninklijke De Vries in Aalsmeer, The Netherlands. Jobs' widow Laurene and three of their children, Reed, Erin and Eve, were at the ceremony. The Jobs family gave each of the members of the shipbuilding staff an elegant thank-you note, along with a token gift of their appreciation â€” an iPod Shuffle with the name of the ship inscribed on the back. The yacht appears to be as it was described in the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. In the book, Isaacson wrote about Jobs showing him models and architectural drawings of the yacht, which Isaacson described as ""sleek and minimalist."" 10 great quotes from Steve Jobs . According to the report, the enormous yacht is between 230 and 260 feet long, and appears to be as it was described in the Jobs biography â€” it's an extraordinary vessel with teak decks and large panes of ceiling-to-floor glass throughout. The boat is said to have seven 27-inch iMacs on board, and a photo showed six of them lined up on a single counter (see gallery below â€” by the way, you can see 7 iMacs on the bridge in exterior photos of the ship). Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? The late Apple CEO was aware he might not live to see the boat launched, but continued to tinker with its design. Now, at its christening more than a year after his death, his quotes about the yacht become even more poignant. In the Isaacson book, Jobs said, ""I know that it's possible I will die and leave Laurene with a half-built boat. But I have to keep going on it. If I don't, it's an admission that I'm about to die."" Update: Here are pics of the yacht, courtesy OneMoreThing, used with permission. How Steve Jobs' legacy has changed . © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Enya is an anomaly. Think about it: How many recording artists have enjoyed 20 years of success while never having toured? Enya sets her own pace when making albums. ""And Winter Came"" is her first CD in three years. ""The fans are very, very loyal,"" says the Irish chanteuse. ""They're always saying, 'When is the next album?' They know when I finish in the studio it's got to be a few years before the next album."" Perhaps it's the vast gaps between releases that help make Enya, 47, the Emerald Isle's second-biggest-selling artist of all time (after U2). Thanks to a stipulation in her recording contract, the Grammy winner has the luxury of setting her own pace with each project, another rarity in the music business. She'll devote two to three years to each album, flitting between her Dublin castle and the studio, where she works tirelessly to perfect every celestial chord and layer harmony upon harmony. ""I always felt that the music sells by itself,"" she says. ""The music has always been the successful aspect on my career and that means that, to me, I can always still stay very focused on music.""  Watch Enya revel in harmony » . Her latest album -- the seventh of her career -- celebrates both the drama and quiet contemplation that come with the winter season. Called ""And Winter Came,"" the release has reached the top 10 on album charts across Europe and in the U.S. since its November release. And while Enya won't commit to the idea of taking her tunes on the road, she does hint at the possibility. ""To actually tour with the songs would be wonderful. It would be very much on a large scale: the orchestra, the choir. There'd be a lot of rehearsals, but it'd be very exciting,"" she says. Enya spoke to CNN about how her music is like an onion (think layers, not tears), keeping a low profile, and marking the 20-year anniversary of ""Watermark,"" her breakout album. CNN: What does wintertime mean to you? Enya: Wintertime for me is a time when I do a lot of my writing in the studio. It's a time I enjoy. And it's very reflective and a very calming time of the year. Throughout the year I gather a lot of musical inspirations and this is where I bring them to the studio and see what will evolve musically. CNN: You set out to make a Christmas album. How did the project evolve? Enya: I've always wanted to put together a Christmas album. So I was writing some Christmas carols and what happened was some of the songs started to veer more into winter themes. And when I discussed it with [producer and lyricist] Nicky and Roma [Ryan], they felt, well, within winter is the celebration of Christmas, so let's infuse the two themes together. CNN: A lot of people think of Enya as a soloist, but really you're kind of a trio, aren't you? Enya: I work with two other people, the producer Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan, the lyricist. The way I work with Nicky and Roma is firstly I do the writing of the melodies in the songs, and that's kind of the solitude moment for me in the studio, which I enjoy very much. When I have the melody -- the idea of the melody -- I play that to Nicky and Roma. ... I get to see their reaction immediately. Is this a song for the album? And I can see from their reaction -- ""Yes, this is going to work,"" or perhaps it's not. There are a lot of ideas that Nicky had wanted to experiment with. When I met with him first he had this idea of using a voice -- one voice -- as an instrument to layer many times and he knew my love of harmonies. Some people who hear the songs think that we have a set routine, a set formula we work with. It isn't, ... because each song is very different, and it's very spontaneous on my part. CNN: About the layering of your voice ... at any given time how many Enyas might we be listening to? Enya: I don't count! It's a very spontaneous moment on my behalf. I will listen back to the last harmony I've sung, and then I'll sort of try to enhance that harmony. Then Nicky will decide if he'll record my voice 20 times or 30 times [for] that one part. CNN: I read that you might [record] as many as 80 vocal tracks. Is that a reasonable number? And then I read 500. That's got to be ridiculous! Enya: Yes, it can be, but you have to remember that [if] it's 500 vocals I wouldn't have sung them at the same time. We're talking about over two years that we keep going back to arrange vocal parts on these songs. It's a very slow process. CNN: It's hard to believe that it was about 20 years ago that you made ""Watermark."" Do you ever go back and listen to that record? Enya: Well, with the anniversary, yes, I've been listening to ""Watermark."" It's kind of like a journal for me. It takes you back to that time in your life. Each song has its own little story and I can hear the life of that song. You know how it was written, what inspired me, what worked, what didn't work. But the nice thing about spending two to three years on an album is I can say there's nothing I would change on any of the albums. CNN: You've said that you change the formula a little with each album, but to an untrained ear your music has sort of stayed the same throughout your career. Are you a believer in the saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? Enya: Musically it has to be something that I'm comfortable to perform. Would we ever hear Enya with a guitar solo? I say, ""Never say never."" And there's a guitar solo on ""My! My! Time Flies."" This happened because it suited the song. It's always got to sound like me because it's my voice and there's always this little sense of melancholy that is inherent in my melodies. I think that's because of my Irish culture. CNN: Your manager has suggested that one of the secrets to your success is that you keep a fairly low profile. Do you agree? Enya: It's very easy for me to keep a low profile because the focus I feel is always on the music. Success and fame are two different things. And so I feel the success is always towards the music, which means that I can have a very normal and private lifestyle.","Enya's new album is ""And Winter Came""

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's former king said Wednesday he is not going to leave his country even though the monarchy has been abolished. Gyanendra came to power in 2001 following the assassination of King Birendra and his family. Ex-King Gyanendra, 60, made remarks to reporters before departing the Narayanhiti royal palace in Kathmandu. He will live as a civilian in the former Himalayan kingdom that was made a republic last month, and he will reside in a summer palace on a forested hilltop outside the capital. A few hundred journalists crammed into the opulent palace's lobby entrance to hear Gyanendra's remarks. It was a chaotic and undeferential scene replete with pushing, shoving and scuffling -- even while the former monarch was speaking. While the former king spoke, reporters looked around at the lavish furnishings, including a huge crystal chandelier, stuffed tigers, stuffed rhino heads mounted on the walls and paintings of previous monarchs. Gyanendra, who expressed his ""love"" for ""independent Nepal,"" said all of his property will remain in the country and that he has no property outside the nation. ""I have no intention or thoughts to leave the country,"" he said. ""I will stay in the country to help establish peace."" The monarchy's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which Maoist insurgents in Nepal gave up their armed struggle, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly. The assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution, deciding the country's future political system and governing the nation. Gyanendra, who noted that the country is going through a ""serious"" stage now, said he accepts the new reality of a republic and reflected on the actions of the monarchy. ""I have done all I can to cooperate with (the government's) directives,"" he said, and added that ""the monarchy in Nepal has always been with the people of Nepal in good times and bad times."" Gyanendra came to power in 2001 when his brother, King Birendra, and his family were massacred in the palace by the crown prince, who later shot himself. Gyanendra on Wednesday denied rumors that he had played a role in that event. The ex-monarch also discussed events of 2005, when he he took over the civilian government to take on the Maoist insurgency, an unpopular move that sparked protests. He said he hopes people ""understand"" he didn't intend to infringe on any of the rights of the people. He left the palace by a side entrance with pro-royalists and pro-republicans gathered outside to see his departure. His car had to stop momentarily as journalists took pictures of him. Gyanendra's royal scepter and a crown of peacock feathers, yak hair and jewels remain in the palace and have been handed over to the government. -- From CNN's Dan Rivers and Manesh Shrestha .","Former king will live as a civilian in a summer palace outside capital .

"(CNN) -- The commander of Libya's rebel army was killed in Benghazi along with two senior officers on Thursday, rebel leaders announced just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield. The death of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis came after the rebels' Transitional National Council sought Younis for questioning about military matters and alleged ongoing ties to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, according to what Younis' supporters told journalist James Hider of the Times of London. Supporters also shot at a Benghazi hotel and smashed its windows. Journalists had been gathered at the hotel for a press conference held by the rebel's civilian leader who announced Younis was summoned back to Benghazi and was killed along with his two aides under unclear circumstances, Hider told CNN. CNN's Ivan Watson analyzes the situation in Libya . Hider described the events surrounding Younis' death as ""extremely murky,"" but he said the rebel army appeared to be on the brink of a rift. Younis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi's government until February, when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement. He was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel, the rebels' Transitional National Council said in a statement aired on their television network late Thursday. No further details were immediately released. Younis, a onetime general in Gadhafi's army, told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to have Benghazi bombed -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands. Rebel forces have been battling to oust Gadhafi since then, aided by a NATO bombing campaign that has targeted government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. More explosions rocked Tripoli shortly before midnight Thursday (5 p.m. ET), indicating fresh airstrikes were under way in the Libyan capital. Earlier Thursday, the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range, which borders Tunisia. Hundreds of rebels moved from their mountain positions at dawn. With heavier weapons leading the way with lighter armed fighters following, they initially encountered fierce resistance from Gadhafi's loyalists. Col. Jumma Ibrahim, spokesman for the Military Council for the western mountain region, said several major battles had taken place before the towns were secured. He named the captured towns as al-Ruwais, Takout, al-Jawsh, Bader and al-Ghazzaya, and the surrounded town as Umm al-Far. Ibrahim said rebels were now negotiating with Gadhafi troops inside Umm al-Far. He said four rebels had been killed in the fighting and at least 20 were wounded, while 20 Gadhafi fighters had been captured. The claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and, if true, puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces. Ibrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains, Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish. Rebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of al-Ghazzaya from forces loyal to Gadhafi. Last week, rebel fighters manning hilltops in the western mountains overlooking al-Ghazzaya told CNN that they had been watching the government forces reinforcing their weapon stocks with heavy military machinery and rocket launchers. The United Kingdom on Wednesday recognized the Benghazi-based rebels as Libya's legitimate government, and the United States recently recognized the council as the country's ""legitimate governing authority."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday reiterated his stance that Gadhafi could remain in Libya if he leaves power, but added that the best thing would be for him to face justice at the International Criminal Court, which is seeking his arrest. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","""There's now a power vacuum within the army,"" reporter says .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- International efforts to persuade Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to step down ratcheted up Tuesday, as world leaders moved against him on financial and political fronts, strengthened their rhetoric and moved military might into the region. ""We have joined the Libyan people in demanding that Gadhafi must go -- now, without further violence or delay -- and we are working to translate the world's outrage into action and results,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya, a senior U.S. official told CNN. ""Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review,"" the official said. U.S. officials have said all options are being considered with respect to Libya. Underscoring that point, the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce were to be repositioned in the Mediterranean to ""provide us a capability for both emergency evacuations and also for humanitarian relief,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters. But, he noted, the U.N. Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force. The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council. It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council. ""This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya's leaders have brought down upon themselves,"" said Ambassador Susan E. Rice, U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, in a statement. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya. ""The world has spoken with one voice,"" he said. ""We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights, including those of peaceful assembly and free speech."" He added that reports from the ground ""are sobering,"" with continuing loss of life and ongoing repression. ""Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities,"" he said. ""There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country."" ""The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown, but likely to exceed 1,000,"" with thousands more wounded, Ban said, using the same fatality figure he had used Friday. Libya's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000. But Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain. ""I think the honest answer is that we don't know,"" he told reporters. The government of Canada has frozen $2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend, Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday. A number of other countries, including the United States, have ordered an asset freeze. Though some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air, Gates and Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they could not confirm the reports. Clinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration, but Mullen said doing so would be ""an extraordinarily complex operation."" A top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya's air defenses. It would be ""challenging,"" U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee. In western Libya, Ban said, there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents. He noted ""allegations of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions and torture."" Though more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition, Gadhafi's supporters ""appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country, chiefly Tripoli,"" he said. He warned of ""serious indications"" that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages. The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders. Ban called for immediate action by the international community. ""Time is of the essence,"" he said. ""Thousands of lives are at stake."" Indeed, at the border with Tunisia, many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route. Some said they had been threatened with death. One man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $500 from him. When he told them he didn't have it, they said, ""Die then"" and threw him into the street. Tunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees. Volunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds. ""There is nothing for them on that side,"" a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border. He was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food, water and supplies to the border. Many said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving. Meanwhile, more parts of the regime have broken off, joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence. In London, the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition, condemning what it called ""all acts of murder and terror"" taking place in Libya. The military situation on the ground was complex: Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled, an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday. The source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday, but did not capture the town. A senior official in Gadhafi's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya. Senior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country. The officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution, but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost. Zawiya was calm Tuesday, but Gadhafi's troops remained nearby, the opposition leader and another source in the town said. CNN is not naming them to protect their safety. Misrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable, said Abd al Baset Imzeereq, who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council. Pro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers (nine miles) outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall, he said. The forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city, but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and ""to terrorize the people"" by opening fire on them. At least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle, Imzeereq said. Still, some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday, when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans, he said. Food supplies were ample, he said, but medical goods were scarce. Imzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began. The capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life. Prices of basic goods have increased; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank. Some residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the leader's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests, told CNN his talks with the opposition are in ""chaos"" because the opposition is divided, with no clear leaders. Many Libyans have rejected the younger Gadhafi's remarks during the uprising. But U.S. officials made similar comments about the rebel forces. A U.S. official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it's ""unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult"" for the U.S. to provide assistance. ""The intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground,"" said the official, who added that the CIA has had a presence in the country for some time. ""I think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from Gadhafi's forces can organize the opposition in the country,"" said Gates. ""We are watching that unfold."" Over the past two weeks, government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces, fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets, numerous witnesses have told CNN. The elder Gadhafi made no public appearances Tuesday, but he appeared out of touch on Monday, denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests. ""No demonstration at all in the streets,"" the 68-year-old ruler told ABC and the BBC in a joint interview in Tripoli. ""They love me, all my people with me, they love me all. They will die to protect me, my people,"" said Gadhafi, who has controlled Libya for nearly 42 years. But Libya's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi disagreed. ""I don't believe that even his family loves him at this moment,"" said Dabbashi, who has joined the rebel movement in calling for Gadhafi to step down. ""I think no one loves him at all. I think the whole Libyan people hate him now. With all the bloodshed, all the killing ... he's certainly out of his mind."" CNN's Arwa Damon, Nic Robertson, Ivan Watson, Anderson Cooper, Ben Wedeman, Eve Bower, Salma Abdelaziz, Jim Boulden, Frederik Pleitgen, Richard Roth, Jack Maddox, Whitney Hurst and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report .","Libya's Deputy U.N.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. The Iraqi Ministry of Justice gave journalists an inside look at the prison formerly known as Abu Ghraib. It is now called Baghdad Central Prison, and has water fountains, a freshly planted garden and a gym -- complete with weights and sports teams' jerseys on the walls. Under Saddam Hussein, tens of thousands of Iraqis were thrown behind bars here. There were horrific stories of torture, abuse, execution without trial. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops.  Watch how the prison has been revamped » . Detainees were photographed in degrading positions, as Americans posed next to them smiling. The images -- naked prisoners stacked on top of each other, or being threatened by dogs, or hooded and wired up as if for electrocution -- caused outrage around the world when they were leaked to the news media in May 2004. Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski, commander of the Abu Ghraib prison at the time, was demoted in rank to colonel because of the scandal. Seven low-ranking guards and two military intelligence soldiers -- described by then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as ""bad apples"" -- were disciplined after the scandal surfaced. Rumsfeld later said the day the scandal broke was the worst in his tenure as defense secretary. ""Clearly the worst day was Abu Ghraib, and seeing what went on there and feeling so deeply sorry that that happened,"" Rumsfeld said shortly before leaving office at the end of 2006. ""I remember being stunned by the news of the abuse."" The United States always denied it was a matter of policy to torture detainees. But it shut down Abu Ghraib in September 2006 and turned the facility over to the Iraqis. They have revamped and reopened it. Rooms have been transformed and renovated. CNN was told, but not shown, that a few hundred prisoners are here already, in a revamped part of the facility that can hold up to 3,000 prisoners. The capacity is critical to help deal with overcrowding at Iraq's other facilities and the potential security threat. The Iraqi government is going to great lengths to try to change the image this facility has. It organized a tour for journalists, very carefully orchestrated by the Ministry of Justice. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. ""We want to change its image, to make it a place of justice,"" he said. A wing that used to hold a thousand prisoners In Saddam Hussein's time now is ready for 160. Cells that used to hold between 30 and 50 people now have a capacity of eight. Prisoners and their families actually get to see each other -- the prisoners behind a cage-like structure, the families on the other side of the fence, in a courtyard with a playground for the children. Again, it is part of the whole effort to create a different atmosphere. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. Changing Abu Ghraib's infamous reputation may take more than fresh paint and fake flowers.","Abu Ghraib is now Baghdad Central Prison, with a garden and a gym .

"(CNN) -- Charles Poland was doing a job he loved, driving a bus full of children he loved along rural Alabama streets and highways. And then, in a quick flurry of bullets, he was dead. For that -- for refusing the gunman's demand to take two schoolchildren around 4 p.m. Tuesday, then to face the horrific consequence -- Poland is being called a hero; by officials in the school system he worked for, by the people of Dale County, by his family. ""You couldn't give nothing greater than your life for a kid or anyone else,"" his brother-in-law Melvin Skipper told CNN affiliate WDHN. ""That's a hero."" His life began on July 16, 1946, in Payette, Idaho -- a town along the Oregon border some 2,300 miles northwest of where his life ended, in southeastern Alabama. For 43 of his 66 years, he was married to Mary Janice Poland. During his lifetime, ""Chuck"" -- as he was known -- also became a father of two and ""paw-paw"" of two grandsons. And he had other children as well. After some time as a substitute bus driver, Poland began full-time duty shuttling students around Dale County four years ago. It was a job he enjoyed, his brother-in-law said, because of the children he drove. ""There was a laughter and a love that he had for the kids,"" Skipper recalled, reflecting on the regular conversations he'd have with his wife about ""my youngins'."" ""They were his youngins', when he had them on the bus."" His wife told the local newspaper, the Dothan Eagle, that her husband would do anything for his young passengers, like many others. ""He loved them,"" she said. ""He loved everybody, and he was loved."" His neighbors in the small town of Newton and relatives remembered Poland as a gentle man, a humble man, a man of faith. In words and deeds, he didn't hesitate to help others in need and wouldn't take anything in return, according to his neighbor Hilburn Benton, who talked to the Eagle. Yet many others first learned of him after Tuesday, when a man -- whom authorities haven't identified, but neighbors and news outlets say is 65-year-old retired truck driver and Vietnam veteran Jimmy Lee Dykes -- approached his bus in Midland City. The gunshots rang out after Poland rebuffed the suspect's attempts for two children. Dykes then took one 5-year-old boy, bringing him to the handmade bunker he had created near his home. Late Thursday night, that's where the child and his kidnapper remained -- with no sign the boy had been harmed, said Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson, but no indication a breakthrough was imminent, either. As to Poland, he'll be memorialized Saturday night at a visitation service, followed by his funeral Sunday afternoon at the Ozark Civic Center. ""We are mourning a hero,"" the Dale County schools said, ""... who gave his life to protect 21 students who are now home safely with their families."" That sentiment was echoed in Poland's obituary. He, the notice said, was ""a selfless man whose life exemplified the Lord he served, (who) made the ultimate sacrifice by saving the lives of the children he loved.""","Bus driver Charles Poland, 66, was killed while on a route in southeastern Alabama .

"(CNN) -- In November 2011, The Boston Globe had a panel on ""cyberetiquette."" We met in a theater at Boston Globe headquarters. On the stage was a moderator, a Globe reporter, and two of the Globe's regular ""advice and manners"" columnists. And then there was me, there, I suppose to represent the cyberworld and where it might take us. As I remember it, we responded to questions from the moderator and from the floor with general agreement on most matters: No texting at family dinner. No texting at restaurants. Don't bring your laptop to your children's sporting events, no matter how tempting. (Your daughter looks up from her star turn at lacrosse, and you are deep into an e-mail to your supervisor. The game was boring until then, sure. But e-mail can get so engrossing that you've got to be careful; you're playing with fire!) Then came this question from the floor: A woman said that as a working mother she had very little time to talk to her friends, to e-mail, to text, to keep up. ""Actually,"" she confessed, ""the only time I have is at night, after I'm off work and before I go home, when I go family shopping at Trader Joe's [a supermarket]. But the guy at the checkout line, he wants to talk. I just want to be on my phone, into my texts and Facebook. Do I have the right to just ignore him?"" Watch Sherry Turkle's TED Talk . The two manners experts went first. Each said a version of the same thing: The man who did the checkout had a job to do. She had a right to her privacy as he provided his service. I listened uncomfortably. I thought of growing up and all the years I went shopping with my grandmother, all the relationships she had with the tradespeople at every store: the baker, the fishmonger, the fruit man, the grocery man, for this is how we called them. TED.com: Make data more human . If they hadn't spoken to us, we would have been upset. If we hadn't spoken to them, I always assumed they would have been upset as well. I was not older than my fellow panelists. And I've never considered myself a nostalgic person. But I found myself disagreeing with them. I answered the question from the floor in a very different spirit. I said that we all know that the job that the man at the checkout counter was doing can now be done by a machine. But until he is replaced by a machine, I think he should be treated as a person, with all the rights of a person. And that includes a bit of human exchange, since that is clearly what makes his job tolerable for him, makes him feel that in his job, this job that could be done by a machine, he is still a human being. TED.com: We are all cyborgs now . My fellow panelists were not pushovers. Nor was the audience. This was not what they wanted to hear. But in this moment, as in so many others like it, when I took stock of their unhappy reaction to what I said, I felt myself at the cold, hard center of a perfect storm: We expect more from technology and less from each other. What once would have seemed like ""good service"" is now an inconvenience. That's the ""less from each other"" part of the equation. We also want technology to step in as we invite people to step back. It used to be that we imagined that our mobile phones would be for us to talk to each other. Now, our mobile phones are there to talk to us. New commercials for Siri, the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone, have it serving as a best friend and confidante to a man who is preparing for a romantic dinner date at home and to an ingÃ©nue who takes a rainy day off from work to dance around her apartment in bare feet. I interview young people who tell me they hope that in the future, Siri will be even more like a best friend to them. TED.com: How technology evolves . We are at a moment of temptation, ready to turn to machines for companionship even as we seem pained or inconvenienced to engage with each other in settings as simple as a grocery store. We want to instrumentalize daily life with real people and accept fantasies of ""intimate"" conversations with robotic personal assistants who have no real understanding of what we are saying to them in terms of what things mean to us. We seem lonely but afraid of intimacy. Siri, the social network, digital assistants, all of these give the illusion of companionship without the demands of relationship. The path we are on seems fraught with paradox and about the most important human matters. Yet smitten with technology, we are like young lovers who are afraid that too much talking will spoil the romance. We don't much want to talk about these problems. But it's time to talk. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherry Turkle.","Sherry Turkle, once an enthusiast for digital technology, expresses some doubts .

"(CNN) -- Look out air travelers. A congressional slugfest over the U.S. deficit is threatening to trigger higher airfares and widespread slowdowns at the nation's airports. Remember that big fight in Congress last year over the national budget deficit? Eventually Congress and the White House agreed to scheduled budget cuts that are so deep that lawmakers would be forced to come together on tough choices. Washington wonks call these cuts ""sequestration."" Related story: Sequestration is the 'dumbest thing' The Federal Aviation Administration is in the cross hairs for sequestration -- with a possible $1 billion in mandatory cuts scheduled to occur as soon as January. The FAA chief warned of the impact of such cuts. And a new study says the cuts would result in fewer air traffic controllers, customs officers and security officers. The FAA's sweeping overhaul of the U.S. air traffic system also would take a hit. NextGen, as it's called, is aimed at improving efficiency and increasing safety. ""If the sequester were to occur, we would face some very drastic cuts in services and these investments,"" said FAA acting administrator Michael Huerta, in an October speech. ""These cuts would impact air traffic control services, NextGen implementation, and aircraft certification -- all of which are critical to our ability to move forward with aviation in this century. ""They would result in significantly less efficient and less convenient air travel service for the American traveling public. We will always, however, maintain the highest levels of safety."" It's anybody's guess -- and up to Congress -- whether the cuts will actually happen. But groups representing pilots and the aerospace industry say it's time to get nervous. Opinion: Clock ticking on defense cuts . Marion Blakey, who headed the FAA during the George W. Bush administration and who now leads an aerospace industry lobbying organization, warned in August that just the threat of the cuts is already having a chilling effect. Consumers should be worried, she warns. ""This will affect their ability to fly when they want and how they want,"" Blakey says. ""It will certainly be a drag on the airlines, which then will incur great cost, which then will be passed on to the consumer or it will cut into the carriers' very meager profits and that's not healthy."" Blakey's group, the Aerospace Industries Association, and Econsult Corp. released a study in August that paints a worst-case scenario, including possible closure of 246 airport control towers, 1,500 fewer air traffic controllers and the loss of 9,000 security screeners and 1,600 customs officers. Obviously, fewer controllers, screeners and customs people would throw a wrench into an already stressed air travel system. ""A billion dollars is a body blow to the FAA,"" Blakey says. For industry planners, Blakey says January is right around the corner, and making industry decisions amid such uncertainty comes with an economic price that will affect the consumer. Not only would airline passengers feel the cuts, but pilots of small aircraft, known as general aviation, or GA, will see ramifications, both in safety and efficiency, says Melissa Rudinger, senior vice president of government affairs at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The cuts could include the shut down of more than 200 control towers, ""which operate almost exclusively at GA locations,"" she says. ""It's unclear to us how the FAA would go about literally closing the doors and turning out the lights,"" she says. ""But there's definitely a safety risk that would have us concerned."" Safety would not be an issue, Blakey says. ""I have every confidence they'll keep it safe,"" she says, although she expects FAA controllers will slow traffic at small airports by reducing hours of operation and capacity. ""I do not anticipate that the FAA will reduce hours and personnel at the nation's big air traffic control centers and the TRACON radar tracking centers,"" she says. For now, many in the aviation industry are taking a wait-and-see attitude. ""There is a great deal of uncertainty about whether sequestration will actually happen and what the real impact would be on commercial aviation,"" writes a spokeswoman for the airline industry trade group Airlines for America. Other groups aren't talking at all. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association wouldn't comment in August, and the FAA referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget. The OMB has 30 days to analyze the sequestration legislation and to make recommendations to the White House. An internal OMB memo (PDF) in July said sequestration would be ""highly destructive to national security and domestic priorities, as well as to core government functions,"" and that Obama has submitted deficit reduction proposals to Congress aimed at avoiding the cuts. The cuts would delay deployment of the multibillion-dollar NextGen program by at least a decade, according to the study. ""It's a very big deal to keep that on track,"" Blakey says. ""It's going to get hit; it's just a question of how much."" This is not just about FAA, Blakey says. Think about the idea of cutting 9,000 Transportation Security Administration screeners. ""How do you like the lines now? How are you going to like them then?"" She says, ""People would like to treat this as a hypothetical or a simple congressional debate."" But the threat will grow, she warns, unless ""people step up and try again to address the long-term issues"" surrounding the nation's debt and deficit -- or they postpone the FAA cuts to give themselves more time for a compromise.","Budget battle may result in slower air travel, higher fares .

"(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden emphasized a ""new tone"" in Washington and around the world as he delivered his first major speech Saturday in Munich, Germany. ""America will do more,"" Vice President Joe Biden told the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday. Biden told delegates at a security conference that the United States will work ""preventively, not pre-emptively"" whenever possible to avoid conflict, and will at the same time ""vigorously defend"" the nation's security. He also said the United States will do everything possible to end the threat posed by extremists. ""We reject as false the choice between our safety and ideals,"" Biden told the Munich Security Conference audience, which included German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""America will vigorously defend our security and our values, and in doing so we will all be more secure."" That policy will be in force at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the U.S. prison that the Obama administration intends to close, Biden said.  Watch Biden address security conference » . ""America will not torture. We will uphold the rights of those we bring to justice,"" Biden said. The vice president emphasized cooperation with allies and to extend a hand to others. He asked for shared responsibility for security and fighting extremism. ""America will do more. That's the good news,"" Biden said. ""The bad news is, America will ask from more from our partners as well."" Obama's administration doesn't believe international alliances or organizations will diminish American power, Biden said. In fact, he said, such alliances do the opposite -- as long as they are ""credible and effective."" He said nations working together can help persuade Iran to forgo the development of nuclear weapons, an ""illicit"" program that Biden said is not conducive to peace. ""Our administration is reviewing our policy toward Iran, but this much is clear: We'll be willing to talk,"" Biden said. ""We'll be willing to talk to Iran and to offer a very clear choice: Continue down the current course and there will be pressure and isolation; abandon the illicit nuclear program and your support for terrorism and there will be meaningful incentives."" By acting preventively to avoid conflict, Biden said, the United States can start to recapture its strength. Biden stressed a commitment to reach peace in the Middle East and draw down U.S. forces in Iraq. He also said the United States will continue to work for a stable Afghanistan. ""We look forward to sharing that commitment with the government and people of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and with all of our allies and partners, because a deteriorating situation in the region poses a security threat not just to the United States, but I would suggest, somewhat presumptively, to every one of you assembled in this room,"" Biden said. Obama ordered a strategic review of U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and is soliciting input from allies, Biden said. ""We are sincere in seeking your counsel,"" Biden said. ""As we undertake this review, there's a lot at stake. The result must be a comprehensive strategy for which we all take responsibility."" The United States also aims to increase foreign assistance to ease poverty, boost education, cancel the debts of poor countries, and launch a ""green revolution"" that produces sustainable supplies of food. ""We also are determined to build a sustainable future for our planet,"" Biden said. ""We are prepared to once again lead by example."" On the issue of a U.S. missile shield in Eastern Europe -- a bone of contention with Russia -- Biden said the United States will remain firm in defending against the nuclear threat, and he said Washington aims to work together with Moscow. ""We will not agree with Russia on everything,"" he said. ""For example, the United States will not -- will not -- recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. We will not recognize any nation having a sphere of influence."" But, Biden added, ""the United States and Russia can disagree and still work together where our interests coincide, and they coincide in many places."" Deputy Russian Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov had started off the day Saturday by proposing a ban on deployment of strategic offensive weapons outside a country's borders, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Biden also promised that America will ""act aggressively against climate change.""","Vice president addresses security conference in Munich, Germany .

"(CNN) -- I was in a year-abroad program in 1973, one of 240 American students attending Loyola University Rome Center. The school year was winding down. I went out to dinner with a group of friends in Trastevere. After several courses and many bottles of wine, we went to a bar and listened to a singer do jazz standards. About 11:30, Steve Pappas, a friend from Vallejo, California, and I decided to peel off from the group and take a cab across town to Harry's Bar, an old Hemingway haunt on Via Veneto. (We'd sit outside, drink whiskey and talk to the prostitutes, beautiful women who walked down from the park, Villa Borghese, looking for a rich guy staying at one of the expensive hotels.) We left the bar, and I saw a taxi on the other side of the piazza under a full moon. Walked to it, and I got in back and closed my eyes, feeling the effects of many drinks. I heard the front door open and close, looked and saw Pappas grinning in the driver's seat. ""We're going to Harry's."" I thought he was kidding. But then I heard the engine start, saw him slip the shifter in gear, and we did a couple doughnuts in the middle of the piazza, tires squealing, and pulled out, turning right onto a street heading for the Tiber River. I said, ""Are you out of your mind?"" He looked at me in the rearview mirror and laughed. Minutes later, negotiating the narrow cobblestone streets of Trastevere, we passed a Carabinieri (national police) sedan parked on the side of the road. I could see the cops look at us in what seemed like slow motion. The next thing I remember, the taxi came to a stop. Unlikely as it was, we were stuck in a traffic jam on the back streets of Rome. I got out of the taxi and started to run, made it to the Tiber but hesitated. Instead of going over the wall and climbing the ladder to the riverbank, I crouched behind a car in a small parking lot and waited. I could feel my heart banging in my chest. A few minutes passed, and nothing happened. Just as I started to relax, I saw a Carabinieri patrolman appear out of the darkness, coming toward me, gun drawn, shouting something in Italian. There was nowhere to go. I stood with my arms raised, hands over my head. I was handcuffed and taken to Carabinieri headquarters. Pappas had also been picked up, and we were reunited in an interrogation room and later were questioned by an angry Carabinieri officer. ""Who are you?"" We gave him our names. I said, ""We're Americans, students at Loyola University."" He didn't seem impressed. ""Why did you steal the taxi?"" ""We had too much to drink,"" Pappas said. ""It was a prank."" ""This is how a man makes his living, and you dismiss it as something trivial, unimportant. You drink too much and use this as an excuse."" The Carabinieri officer paused. ""In Italy, you are guilty until proven innocent."" With that, he walked out of the room. From there, I was handcuffed and pushed into the back of a Fiat sedan, flanked by two heavyset cops, and driven to the outskirts of Rome. I could see the walls and towers of a prison in the distance set behind a high fence topped with razor wire. I said to the cop on my right, ""What is that?"" ""Rebibbia,"" He said. I had heard of it, Rebibbia, where the hardcore criminals were sent. We turned into the prison complex and pulled up to a building with a silver steel garage door that reminded me of something I'd seen in a James Bond movie. The door went up, and we drove into a concrete loading area. The handcuffs were removed, and I was escorted to a room, photographed and fingerprinted. After that, I was escorted to a hall and fell in line behind the other fools who had been arrested that night, a motley crew of 20 men. No sign of Pappas. Grit on wry: A dinner with Elmore and Peter Leonard . I was thinking about what my mother had said before I left the country. We were standing on the driveway, getting ready to go to the airport. ""Peter, please don't get in trouble."" I said, ""What do you think I'm going to do?"" The line kept moving, and when it was my turn, I stepped up to the open half-door of a storeroom and was given a stained towel, a bar of soap and a distressed cup made out of extruded metal. A guard escorted me to a cell, solitary confinement, which seemed like a blessing under the circumstances. It was now 4:30 in the morning. I was exhausted and fell asleep fast. Next thing I remember, I was in that state between sleep and waking up when your mind can play tricks on you. I was thinking about the events of the previous night, wondering if it was a dream, and then I opened my eyes and saw the morning sunlight coming through the barred window creating a distorted pattern on the tile floor. The room had a bed, an orange metal frame bolted to the wall and a stained mattress, a toilet, and scarred, graffiti-covered walls. A guy named Ricki professing his love for Ana. On my second day, in captivity a woman from the American Embassy visited and gave me a couple packs of Marlboros and a couple Hershey bars. I said, ""Do you have any news from Father Felice?"" He was the director of the university. She didn't know who he was, which wasn't a good sign. I hadn't heard anything from Felice or anyone else, and I was starting to wonder. Except for an hour in the exercise yard each day, I was locked in the 6-by-8-foot cell, and I was getting anxious, on edge. The exercise yard, with its concrete floor and chain-link walls, looked like it had been lifted from the projects in Detroit. I would stand with my back to the fence, feeling the warmth of the sun. Inmates would come up and ask if I was Swedish. When I told them I was an American, they assumed I had been arrested for drugs. ""No,"" I would say, ""stealing a taxi."" And the typical response would be: ""That's not bad. You get eight months, maybe a year, but no more than that."" Hearing it freaked me out. I thought, eight months, I've got to get out of here. One afternoon in the yard, a dark-skinned guy who looked Tunisian or Moroccan tried to take my cigarettes. I didn't say anything, just stepped in and hit him in the face, and he went down. No one else bothered me after that. Early, the morning of day four, I was taken to a holding cell where I met my court-appointed attorney, a young guy named Sergio who didn't speak English. I asked him to contact Father Felice and find out was going on, but I don't think he understood. Sergio represented me during the arraignment that was held in a conference room at the prison. A judge advocate explained the charges against me and said I would be going to trial in a few days. After the arraignment, I was moved to a four-man cell in general population. Pappas has been moved there, too. Our cellmates were Alejo, a 25-year-old pickpocket from Buenos Aires, and Spoleto, a 72-year-old armed robber who had been incarcerated since Mussolini was in power. Spoleto was demented and slept in his clothes, thinking he was going to be released any minute. I spent the next three days reading crime fiction from the prison library and thinking some day I would use the Rebibbia experience in a novel. On day seven, I was escorted to a large holding cell filled with prisoners, most of whom were throwing salt over their left shoulder for good luck before going to court. Pappas appeared a little later, handcuffed to a thin, frightened Italian. I was handcuffed to a little Sardinian guy who might've been 5 feet tall. When we rode on a bench seat in the back of a van, six of us on one side with our backs to six others, the Sardinian's little feet dangled over the floor. In court, we were represented by father/son attorneys hired by Father Felice. Here's what I remember: There were three judges and a prosecutor, all wearing powdered wigs and black robes. The prosecutor shouted at us in a loud theatrical voice. Our attorneys answered the charges, and the three judges spoke to each other in hushed tones. It was over in 10 minutes. I was acquitted; there was no evidence against me. As I recall, Pappas was found guilty and fined 20,000 Lire, about $34. We found out later that Pappas' attorney and one of the judges were friends, and a deal had been made. We were released, but it wasn't over. Guilty or not, we were given 48 hours to leave the country. Which coincided with the end of the school year and our flight back to Chicago. Pappas and I were in the airport, drinking beer with our friends, when two Carabinieri in SWAT fatigues called our names and escorted Signore Pappas and Signore Leonard out of the airport terminal, through a gate to the tarmac and up the stairway that led to our plane. We were officially kicked out of Italy, persona non grata. We arrived in Chicago the next morning, and I took a connecting flight a few hours later. My father, Elmore Leonard, was waiting at the gate when I got off the plane in Detroit. Elmore looked at me and said, ""Hard time makes the boy the man.""","Leonard's experiences studying in Rome inspired his book ""All He Saw Was the Girl""

"(CNN) -- Two men have been arrested in connection with an effigy of Sen. Barack Obama that was hung outside a building at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, police said Thursday. Joe Fischer, left, and Hunter Bush were arrested on disorderly conduct and other charges, police said. Authorities found a life-size effigy of the Democratic presidential candidate hanging from a tree outside the school's Mines and Minerals building on Wednesday morning, police said. Police said they arrested Joe Fischer, 22, a senior at the university, and Hunter Bush, 21, a former student at Bluegrass Community and Technical College. ""This was a serious incident.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- One of the Chinese badminton players disqualified from the Olympics for trying to lose a match has said she is quitting the sport, accusing the badminton governing body of ruining her dreams. ""This is my last match,"" Yu Yang wrote on her microblog account late Wednesday. ""Farewell Badminton World Federation, farewell my beloved badminton."" Yu; her women's doubles partner, Wang Xiaoli; and six other players were kicked out of the competition Wednesday by the Badminton World Federation in one of the most controversial episodes of the London Games so far. Read more: Badminton players disqualified . The athletes were accused of playing to lose in order to face easier opponents in future matches, drawing boos from spectators and warnings from match officials Tuesday night. The other doubles pairs booted out were from South Korea and Indonesia. All four duos were charged by the federation with not doing their best to win a match and abusing or demeaning the sport. While the Indonesian and South Korean pairs both unsuccessfully appealed the decision, the Chinese sporting authorities accepted the ruling and the country's head badminton coach apologized for the players' behavior. Trying to fail? Not just in Badminton . But Yu and Wang, ranked No. 1 in the world, were defiant in their posts on their accounts on Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. They blamed injuries and the rules of the competition for the controversy. ""We were injured before the match,"" Yu wrote. ""And we were using the rule to give up the match to be better prepared for the knockout round. Do you know how much pain we suffer when we athletes get injured and still have to compete?"" She said the federation's decision to disqualify them had ""dashed our dreams."" At 26, Yu is relatively young to be leaving the sport. There are women's doubles players among the top 10 pairs in the world who are still competing beyond the age of 30. She appeared to be sticking to her intentions Thursday, changing her profile information on her Weibo account from ""badminton player"" to ""freelancer."" But her official team apology was less unequivocal. ""I apologize to all our fans because we failed to abide by the Olympic spirit and failed to present a game as it should have been ... I am ready to do my best in every game of my professional career in the future, to show all of my fans that I've changed,"" it read. Reached by telephone, an official at the Chinese Table Tennis and Badminton Center, which is affiliated with the country's General Administration of Sports, was unable to provide any information about Yu's status. The official declined to give his name and title. The disqualifications resulted from two lackluster contests in London that angered the watching crowds as the doubles pairs appeared to be serving into the net on purpose. The eight players concerned had all already qualified for the quarterfinals of the tournament before the final matches of the group stage Tuesday night. The Chinese Olympic delegation ""fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish"" its athletes, it said in a statement. ""The actions of Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli on the court have violated Olympic principles and the spirit of fair athletic competition. The Chinese Sports Delegation feels saddened,"" it said. The delegation is investigating the Chinese players' conduct, it said, ""and will make appropriate rulings based on the result."" The head coach of the Chinese badminton team, Li Yongbo, expressed contrition for what happened. ""As the head coach, I owe the fans and the Chinese an apology,"" he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. ""Chinese players failed to demonstrate their fighting spirit of the national team. It's me to blame."" The state-run television station CCTV aired footage of Wang and Yu apologizing. But their microblog accounts told a different story. ""I can't believe we fought so hard for four years and the result is this!"" Wang wrote. ""I tried hard at the match with a body full of injuries."" She said she and her partner paid the price for the federation's ""imperfect game rules."" Xinhua published reports in Chinese based on the two athletes' angry Weibo comments. In the first of the Tuesday matches that prompted the uproar, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which ""neither side seemed to be exerting themselves,"" the official Olympic news service said. After several serves by both pairs went into the net, the tournament referee, Torsten Berg, was called to the court, the news service reported, ""where he warned all four players amid a chorus of boos from the crowd."" The South Koreans eventually won the ""repeatedly interrupted match,"" securing first place in their group, according to the news service. But that put them in the same side of the draw as Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei, a Chinese duo who are ranked No. 2 in the world. The second controversial match took place about an hour later, pitting South Korea's Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung against the Indonesians Meiliana Jauhari and Greysia Polii. Play in that contest was ""sluggish early on,"" the Olympic news service reported, and Berg was called onto the court at least twice ""with the crowd calling for the players to be sent off."" Former badminton player Andy Goode, who represented Britain at the 1992 Olympics and managed the team four years later, said the disqualification was the right call for the sake of the sport. ""It was a decision they had to make, and they had to make quickly,"" he said. ""I've never seen any sporting event, any major event, where two players or two pairs just stood on a court and haven't tried."" But Goode said the kind of tactical play seen Tuesday ""does go on,"" especially in countries where the team ethic is very important. ""These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games,"" he said. The world champion Chinese pair, Wang and Yu, ""were going for gold, and this was just part of their journey to get to that gold."" They probably didn't see anything wrong with what they did because they were focused on the next round and winning medals for their country, he said. Goode said he hoped the furor would not have a negative effect on the racket sport longer term, given the swift response by its governing officials. British sports fans going into the Olympic Park on Wednesday said the athletes' behavior was ""shocking."" ""It's not in the spirit of the thing,"" said Kevin Button of Ashford, in southeastern England, who had watched parts of the matches on television. ""And it's so disappointing for the people who came to see it,"" said his wife, Tina. ""It leaves a bit of a sour taste."" The debacle has prompted wide debate on social media, with opinion divided on whether the players were exercising tactical nous within a poorly designed system or were guilty of failing the Olympic spirit and bringing the game into disrepute. Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London Olympic organizing committee, was clear where he stood on the controversy, describing the spectacle as ""depressing"" and ""unacceptable."" ""I mean, who wants to sit through something like that?"" he asked. The game of badminton dates back centuries but has been an Olympic sport only since 1992. Competition has been dominated by China, Indonesia, South Korea and Denmark, according to the federation. China has won 11 of the 24 Olympic gold medals awarded in badminton since 1992, according to the International Olympics Committee's database. Although not widely played in the United States, badminton -- viewed as one of the fastest racket sports -- is popular in many European and Asian nations. OfficialBadminton.com says it is played by 200 million people worldwide and is the national sport of Indonesia and Singapore. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Florence Davey-Attlee and Laura Smith-Spark in London; Steven Jiang, Dayu Zhang and Jaime A.

"London (CNN) -- Spain faces a test of unity over the coming months as regional elections in Catalonia and Galicia threaten to destabilize the debt-ridden nation. With unemployment at a record 25%, borrowing costs spiraling and debt repayments looming, Spain is emerging as the possible next candidate to tap its eurozone peers for financial help. But Spain stands apart from other nations forced to seek aid. As the eurozone's fourth largest economy -- making up around 11% of the currency bloc's gross domestic product -- its financial problems are now being exacerbated by defiance from some of its 17 disparate regions. Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region in the Northeast, represents one fifth of Spain's economy and the protestors are now actively calling for a split from central government. Such agitations -- coming as they are in the midst of the country's debt crisis -- threaten to undermine Rajoy's attempts to pull Spain from its financial mire. Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy told CNN that the sub sovereign debt problems are a ""hot button issue."" For Rajoy, the push back ""accentuates [the problems], making it more likely Spain will be forced to call on the European Stability Mechanism [Europe's permanent bailout fund],"" Spiro said. But Antonio Barroso, a Europe analyst at Eurasia Group, told CNN that despite the protests the likelihood of a Catalan separation is ""extremely low."" According to Barroso, the ruling political party in Catalonia, Convergence and Union (CiU) led by Catalan President Artur Mas, has used the eurozone debt crisis and regional elections set for November 25 to openly call for sovereignty. Barroso said: ""It is true that public support for independence has been on the rise. But the Catalan government is implementing very tough financial adjustments and therefore the [Catalan] President, Artur Mas, is capitalizing on nationalist sentiments to shift the burden of responsibility onto the central government."" Last week Mas met with the Rajoy in Madrid to try and negotiate a new fiscal arrangement, whereby Catalonia would manage its own taxes and transfer less money to other regions in Spain. But talks stalled. Even as Catalonia -- with its own language and culture -- strives for autonomy, in August, the CiU requested a 5 billion euro ($6.3 billion) bailout from the Spanish government. The request came after Rajoy announced plans for a credit line to be extended to Spain's 17 regions. But, according to Barroso, Catalonia is not Rajoy's main concern. Instead Spain's leader is focusing on regional elections in Galicia in October -- a region in North-western Spain -- where his party is likely to win and where the policies could create a model for the rest of Spain. Barroso said: ""The key area for Rajoy is Galicia because his party has an absolute majority. He wants to use Galicia as an example of how his policies are working because it is one of the healthiest region in fiscal terms."" Spain has already requested up to a 100 billion euro ($128 billion) aid package for its ailing banks, which are still struggling to grapple with the property collapse in 2008. Pressure from European partners and investor fear over further credit downgrades for Spain could undo the calming effect of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's announcement on September 6. Draghi said the bank would be willing to purchase sovereign bonds of fiscally-frail countries such as Spain and Italy, if these indebted nations request a bailout. But Barroso noted it was difficult to place a time frame on Spain seeking any external aid. He added: ""For Rajoy, he has said 'only if market pressure increases' and you see how yields are going up again. I think market pressure is the ultimate factor that would cause Rajoy to apply.""","Catalonia has requested a 5 billion euro ($6.3 billion) bailout from the Spanish government .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council's sanctions committee has approved a U.S. request to unfreeze $1.5 billion in Libyan assets to be used for humanitarian and civilian needs. ""We felt the need was urgent; that the (National Transitional Council) had to start paying its bills and to start establishing a track record as a clean, democratic organization,"" a senior administration official said. The money will start flowing ""in a few days,"" the official said. The money will be allocated in three equal amounts, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Up to $500 million will be transferred to international humanitarian organizations; up to $500 million will be transferred to suppliers for fuel and other goods intended for civilian use; and up to $500 million will be transferred to a temporary finanical mechanism established to assist the Libyan people's food and other humanitarian needs. South Africa had held up the release, expressing concern that no individual body should yet be declared the sole legitimate authority in Libya. The administration compromised by replacing references to the National Transitional Council with ""relevant Libyan authorities,"" the official said. ""This money will go toward meeting the needs of the people of Libya,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a prepared statement. ""We urge other nations to take similar measures.  Many are already doing so."" She called for the National Transitional Council to move quickly toward building a democracy ""that protects the universal human rights of all its citizens."" She added, ""There can be no place in the new Libya for revenge attacks and reprisals."" The U.S. military is looking at options for delivering humanitarian assistance to Libya and helping with the return of refugees. A senior U.S. military official with direct knowledge of the effort said there had been no requests for assistance, but the military was doing ""prudent planning"" to be prepared if asked. U.S. President Barack Obama's policy of ruling out any U.S. troops on the ground remains in effect, he said, but military officials have indicated military aircraft and ships might deliver aid to airfields and ports. The NTC, which is expected to function as an interim government, was offering few details about its needs, the official said. Any U.S. assistance would likely take place within a broader post-conflict NATO effort under a United Nations umbrella, a senior NATO official told CNN. NATO military officials have begun planning efforts to be ready if they are asked for help, the senior official said. That would include planning for humanitarian aid, air and maritime security, and the possibility of training Libyan military forces at locations outside the country, the senior official said. Arab allies such as Qatar, Jordan and perhaps others are expected to join in any post-conflict effort in order to keep it from looking like NATO nations are running the show, the senior official said. Meanwhile, the Libya Contact Group -- an alliance of countries -- met Thursday in Istanbul to discuss how to help rebuild Libya's infrastructure. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman, on the sidelines of the meeting, said the Arab League was expected to officially ""seat"" the transitional council at league headquarters in Cairo on Saturday. Feltman said part of the proposed $1.5 billion in assets, once unfrozen, will help pay oil bills to keep the electricity on in Libya. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said participants were looking forward to a high-level meeting of allies in Paris next week. Italy will unfreeze about $505 million in Libyan assets that have been held in Italian banks, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Thursday. The rebels have already gotten some support. Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the transitional council, revealed that Turkey had sent $300 million to the rebels since July. The expected release of financing for humanitarian aid came as a few signs appeared on the streets of the capital that indicated a lessening of tensions in some neighborhoods. For the first time in days, a few stores opened and more residents were out on the streets. But fighting continued in pockets as the rebels hustled to consolidate power and much of the city remained a no-go zone. Weapons littered the streets in some areas. Around one intersection, a dozen bodies lay on the ground, their hands bound behind them. Rebels said they had been executed by Gadhafi's men, but that was not clear. The victims were black Africans, who composed a large part of Gadhafi's army, raising the specter of the revenge killings that Clinton has cautioned against. The opposition has posted a $1.4 million bounty for Gadhafi's capture or death. Though he hasn't been reported seen since rebel forces began advancing last weekend into the Libyan capital, he appeared to have issued another audio message in which he exhorted his followers to fight for control of the capital. ""Tripoli is for you, men and women,"" the speaker said. ""Go out, go out and free Tripoli. Destroy them wherever they are, fight them. Let the crowds from everywhere march to Tripoli."" The speaker added, ""Libya is for you"" and not for France or its president, Nicolas Sarkozy. France is a leader in the NATO mission in Libya. ""Do not leave Tripoli for the rats, do not leave them. Fight them, destroy them. You are the overwhelming majority, you have marched in millions. March with the same millions but fight this time. Fill the streets and the fields,"" the speaker said. Gadhafi has previously described his adversaries as rats. ""Do not be afraid of bombing, you will not be hit. Do not be afraid at all. They are just stun grenades to scare you. Do not be afraid at all, do not surrender Tripoli."" CNN cannot independently confirm who was speaking in the recording. Special forces from Britain, France, Jordan and Qatar -- on the ground in Libya -- have stepped up operations in support of the rebels in Tripoli and other cities. But a senior opposition official said much of the capital's southern neighborhoods remained dangerous. ""We have 80% of Tripoli liberated,"" said Hisham Abu Hajer, the coordinator of the rebels' brigades in Tripoli. ""The two suburbs of Abu Salim and Al Hadba al Khadra remain contested and fierce fighting with Gadhafi forces continues."" Witnesses told CNN that fighting between rebels and Gadhafi loyalists erupted Thursday at the embattled leader's compound, the scene of a number of clashes in recent days. A giant plume of smoke rose from the compound in Bab al-Aziziya two days after it was seized by rebels. Rebels controlled Tripoli's international airport, but were struggling to secure an area east of it.  Gadhafi loyalists destroyed an empty Libyan airline passenger plane parked at the airport Thursday -- the third plane destroyed in 24 hours. ""The Tripoli airport is under the control of the rebels, but it is still being shelled by Gadhafi forces with Grad missiles,"" Abu Hajer said. NATO is trying to learn how many surface-to-air missiles and launchers may still be operational inside Libya and who controls them, a NATO official told CNN Thursday. Several months ago, the U.S. military estimated Libya had an arsenal of 20,000 SAMs, but it was not clear how many may have been destroyed during the conflict and who has control of the remaining missiles. The State Department's Nuland also said the 10 tons of mustard gas stored at the Waddan Ammunition Reservation in Libya are secure ""inside massive steel containers within heavy bunkers."" But Nuland also referred to discussions with the transitional council about taking over external security of the facility, raising the question about who is now watching over them. A U.S. official said the same Libyan government unit that had been guarding the mustard gas stockpile is still doing so, an indication that Gadhafi security forces were still present. But the official said monitoring of the facility has determined ""they have neither abandoned their posts, nor tried to gain access to the materials."" The materials ""are secure, guarded and not disturbed,"" said the official. At hospitals across Tripoli, overwhelmed doctors and nurses attempt to care for the wounded. Robin Waudo, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said two surgical teams were en route from Europe with the first scheduled to arrive Friday. In Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, the NTC said it was negotiating with the longtime ruler's tribal leaders for their surrender without bloodshed. Abu Hajer said the process of moving government ministries from the opposition base in Benghazi to the capital has inched forward, with about four or five ministerial level officials of the NTC already in Tripoli. In the oil-rich city of al-Brega, several crude oil storage tanks continued burning more than six days after they were set ablaze by retreating Gadhafi troops, said Ramadan Shalash, the refinery fire chief. CNN's Joe Vaccarello, Richard Roth, Jack Maddox, Dan Rivers, Sara Sidner, Arwa Damon, Raja Razek, Jomana Karadsheh, Hada Messia, Kareem Khadder, Richard Allen Greene, Barbara Starr, Pam Benson, Moni Basu, Tom Cohen and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","$1.5 billion expected to be released soon for humanitarian aid .

"(CNN) -- Fantasia Barrino left the Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital Wednesday where she was admitted Monday after overdosing on ""aspirin and a sleep aid,"" her manager said. ""She has been lifted up by the outpouring of love and support from her fans,"" Brian Dickens said in a written statement Wednesday evening. Barrino's overdose came the same day she read a court complaint from a woman who alleged that the singer carried on a year-long affair with her husband, Dickens said. Audio of the 911 call made Monday evening from Barrino's home was released by police Wednesday. ""An individual took a bottle of aspirin, and she's slowly losing consciousness,"" the caller said. A police report released Tuesday identified the caller as Dickens. The incident capped off a day for Barrino that included a barrage of media reports about a child custody case filed last week. Paula Cook charged that Barrino and her husband, Antwaun Cook, became romantically involved last August. ""Fantasia is heartbroken and is sorry for any pain she may have caused,"" Dickens said in a written statement Tuesday. ""Yesterday, she was totally overwhelmed by the lawsuit and the media attention."" The statement acknowledged the affair, saying ""Fantasia fell in love with Mr. Cook and believed that he loved her."" The former ""American Idol"" winner's affair was based on lies he told her, Dickens said. ""Fantasia believed Mr. Cook when he told her he was not happy in his marriage and his heart was not in it,"" Dickens said. ""She believed him when he told her he and Mrs. Cook separated in the late summer of 2009. She believed Mr. Cook when he told her he lived elsewhere."" Cook even took her to a residence where he claimed he lived apart from his wife, Dickens said. Photos of Barrino and Cook were published online in recent months, prompting questions about their relationship. ""Fantasia gave inconsistent interviews about the status of her relationship with Mr. Cook because sometimes they were on and sometimes they were off,"" Dickens said. ""When they were on, they spent most of their time together when she was not traveling with work."" She read Paula Cook's child custody complaint for the first time Monday, Dickens said. ""She knows some of the allegations in Mrs. Cook's complaint are totally false,"" he said. ""There are others she strongly doubts. There is plenty she does not know."" The petition, which said the couple separated in June, described a phone conversation in July in which Barrino allegedly told the wife: ""He don't want you. ... Maybe the next time that you get a husband, you'll know how to keep him. ... That's why he is here with me."" While Barrino is not directly involved in the current legal case, North Carolina is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection. Barrino's raw talent as a songstress, combined with her hard-luck story as a teenage mother, won her many fans, starting with her winning ""American Idol's"" third season. Her six-year-long entertainment career has been pockmarked with adversity, including being sued by her own father and well-publicized financial troubles. The High Point, North Carolina, native's newest album, which has received favorable reviews, will be released on August 24, while the second season of her reality show debuts next month.","Manager Brian Dickens: Fantasia Barrino was ""lifted up"" by fans' love .

"WILMINGTON, Delaware (CNN) -- Sen. Joe Biden was always in charge when he was a boy, his younger sister said. Not because he bullied the other kids, but because he appealed to their ""better angels."" Joe Biden greets supporters at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, on August 31. ""He was always the guy who led the pack, and it wasn't because he stood up and pounded his chest and said, 'C'mon and follow me,'"" his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, said. ""The kids just naturally followed him."" Owens, who is three years younger than the 65-year-old vice presidential candidate, said she was her brother's sidekick when the two grew up in their Scranton, Pennsylvania, neighborhood with their brother and sister. ""I opened my eyes, and he was there,"" she said. ""He always taught that I could stretch. He encouraged me to achieve and try things that I would never have tried before,"" she said. Biden ""was the kid who brought all the kids into the pack"" and was a boy ""who did the right thing, and did the right thing by other kids,"" Owens said.  Watch Biden revealed in documentary » . ""He was always the fearless leader ... and he's always, you know, [saying], 'It's your turn. Now, you. Try it again. You can do it. Go ahead,'"" she said. Owens said her older brother always tried to make kids feel part of the group because he knew what it felt like to feel excluded. One kid in high school called him ""Dash Biden"" because he stuttered and it took him a long time to pronounce his name, Owens said. ""A fierce determination that he was not going to allow an imperfection to hold him back,"" drove him to overcome the stuttering, she said. ""There are not excuses so he had to figure out a way to overcome it,"" Owens said. ""He practiced, and he used to take verses from Emerson and Yeats and he would memorize them.""  Watch how Biden overcame his stutter » . Stuttering would not be the last -- or even the greatest -- challenge Biden would face in his life. Shortly after he was elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 29, Biden's first wife, Nealia, and a daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car accident. His sons, Beau and Hunter, survived the crash, and Biden took the Amtrak train from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, daily to take care of them. After the accident, Biden was ""devastated -- his world was gone,"" Owens said. But Biden ""put one foot in front of the other"" and made sure he took care of his children, she said. ""I think that's why he connects with people,"" she said. ""As my dad said, 'It's not how you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get back up.'"" Follow a timeline of Biden's career » .

Now, Owens said, Biden's ability to unite people and appeal ""to the better instinct in human nature"" -- the same traits he showed when he was a boy in Scranton -- are why he is a good running mate for Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee. ""He never would have signed on and agreed to run with Sen. Obama unless he thought he could make a difference, unless he believed in Sen.

"(CNN) -- Iran denied reports of a grenade exploding near the convoy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during his visit to a western Iranian city Wednesday. The semi-official Fars News Agency and several other outlets had reported the incident, in which Ahmadinejad was unhurt. But the media department at Iran's presidential office denied there was an attack. Media advisor Ali Akbar Javanfekr told CNN that the grenade was a toy firecracker and accused international journalists of blowing the story out of proportion. ""This was someone playing with a firecracker, the kind children play with, the kind you use when you want to celebrate,"" Javanfekr said. ""This was a toy and there were no injuries but the western media took and made it bigger than it is."" Did you see the reported incident? Share your video, photos . Despite the denial, there was an account about the incident on Raja news, a rightist website linked to some members of parliament that has in the past both supported and criticized Ahmadinejad. The site reported there had been a grenade attack and quoted the Fars news account. Someone lobbed a homemade grenade just after the president's motorcade went by, Fars reported. The suspect was arrested, according to both reports. The grenade exploded during the president's visit to the city of Hamedan, reported parlemannews.com. The account was also carried by the conservative website Khabar Online. The presidential convoy was headed from the airport to the city's sports stadium. The reports also said that Ahmadinejad warned on Tuesday that ""Zionists"" were plotting to kill him. Iran uses the word ""Zionists"" to refer to Israel.

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old who went missing from his home in Dewey, Arizona, on Monday night was found dead Wednesday, according to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. The body of Emmett Trapp was found by search and rescue personnel at 11:30 a.m. about one mile from his home, lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site. ""We are just devastated by the loss of this little boy,"" sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. The area where his body was found on the former Iron King Mine site is being treated as a crime scene, which the sheriff's office described as ""common protocol."" The cause of death appears to be a result of spending more than 24 hours exposed to Arizona's elements, Sgt. Jeff Newnum said. An autopsy was scheduled to be performed later Wednesday, he said. He added that there was ""no foul play at Emmett's body that would suggest something was awry."" Emmett was the second 2-year-old boy to go missing from Yavapai County in 10 days. His case is believed to be unrelated to the disappearance of Sylar Newton -- another 2-year-old who went missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock and is presumed dead, D'Evelyn said Tuesday. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The mother told authorities that she and her four children were at their home in the Dewey-Humboldt area, about 80 miles north of Phoenix. When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening, Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top, diaper and no shoes -- was missing. The family dog had also apparently wandered off with Emmett, but returned when called. The mother told police she searched around the home and immediate area without success. Newnum said the door to the house was unlocked at the time of Emmett's disappearance, and it appears the boy walked as many four miles, crossing hilly, rough terrain, before he was found. Newnum credited the muddy terrain in the area with helping find Emmett. He said the small footprints around the site indicate the boy ""was by himself.""","NEW: The boy was found in a muddy pit on an old mining site .

"(CNN) -- A man who shot eight people dead Tuesday at a Connecticut beverage distributor before turning the gun on himself chased at least one of his victims through the building and out into a parking lot, police said Wednesday. Police are still attempting to determine whether Omar Thornton targeted his victims, said Manchester, Connecticut police Lt. Chris Davis. But ""it's probably likely that he was targeting some individuals,"" he said, as some of those who died were in management. Thornton passed others by without shooting them, he said. Authorities said Thornton, 34, resigned under pressure Tuesday after he was accused of stealing alcoholic beverages while on his driving route for Hartford Distributors. As he left that meeting, escorted by two people, Thornton said he wanted a drink of water and went into the kitchen area, Davis said. Police believe he had brought two 9mm handguns to the building in a lunchbox. In the kitchen, he pulled out the guns and shot his two escorts. Thornton then ""went through the whole building in a very short amount of time"" as workers cowered under desks and in ""nooks and crannies"" and 9-1-1 calls poured in, Davis said. Read 9-1-1 call transcript . He would not say whether anyone was shot in the parking lot, but said Thornton shot through a glass door to re-enter the building. Asked about allegations that Thornton, who was African-American, had experienced racial discrimination at work, Davis said police, working with the company, had found no evidence of discrimination. A girlfriend of Thornton had indicated he was a victim of racial harassment at the beverage center, the girlfriend's mother, Joanne Hannah, said Tuesday. She said Thornton told the girlfriend he had reported it to a company supervisor and a union representative but nothing was done about it. ""There is nothing on record of any complaints from Omar and there had been no disciplinary actions with him prior to this,"" said Chris Roos, secretary and treasurer of Teamsters Local 1035, said Wednesday. The first 9-1-1 call came in at 7:26 a.m., Davis said, and the first officers arrived within three minutes. A five-man team was sent into the building to search for the suspect within 10 minutes, he said. Thornton's body was found in a corner office area of the building by 8:15 a.m. Earlier Wednesday, Manchester police identified the eight slain people as Francis Fazio, 57, of Bristol, Connecticut; Douglas Scuton, 56, of Middletown, New Hampshire; Edwin Kennison, 49, of East Hartford, Connecticut; William Ackerman, 51, of . Broadbrook, Connecticut; Bryan Cirigliano, 51, of Newington, Connecticut; Craig Pepin, 60, of South Windsor, Connecticut; Louis Felder Jr., 50, of Stamford, Connecticut; and Victor James of Windsor, Connecticut, who was killed on his . 61st birthday. The injured people were Steven Hollander, 50, of South Windsor. He was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Jerome Rosenstein, 77, of West Hartford, Connecticut, remained in serious condition, authorities said Wednesday. Cirigliano was the shop steward for the Teamsters union and its president, Roos said Tuesday. One of those killed was attempting to escape from the gunfire and drove a forklift into an electrical conduit, starting an electrical fire, Davis said Wednesday. He would not say whether that person was shot. Police also found a shotgun in Thornton's vehicle, but believe it was not used in the shootings, Davis said. Thornton was ""fairly nomadic,"" he said, and authorities have searched his previous addresses, but found nothing of value. Asked whether the company had taken security measures for the meeting with Thornton, Davis said some measures were taken. The company had had a private investigator follow Thornton in an effort to determine whether he was taking the alcohol, he said. Thornton left no notes behind, and made no comments to relatives about his plans, Davis said, but the fact that he brought the guns to the building indicates the shootings were ""obviously something he was thinking about doing."" Thornton had six guns registered to him, and police were attempting to account for them all, he said. Authorities believe the guns used in the shootings were bought at a gun dealership in East Windsor, Connecticut. Joanne Hannah said Thornton showed her daughter, Kristie Hannah, a cell phone photo of racial epithets and a stick figure with a noose around its neck drawn on a restroom stall. He said he was in a stall once and heard a coworker say they ""wanted that n----- out of there,"" she said. Thornton's mother told CNN affiliate WFSB that she received a phone call from him shortly after 7 a.m. Tuesday. He told her he had just shot several people and planned to kill himself. She said she told WFSB that she pleaded with him not to do it for 10 minutes, but it didn't work. ""He said, 'I killed the five racists that was there bothering me,'"" Will Holliday, Thornton's uncle, told WFSB. ""He said, 'That's it. The cops are going to come in so I'm going to take care of it myself.'"" About 50 people were in the building at the time, officials said. ""It couldn't have happened at a worse time of day,"" Teamsters union official John Hollis told CNN affiliate WTNH. ""They have third shift going on, the first shift coming on, the office staff there, the sales staff there."" About 170 people work at the company, Roos said. The shootings left the company and the community in shock. A memorial service was planned for Wednesday night to allow community members to grieve. At the company Wednesday, employees comforted one another. One man, identified only as Roy, was in the building at the time of the shootings. One employee embraced Roy. Asked afterward how Roy had described the incident, the man said Roy told him, ""Pure hell, Al, and just walked away. Pure hell ... And I'm sure it was.""

"(CNN) -- A second 2-year-old boy has gone missing in 10 days from Yavapai County, Arizona, authorities said Tuesday as they announced a major search effort under way for the toddler, identified as Emmett Trapp. Emmett's disappearance is believed to be unrelated to the case of Sylar Newton, another 2-year-old who was reported missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock, Yavapai County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. Sylar's disappearance is now being investigated as a criminal case, authorities said Monday. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The mother told authorities that she and her four children were at their home in the Dewey-Humboldt area, about 80 miles north of Phoenix. When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening, Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top and a diaper -- was missing. The family dog had also apparently wandered off with Emmett but returned when called. The mother told police she searched around the home and immediate area without success. Authorities have conducted aerial as well as ground searches for the boy, according to the sheriff's office. ""There is no evidence of foul play associated with the missing child as of now,"" the news release said. Meanwhile, D'Evelyn said Tuesday that the investigation into Sylar's disappearance is ongoing. Sylar was last seen shortly after midnight July 24, sleeping in a tent with his custodial family at the Beaver Creek Campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. July 25, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag. ""The sheriff's office believes Sylar did not wander from the campground, and he is presumably dead,"" Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh said Monday. ""The search effort is now in a recovery mode and the investigation has become criminal in nature."" Waugh said investigators have spent three days searching more than 200 tons of garbage in a nearby landfill ""to try to determine if in fact the boy's body was there."" Sylar was camping with Christina Priem and her children when he disappeared. Priem has said she was in the process of adopting the boy from his biological mother. D'Evelyn said last week that ""there's no evidence"" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, ""but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated."" About 25 other people were at the campgrounds the night of Sylar's disappearance, all of whom have cooperated with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.","Emmett Trapp was last seen Monday evening .

"(CNN)  -- All but one of the dogs seized in the Michael Vick dog fighting case will be placed with families or put in a ""sanctuary,"" where they will interact with people to overcome their fear and lack of socialization, according to court order filed Monday. Michael Vick pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy charges related to dog fighting. One of the 49 seized dogs ""has a history biting humans"" and will be euthanized, according to a motion filed in Virginia in U.S. District Court. U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg said the dog -- identified as number 2621 -- ""exhibited intense aggression to humans to the point where the evaluation could not safely be completed."" The recommendation came more than a month after the court ordered the dogs evaluated by U.S. Department of Agriculture contractors. Last month a team of animal behavior experts selected by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals analyzed the dogs, and then recommended whether they were best suited with families, trained as police dogs, placed in a sanctuary or euthanized. Federal authorities anticipate recommending a guardian be appointed to oversee the placement of the other dogs. Vick pleaded guilty in August to federal conspiracy charges related to dog fighting on his property in Surry County, Virginia. He is to be sentenced on the federal charges on December 10. Last month, a federal judge tightened restrictions on Vick after he tested positive for marijuana use. The suspended Atlanta Falcons player must submit to any method of drug testing required by the pretrial services officer or the supervising officer. He must participate in substance abuse therapy and mental health counseling if the pretrial services officer or supervising officer orders that. Vick was also ordered to stay home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. He is to be electronically monitored during that time. Vick also faces state charges related to dog fighting. He will be arraigned on state charges on October 3 in a Virginia court. E-mail to a friend .","Only one of the 49 dogs seized will be euthanized .

"(CNN) -- Police in Leesburg, Virginia, and Genesee County, Michigan, suspect three recent attacks in Leesburg are linked to the stabbing deaths of five people and injuries to 10 others in the Flint area. Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton confirmed in a news conference Monday that Michigan authorities have been in contact with police in Virginia, saying ""there are some similarities"" between the assaults in both states. Leyton said the Virginia victims' description of the suspect as well as their description of the suspect's vehicle led authorities to make the possible connection. Elsewhere, police in Toledo, Ohio, said Monday that a stabbing there fits the pattern of the Michigan attacks and could be linked to the same suspect as well. The suspect is described by Michigan authorities as a white man in his late 20s to early 30s. All of the Michigan victims but one are black, leading authorities to consider a possible racial motive. Two of the three Virginia attacks involved black victims as well, Leyton said. Leesburg police told CNN they have established a $5,000 reward for anyone providing information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case. ""We have no information at this point to say he's either still here or he has fled,"" Leesburg Police Chief Joe Price told a news conference. ""We are continuing our operations as if he is still here."" Price called the suspect ""very desperate and very dangerous."" The FBI is assisting in the investigation, Leesburg and Genesee County officials said. Leyton said the timing of the attacks in Virginia ""is such that it could be the same individual."" The Michigan attacks began May 24. The most recent was August 2. Previously, only 13 stabbings were believed related in the Flint area. ""We now believe there are 15 stabbings potentially attributed to the same suspect,"" Leyton announced Monday. The three attacks in Leesburg occurred August 3, 5 and 6. The stabbing in Ohio occurred August 7, according to Sgt. Bill Wauford of the Toledo Police Department. Officials in Michigan say the attacker is believed to be driving a Chevy Blazer or GMC Jimmy, model years 1995-2005, with a two-tone green top over a beige or gold bottom. Virginia authorities provided a similar description: an older model 1995-2000 Chevy S-10 Blazer with a dark green upper and a lighter tan or beige color on the lower panels. The suspect is described as a stocky, unshaven white man usually wearing a baseball cap. ""We know he is a strong individual,"" Leyton said, adding that the suspect is ""preying on individuals who are alone on the street."" The Michigan victims' ages have ranged from 17 to 60 years old, according to Leyton. All of the victims have been men, and in two cases they were people with special needs. Price said the Virginia victims ""all appear to have been smaller in stature or more of an older age than our suspect -- in other words, people that he thinks he can physically handle."" The suspect is believed to approach victims who are on foot during the early morning hours, asking for directions or other assistance to lure them closer to his car, Leyton said. The Toledo Police Department's Wauford said the method of attack in the Ohio case matched the Michigan incidents. The attack occurred Saturday about 7:45 p.m. after a 59-year-old man -- also black -- was taking a smoke break from his job as a church custodian, Wauford said. ""A suspect approached him asking for directions and started stabbing him for no apparent reason,"" Wauford said, adding that the incident occurred near a major interstate highway. Authorities were able to speak to the victim for only a short time Saturday night before he was rushed into surgery for a collapsed lung, Wauford said. Police were able to get a description of the suspect's vehicle -- a dark green early '90s Chevy Blazer. Leyton confirmed Michigan authorities are in touch with police in Toledo, but declined to definitively link that attack, saying ""it is very fresh and we just obtained the information."" The five Michigan victims who did not survive the attacks are David Motley on May 24; Emmanuel Dent on June 21; Darwin Marshall on July 26; Frank Kellybrew on July 30; and Arnold Miner on August 2. CNN's Sarah Aarthun and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Police in Ohio say a recent attack in their state could also be linked .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water. The aid requested is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake this year -- but twice as many Pakistanis are in dire need of help. The money poured in for survivors of Haiti's quake, but the funds are only slowly trickling in for people left homeless or ill in the wake of widespread flooding in the South Asian nation. Is it because the earthquake was such a sudden shock, destroying huge chunks of cities and villages within a matter of 35 horrifying seconds while Pakistan's floods evolved over three weeks? That's part of the reason, said Alex Wynter of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people,"" Wynter said. ""However, this is a totally exceptional flood. I have seen quite a number of floods in my time, but never anything remotely approaching this scale."" Much also depends on media coverage and the images that permeate television and computer screens. In Haiti, pictures of the collapsed presidential palace and vast tent cities tugged at hearts. ""It's very hard to compare disasters,"" said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). ""Haiti was instant, extremely visual. There was an outpouring of sympathy. Pakistan has been a slowly evolving disaster."" Though it is far from truth, the suffering in Pakistan appears more muted than when dump trucks carried thousands of crushed bodies to mass graves outside the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake. The flooding in Pakistan has been of epic proportions: 20 million people affected; more than 1,400 dead; 900,000 homes damaged; 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases. More people have been affected than in the 2004 South Asia tsunami, the 2005 South Asia earthquake, and the Haiti earthquake combined. But the enormous scale of Pakistan's tragedy has been hard to grasp. The death toll has not been nearly as high as it was in those previous disasters. Ironically, that may be a reason why aid has been slow to come in. ""The public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower, so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it,"" said Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for OCHA in Pakistan. ""The slow onset of the emergency meant that nobody knew the real scale at the beginning. It is a picture which is still evolving,"" he said. The United Nations asked for $460 million to cover six million Pakistanis over the next three months, but has only raised one-third of that so far. In Haiti, the United Nations received $286 million in just three days. Its request for $1.2 billion for three million Haitians over a six-month period was fulfilled within a couple of weeks, Reader said. Farzana Shaikh, an expert on Pakistan for the London-based Chatham House think-tank, blamed the country's reputation on the international stage for the low donor turnout. Many people associate Pakistan with Islamic militancy. ""Pakistan is seen to have done the international community the disservice of aiding and abetting terrorism, and this perception has almost certainly influenced people's willingness to dig deep into their pockets,"" Shaikh said. There are also perceptions that Pakistan is mired in corruption and that money donated in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake disappeared into a black hole. ""Unless Pakistan can show that it can be transparent, the international community will be wary of pumping in the kind of money that it needs at the moment,"" Shaikh said. ""In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."" Donors like to give money to problems they feel they can help solve. They like to make a difference, said Peter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton University who has studied the subject. ""There's lots of evidence that shows people are less likely to help if they feel it's a really big problem and they can't make a difference,"" said Singer, author of ""The Life You Can Save."" ""When you hear the extent of the problem in Pakistan, I think there is a sense of futility."" Haiti was smaller -- and closer to America. Americans felt a moral responsibility to help and dug deep into their pockets. What was Haiti's gain has been Pakistan's loss, said Waleed Rauf, country director in Pakistan for the humanitarian agency CARE. He called it Haiti donor fatigue. In the middle of a recession, to boot. ""There was a great outpouring of aid for Haiti,"" Rauf said from Islamabad. ""So we know it's there. People are suffering in Pakistan. He urged people to think of it this way: Take the effects of Hurricane Katrina in the four coastal states and multiply the misery. Over and over again.","The response to the Haiti earthquake was quicker and more generous .
Aid experts think it has to do with the evolving nature of the flooding .
They also point to Pakistan's global image and donor fatigue ."
"(TIME.com) -- Forget brain-training exercises, 12-hour shifts and those long, uninterrupted, caffeine-fueled study binges. When you really need new information to sink in, you can't skimp on taking breaks, new research suggests. That's the message from a study by psychologists and neuroscientists at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, who asked a small group of normally aging elderly men and women to recall as many details as possible from two stories they were told. Following one of the stories (but not always the same one for all the participants), the men and women were instructed to relax, take a brief break and close their eyes for 10 minutes in a dark room. Following the other story, those same participants were instead distracted with a new task, spotting the differences between pairs of nearly identical images. Overall, the study participants remembered many more details of whichever story they heard before they were told to rest — and their striking memory boost persisted even a full week out after the story-telling. Take heed, students, doctors and anyone else who has to process large amounts of information: the elderly may worry most about memory, but given what we know about how memories form, these new findings have implications for people of all ages. TIME.com: Quizzes help the brain learn . Previous research has already shown that both the young and the old have better recall of, say, a list of words if they're allowed to rest for a few minutes in between learning the words and then regurgitating them. What this latest study adds, however, is evidence that a few minutes of wakeful rest may have an effect even on long-term memory consolidation. In fact, when we first encounter new information, it seems, we are probably ""just at a very early stage of memory formation,"" according to Michaela Dewar, the research fellow who is first author on the new study. ""Further neural processes have to occur after this stage for us to be able to remember this information at a later point in time,"" she told reporters. Those neural processes don't have to be consciously planned, however. Research on rats has shown the animals will ""re-play"" in their brains the things that have just happened to them — things like walking through a maze — if they are given some idle time. Scans of human brains suggest that people do the same thing, and, importantly, that this brain activity occurs automatically, without people having to think about it. The volume of that brain activity is then linked to memory retention later. TIME.com: Want to sharpen your mind? Drop a few pounds . Similarly, there is a growing body of evidence on the crucial role of sleep in memory consolidation. The precise mechanisms are not well understood, but sleep seems important both for ""declarative"" memory (remembering facts) and especially for ""procedural"" memory — remembering how to do things, like learning to ride a bike or to play scales on a piano. In fact, it's even been suggested that sleep's major role in procedural memory is the reason that infants spend most of their lives asleep; they need that time, perhaps, to consolidate new memories about how to control their young bodies. TIME.com: Are e-books harder to remember? But if resting, either while awake or asleep, is so important for memory consolidation, then it's unfortunate there seem to be so very many distractions everywhere we turn. ""In this day and age of information overload there are few opportunities to sit back and rest,"" Dewar and her colleagues write in their new paper, to be published in Psychological Science. Whether at work or at school, to learn new tasks well, it may help to schedule in some genuine down time. This article was originally published on TIME.com .

"(CNN) -- French forces have seized a significant arms cache in northern Mali believed to have belonged to Islamist jihadist groups, including ""tons"" of heavy weapons, suicide belts and equipment for improvised explosive devices, France's defense minister said Friday. Speaking from Bamako, Mali, on Europe 1 radio, Jean-Yves Le Drian said he'd toured the ""sanctuary of al Qaeda in Mali"" and saw the radical Islamists' arsenal sitting in caves. ""(The arms were) destined to break the security of our own territory,"" the minister said. French and allied forces, including Malian and Chadian troops, have made significant inroads in recent weeks combating Islamist extremist fighters. Still, fighting continues in mountainous areas in the northeastern part of the West African nation, and Le Drian said that security in the key northern city of Gao remains a concern as well. France will begin to reduce its troop levels in Mali next month in an effort to have West African forces, with the support of the United Nations, take over and maintain security in the country, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said earlier this week. When asked Friday if France's intervention in Mali is mostly complete, Le Drian said that his country has ""accomplished a big part of the mission, but the last part is the hardest."" Beyond combing through their weapons, French forces are using DNA tests to identify some of the slain Islamist fighters, Fabius said. Those tests could establish whether Moktar Belmoktar or Abdelhamid Abou Zeid -- two men who have been major figures in al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- are among the dead, as has been suggested by others but not confirmed by France. French citizens among radical fighters in Mali, minister says . Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. Nearly 4,000 French soldiers are now deployed in Mali, according to the French Defense Ministry website, alongside about 6,300 troops from Chad and the African-led International Support Mission to Mali.","France's defense minister describes seeing sizable arms caches in northern Mali .

"(CNN) -- Echoing an airline chief and flight attendants, U.S. Rep. Ed Markey came out Saturday against the Transportation Security Administration's move to allow small pocketknives on airplanes, calling it unnecessary, counterproductive and potentially dangerous. In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, the Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed. ""The attacks on September 11, 2001, demonstrated that in the confined environment of an airplane, even a small blade in the hands of a terrorist can lead to disaster,"" wrote Markey, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat recently vacated by John Kerry. ""... In addition, the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at TSA checkpoints, potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security."" Knives on a plane? Really? Under the new rules outlined this week, knives with blades no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) and less than a half-inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is retractable and does not lock into place. Razorblades and box cutters are still prohibited. The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. Pistole said the move brings the United States into alignment with international rules and are keeping with his ""risk-based security"" approach. Kip Hawley, who oversaw the TSA from 2005 to 2009, said the search for knives interferes with the search for objects such as bombs and toxins that can threaten aircraft. Ex-TSA chief backs decision . But others have sharply criticized the change, which takes effect April 25. They include the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, a nearly 90,000-member group that has launched a campaign to reverse the TSA's decision. The policy is also opposed by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a union representing more than 26,000 officers from 65 agencies. And Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said Friday that he shares the same ""legitimate concerns"" as his flight attendants. Delta CEO opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft . ""If the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow, there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk-based screening mechanisms,"" he wrote in a letter to Pistole.","The TSA said it would allow small knives onto planes, starting April 25 .

"(CNN) -- Joe Kistel and Penny Malphrus have never met. But they are connected in a way that may help provide each of them with an answer to the same question: Could strewn pieces of metal recently found partially buried in the sandy ocean floor 20 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida, be what's left of a plane that disappeared without a trace 16 years ago? The story begins on February 17, 1996. That's the day Penny's father, Stewart Dunbar, an experienced pilot, took off on a short solo flight from Swainsboro, Georgia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Dunbar was returning home after going to show his twin engine propeller-driven Piper Aerostar to a prospective buyer who, as it so happened, failed to show up for the scheduled appointment. Shortly after he took off around 7:45 p.m., Dunbar, 58, reported feeling dizzy and said he was having trouble seeing. He radioed a distress call and advised the radio control tower in Jacksonville, Florida, of his coordinates. In what would be his last communication, he said he was placing the plane on autopilot and turning toward the ocean. Though never certain, the family believes Dunbar, realizing his predicament and unable to control the light transport aircraft, wanted to steer the plane away from land and avoid hurting anyone. If her father was unconscious, Penny Malphrus, who was 24 at the time, theorizes, his body might have shifted against the controls, putting the plane down off the coast near Jacksonville. Two fighter jets were scrambled from a Navy base at Charleston, South Carolina, and got close enough to see the plane but couldn't see inside the cockpit. The fighters ran low on fuel and turned around. Despite a lengthy aerial and water search by the Coast Guard and Navy, not a single piece of Dunbar's plane was ever found. ""I spend countless weeks imagining his fuselage possibly still intact, bouncing around in the ocean like a bottle thrown to sea waiting to be found,"" Malphrus, now 39, said quietly this week from the same Hilton Head Island home where she grew up. ""If there's a chance he could still be alive somehow, he will find me here waiting, same address, same phone number as it was before and always will be,"" she said with a mixture of hope and resignation. ""If he survived, I was certain he was out there floating around like a cork surviving on the snack pretzels, chips and soft drinks that he always kept onboard for his passengers,"" she reflected. Enter into the narrative: 31-year-old Joe Kistel, the executive director of TISIRI (Think It Sink It Reef It), a non-profit Jacksonville-based marine conservation company in the business of protecting the habitat and building artificial reefs. About three weeks ago, Kistel was preparing to visit reef sites off the Florida coast to take pictures for TISIRI's interactive reef map project used by researchers, tourists and maritime enthusiasts. Kistel said his depth finder detected something on the sea floor and what looked like fish 80 feet below the surface. ""We decided to check it out, out of curiosity,"" he said. ""You just never know."" He and another diver put on scuba gear and went down but didn't find any fish. They expanded their search. That's when they noticed a weed-shaped object like a coat hanger, a piece of stainless steel and other debris that Kistel initially thought might have fallen off a barge. What they found were plane parts: two Lycoming piston engines, an engine block and a bent propeller, but no fuselage. Lycoming engines were used on Piper Aerostars. They took photos and, once on shore, started looking for answers. Hearing about the discovery, local fishermen led them to a second site about four miles away where there is a second plane, a larger, perhaps military-type aircraft with at least three tires. Kistel went online to post dozens of photos and video of both sites and to ask the public for help in identifying the planes. Were they remnants of World War II era planes or more recent aircraft? See the photos and videos . Kistel and his team planned to dive this weekend to bring up what they could, but bad weather forced them to reschedule. His company, with its limited budget, isn't equipped to raise heavy pieces, but he said they may be able to use a float bag to drag some of the parts to shore. If they don't work quickly, they worry a hurricane will come along and bury the site. Malphrus will be anxiously waiting. ""Anything for closure,"" she said. She acknowledges she never stops looking, wondering. ""I still check the horizon of the coastline here in Hilton Head Island every day and the newspapers every night,"" she said. Just this week, she and her 9-year-old son, Trent, were walking on the beach right after high tide in the moonlight to observe hundreds of turtles hatching. ""We watched every single one with their cute little wiggly waddle all the way to the water where they just took off. No fear at all,"" she said. Around midnight, Malphrus and her son came upon something unusual partly covered in sand. Could this be it, she thought, part of her father's plane? They started digging and eventually uncovered what appeared to be a gigantic rudder from a ship. ""Never a day goes by that I don't think of him,"" she said by phone the next day. ""My Dad was the most amazing man."" Her search continues. She hopes Joe Kistel finds the answer this time.","NEW: Team cancels plans to dive this weekend due to bad weather .

"(CNN) -- The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said authorities Friday took a fourth person into custody in their ongoing investigation into domestic terrorism. The RCMP said its Integrated National Security Enforcement Team executed a search warrant in Ottawa and took one person into custody.  No charges have been filed. Earlier Friday, a Canadian government source close to the investigation said the three men arrested previously ""are not card-carrying members of al Qaeda but they follow in the movement and show common trends."" RCMP Chief Superintendent Serge Therriault said Thursday the three suspects are Canadian citizens living in Ontario -- Hiva Mohammad Alizadeh, 30, of Ottawa; Misbahuddin Ahmed, 26, of Ottawa; and Khurram Syed Sher, 28, of London. The name of the suspect arrested Friday has not been released. Alizadeh faces three charges: conspiracy, committing an act for a terrorist group and providing or making available property for terrorist purposes. Canadian federal prosecutor David McKercher told CNN the three charges carry maximum sentences ranging from ten years to life in prison. Ahmed has been charged with conspiracy, but he could face more charges, according to his defense attorney.  Ian Carter told CNN he met with Ahmed for half an hour.  Asked how the suspect was feeling, Carter said, ""He is in shock."" Ahmed is married and has a 7-month-old daughter. Sher also is charged with conspiracy, officials said. The RCMP said the three suspects were arrested under Canada's Anti-Terrorism Act, passed in 2001. Therriault said that a yearlong investigation found that in addition to forming part of a terror cell, the suspects possessed schematics, videos, drawings, instructions, books and electrical components designed specifically for the construction of improvised explosive devices.  He said authorities seized more than 50 circuit boards designed to remotely detonate IEDs. In addition, Therriault said, investigators have grounds to believe Alizadeh is a member of and remains in contact with a terror group with links to the conflict in Afghanistan.  One reason the arrests happened when they did, the investigator said, was to prevent Alizadeh from providing financial support for weapons that would be used against coalition forces and Canadian troops in Afghanistan. The three suspects represent the core of the domestic terror group, Therriault said, but the ongoing investigation could result in more arrests. There are no related arrests in the United States, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said there is no clear link between the Canadian suspects and the United States. Therriault said he could not confirm whether there was a direct link to the United States. A Canadian government source close to the investigation told CNN the United States is not the focus of the investigation. U.S. counterterrorism officials said they consider the arrests an internal Canadian matter.

"(CNN) -- After hiking along the Amazon River for more than two years, Ed Stafford is suddenly in a rush. The native Brit, who set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 miles more than two years ago, is hoping to finish his hike on Monday, in time to catch his scheduled flight home to Leicestershire from Brazil. Despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside Sunday morning, Stafford is confident he'll make the plane. ""Feeling much better,"" he wrote in a blog post from northeastern Brazil on Sunday, after catching three hours of sleep. ""...will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometers."" It's the kind of fortitude that Stafford has summoned time and again since setting out from the Amazon's River source in Peru in April 2008, seeking to raise international attention about rain-forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it. Since then, Stafford and Gadiel ""Cho"" Sanchez Rivera -- a Peruvian forestry worker who joined him in July 2008 -- have encountered pit vipers, electric eels, anaconda, mosquitoes and scorpions, but very few doubts about whether they'd reach the Atlantic. ""After grabbing something to eat, and replying to emails I finally got my head down at 1:27 a.m.,"" Stafford wrote in a piece for CNN.com last week, after hiking for 15 straight hours. ""We've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we've achieved, if a little stiff."" Stafford, a former British army captain, and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks. Stafford contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin disease, and had to have a botfly removed from his skull. Cho suffered a nasty machete cut. But their biggest challenges were far less dramatic. ""Although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with (indigenous residents) pointing bows and arrows at our chest, for me that wasn't the hardest part,"" Stafford said last month, "" ... the adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting, potentially dangerous moments like that easily."" ""It's been the mundane that had really challenged me,"" he said. ""... The weight of the rucksack, the basic food, the constant mosquito bites, the constant thorns. The little things that in a two-day expedition wouldn't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging."" The greatest pleasures of the journey, Stafford said, have been the warmth of the Brazilian people, with village children frequently welcoming him and Cho to new towns and their parents offering home-cooked meals. Having never visited the Amazon before starting his expedition, Stafford now says that his quest to save the region won't end with his hike. ""I'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life,"" he wrote on CNN.com this month, ""and I intend to take 'Walking The Amazon' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we've met along the way, the lives in the Amazon and the tale of the jungle."" Though he says that deforestation means the Amazon ""is changing faster than many of us can comprehend,"" Stafford has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking. ""Although (deforestation) is sill going on in the moment,"" he said, ""there's a generation coming through Brazil that are very aware of environmental issue and really do care about the Amazon."" As he closes in on the Amazon's mouth, Stafford has found time to nurse less lofty desires. He says the first thing he'll do after touching down in England is grab a pint of beer. And his Peruvian partner, he says, can't wait for a pint of fresh milk.","Ed Stafford set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 miles .

"(CNN) -- BP moved closer on Monday to sealing, once and for all, its ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico, though government and company officials said their struggle against the spill's extensive environmental and economic damage is far from over. A relief well is expected to start the final shutdown within the week, said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man in the region. Allen said the closer of two relief wells alongside the capped, formerly gushing BP well in the Gulf is 17,909 feet deep and less than 100 feet from intercepting the main well. During the previous 72 to 96 hours, he said, crews had twice drilled for 30 feet at a time, then backed out and put wire down the pipe to gauge the exact location relative to the main well. Allen said drillers would make ""one more run,"" and hoped to intercept, then pump cement into, the main well as early as the end of the week, permanently sealing the crippled well. Crews will have to keep a close watch on inclement weather while drilling. Strong thunderstorms and gusty winds are possible over the main well starting on Wednesday, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The National Hurricane Center said a broad area of low pressure over southern Florida is forecast to move slowly northwestward into the Gulf and toward the north-central Gulf Coast this week. The system has roughly a 30 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the center said. Also on Monday, BP, the oil company that operated the sunken well, released an updated tally on expenses associated with cleanup and containment, which now stands at about $6.1 billion. BP said it has established a trust and made an initial $3 billion deposit of the previously announced $20 billion escrow account to pay ""legitimate"" claims arising from the April 20 Deepwater Horizon incident and the resulting oil and gas spill. The oil giant named two trustees who will administer the account: John S. Martin, a former federal judge for the Southern District of New York, and Kent Syverud, dean of the Washington University School of Law. Citigroup will serve as corporate trustee and paying agent for the account, BP said. Responding to the company's $3 billion deposit, the Justice Department said Monday details of the account have been worked out. A top government attorney noted that BP is fulfilling its obligations. ""We are pleased that BP made an initial contribution and has taken an important step toward honoring its commitment to the president and the residents and business owners in the Gulf region,"" Associate Attorney General Tom Perrelli said in a statement confirming BP's $3 billion installment. Also on Monday, BP's newly-appointed Chief Executive Bob Dudley met with high-level White House officials and Allen to talk about recovery efforts. Government officials stressed the importance of BP living up to its commitments, including the quick payment of claims made by state and local governments, according to a White House statement. President Barack Obama, who has been under pressure to show a strong response to the spill, said he was committed to standing by communities along the Gulf Coast well beyond when the well is closed. ""What is clear is that the battle to stop the oil flowing from into the Gulf is just about over. Our work goes on, though,"" he said in Washington. The oil spill hasn't just hurt BP's bottom line -- it's inflicted heavy blows on Gulf coast industries like tourism and fishing. A group of concerned St. Louis, Missouri, residents said they left on a caravan of support on Monday, spending money at small businesses along the Gulf Coast, using funds raised from around the country. The caravan is expected to travel through Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle, completing its trek on Friday. ""We've learned of so many businesses in the Gulf region that are losing their customers, employees and dreams because of the impact on tourism,"" organizer Dennis Gorg said in a statement. ""As a small business owner, I can't imagine how I'd support the people who depend on me. We can do something. We can become tourists with a purpose."" The well erupted after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 men dead. A temporary cap contained the spill on July 15, and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the oil back into the ocean floor last week. The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped, with some of the oil ending up on beaches or in marshes. Fresh, green grass has begun growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in places. Allen said Monday responders will be ""redoubling"" their efforts in the marshes. ""There's a lot of clean-up working going on here, and that's excellent,"" Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation, told CNN last week. ""But the tide keeps coming and going each and every day."" CNN's Terry Frieden, Eric Fiegel, Ed Lavandera and David Mattingly contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says recovery work will continue beyond when the well is shut .

"(EW.com) -- ""The Closer"" closed out Kyra Sedgwick's involvement in the series on Monday night, installing Mary McDonnell in her place, in a ""new"" series, ""Major Crimes."" While I have no inside information about how McDonnell was originally cast in ""The Closer,"" I'm led to think, based on the premiere episode that aired after the ""Closer"" finale, that she was never intended to be the new star of the show. Because the new show is, I believe, an inevitable disappointment for hardcore ""Closer"" fans. As for those of us who are Mary McDonnell fans? Ambivalence reigns! First of all, the exit of Sedgwick's Brenda Leigh Johnson. (This is your SPOILER ALERT.) ""The Closer"" series finale brought closure to Deputy Chief Johnson's career, as she faced off with her long-running arch-nemesis, the serial rapist Philip Stroh (Billy Burke). Then Johnson abruptly accepted a new job (something like chief of bureau of investigations L.A. liason officer in the D.A.'s office -- it sounded like the longest-titled cushy job possible) and lit out, munching a signature bit of junk food. Over the years, ""The Closer"" had become a light-comedy crime show with heavy-handed humor performed not just by Sedgwick but also the supporting cast that has migrated over to ""Major Crimes,"" especially G.W. Bailey, whose slow burns have become endless fuming, and, only by contrast to a lesser extent, Tony Denison, Michael Paul Chan, Raymond Cruz, and Phillip P. Keene. (I've always found it interesting that Denison and Chan are veterans of two, need I say superior, Michael Mann TV shows, Crime Story and Robbery Homicide Division -- indeed, many of Chan's gestures and body language when he enters a crime scene strongly echo his moves in RHD, and I'd bet that's where he picked up those good habits, from Mann's heavily-researched series.) Ryan Lochte books '90210' gig . In previous guest-star turns, McDonnell's Captain Sharon Raydor has clashed with Johnson and her crew, with her maddeningly (to them) methodical, by-the-book manner. Me, I've always found Raydor's serene assurance a palliative to the twitchy eccentricity of Emmy Award-winning Segwick's Johnson. (As she proved on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" nobody does soothing sensibleness better than McDonnell.) ""Major Crimes"" went out of its way to announce, in one character's words, ""we're changing the focus of [the] major crimes [unit]"" -- that is, from a viewer's vantage point, from an emphasis on the case-closing interrogation (Johnson's trademark speciality, from whence the earlier series got its title) to, as a lawyer phrased it in ""Major Crimes' "" first hour, a ""new deal-making paradigm that [Raydor] wants to put in place."" Me, I like this approach -- it's closer to being the TV equivalent of a police procedural novel crossed with a legal thriller, if well-done. Unfortunately, the first ""Major Crimes"" suffered from obviousness and snail's-pace plotting. 'Joe Schmo' back on Spike TV . In other words, slow-and-steady (and by-the-book) wins the race... but not necessarily the hearts of viewers. ""Major Crimes"" is engineered to be as sober as Raydor's dark horn-rim glasses, whereas ""The Closer"" was as bright and lively as Johnson's trench coats and candy wrappers. The new show tried to start something in Raydor's personal life, with her taking in homeless Rusty, but, boy, does that dynamic look dull. I am rooting for Mary McDonnell to succeed on television once again. But she needs a better vehicle than this. She needs, deserves, a series at least as clever and complex as, say, ""The Good Wife."" Because I have some doubt that, a few weeks in, she and TNT are going to succeed with this good new boss. See the full article at EW.com.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A 33-year-old Israeli citizen was charged with assault with intent to murder in Michigan Thursday in connection with 18 stabbings that left five people dead across three states, according to a Michigan prosecutor. Elias Abuelazam was arrested Wednesday night at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. Abuelazam was trying to board a flight to Israel when he was taken into custody, police said Thursday. The stabbings occurred in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio. Genesee County, Michigan. Prosecutor David Leyton said the lone charge filed against Abuelazam is related to a stabbing in Flint, Michigan on July 27. With a manhunt on in connection to the stabbing spree, Michigan police received a tip that sent them Wednesday to a market where the suspect worked, Leyton said. After talking with employees, police watched surveillance video to determine if he matched the physical description of the attacker. After tracking him to Louisville, Kentucky, authorities learned he had bought a $3,000 ticket from Atlanta to Tel Aviv, Israel, paid for by his uncle. Leyton said Abuelazam had flown from Detroit, Michigan, to Louisville and then on to Atlanta. It was not clear whether he was already en route to Atlanta when authorities identified him as a suspect in the killings. A federal law enforcement official involved in the investigation said the man was traveling on an expired Israeli passport but was in the United States legally. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said they arrested Abuelazam at 10 p.m. ET as he attempted to board Delta Flight 152 bound for Tel Aviv. A Homeland Security official told CNN that the National Targeting Center had found his name on the passenger list. Upon confirmation of his identity, the man was placed in the custody of the FBI and the Atlanta Police Department. Over the past week investigators from a Michigan task force; police departments in Leesburg, Virginia, and Toledo, Ohio; the FBI and numerous other law enforcement agencies have investigated leads and tips from the public. Authorities have said the same person is responsible for three recent attacks in Leesburg, Virginia, the stabbing deaths of five people and wounds to nine others in the Flint, Michigan, area and a stabbing Saturday that wounded a man in Toledo, Ohio. Fourteen of the 16 victims in Michigan were African-American, police said. Flint is a majority African-American community. In majority-white Leesburg, Virginia, two victims were black and one was Latino. Leesburg Police Chief Joseph Price said he believed the suspect was targeting African-Americans. ""For our community... when you look at our demographics and you look at the victims here, my belief is he selected the victims in Leesburg based on the color of their skin,"" Price said. The Michigan attacks began May 24, with the most recent taking place August 2. The three attacks in Virginia occurred Tuesday, Thursday and Friday of last week. The Michigan victims ranged in age from 17 to 60, authorities said. All of the victims were men, and in two cases they were people with special needs. The suspect is said to have approached victims who were on foot during the early morning hours, asking for directions or other assistance to lure them close to his car, police said. Sgt. Bill Wauford of the Toledo Police Department said the method of attack in the Ohio case matched that described in the Michigan incidents. The five Michigan fatalities were identified as David Motley, Emmanuel Dent, Darwin Marshall, Frank Kellybrew and Arnold Miner. Leyton said Abuelazam worked in Flint until August 2 and then told fellow workers he was going to Virginia. He said the suspect had lived in the Flint area since May in a home owned by his uncle. The suspect had a previous address in Florida. Arlington, Virginia, police arrested the suspect on August 5 for failure to obey a highway sign. At the time, police learned he had an outstanding warrant for a prior assault and he was arrested and his 1996 Chevy Blazer was impounded. Police found a knife and hammer inside the car. But he was released that day, and the circumstances of his release were not clear. Also that day, a victim was stabbed in the area, but he told police the assailant was driving a different vehicle. The Blazer was returned to the suspect that night. Abuelazam was in all three states at the time of the stabbings in those states, according to authorities. After police identified his vehicle, they tracked him near an airport in Louisville, Kentucky. Leyton said the suspect was in Toledo at the time of the stabbing there. Investigators continue to investigate and Leyton said more charges are expected. Members of the Michigan task force were in Atlanta Thursday, and Leyton's office was preparing papers for extradition. According to Tracy Flanagan of the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, Abuelazam was processed at the Fulton County Jail and is being held there for the 68th District Court of Flint, Michigan. Barring special circumstances, he should have an extradition hearing in the coming days. ""We ought to remember the victims in all of this,"" Leyton said. ""You have real people who have died and real families who have been torn apart. Our heart goes out to them.""

"(CNN) -- Fantasia Barrino overdosed on ""aspirin and a sleep aid"" and was rushed to a Charlotte, North Carolina hospital Monday night, her manager said. The overdose came the same day she read a court complaint from a woman who alleged that Barrino carried on a year-long affair with her husband, according to manager Brian Dickens. ""Her injuries are not life threatening,"" Dickens said. ""She was dehydrated and exhausted at the time."" She was expected to be released from the hospital Tuesday, he said. WBTV: Fantasia Barrino 911 call . Barrino publicly acknowledged the affair in a statement Tuesday issued by Dickens that said ""Fantasia fell in love with Mr. Cook and believed that he loved her."" ""Fantasia is heartbroken and is sorry for any pain she may have caused,"" Dickens said in a written statement to CNN. ""Yesterday, she was totally overwhelmed by the lawsuit and the media attention."" The former ""American Idol"" winner was hospitalized overnight but was expected to go home Tuesday, Dickens said. The police report obtained by CNN said Dickens called 911 to report the overdose at the singer's home in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a child custody case filed last week, Paula Cook charged that Barrino and her husband, Antwaun Cook, became romantically involved last August. The singer fell in love with Cook based on lies he told her, Dickens said. WCNC: Fantasia was 'overwhelmed' ""Fantasia believed Mr. Cook when he told her he was not happy in his marriage and his heart was not in it,"" Dickens said. ""She believed him when he told her he and Mrs. Cook separated in the late summer of 2009. She believed Mr. Cook when he told her he lived elsewhere."" Cook even took her to a residence where he claimed he lived apart from his wife, Dickens said. Photos of Barrino and Cook were published online in recent months, prompting questions about their relationship. ""Fantasia gave inconsistent interviews about the status of her relationship with Mr. Cook because sometimes they were on and sometimes they were off,"" Dickens said. ""When they were on, they spent most of their time together when she was not traveling with work."" She read Paula Cook's child custody complaint for the first time Monday, Dickens said. ""She knows some of the allegations in Mrs. Cook's complaint are totally false,"" he said. ""There are others she strongly doubts. There is plenty she does not know."" The petition, which said the couple separated in June, described a phone conversation in July in which Barrino allegedly told the wife: ""He don't want you. ... Maybe the next time that you get a husband, you'll know how to keep him. ... That's why he is here with me."" While Barrino is not directly involved in the current legal case, North Carolina is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection. The High Point, North Carolina, native has enjoyed a successful recording and acting career since winning ""American Idol's"" third season. Her second album, which has received favorable reviews, will be released on August 24, while the second season of her reality show debuts next month.

"(CNN) -- Jailed former prison escapee John McCluskey was discovered Tuesday with self-inflicted cuts on his neck and forearms, a source close to the investigation said. McCluskey, 45, was taken from the Mohave County Jail in Kingman, Arizona, to a hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries. The cuts apparently were made with a disposable razor. McCluskey was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of the prison July 30, allegedly with help from Casslyn Mae Welch. Renwick was recaptured the next day, and Province was caught eight days later. But McCluskey and Welch, 44, eluded authorities until late last week. The hunt for the pair ranged from the Southwest to western Montana and along the border with Canada, federal marshals said. Welch and McCluskey appeared in court Friday in Apache County, Arizona, where he faces three counts of kidnapping, two counts of escape, two counts of robbery, two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of misconduct involving weapons. Welch faces a similar but shorter list of charges. Bail was set at $1 million for each. McCluskey and Welch were arrested late Thursday at a campground on the edge of Apache and Sitgreaves National Forests in Springerville, Arizona, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said Friday. A forest service employee noticed an unattended fire at a campsite and spotted a suspicious car backed into some trees, authorities said. A license plate check determined that it matched the description of one recently stolen in New Mexico, near where a couple was murdered. McCluskey and Welch are suspected in the killings of the couple, whose bodies were found in their burned camper this month, according to authorities. Welch, who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates, threw cutting tools over a prison fence to help the men escape, corrections officials said this month. Renwick, 36, was captured August 1 in a shootout with police in Rifle, Colorado. He was serving 22 years for second-degree murder when he escaped. Province, 42, was caught August 9 in Meeteetse, Wyoming, near Yellowstone National Park after authorities were notified by a local resident who sat and talked with Province a day earlier on the steps of a church in town. He was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. Renwick remains in the Garfield County, Colorado, jail on charges of attempted first-degree murder and eluding police, the U.S. Marshals Service said Sunday. Authorities are working to coordinate the transport of Province back to Arizona from Wyoming, expected to occur within the next month, the marshals service said.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham's glittering international career has been brought to an end after England coach Fabio Capello announced his fate in a pre-match television interview. Capello said the 35-year-old Beckham was now ""a little bit old"" -- ending the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star's hopes of adding to his 115 caps. Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Beckham had hoped to crown his England career with a fourth World Cup finals appearance in South Africa, but was ruled out after suffering a serious Achilles tendon injury in March while on loan with Italian club AC Milan. He went to South Africa anyway as an ambassador for England's 2018 World Cup bid and as a mentor for the team, watching the matches from the bench alongside Capello. Beckham blunder: Has crass Capello lost the plot? Beckham may be fit before the end of the American MLS season as he has now returned to light training, but he would not be ready for England's opening Euro 2012 qualifiers next month. ""I say thank you very much for helping me at the World Cup, but probably he is a little bit old,"" Capello told British broadcaster ITV ahead of England's 2-1 friendly win against Hungary in London on Wednesday night. The 64-year-old then confirmed after the match that he had made the decision without informing Beckham. ""Did I phone him before I went on television? No. I think I will speak with him. We tried to speak with him,"" Capello said. ""But I think David knows he has no future with the international team because we have to change. We have to see the new players for the future because the age is important for a lot of people, not only for David. ""I hope when David is okay he can play here the last game at Wembley in a friendly to say goodbye and thank you very much to the crowd. I won't be picking him for any more competitive matches."" However, Beckham's spokesman insisted that the player had not made any decision to end his England career, the UK Press Association reported. ""There has been no discussion of retirement. He will always be available for his country -- when fit and if needed, he will be there,"" the spokesman said in a statement. Beckham had been tipped as a possible successor to Capello after the Italian's position was in doubt following the team's second-round exit at the World Cup, but he insisted he was not interested in becoming a manager. Capello, who signed a new contract before the tournament, was given a vote of confidence by the English Football Association -- and subsequently vowed to bring younger players into his squad. Beckham has previously been axed by Capello while at Real Madrid, but returned to help win the Spanish league title before moving to the United States in 2007. He won more international caps than any other outfield England player, but is 10 short of the country's record held by goalkeeper Peter Shilton. Meanwhile, England's win over Hungary featured another incident that highlighted the need for goal-line technology in football. While England midfielder Frank Lampard had a goal wrongly not awarded against Germany at the World Cup even though it clearly crossed the line, the Hungarians were given a goal that did not appear to go completely over it at Wembley. Debutant Michael Dawson had vainly attempted to clear the ball, which deflected towards the goal off his teammate Phil Jagielka following the former's earlier error. England bounced back from the 62nd-minute incident to win with two goals from captain Steven Gerrard -- the first a dipping effort from outside the penalty area, the second a neat dink over the goalkeeper after a clever twist and turn.","Fabio Capello indicates that David Beckham will not play for England again .

"(Mashable)  -- New mobile photo apps such as Instagram, Picplz and Path represent the next generation of photo sharing -- where high quality photos are snapped and shared in seconds on your mobile device. Instagram and Picplz focus on the instantaneous point-and-share functionality of smart phones while providing users with filters to fancify and enhance photos and the tools to share them with the world. Path makes the same bet that users will capture important moments in their lives on their mobile devices, but instead assumes that users prefer to share these intimate memories with just friends and family. Each aims to capitalize on the convergence of key mobile and social networking trends with a closed-loop approach: users take, share and view photos entirely on their mobile device. Some history . The online photo sharing movement can be looked at in three distinct product cycles: photo-only sites, social networks and now mobile. In the early and mid 2000s there was a measurable boom in online photo sharing services. That boom brought us Flickr, Picasa, Photobucket, ImageShack and dozens more. It also led to key acquisitions -- Yahoo purchased Flickr, Google bought Picasa and Fox Interactive snatched up Photobucket -- and a widespread user interest in using the web to share photos. The trend was also fueled by the prevalence (and falling prices) of digital cameras. In the late 2000s, social networking has dramatically grown in popularity and photo sharing has become standard fare on Twitter and Facebook. These two services alone served as a catalyst for the second photo sharing boom, which had a slightly narrowed focus on instantaneous sharing to friends and followers. As of July of this year, Facebook now sees more than 100 million photo uploads every day. In 2008, TwitPic kicked off the Twitter photo sharing phenomena and dozens of copycats hurried to pile on in the hopes of a building tools for users to quickly share photos on Twitter. This instant photo sharing trend is still on-going and has mutated to include a vast array of services that have added support for posting to Twitter and Facebook, Posterous and Tumblr included. Now in 2010, mobile photo sharing products from Picplz, Instagram and Path represent the next boom in photo sharing. These startups are strategically focusing on mobile first and aiming to capitalize on both the ever-improving quality of smartphone cameras and users' desire to snap and share with ease. The trend in action . Mobile phone cameras have been around for years, but until recently poor photo quality was a deterrent that prevented device owners from using their mobile phones as their primary cameras. That's no longer the case. Now there is a vast array of smartphones available capable of producing photos that are as good, if not better than, the many digital cameras. As a result, more and more users are opting to use their mobile device to capture, save and share stunning photo memories. The common belief is that mobile users want a friction-free way to capture and post photos, minus the clunkiness and time commitment usually required when transferring photos from mobile device to desktop to web. Entrepreneurs and investors are just now starting to build or invest in mobile-only applications specifically designed with these users in mind. Path, for instance, was generating buzz long before its launch thanks to the pedigree of its founders and its all-star cast of investors, including Ron Conway, Keith Rabois, Paul Buchheit and Ashton Kutcher. It's unclear how well its private approach to mobile photo sharing is catching on, but its existence suggests there may be other unexplored roads entrepreneurs can traverse to capitalize on mobile photos. Picplz founder -- and former Imeem creater -- Dalton Caldwell is making an educated bet that mobile photo sharing will become big business. The startup landed $5 million from investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, which clearly shares the same vision. And then there's Instagram, the two month-old, hit iPhone app that signed on more than 100,000 users in its first week and is now seeing two to three photo uploads per second. Some predictions . As more mobile device owners upgrade to smartphones -- and there's still plenty of room for growth here -- and mobile cameras continue to improve in quality, more startups and businesses will form to cater to the modern conveniences that instant mobile sharing affords users. They will build for mobile first and web second, if at all. Plus, since history tends to repeat itself, we can expect Google and Yahoo to make acquisitions to stay competitive in the mobile frontier. Of course, Facebook -- particularly keen on improving its photos offering -- will also continue to make strategic acquisitions to maintain its place in the photo sharing market. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Fantasia Barrino overdosed on ""aspirin and a sleep aid"" and was rushed to a Charlotte, North Caroline hospital Monday night, her manager said. The overdose came the same day she read a court complaint from a woman who alleged that Barrino carried on a yearlong affair with her husband, according to manager Brian Dickens. ""Her injuries are not life threatening,"" Dickens said. ""She was dehydrated and exhausted at the time."" She was expected to be released from the hospital Tuesday, he said. Barrino publicly acknowledged the affair in a statement Tuesday issued by Dickens that said ""Fantasia fell in love with Mr. Cook and believed that he loved her."" ""Fantasia is heartbroken and is sorry for any pain she may have caused,"" Dickens said in a written statement to CNN. ""Yesterday, she was totally overwhelmed by the lawsuit and the media attention."" The former ""American Idol"" winner was hospitalized overnight but was expected to go home Tuesday, Dickens said. The police report obtained by CNN said Dickens called 911 to report the overdose at the singer's home in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a child custody case filed last week, Paula Cook charged that Barrino and her husband, Antwaun Cook, became romantically involved last August. The singer fell in love with Cook based on lies he told her, Dickens said. ""Fantasia believed Mr. Cook when he told her he was not happy in his marriage and his heart was not in it,"" Dickens said. ""She believed him when he told her he and Mrs. Cook separated in the late summer of 2009. She believed Mr. Cook when he told her he lived elsewhere."" Cook even took her to a residence where he claimed he lived apart from his wife, Dickens said. Photos of Barrino and Cook were published online in recent months, prompting questions about their relationship. ""Fantasia gave inconsistent interviews about the status of her relationship with Mr. Cook because sometimes they were on and sometimes they were off,"" Dickens said. ""When they were on, they spent most of their time together when she was not traveling with work."" She read Paula Cook's child custody complaint for the first time Monday, Dickens said. ""She knows some of the allegations in Mrs. Cook's complaint are totally false,"" he said. ""There are others she strongly doubts. There is plenty she does not know."" The petition, which said the couple separated in June, described a phone conversation in July in which Barrino allegedly told the wife: ""He don't want you. ... Maybe the next time that you get a husband, you'll know how to keep him. ... That's why he is here with me."" While Barrino is not directly involved in the current legal case, North Carolina is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection. The High Point, North Carolina, native has enjoyed a successful recording and acting career since winning ""American Idol's"" third season. Her second album, which has received favorable reviews, will be released on August 24, while the second season of her reality show debuts next month.

"(CNN) -- A policeman sacrificed his life for the sake of others, embracing a suicide bomber in southeast Afghanistan on Saturday morning to dull the blast as it detonated, eyewitnesses said. The bomb killed the officer, Murad Khan, and eight minors between the ages of 7 and 17. It wounded two more people, said police spokesman Haji Yaqoob of Khost province. The bomber attempted to enter a village where coalition forces were conducting training exercises with Afghan police, but officers at a checkpoint recognized his explosive vest and stopped him, police said. The training session had convened near the checkpoint, and Yaqoob believes it was the target. In a separate incident Saturday, a suicide bomber on a bicycle detonated himself at a gate to the Afghan defense ministry in Kabul hours after newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel landed in the Afghan capital. Hagel was not in the area at them time of the explosion. The secretary is in Afghanistan to visit American troops and get the lay of the land in the restive country to better advise President Barack Obama. Hagel emphasized that the United States is still at war in Afghanistan despite the current mission to transition into a role of ""training, assistance and advice."" This is the latest suicide attack in the nation. A car bomber drove up to a U.S. military base in Khost province in December, but did not make it past the gate. The vehicle's detonation killed three people -- a security guard and two truck drivers. Coalition forces in Khost are moving from a combat role side by side with Afghan National Army troops to an advisory role. CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote in Atlanta; Jennifer Z.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have pulled out all the stops to find the last of three escaped Arizona convicts and his suspected accomplice Tuesday, and believe the couple may be in western Montana or southwestern Canada, federal law enforcement officials said. Fidencio Rivera, chief deputy U.S. Marshal for Arizona, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that it's believed John McCluskey and Casslyn Mae Welch have left the Yellowstone National Park area where they initially were hiding out after McCluskey and two other men escaped from a prison in Arizona July 30. David Gonzales, the U.S. marshal for Arizona, warned Monday that McCluskey and Welch -- who authorities describe as McCluskey's cousin and fiancee -- ""have nothing to lose"" and may not surrender without a battle. ""It changes by the minute, but we are convinced that they are not going to go down lightly,"" Gonzales told CNN. Rod Ostermiller, the acting U.S. Marshal in Montana, said Monday investigators were looking into whether the pair might have traveled to Montana's Glacier National Park, near the Canadian border. A witness reported seeing Welch in the area, he said. ""We're not taking it lightly,"" Ostermiller said. ""We believe it is a good lead."" As far as survival skills, Rivera said authorities know the couple was familiar with camping, but believe they have limited resources. On Monday night, Ostermiller said his office is coordinating its efforts with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ""We are working leads and interviewing people right now,"" he said. Ostermiller expressed urgency in the hunt for the escapees. ""When they move quick, we have to move quick,"" he said. ""That's what we're doing in this case."" McCluskey, 45, was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of prison July 30. Welch helped the convicts escape by throwing cutting tools over a prison fence, according to Charles Ryan, director of Arizona's Department of Corrections. And McCluskey's mother and ex-wife have been arrested on charges of helping the fugitives, prosecutors said Monday night. Province was captured without incident Monday in Meeteetse, Wyoming, near Yellowstone National Park. Gonzales said authorities were notified by a Meeteetse citizen who sat and talked with Province on Sunday on the steps of a church in town. When the woman returned home and saw the news reports, she immediately recognized Province and called police. Marshals arrested Province at 6:20 a.m. Monday, Gonzales said. When arrested, Province was carrying a 9mm pistol and a hitchhiking sign with ""Casper"" written on it, marshals said. ""He was relieved this manhunt was over for him,"" Gonzales said. Asked whether Province gave authorities any information about the whereabouts of McCluskey and Welch, Rivera said Tuesday he provided ""very limited"" information. Police believe there were some ""half-truths"" in that information and were attempting to corroborate the information he did provide, he said. Renwick, 35, was arrested July 31 in Rifle, Colorado, after a shootout with police, and Province and McCluskey are suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found Wednesday in New Mexico, Gonzales said. ""There was evidence that ties them, our suspects who escaped from prison, directly to their murders,"" Gonzales told CNN. When the initial escape happened, the plan was for the inmates to get into a nearby getaway car, Rivera said. However, in the confusion, Renwick found the vehicle first and left, he said. The other two had money, additional weapons and identification in the vehicle. ""We believe they're desperate"" and will rob or kill to further their escape, he said. A $40,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the remaining escapee's arrest. Authorities urged people to call (602) 542-1212 if they have any information about the case. Before the escape, the 42-year-old Province was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. Renwick was serving a 22-year term for second-degree murder. McCluskey and Welch are believed to be driving a gray Nissan Sentra, Gonzales said. And Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Robert Halliday said the manhunt will continue with full force. ""We are going to be on McCluskey like a cheap suit. We are not going to pull this thing down,"" Halliday said. Sunday, the search turned to the area around Yellowstone National Park, at the northwest corner of Wyoming. Marshals said McCluskey and Province had belonged to a white supremacist prison gang and may have been trying to reach fellow believers in the Northwest. Saturday, authorities arrested McCluskey's mother and charged her with aiding the escape. Claudia Washburn, 68, was arrested in Jakes Corner, Arizona, and faces charges of conspiracy to facilitate escape and hindering prosecution, Thomas Henman of the U.S. Marshals Service told CNN. Washburn allegedly provided ""financial and other aid"" to McCluskey, Province and Welch. A search warrant was executed, and Washburn was being held on $250,000 bond at the Gila County Jail in Globe, Arizona, the U.S. Marshals said. In addition, state charges have been brought against Washburn and McCluskey's ex-wife, Diana Joy Glattfelder, the state attorney general's office announced late Monday. Both are charged with hindering prosecution and conspiring to commit escape by providing the fugitives with ""money, supplies and/or transportation,"" prosecutors said in a statement announcing the arrests. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Fugitive couple thought to be in western Montana or Canada .

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian militant group on Saturday announced the deaths of seven workers from a construction company who had been taken hostage last month. The group, Ansar al-Muslimeen (widely known as Ansaru), released video stills of some of the bodies and blamed the deaths on a joint Nigerian-British military operation intended to free the hostages. Neither of those governments confirmed the purported operation. ""We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Nigeria and are urgently investigating,"" according to the Foreign Office. ""We urge the media not to speculate at this extremely sensitive time."" The militants on February 18 claimed responsibility for the kidnappings of the seven construction workers taken from their office in northeastern Nigeria. At the time, in an e-mail sent to reporters, Ansaru said it taken the hostages two days earlier because of ""transgression and atrocities"" against Islam in Afghanistan, Mali and other locations. Those kidnapped included workers from Italy, Greece, Britain and Lebanon. Gunmen took the workers from the offices of Setraco, a construction company in Jama'are, in Bauchi State, police said. The company is based in Abuja and is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria. The gunmen first attacked a prison, burning two police trucks, public service broadcaster Voice of Nigeria reported, citing state police spokesman Hassan Muhammed. They then killed a guard at the Setraco workers camp before kidnapping the workers, Muhammed told the broadcaster. In December, the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of a French citizen near the border with Niger and for an attack on a prison in Abuja in November. U.S. officials say Ansaru is an offshoot of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which Nigerian authorities say is behind a recent rash of killings and kidnappings in the country. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria, according to Human Rights Watch. Incidents have included the killings of three North Korean doctors in northern Yobe and the killings of nine people working for a government polio vaccination program in the northern city of Kano this month.","Militant group Ansaru says 7 foreign workers are dead .

"(CNN) -- A winter storm blasting the Northeast caused significant headaches for travelers on Friday, including long delays at several airports, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Flights destined for Newark Liberty International Airport in northern New Jersey were arriving more than four hours late on average, the FAA reported around 4 p.m. ET on its website. Significant delays were reported elsewhere in the region as well, including about 2Â½ hours at both New York's LaGuardia airport and Boston's Logan airport. The travel situation, however, did improve considerably over the course of the night. By 9 p.m., for instance, most Northeast airports were experiencing only minimal delays. One exception then was LaGuardia, which still was experiencing 2Â½-hour backups on arriving flights, according to the FAA. Even so, between United, Delta and American airlines alone, the bad weather caused at least 670 flight cancellations Friday in the Northeast corridor. Some areas of Massachusetts could be under two feet of snow by the time the storm cleared the area Friday night, according to the National Weather Service. The Northeast isn't the only area being hit by late wintry weather. Blizzard warnings were posted through Saturday and in some cases into Sunday for parts of four Rockies and Plains states. Parts of Colorado could see 10 to 15 inches of snow, according to the weather service. Before it hit in full, the storm system had already caused travel issues. United Airlines preemptively canceled 270 flights on Saturday and Southwest canceled another 125. Most of the cancellations impact Denver.","NEW: The situation at most Northeast airports improves as the night passes, the FAA says .

"(CNN) -- The last time Mill Ends Park was in the news, it was full of teeny-tiny plastic police officers, a whole lot of teeny-tiny protest signs, and one scrawny evergreen tree. That's the kind of place it is, all 452 square inches of it. What's billed as the world's smallest park, tucked inside a concrete circle just 2 feet across, is a quirky Portland kind of place. It's the site of itty-bitty protests -- including that 2011 Occupy Portland protest covered by CNN affiliate KATU -- teensy-weensy swimming pools and way small diving boards -- for the diminutive butterflies, of course. And then, for a short time it seems, someone stole its lone tree. The diminutive evergreen disappeared sometime last week from the downtown street-corner park, KATU reported, citing the Portland Parks and Recreation Department. It was more of a crisis than you might think: The place is also reputedly the home of leprechaun Patrick O'Toole, whom the late Oregon Journal columnist Dick Fagan claimed granted him a wish of having his own park. According to the parks department, Fagan planted flowers in an unused hole in the median outside his newsroom office way back in 1948. He frequently wrote about it in the years before his death in 1969, frequently weaving in fanciful tales involving O'Toole and other leprechauns, according to numerous accounts of the celebrated little park. The city took it over on St. Patrick's Day in 1976, and good-natured park workers have tended to the tiny plot ever since. So, on discovering the tree was gone, of course they quickly scraped up $3.25 for a new one, hurried downtown and planted the replacement before the notoriously fickle-tempered leprechaun could make any trouble, KATU reported. The new tree is a Douglas fir sapling, CNN affiliate KPTV reported. ""It was important to replace it so the leprechaun there had some shade from the sun,"" a suitably deferential park official, Mark Ross, told KATU. But just after the tiny replacement tree was planted, the old tree returned. A driver noticed the diminutive tree Friday ""roots and all, lying on its side just outside the park,"" Portland Parks & Recreation said. Some wondered if tree bandit had felt remorse. ""Whatever the motivation, we are relieved,"" says Portland Parks & Recreation Director Mike Abbate. But police were still on the case. ""Remorse does not mean case closed',"" says Portland Police Bureau Sergeant Pete Simpson. ""We will pursue ... our investigation and hope that justice is served, and served swiftly"".

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is still remembered as one of the worst days in the history of modern sailing. The Fastnet race still remains one of the biggest events in the yachting calendar. Yet the Fastnet tragedy of 1979 in which 15 people were killed and ex-British leader Edward Heath went missing helped to usher in a new era of improved safety in the sport. It was 30 years ago today that a freak storm struck over 300 vessels competing in the 600-mile yacht race between England and Ireland. Mountainous seas and vicious high winds sunk or put out of action 25 boats. The British rescue attempt turned into an international effort with a Dutch warship and trawlers from France also joining the search. In spite of the biggest rescue operation launched by the UK authorities since the Second World War a total of 15 people died. Some of them drowned and others succumbed to hypothermia. Six of those lost went missing after their safety harnesses broke. ""It was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences for the sport, the biggest of which was in the design and safety of the boats,"" Rodger Witt, editor of the UK-based magazine Sailing Today told CNN. ""Most people in the sailing community at the time knew someone who was involved in one way or another. I had a friend who lost his father. It was devastating."" In total 69 yachts did not finish the race. The former British prime minister, Edward Heath disappeared at the height of the storm, though he later returned to shore safe from harm. The corrected-time winner of the race was the yacht ""Tenacious"", owned and skippered by Ted Turner, the founder of CNN. Witt said that in the aftermath of the disaster the rules governing racing were tightened to ensure boats carried more ballast. Improvements were also made to the safety harnesses that tied crewmen to their boats, many of which proved ineffective in the tragedy. It also became mandatory for all yachts to be fitted with radio communication equipment and all competitors were expected to hold sailing qualifications to take part. At the time of the tragedy the Fastnet race was the last in a series of five races which made up the Admiral's Cup competition, the world championship of yacht racing. Competitors from around the globe attempted the route which sets off from the Isle of Wight, off the English south coast, and rounds the Fastnet rock on the southeast coast of Ireland. Roger Ware was in charge of handling press for the event on behalf of the organizers, the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Ware said that even today the tragedy ""still spooks me."" The racers set off on a Saturday but it wasn't till three days later that the authorities in the English coastal town of Plymouth realized there was a problem. The press team was based at the Duke of Cornwall hotel in Plymouth and early Tuesday morning Ware got a call from his superiors to go to the hotel immediately in order to field calls from journalists. ""The night before we'd noticed high winds but there'd been no forecast of bad weather so we didn't think much of it,"" Ware told CNN. ""As the morning progressed though, we heard that more and more boats were missing. It became obvious a tragedy was unfolding."" Ware said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives. ""The Royal Ocean Racing Club headquarters was overloaded so calls were getting transferred to the press team. ""I found myself talking to a woman whose husband I knew was in one of the boats where there'd been fatalities. I couldn't give her the information she wanted and to this day I still think about that telephone call.""","The 1979 Fastnet race ended in tragedy after a freak storm hit competitors .
