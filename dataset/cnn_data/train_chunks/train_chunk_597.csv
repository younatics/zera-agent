A mother-of-two has been murdered during a savage attack at her home, while her young son was in the house, according to reports. Jabeen Younis, 30, was discovered by police at her Oldham home with serious neck injuries. A 20-year-old woman was arrested in the early hours of today on suspicion of murder. She remained in police custody for questioning this afternoon. Jabeen is understood to have recently separated from her husband five months into their marriage and friends said she wanted a fresh start in her native Pakistan. Neighbours and friends have paid tribute to Jabeen, who worked in a furniture store in Oldham town centre, calling her a 'loving mum' and a 'friendly and lively character'. Nearby residents described dramatic scenes as police cars raced to the scene after receiving a 'concern for welfare' call yesterday morning. Her son, believed to be around seven years old, was seen being led from the house by officers shortly afterwards. A large section of the residential street was cordoned off throughout the day as forensics officers combed the house for clues and carried away clothes and other household items in bags. Police have said a murder investigation was underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death. Superintendent Catherine Hankinson, from Oldham police, said: 'A young woman has tragically had her life taken from her. We are doing all we can to establish the exact circumstances leading up to her death to provide some much needed answers for her family, who are clearly devastated by what has happened. 'The team of detectives dedicated to investigating this woman’s death are currently following a number of lines of inquiry, and we are keen to hear from anyone who has any information that may assist this investigation. 'We do not believe there are any immediate concerns for the safety of the wider community, but extra patrols will remain in the area to provide reassurance to local people' Jabeen is understood to have moved to Oldham around 10 years ago from Pakistan shortly after the birth of her daughter. Having previously been divorced, she remarried at the end of last year but friends said she had recently ended the relationship. Nearby residents have described dramatic scenes as police cars raced to the scene after receiving a 'concern for welfare' call . Extra patrols have been stepped up in the area and a team of detectives are working to establish the circumstances leading up to the death . Police have said a murder investigation was underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death. One friend, who did not wish to be . named, said he had spoken to her less than 24 hours before her death. He . said: 'Her marriage was over and she wanted to go back home to get away . from it. 'I’d been on the phone with her helping to arrange it all and she was looking to leave very soon. She was a nice girl who just wanted the best for her children and for them to lose their mum is just unbelievably tragic.' Another friend said: 'She was just a normal young woman enjoying her life, she loved her kids and she went out to work every day, she just got on with things. 'She loved her fashion and was always really well-turned out, she was a happy, lively character who once you’d met her, she’d put a smile on your face. A large section of the residential street was cordoned off throughout the day as forensics officers combed the house for clues . 'She was funny and a very strong person who wouldn’t put up with any nonsense, she enjoyed her life in Oldham and made it her home.' Ian Whitbread, 45, said: 'I used to see her on my way to work and I’d stop and have a chat with her from time to time, she was a really nice girl. 'She just seemed like someone with everything to live for. 'She was clearly a popular girl and she seemed to have a lot of friends around her, she just always seemed really happy and it’s awful to think someone like that can just be taken away so suddenly.' Neighbours spoke of their shock after initially being alerted by teams of police racing up the quiet street. Abdul Alam, 20, said: 'I was asleep but I could suddenly hear all these sirens going up to the top of the street and police were trying to get into the house. 'It's really shocking because it's quite a quiet community where people look out for each other and people just don't know what to do now because they can't believe this has happened. 'I only knew her to say hello to but she seemed like a friendly, happy person. It's a real tragedy.' Sara Begum, 23, said: 'I saw all the police come tearing up the street. There were probably two or three cars and vans and you knew straight away it was an emergency. 'I saw them taking her little boy out of the house and then you knew it was something quite serious and people were just waiting to hear the full extent of what's happened. 'I think a lot people will be quite worried that something like this has happened on their doorstep. It's usually quite a peaceful area and for someone to come and do something like this to someone in her own home is sickening.' A post-mortem examination to establish the cause of death is due to take place today.

Child heart surgery is to be resumed at Leeds General Infirmary amid claims of a ‘shambles’ over the decision to suspend operations on safety grounds. Parents, MPs and campaigners have demanded to know how the troubled unit came to be closed over safety concerns – only to re-open within a week. Some claimed the decision had been ‘reckless’ – while the NHS and trust bosses maintained they were forced to act after seeing data that suggested death rates were double the national average. Children's heart surgery is set to resume at Leeds General Infirmary after days of uncertainty over its future. It was closed last week after figures emerged suggesting high death rates . But last night worrying new evidence emerged of the problems at the unit. All child operations at the Leeds unit were halted on Maundy Thursday . following the release of NHS figures suggesting its death rate was . double that of other centres, and a ‘constellation’ of issues. But a decision was reached at a summit between Leeds Teaching Hospitals . NHS Trust, NHS England and other organisations on Thursday to aim to . re-open the unit early next week. Treated at Leeds: Imogen-Rose, right, was saved by surgery after doctors said they should abort her. Eve Burton, right, had a heart defect and died after an operation at Leeds for a heart defect . Some parents of children treated at the unit, as well as MPs and . campaigners, have welcomed the news. But others said questions still . needed to be answered about the problems at the unit. Emma Ethelstone, 28, and John Sauve, 37, say they were left ‘devastated’ by the way they were treated at Leeds.  The couple were told by doctors . at the unit that their longed-for baby daughter had such severe . congenital heart disease that they had no choice but to abort her. Conflict: Sir Bruce Keogh's decision to close the unit came just 24 hours after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary . Leeds General Infirmary is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of children's heart services at the hospital. The NHS . announced last July it wanted to close three units and keep seven open, the idea being to concentrate specialist services in . fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for . child heart patients. Those currently chosen to stay open are at Bristol, Birmingham, . Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton and two London centres. Facing closure are units at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, London’s Royal Brompton and the Leeds site. This means patients in Yorkshire would be being forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment - a 150 or 200-mile round trip respectively. There is . huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the Yorkshire and nearly . 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit, oragnised by the group Save Our Surgery (SOS). Last month, a High Court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘secretive’ approach of NHS chiefs. Mrs . Justice Davies backed claims by SOS that . the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair . because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals . were kept secret. Last week, she ruled the decision was 'unfair and legally flawed'. But . within 24 hours, Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, had . travelled to Leeds to suspend congenital heart surgery after data . emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average. He said the figures were among a 'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension. Miss Ethelstone – who was 26 weeks pregnant – was told ‘not to Google’ her baby’s condition as it wouldn’t be helpful. When the couple ignored this advice and looked up the condition on the . internet, they were shocked to discover that there was in fact an . operation that could help. Miss Ethelstone then emailed every hospital in England specialising in . complex heart conditions – and the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle said . they could offer the surgery. Their baby daughter Imogen-Rose was born there on March 5 and given open . heart surgery four days later. She will need further operations but she . is now a healthy one-month-old. Miss Ethelstone said: ‘We felt like a piece of meat on a conveyer belt. It didn’t seem like they were talking about my little girl – they kept . calling her the foetus.’ But when they went to Newcastle, medics had a totally different attitude, she said. ‘They gave us hope. I just want to advise other expectant mothers to always seek a 2nd 3rd 4th opinion.’ Helen Burton, 39, is among those calling for a full investigation into . deaths at the hospital. She lost her only child, seven-year-old Eve, . last March after an operation at Leeds to rectify a congenital heart . defect. After Eve’s death, Miss Burton complained to the hospital about her . daughter’s care, including why the operation was delayed until Eve was . seven, when the average age for such a procedure is apparently four. She . also says she was not fully briefed on either the risks involved, or . exactly what went wrong during the surgery. Responding to the news that the unit is to resume operations she said: . ‘It seems back-to-front to me to announce it will re-open before they . have had assurances that the unit is safe. This is too important to be . rushed.’ Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, who has . campaigned to keep the unit after its closure was recommended in a . nationwide review, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to launch an . investigation into how the hospital’s closure had been handled. He said: ‘I’m afraid the communication from NHS England has been woeful . and the handling has been deeply questionable, and indeed the motivation . behind the decision in the first place is something that I think people . want to get to the bottom of.’ Parents had criticised the timing of the unit’s suspension, which came . just 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making . process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of . services was ‘legally flawed’. Sharon Cheng, of the Save Our Surgery group, which ran the campaign to . save children’s heart surgery at Leeds, said: ‘Many children are reliant . on the Leeds unit for urgent or on-going treatment, so the sooner . normal service can be resumed, the better.’ But Anne Keatley-Clarke, chief executive of the Children’s Heart . Federation, said families needed full disclosure on the investigations . that had taken place because they were still ‘very worried’ about their . children and frightened about raising concerns. She said parents who had raised concerns in public had been subject to harassment and bullying. The hospital is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of its children's heart services . Ian Dalton, deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of NHS . England, said: ‘The risk summit concluded that surgery could restart at . the beginning of next week, subject to independent validation of the . clinical data and an external review of clinical governance processes. ‘We expect this work to be completed over the next few days and a conclusion reached early next week.’ A spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals said: ‘We cannot comment on . individual cases but we would be very happy to talk to families if they . would like to contact the hospital to discuss any concerns.’","Unit forced to close last week after data emerged showing high death rates .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:22 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:21 EST, 22 April 2013 . David Cameron, speaking today in Derbyshire, insisted he would press ahead with nursing reforms . David Cameron today vowed to face down opposition from nursing leaders to plans to force students to spend a year helping patients eat, wash and get dressed. A war of words has erupted over the plan to send trainee nurses have a year working as healthcare assistants. The row over-shadowed an announcement by Labour leader Ed Miliband of a fresh reorganisation of the NHS if he wins the next election. The Royal College of Nursing branded it a ‘really stupid idea’ but the Prime Minister insisted the health service had to refocus on care and not just chasing targets and budgets. The back-to-basics approach was announced after claims that many trainee nurses, educated to degree-level, consider themselves ‘too posh to wash’. Ministers insist ‘hands-on caring experience’ is just as important as academic training. The idea emerged in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which up to 1,200 needlessly died as a result of poor care. Speaking during an event in Derbyshire, Mr Cameron refused to back down. He said: ‘So there’s a big row going on today which is about the NHS and the future of nursing. ‘We’ve said that nurses should spend some time when they’re training as healthcare assistants in the hospital, really making sure that they are focused on the caring and the quality and some of the quite mundane tasks that are absolutely vital to get right in hospital. ‘It’s going to be controversial. But in the end the sort of health service we want is not just about making sure we’ve got the facts and the figures and the money and everything else spent well, it’s the level of care so when our elderly relatives go in there, we know they’re going to get a really good quality of care.’ Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister conceded that the plan to force trainee nurses to spend as a healthcare assistant was 'controversial' but was needed to return the focus of the NHS to care . The row between ministers and nurses could prove politically damaging for the government . Under the plan students seeking NHS funding for nursing degrees will be required to work for up to a year as a healthcare assistant or support worker. The scheme could eventually be extended beyond nursing in the future, meaning doctors would have to spend time learning hands-on care. But the idea has been savaged by the Royal College of Nursing. Critics say the proposals lack crucial details, such as how the NHS could 21,000 extra student nurses each year, and who would assess them. The Royal College of Nursing says the plan is 'stupid' and will cost too much money (file picture) RCN president Andrea Spyropoulos said the policy was a ‘waste of money’. She added: ‘It demonstrates the lack of understanding the Government has regarding the requirements of modern nursing. It is a waste of taxpayers’ money that will have no benefit to patients. It’s a really stupid idea.’ The row puts the government on a collision course with nurses, which carries big political risks. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted that many nurses supported the plan, while pointing out that the RCN had come in for criticism in the Francis report into Mid Staffs. ‘I think the Royal College of Nurses has to be very, very careful. They missed what happened at Mid Staffs,’ he told Sky News. ‘The Francis report levelled some very serious criticisms at that. It said that they basically allowed their trade union responsibilities to trump their responsibilities as a Royal College to raise professional standards. ‘They have a conflict of interests and I think that, before they start criticising the Government for accepting recommendations that are going to improve compassionate care throughout the NHS, they need to answer those very, very serious criticisms themselves. ‘What nurses on the front line are saying, a lot of them, particularly the older nurses, is that this was part of nursing training. Why would you want to become a nurse if you were unwilling to spend time washing patients, feeding patients, doing that really vital experience on the front line? ‘We need people to go into nursing with the right motives. Actually having that frontline hands-on experience is a good thing to do.’ The row came as Mr Miliband warned of a multi-billion pound black hole in NHS funding to meet the care needs of an ageing population unless there is reform. Under the Labour plans more care will be provided directly in people's homes, there will be a greater focus on prevention and better co-ordination between different branches of the system. Labour leader Ed Miliband returned to his wooden pallet to give a speech in Chorley, Lancashire today . Mr Miliband said the health service needed to be overhauled to deal with a budget black hole . Speaking to a crowd of about 60 . people from a wooden pallet in Chorley, he said: 'If we can bring . together the way the health service works with the way the social care . works we can make a huge change in the care we give to elderly people. 'How many people here know of elderly . people who end up in hospital when they don't really need to be in . hospital? They are only in hospital because they have nowhere else to . go. 'Let's have health and social care . working together so it keeps elderly people out of hospital and saves . the health service money.'","Prime Minister refuses to ditch plan for trainee nurses to spend a year as healthcare assistants .

Argentina was warned to respect the wishes of the Falkland Islanders last night following their overwhelming vote to remain British. David Cameron said Buenos Aires should take ‘careful note’ of the referendum, which went 99.8 per cent in favour of remaining a British overseas territory. In a telephone call to Gavin Short, chairman of the Falklands Legislative Assembly, the Prime Minister said he was ‘over the moon’ with the result. Jubilant: Falkland islanders cheer after hearing the results of the referendum to remain part of Britain . ‘The Falkland islanders couldn’t have spoken more clearly,’ he said. ‘They want to remain British and that . view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina. It is the . clearest possible result there could be.’ Just three unidentified islanders voted to end British sovereignty three decades on from the Falklands conflict. A total of 1,517 valid votes were cast in the referendum, a turnout of 92 per cent of the eligible islanders. The question was: ‘Do you wish the . Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas . Territory of the United Kingdom?’ Alicia Castro, Argentina’s ambassador to the UK, said the vote was ‘irrelevant’ to Argentina’s claim to the islands. An overwhelming yes: 98.8 per cent of eligible voters in the Falkland Islands voted to remain a part of Britain . She said: ‘It is a manoeuvre with no legal value, it has not been organised or supervised by the United Nations . 'It is a referendum between British . inhabitants, organised by the British, to say that they want the . territory where they live to be British.’ In a virtually unanimous message of . defiance to the Argentine government, 1,513 voted to remain under . British rule, with just three - 0.2% - voting against the referendum . question 'Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current . political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?' The Prime Minister said the 99.8% vote . in favour of remaining a British Overseas Territory in a referendum . held on the islands over the past two days was the 'clearest possible . result there could be'. He said Britain would always be there . to defend the islands. Speaking at 10 Downing Street just hours after . the result of the referendum was announced, Mr Cameron said it sent a . clear message to Argentina. Although the result of the referendum . was widely seen as a foregone conclusion, the landslide delivered a . resounding message. Rule Britannia: Falkland islanders sing and celebrate as their referendum result sends a message to Argentina that they want to remain part of Britain . Waiting up: Residents waited outside Port Stanley's town hall to hear the results as they were announced shortly before 2am this morning . Nigel . Haywood, governor of the Falkland Islands, said the referendum was a . 'massive demonstration of the way the Falkland Islanders feel and of the . way they see their future'. He . said: 'Obviously it is a major principle of the United Nations that a . people have their right to self-determination, and you don't get a much . clearer expression of the people's self-determination than such a large . turn out and such a large yes vote.' Following . the vote Mr Hague said: 'I welcome the result, which demonstrates more . clearly than ever the Falkland Islanders' wish to remain an Overseas . Territory of the United Kingdom. 'We . have always been clear that we believe in the rights of the Falklands . people to determine their own futures and to decide on the path they . wish to take. It is only right that, in the 21st century, these rights . are respected. 'All . countries should accept the results of this referendum and support the . Falkland Islanders as they continue to develop their home and their . economy. I wish them every success in doing so.' Our Islands, our choice: Nearly all of the residents of the Falkland Islands voting in a referendum chose to remain a British overseas territory . The outcome of the two-day sovereignty referendum was punctuated by the over 90 percent high turn-out of patriotic islanders eager for their voices to be heard in the diplomatic row that has blown up more than three decades after British forces repelled an Argentinian attempt to seize the islands by force. The residents voted by a huge majority to remain a British Overseas Territory, with a ballot box turnout exceeding 90 per cent of eligible voters. Residents lined up for 30 minutes outside Port Stanley’s town hall waiting to cast their ballots yesterday amid a festive atmosphere that left the Falklands’ diminutive capital swathed in red, white and blue. Posters bearing the slogan ‘Our Islands, Our Choice’ adorned windows throughout the town and the post office produced a line of official stamps to mark the occasion. Voters turned up carrying Union Jacks on a procession of horses and in Land Rovers swamped in bunting. Today the Prime Minister called the Chair of Falklands Legislative Assembly Gavin Short to congratulate him on the emphatic result. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'He also praised the way that the referendum had been carried out and said that he hoped that the outcome would be clearly recognised internationally. 'Mr Short agreed, thanking the Prime Minister for Britain's help and support. He said that the referendum had left a mark in the history books of the Falklands. 'The Prime Minister said that the Islanders should be very proud and promised to continue to support and promote the Falklands, wishing the Islanders the best for their future.' Centre of attention: Media crews await the result of the referendum in Port Standley, Falkland Islands . In the minority: Only three voters choose to cast their ballot against remaining part of the UK . In distant islands and far-flung sheep farms, ballot papers were being flown and driven in by mobile polling stations. ‘We hope those undecided, or those uninformed, or those countries that might otherwise be prepared to give the nod to Argentina’s sovereignty claim might have pause for thought after the referendum,’ said John Fowler, deputy editor of the islands’ weekly newspaper, the Penguin News. ‘This is an attempt to say “hang on a minute, there’s another side to the story”. ‘For me, this referendum is extremely important because I have no wish to be part of Argentina,’ said Rob McGill, 67, who runs a guesthouse in isolated Carcass Island and voted by post. ‘I consider myself a Falkland Islander, but my ancestors came from Britain,’ he added. Some islanders are the descendants of British settlers who arrived eight or nine generations ago and the Falklands retain an unmistakably British character despite a sizeable community of immigrants from Chile and Saint Helena. The count: Election officials count votes on the polling counting table at the Town Hall in Stanley . High turnout: The Falkland Islands referendum saw a turnout of more than 90 per cent of its eligible voters . Residents say fiery remarks by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez and her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, have galvanized patriotic sentiment on the islands, which lie nearly 8,000 miles from London and just a 75-minute flight away from southern Argentina. Tensions have risen with the discovery of commercially viable oil resources in the Falklands basin and by Fernandez’s persistent demands for Britain to hold sovereignty talks over the Malvinas, as the islands are called in Spanish. London says it will only agree to negotiations if the islanders want them, which they show no sign of doing. Argentina has blasted the referendum as a ‘public-relations campaign’ and accused Britain of pursuing ‘irresponsible initiatives in bad faith.’ ‘This new British attempt to manipulate the Malvinas issue through a vote by the population that it implanted is forcefully rejected by Argentina,’ a foreign ministry statement said, citing broad Latin American support for Argentina’s position. Campaign: Islanders take part in the 'Proud to be British' parade along Ross Road in Port Stanley yesterday . Festive: A woman shows her off her T-shirt ahead of casting her vote in the Falkland Islands referendum . Argentina says the sovereignty dispute can only be decided between London and Buenos Aires. Argentina has claimed the islands since 1833, saying it inherited them from the Spanish on independence and that Britain expelled an Argentine population. Its attempt to take the islands by force in April 1982, drew a swift response from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The 10-week war, which killed about 650 Argentines and 255 Britons, is widely remembered in Argentina as a humiliating mistake by the brutal and discredited dictatorship ruling at the time. In the islands, where plans for oil production to start in 2017 could further boost the flourishing local economy, most residents are determined to maintain the status quo. ‘Our best-case scenario is for them to drop their claim and realize that we are a people, we are a country and we do exist,’ said Gavin Short, one of the Falklands assembly’s eight elected members. Asked if he thought that might happen, he said: ‘Not in my lifetime.' Voting day: A local resident participates in a vehicle parade to show their support for voting yes to Britain in the referendum .

Carol and Sir Mark Thatcher both returned to Britain yesterday after learning of their mother’s death while abroad. Sir Mark was said to be finding it ‘very tough’ since receiving the news. Both he and his twin sister have been grieving privately overseas but have returned to London as the family gathers ahead of next Wednesday’s funeral. Baroness Margaret Thatcher at the age of 33, has time to play with her twin children Mark and Carol aged six, Both engrossed in their toy garage and motor cars in 1959 . Baroness Margaret Thatcher with Sir Denis Thatcher and her twins in 1959. Her children are returning to London for the former prime minister's funeral . Sir Mark was on holiday at a rented multi-million-pound villa in Barbados when he was informed. The five-bedroom property overlooks the Caribbean Sea and is on the fringes of the exclusive Sandy Lane estate on the island’s scenic West Coast. He and his wife, Sarah Jane Russell, packed up and left early yesterday morning to fly to London. A member of staff at the villa told the Daily Mail: ‘He is only as good as can be expected under the circumstances. It is very tough for him. ‘He has gone away now. He left very early and he was gone by the time we got to work. His wife went with him.’ Carol Thatcher lives in Klosters, the upmarket ski resort in the Swiss Alps favoured by the Royals. In 1953 Lady Thatcher was 28 when her twins were born. She had been married for two years and was trying to juggle her new career as a lawyer with her political ambitions . Despite living abroad, the twins made regular trips back to Britain to see their ailing mother, and were often seen accompanying her to lunch on her birthday . She left on Sunday morning – the day before her mother’s stroke – on a pre-planned trip, according to her partner, ski instructor Marco Grass. A neighbour of their apartment, which has a traditional Swiss wooden balcony with stunning views, said Carol had caught a train at 10am to Zurich. The neighbour added: ‘Everybody knew about Carol’s famous mother. The news is very sad.’ Carol’s whereabouts since then have been unknown, but she is said to have remained abroad until yesterday when she arrived in London. The 59-year-old twins have not issued an official statement, and have asked for privacy as they mourn their mother.

The statement released on Monday by Lord Bell to announce the death of the former Prime Minister was issued in the name of her two children. However, they have not been seen in public since the announcement, and have not chosen to share publicly any personal tributes to Lady Thatcher. Despite living abroad, the twins made regular trips back to Britain to see their ailing mother, and were often seen accompanying her to lunch on her birthday. A mourning Mrs Thatcher on the day that she attended her husband's funeral . It is unclear on what occasion either twin last saw their mother. ‘They are very private people, they very rarely talk about their feelings,’ said family spokesman Lord Bell. He confirmed that the twins were planning to attend their mother’s funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral, central London. In her final days, Baroness Thatcher had a dedicated group of friends who took it in turns to visit her during her recuperation at the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly. One of that inner circle, Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, said yesterday: ‘I saw her very regularly. I used to see her pretty much weekly. I had some very special times with her.

The number of patients facing waiting times of more than four hours in England's accident and emergency units has reached an eight-year peak. The proportion of people facing the lengthy wait for treatment has increased by more than a quarter, reaching its highest level since 2004, according to NHS performance data. The King’s Fund report showed that 4.2 per cent of A&E patients waited longer than four hours from January to March, compared with 3.4 per cent in the same period last year. NHS report: The number of patients facing waiting times of more than four hours in England's accident and emergency units has reached an eight-year peak . Its authors said the increase was a cause for concern and reflected growing pressures on the hospital sector. On a national level, the Government’s target that no more than 5 per cent of patients face more than a four-hour wait in A&E was met last year, the think-tank’s quarterly monitoring report found. But 48 NHS providers breached the threshold in the final quarter of last year compared with 18 in the second quarter. The King’s Fund said the rise coincides with emerging evidence of increases in 'trolley waits' as some hospitals struggle to find beds for patients. Data obtained from 60 NHS finance directors as part of the study also revealed that 40 per cent of trusts did not meet their productivity targets in 2011/12. The report said: 'This will be a significant concern as last year was the first in a four-year spending squeeze, during which the NHS needs to find £20 billion in productivity improvements.' Health Secretary Andrew Lansley disputed the report's findings . Just four of the finance chiefs . questioned said their organisation was forecasting a deficit this year, . backing up national figures that estimate a surplus of £1.5billion . across the NHS. The study found the NHS was performing well against a number of other key indicators including hospital treatment waiting times and superbug infections. The proportion of inpatients waiting more than 18 weeks for treatment fell, while outpatient waits remained static, the report said. C difficile and MRSA infections dropped by 33 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. John Appleby, chief economist at the King’s Fund, said: 'Overall, the NHS continues to perform well, despite the spending squeeze. However, this masks growing pressures in hospitals and significant performance issues in some NHS organisations. 'Given the strength of the political commitment to keep waiting times low, the steep rise in A&E waits will be a concern for the Government. 'The productivity challenge will only get harder, so evidence that large numbers of NHS organisations failed to meet their productivity targets last year does not bode well.' Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: 'The King’s Fund report is wrong to suggest the proportion of people ""waiting"" more than four hours to be seen in A&E is growing. 'This measure records the total time people spend in the department, including the time they are being treated; it does not just measure waiting. 'People are waiting on average only 49 minutes for their treatment to start. In addition, the NHS has continued to meet or exceed the target of 95 per cent of patients spending a total time of four hours or less in A&E.'","4.2 per cent of A&E patients waited longer than four hours from January to March, compared with 3.4 per cent in the same period last year .

Detectives are investigating whether an air hostess who fell to her death in Dubai was fleeing a British businessman she met in a bar. Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, ran barefoot into a block of flats in the early hours of Monday morning and told staff: ‘Someone’s trying to kill me’. The Scot made her way to the eighth floor, where she reportedly set off a fire extinguisher, before falling from a window. Police suspect that she may have opened the window to escape the fumes from the dry powder extinguisher. Now, it has emerged that Dubai CID have questioned a British man she met in a hotel bar on the same night. The man told police that, after drinking together, he invited Miss Clarke back to his flat. They left on-foot but, when they arrived at his accommodation, she apparently became ‘nervous with him’ and they parted company. A police source told the Mail: ‘The British man was working in Dubai. ‘He came to speak to us when he heard what had happened. ‘They had met the same day in the bar. He said they had both been drinking and the lady was very drunk. He was drunk also. ‘He said ""come with me to my flat"" and she went with him to his building. ‘When they were outside, she got nervous with him and did not want to go in, so she left.’ He said detectives had ruled out that it was this man who Miss Clarke felt threatened by. He said: ‘Maybe this is why she was running, we do not know. ‘He said nothing else happened and we do not believe has committed a crime.’ Minutes later, police say the ‘drunk’ flight attendant jumped into a stranger’s convertible car, which was parked on the road. When they told her to get out, she ran into the nearest building – leaving her shoes in the car. At 4.37am, her body was found outside the block of flats, in the Al Mankhool area of Bur Dubai, after falling from the top floor. The source said: ‘She jumped into a convertible car, through the roof. We don’t know why. ‘There was a Tunisian man and an Egyptian man inside and they were saying ""What is happening? Get out, get out. Why are you coming into my car?"". Miss Clarke worked for the airline Emirates and was living with friends in Dubai . ‘They said they would call the police and she got out, but she left her shoes behind. ‘She ran into the building. ‘They say she was alone, but there are no security cameras so we cannot be sure. ‘Staff at the building said she was followed by an Indian man, but we just don’t know.’ Miss Clarke, from Ayrshire, ran into the lobby of the building and put her hand out to stop the lift doors closing. A ‘nicely dressed’ Indian man was reportedly stood behind her, but did not get into the lifts. Newspaper delivery man Raj Dev, 37, who was inside the lift at the time, said: ‘She seemed scared. She said ‘someone’s trying to kill me’. ‘I said I would call the police but she said ‘no, there’s no need’. ‘I said ""come with me to security"" but she repeated ""no"".’ ’She got out at the third floor and I did not see her after that.’ When Mr Dev returned to the ground floor, an Indian man was apparently still stood in the lobby. ‘He asked if the lady was staying in the building and I ignored him. I said ""security are on their way"" and he left. Mr Dev said he was ‘very sad’ to receive a phone call later that morning from security staff to say she had fallen. He said: ‘I tried my best to help her, but I think that I should have brought her with me to the security guard. I feel like maybe I could have saved her.’ Miss Clarke was living in Dubai and had returned two days earlier from a six-day work trip to Australia and New Zealand. Yesterday, her devastated parents met with detectives in Dubai. They also visited the Emirates accommodation block where their daughter was living with colleagues, two miles away. Police are still awaiting the results of a post-mortem. Hundreds of tributes have been left on a Facebook memorial page. Friend Helen Brown wrote: ‘So privileged to have known such a fun-loving, warm-hearted, caring girl. A cruel and tragic loss.’","Evelyn Clarke, 28, is believed to have fallen from the block after a night out .

In a twist, the Finnish retailer later revealed that a second phone had been dropped - and that there's a reward of 1,000euros (£810) for the finder.

The drug, which has already been successfully tested on animals, could allow people to sleep soundly at night and wake up without the groggy feeling that blights many other tablets. Billed as ‘a good night’s sleep without the side-effects’, the tablet, which is known only as DORA-22, works in a different way to the existing pills taken by millions of Britons.

Some 15million prescriptions for sleeping pills are written out each year and although newer drugs produce fewer side-effects patients can still experience problems with concentration and grogginess. Concerns that Britain has become a nation of sleeping pill addicts has led to doctors being urged to first try alternative treatments such as counselling. Most of the £50million a year spent by the NHS on sleeping pills, or hypnotics, as they are known to doctors, goes on drugs that target a calming brain chemical called GABA. Insomnia: Some 15million prescriptions for sleeping pills are written out each year (file picture) In contrast, DORA-22 works on orexin, a brain compound that helps keep us awake. In tests, rats given the drug slept longer than those given a dummy pill. And after being given the drug, the creatures remained free of the memory problems that affected rats given Valium or one of two more modern sleeping pills. Similarly, monkeys given the other pills suffered problems with memory and alertness. However, DORA-22 was free of those problems and did not impact on reaction times, even when given at extremely high doses. The pharmaceutical giant, Merck, which is developing the drug, said that the tests mimicked a situation in which someone would wake up shortly after taking a sleeping pill. It added that more work is needed to check that the pill doesn’t cause grogginess the next morning. DORA-22 is only being used in lab tests at the moment. However, another drug in the same family has been tested on people and is very close to the market. An accompanying article, also in the journal Science Translational Medicine, says that such tablets could usher in a new era for insomnia treatment. However, the commentary’s author, a sleep researcher from Stanford University in the US, also urges caution, saying that the search for the perfect sleeping pill has been ‘marked by cycles of exuberance followed by disappointment, as adverse side-effects have emerged following widespread use’. He adds that only time will tell if DORA-22, and similar drugs, are ‘the perfect hypnotics’. Professor Colin Espie, founder of the sleep centre at Glasgow University, warned that tampering with orexin might produce other side-effects such as an increase in appetite. He added that the real challenge will be to find a pill that gets to the root cause of insomnia, rather than merely being a quick fix.

"By . Graham Smith and David Mccormack . UPDATED: . 10:23 EST, 3 April 2013 . The world is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first call from a cell phone, which was made in New York City on April 3, 1973. That momentous first call was made by Motorola employee Marty Cooper, who used a prototype known as a DynaTAC to call rivals Bell Labs (then a division of AT&T) to inform them that they had been beaten in the race to achieve the technological breakthrough. Cooper, then 42, reportedly said: ‘I'm ringing you just to see if my call sounds good at your end.’ The momentous first call was made by Motorola employee Marty Cooper, who used a prototype known as a DynaTAC to call rivals Bell Labs . The Motorola DynaTAC was nine inches . tall, weighed 2.5lbs, had a talk-time of 35 minutes and . took 10 hours to recharge. It would be another 10 years before Motorola finally introduced the DynaTAC 8000x, the first commercially available mobile phone weighing 1lb, with a one-line text-only LED display and costing $3,995. Few would have predicted 40 years ago that what was then perceived as a niche device for businessmen would blossom into a global industry with annual revenues of $1,200bn. From 1990 to 2011, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew from 12.4 million to over 6 billion, penetrating an estimated 87% of the global population and bringing telecommunications to people in some of the poorest parts of the world. Michael Douglas models a Motorola DynaTAC 8000x in 1980s movie Wall St, while the iPhone from Apple is one of the most common smartphones in use today . Today's market is dominated smartphones manufactured by Samsung and Apple which people use for internet access, social networking, maps, morning alarms, games, apps, to take photos, watch video clips - as well as talking and texting. The iconic chunky DynaTAC phone can be seen in several Hollywood films, including ‘Wall Street,’ where Gordon Gekko uses it to place a call from the beach, and ‘American Psycho,’ where Patrick Bateman uses it to place a fake dinner reservation call. Back in 1973 when he took the prototype phone for a walk around New York City, Marty Cooper recalls the reaction from passers-by was one of complete bewilderment. Mr Cooper, now 84, recalls: 'As I walked down the street while talking on the phone, sophisticated New Yorkers gaped at the sight of someone actually moving around while making a phone call. Marty Cooper recalls New Yorkers gaping back in 1973 at the sight of someone actually moving around while making a phone call . 'Remember that in 1973, there weren't cordless telephones, let alone cellular phones. 'I made numerous calls, including one where I crossed the street while talking to a New York radio reporter - probably one of the more dangerous things I have ever done in my life.' At the time Mr Cooper was general manager of Motorola's Communications Systems Division. As he walked around New York that day, his made his first call to Dr Joel S Engel, his rival and head of research at Bell Labs phone company. Mobile phones have undergone a number of transformations over the years . Mr Cooper called his office landline to break the news that Motorola had beaten Bell in developing the first mobile phone. He then let reporters make their own calls to verify that the invention actually worked and that they weren't the victims of an elaborate hoax. It had long been Mr Cooper's vision for phones to become portable, in an age when even James Bond dared not dream of making a phone call outside of a vehicle. For that was as portable as phones had become up to that point.

Music icons Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor could have helped rock the foundations of Communism, according to a Cold War US government memo. The artists were named in a U.S. government dream list of stars who could have won over public opinion by going on tour in the Soviet Union. Walter Stoessel Jr, a former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow, wrote that Soviets had little appetite for American soul music. Bob Dylan (left) and Joni Mitchell (right) were two of the stars named in a U.S. government . list of those believed to have been able to win over public opinion by . going on tour in the Soviet Union . But in his January 1975 diplomatic note to Washington, he suggested 'soft rock' like 'American Pie' by Don McLean or 'Free Man in Paris' by singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell could be a big hit with the oppressed. He added that 'priority' should also be given to 'blues/rock' or 'country rock.' The note adds: 'While this would be new for Soviet tour, as would most aspects [of] current music, believe time ripe to make attempt.' The cable, one of a new batch of 1.7 million U.S. diplomatic communications from the years 1973 to 1976 released by the whistleblower Wikileaks website on Monday, suggests bigger stars should be approached rather than 'lesser-known more derivative artists.' As well as Dylan, Mitchell and Taylor, the ambassador's wish list included seventies rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd, Poco and The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. None of the artists ended up playing behind the Iron Curtain at the time and it's unclear whether any were asked. Singer Elton John pictured in Moscow in 1979.

Eight years later, James Taylor, accompanied by Santana, Bonnie Raitt and the Doobie Brothers – all artists fitting the U.S. ambassador's criteria – headlined the joint Soviet-American 'Summit' concert in Moscow to herald the dawning of glasnost. Later that same year, Billy Joel would perform three sold-out shows in Moscow and three more in Leningrad that were hyped as 'the first time an American pop music star had brought a fully staged rock show to the Soviet Union.' Although from a different musical genre, Duke Ellington and his band also visited the USSR in 1971 on a tour backed by the US State Department. Cold War paranoia over pop music was so intense that youngsters from East Germany were not even allowed to congregate near the Berlin Wall when Michael Jackson played an 1988 concert in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the western side of the city's divide for fear they would rebel. The wall that had separated the city since 1961 fell a little over a year later in an era of change triggered by the reforms of Soviet President Michhail Gorbachev. A month after Jackson's 1988 concert, Bruce Springsteen performed in front of 160,000 East Germans - the biggest concert in the Communist country's history. East Germany welcomed him as a 'hero of the working class,' but Springsteen instead fuelled widespread dissatisfaction with the words: 'I came to play rock 'n' roll for you East Berliners in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down.'","Artists named in US list of stars who could have won over public opinion .

Officials also warned of the possibility of a Mumbai-style firearms attack on a crowded place, and surface-to-air missiles being used to shoot down a passenger jet. According to the document, handed to MPs, there are emerging fears about a ‘large-scale terrorist attack using biological agents’. No further information was given about the nature of the threat - but biological warfare can involve the release of a deadly virus or bacteria, such as smallpox. The Home Office report, called Contest, says: ‘We have increased the stocks of medical supplies and put in place better plans to improve the speed and coverage of the health response.’ Charles Farr, head of the Home Office’s Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism, said one potential source of biological weapons was UK universities, where science labs use materials with a ‘dual purpose’. Universities have been asked to improve security to prevent fanatics being able to steal the biological agents. Other current threats to the UK include: . The report said the overall threat to the UK had diversified beyond al Qaeda plots developed from within Pakistan to other areas. More than 150 foreign nationals have been kidnapped by Islamist terrorist groups since 2008, at least 13 of whom were British, the report said. In a worrying trend, numbers last year were more than double those in 2010. Fanatics linked to al Qaeda and other groups have received at least £40million to fund terrorism as a result. Officials also raised the prospect of a jet carrying British passengers being shot out of the sky using surface-to-air weapons, when passing over North Africa. Threat: Charles Farr said one potential source of biological weapons was UK universities . A number of weapons have gone missing in the chaos which followed the downfall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya. Planes carrying Westerners are considered an attractive target. Concerns remain about the ‘trend for terrorists to use firearms as part of an attack’, officials said. Specialist teams of police and emergency services have been trained to respond to terrorists attempting a mass casualty attack on a hotel, train station or city centre in the UK. British jihadists currently fighting in Syria pose a real threat to the UK as it is feared some are being trained to carry out terror attacks when they return. Between 70 and 100 British fighters have been enlisted by anti-Assad group Jabhat al-Nusra which it is believed is looking to broaden its activities beyond Syria's borders. Many of the fighters who have travelled to the UK are first-time warriors and several have been killed by President Assad's forces. Most of those involved in the fighting come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. They include young Asians, North Africans and converts to Islam. On Monday a 31-year-old man in East London became the eighth person in Britain to be arrested as part of inquiries into recruitment and organisation for the Syrian conflict. The report also warns the threat to the UK from al Qaeda allies such as al Qaeda in the Maghreb in North Africa has heightened in the last year. It follows a recent warning by Sir Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5, that the chaos caused by the Arab Spring has created new terrorist training camps for jihadis intent on attacking Britain. Mr Farr warned that Syria had become ‘particularly challenging” with large numbers of foreign fighters, including from the UK, active in Syria. Some 600 terrorist attacks involving Syrian groups took place last year, including 60 suicide deaths. Whitehall sources have suggested there could be 70 British fanatics who have travelled to Syria. The fear is that they will travel back to the UK to carry out attacks here. Mr Farr said threats from terrorism were spreading across a wider area into lawless countries with no recognised government. The report said: ‘This poses significant challenges to our national security and to the security and intelligence agencies and departments working on counter-terrorism. ‘Operating in these areas is difficult and dangerous, requires very significant resources and is complicated and at times made impossible by the breakdown of governance and law and order.’ Asked whether counter-terrorism efforts faced funding cuts, Mr Farr said: ‘I don’t think that counter-terrorism is immune from the sort of efficiencies being found elsewhere. 'We’re looking at every bit of counter-terrorism to identify those savings.’","Officials warned of a Mumbai-style firearms attack on a crowded place .

The former chief executive and chairwoman of the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital are to be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct. Stafford Borough Council has agreed to file complaints against former Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Martin Yeates, and chairwoman Toni Brisby. Councillors allege they committed misconduct in public office. They believe hospital bosses . knowingly gave false and misleading evidence relating to death rates to . the council's statutory overview and scrutiny committee. The former chief executive and chairwoman of scandal-hit Stafford Hospital are to be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct . Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at the hospital as a result of poor care between 2005 and 2009. In the Commons today David Cameron claimed the scandal would be 'repeated over again' if Labour was in power. At the time of Robert Francis QC's report into the scandal was published, he agreed there should not be a search for 'scapegoats'. Both Labour and the Tories initially refused to use the deaths for political gain. Prime Minister David Cameron said the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated if Labour returns to power . But today, as he was attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband over longer waiting times at A and E departments, the Prime Minister warned there could be another similar crisis if Labour was in power. Mr Cameron pointed to the Labour administration's running of the NHS in Wales as proof it could not be trusted with the health service. He told MPs: 'That is what you get under Labour, cuts to our NHS, longer waiting lists and all the problems we saw at Stafford Hospital will be repeated over again.' Mr Miliband slammed the 'disgraceful slur'. It came as councillors in Staffordshire moved to refer former bosses to the police. At a meeting of the full council on Tuesday night, councillors instructed Stafford Borough Council chief executive, Ian Thompson, to make a formal complaint to the CPS over the allegations. A spokesman for the council said: ‘At a meeting of the full council last night it was agreed to instruct the council's chief executive to make a formal complaint to the Crown Prosecution Service in that Mr Martin Yeates - the former chief executive of the hospital trust - and Mrs Toni Brisby - former chair of the Trust - committed the offence of misconduct in public office by knowingly giving false and misleading evidence to the council's statutory overview and scrutiny committee.’ A spokeswoman from Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust said it would not be commenting on the issue. The move comes after thousands of . supporters flooded Stafford town centre last weekend in a demonstration . aimed at keeping major services at Stafford Hospital. Stafford Borough Council has agreed to file complaints against Martin Yeates and Toni Brisby . A public inquiry into the hospital, which was placed into administration last week, found it had provided 'appalling' standards of care and caused unnecessary suffering to hundreds of patients over a five-year period up to 2009. Health regulator Monitor has given two special administrators 45 working days to produce a plan for the sustainable “reorganisation” of future services, including maternity care. The decision to place the Trust, which also runs Cannock Hospital, into administration was taken after a review team concluded that its services were clinically and financially unsustainable. The review also concluded that the Trust was unlikely to be able to repay its debts.

She is the glamorous brunette dubbed the ‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’. He is the barrister to the stars frequently pictured with his VIP clients. Now, the conduct of these two key lawyers at the Leveson Inquiry into media standards has been called into question – after the revelation that they are having an affair. Twice-married David Sherborne, 44, who represented Hugh Grant and other phone-hacking victims, is in a relationship with mother-of-two Carine Patry Hoskins, junior counsel for Lord Justice Leveson. Scroll down for video . In a relationship: Carine Patry Hoskins, left, who is junior counsel for Lord Justice Levseson and lawyer to the stars David Sherborne, right . The couple admit going on holiday together to the Greek island of Santorini in August – days after months of public hearings at the Inquiry ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the controversial Leveson report was published in November. The disclosure raises concerns over whether their relationship undermined the integrity of the Leveson Inquiry. The pair have already been the subject of gossip in legal circles for several months, with rumours including sightings of the couple late at night in a London bar and breakfasting together at a fashionable brasserie near the Royal Courts of Justice. But they did not tell Lord Justice . Leveson or Robert Jay QC, the Inquiry’s senior counsel and Miss Patry . Hoskins’ immediate superior, of their relationship, with the Santorini . trip brought to the men’s attention only in recent days. Twitter frenzy: Carine Patry Hoskins trended on Twitter when she appeared on television in the Leveson Inquiry . It is understood the couple claim  that they went on holiday together simply to ‘discuss the possibility of a future relationship’. In a joint statement, the judge and the QC confirmed: ‘Neither Lord Justice Leveson nor Robert Jay QC was aware of the fact that Ms Patry Hoskins went on holiday with Mr Sherborne or that they had a developing relationship. 'Mr Jay first learnt there was a persnoal relationship of any sort on 18 March 2013 and he later informed Lord Justice Leveson. The Santorini holiday has only been mentioned this week.' Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, and her husband, QC Mark Hoskins, 45, put their £4million home on the market in December and are understood to be divorcing. As junior counsel for the Inquiry – her fees paid by the taxpayer – Miss Patry Hoskins was required to be totally independent. Her job was to test the evidence given to the Inquiry on behalf of the public and assist proceedings without any undisclosed conflict of interest. Details of her affair will prompt questions about her objectivity. At the hearings she questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances against the Press. Among them were singer Charlotte Church and ex-footballer Garry Flitcroft. During the Inquiry and once the public hearings concluded at the end of July, Miss Patry Hoskins was also heavily involved in drafting important legal correspondence between the Inquiry and individuals and organisations that gave evidence – including newspapers and editors who had been subject to fierce questioning by Mr Sherborne. She also collated facts for parts of Lord Justice Leveson’s report, published on November 29. Bar Council guidelines warn barristers it is very unwise to have relationships with counsel involved in the same cases because clients might perceive ‘a danger of breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Any relationship was also likely to breach the Council’s code of conduct. Miss Patry Hoskins and father-of-three Mr Sherborne both featured prominently in the televised live proceedings of the Inquiry, which began in September 2011. Mr Sherborne was also frequently photographed entering the High Court alongside some of his high-profile celebrity clients. Mr Sherborne spoke of 'conflicts of interest' in his closing submissions to the Inquiry. He said: 'Coupled with the evidence . we've heard of the overly close relationship between the Press and . police, the accounts of excessive hospitality, is it any wonder there . was the perception of bias or conflict of interest?' A spokesman for the barristers said Mr Sherborne's involvement with the Inquiry ended on July 24. The barrister – part of whose Leveson fees will also be paid out of the public purse – has represented dozens of phone-hacking victims at both the Inquiry and in damages claims against News International, including actor Jude Law, Sarah Ferguson and the parents of Madeleine McCann. Mr Sherborne, paid £400 an hour for appearing at the Inquiry, has also represented comedian Frankie Boyle and Kate Winslet’s husband Ned Rocknroll in recent High Court cases against newspapers. He was Max Mosley’s lawyer when he successfully sued the now defunct News of the World for invasion of privacy in 2008 after it ran a sexual exposé on him, which wrongly suggested that consensual S&M scenes seen on video footage had a neo-Nazi connotation. David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry in July 2011 at the height of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. He appointed Lord Justice Leveson to run the investigation into the culture, practice and ethics of the press. The High Court judge had the power to summon newspaper proprietors, journalists, police and politicians to give evidence under oath. Victims of phone-hacking and press intrusion – including many celebrities – also appeared. The final cost of the Inquiry has yet to be announced but it is estimated to be approaching £6million. More than £1million of that is expected to be on legal fees for lead counsel Mr Jay and his two junior colleagues, Miss Patry Hoskins and David Barr. In his opening remarks, Lord Justice Leveson stressed  that ‘complete transparency’ should be one ‘of the principal objectives’ of the Inquiry. A stickler for the rules, in June he was close to quitting after Education Secretary Michael Gove criticised him, arguing the Leveson Inquiry was a threat to press freedom. Mr Sherborne’s profile on the 5RB Chambers website describes him as a media and entertainment barrister and gives a long list of famous names he has represented, including the late Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Blairs. It says he is ‘particularly well-known for his extensive reputation management practice’ and has also ‘carved himself a niche advising in relation to high net-worth or high-profile divorces, especially in respect of media, confidentiality and disclosure issues’. The son of a QC, Mr Sherborne has two children from his first marriage to Helen, who he wed in 1993. He got married again in 2006, to 36-year-old Charlotte Leyshon, who he has now divorced. The couple lived in a £1.5million converted barn near Shenley, Hertfordshire, but she has since moved to south Wales with their young child.","David Sherborne, 44, is in a relationship with Carine Patry Hoskins, 40 .

UKIP could secure its first elected MP in a dramatic by-election upset, leader Nigel Farage claimed today as he boasted his party was ‘coming up on the rails’ to overtake both the Liberal Democrats and the Tories in Eastleigh. With voters going to the polls tomorrow to choose a replacement for disgraced Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne, Mr Farage said UKIP supporters would vote for his party's candidate Diane James ‘in blood’ to express their anger at the bigger parties. Recent polls have put UKIP comfortably in third place, behind the Tories in second and the Lib Dems ahead with a five point lead. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured campaigning in Eastleigh today, raised the prospect of a shock win for his party in tomorrow's by-election . But activists on the ground report a groundswell of support for UKIP in recent days, taking support from both coalition parties. Mr Farage told LBC 97.3: ‘It started off as a two-horse race with the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives ahead. ‘Over the course of the last week we have been coming up on the rails. We have almost drawn level with one full day’s campaign to go. ‘What we have got here is a very . exciting three-way marginal. I think this is the toughest by-election to . call we have ever seen. Comedian John O’Farrell, Labour’s candidate in Eastleigh, was slammed by David Cameron today over were ‘extraordinary’ comments about IRA terrorism and the Falklands War. The Prime Minister urged Labour leader Ed Miliband to disown the satirist's admission - in a 1998 book - that he felt ‘disappointment’ Margaret Thatcher was not killed in the 1984 Brighton bomb. Mr Cameron added that Mr O'Farrell (pictured, right, with Mr Miliband) had shown ‘a shocking lack of national patriotism and pride’ by writing that he had wished Argentina would be victorious in the 1981 Falkland conflict. It was ‘absolutely staggering’ that someone standing for public office had written of feeling a ‘surge of excitement at the nearness of Margaret Thatcher's demise and yet a disappointment that such a chance had been missed’, Mr Cameron said during Prime Minister’s Questions Mr Miliband failed to respond. Mr O'Farrell, who was campaigning with Cherie Blair in Southampton today, took to Twitter to defend himself, posting: ‘I wrote an honest memoir and volunteered this fleeting bad thought from 1984 to illustrate how hatred can poison politics.’ ‘Turnout makes a hell of a difference. People who have said they will vote UKIP will go out and vote for UKIP in blood. We could see a UKIP win,’ he added, although he accepted ‘the odds are against’. Bookies reported a surge in bets on a UKIP win. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: ‘UKIP are roaring into contention at the eleventh hour. Given the added safety net political punters have never been keener to back Farage's party. ‘We've never seen stakes this high in a by-election. Betting records have been smashed many times over.’ UKIP MEP Roger Helmer said he thought the party would secure a record share of the vote for a by-election, adding: 'If we do I shall drink a great deal of champagne.' In the Commons today David Cameron urged Tory MP 'who are not there already to make their way to Eastleigh this afternoon and support Maria Hutchings in the by-election campaign'. Former Tory leadership challenger . David Davis told BBC TV's Daily Politics: 'I think if we came third it . would be a crisis, I think that’s the case, and if it’s a close second . with UKIP on our tail it will also be uncomfortable. 'Lets . be clear, it's not gonna dislodge David Cameron, he’s going to be there . till the next election, but the simple truth is that it will make . things more uncomfortable in the House of Commons.' The . Eastleigh contest has been billed as a must-win for both David Cameron . and Nick Clegg, to reassure their party grassroots that they can defeat . their coalition partners in a straight fight. An opinion poll by former Tory deputy . chairman Lord Ashcroft suggested that in the Hampshire seat of . Eastleigh, where voters go the polls on Thursday, the Lib Dems are . clinging on to a five-point lead over their coalition partners. All the main parties stepped up their campainging efforts today in a last ditch bid to win support. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling was leading the Tory drive, while Deputy PM Nick Clegg was in the constituency to shore up votes for Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton. Labour's candidate, comedian John O'Farrell, has trailled in the polls and been dogged by comments about the IRA bomb attack which nearly killed Margaret Thatcher and wishing Britain had lost the Falklands war. Today he was joined by Cherie Blair on the campaign trail, although Labour insiders have given up hope of making any in roads in the crucial southern seat. Labour's candidate John O'Farrell was joined on the campaign trail by Cherie Blair, meeting Angela and Millie Lancaster 3, at Southampton's Children's Hospital . Tory candidate Maria Hutchings was joined by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling on the last day of campaigning . The Lib Dems had been confident that . Huhne’s resignation after pleading guilty to perverting the course of . justice would not damage their support. But . the party has since become embroiled in the Lord Rennard ‘groping’ scandal, with up to 10 women claiming he behaved inappropriately towards . them when he was the party’s chief executive until 2009. During his weekly radio phone, Mr . Clegg said it was a 'fair question' to ask why voters would trust his . party given its record of scandal. 'He told LBC 97.3: 'My sense is that . actually when people vote they ask themselves who's going to create . jobs, who's going to deliver fair taxes and who's going to protect green . spaces in the Eastleigh area and who is going to be an outstanding . local MP for my area. The Lib Dems are defending a 3,684 majority in the Eastleigh seat, with UKIP expected to make the biggest gains . A poll by Lord Ashcroft this week put the Lib Dems five points ahead of the Tories . 'And on all of those counts, delivering jobs, increasing the number of apprenticeships, delivering fairer taxes, lower council tax, fairer income tax and protecting green spaces I think everybody accepts in Eastleigh that it's the Liberal Democrats who've got the record of action.' Losing Eastleigh would be a major . blow to Mr Clegg, and pose a serious threat to his leadership ahead of . the party’s spring conference next week. It would mark the first time a prime minister has taken a seat in a . by-election since Margaret Thatcher in her Falklands pomp in 1982. The . Tories must also secure victory to prove Mr Cameron can make electoral . gains from his coalition partner, in the hope of landing an overall . majority in the 2015 election. UKIP leader Nigel Farage claims there has been a surge in support for Diane James, his party's candidate in Eastleigh . Must win: David Cameron and Nick Clegg, both pictured today, each need to secure victory in Eastleigh to prove to their party activists that they can defeat their coalition partners in a key seat . Education Secretary Michael Gove admitted the Tories risk losing votes to UKIP. Campaigning in Eastleigh he said: ‘Voting UKIP seems a cost-free way of saying we’re hurting. ‘People understand there is no alternative to the tough decisions David Cameron has made. But sometimes there are people who are tempted to cast a protest vote,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. The Tories have warned voting for UKIP risks handing Mr Clegg a crucial win. Former UKIP MEP Marta Andreasen, who has defected to the Tories, appeared in Eastleigh alongside Cabinet . ministers including Michael Gove and Patrick McLoughlin to warn the ‘cold reality’ was a ‘vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg another pro-Euro MP’.","Nigel Farage claims: 'We could see a UKIP win'

The latest mobile app doesn’t just tell you where your friends and co-workers are – it tells you where nearby women are, and allows you to see their full name, photos, and send them messages. The Girls Around Me application takes your GPS data from Foursquare and searches for women in the immediate area who have also checked in on the location-based mobile service. News of the app’s less-than-careful data sharing has caused considerable online outrage, with many lambasting the app for making stalking easy and taking advantage of those who don’t understand privacy policies of social media. There's an app for that: Girls Around Me searches for women who have checked in via Foursquare . Stalker's paradise: The app promises to put you in control of finding women in the area, who often have no idea they are being searched . But Girls Around Me is a two-way street – users are first asked to link Girls Around me to their personal Facebook account. Once downloaded, the app requests a host of information, including the user’s Facebook log in, pictures, basic information including gender and age, as well as photos and email addresses. It asks permission to run even when the app itself is closed, thus allowing Girls Around Me to collect location data at all times. The app’s website advertises that Girls Around me ‘puts you in control!’ It continues: ‘Reveal the hottest nightspots, who’s in them, and how to reach them…’ It also says that users can easily find ‘love’ or ‘a one-night stand.’ Though the initial app download is free, users have to pay 99 cents for every ‘energy pack,’ to search for nearby women in area at an accelerated rate. Stanford lecturer Elizabeth Stark told the New York Times’ Bits blog that the application requires far too much information. Big brother: The app was harshly criticised for accessing women's data without their knowledge or permission . ‘This would be a very different application if it didn’t like back to Facebook, which is a treasure trove of information,’ she said. ‘With that link, this app could easily be a “let’s stalk women” app.’ Sophy Tobias, a spokesperson for Facebook, told MailOnline that people are responsible for how their information is viewed. She wrote: ‘People can control the privacy for their posts from Privacy Settings, or can customise the settings for individual posts from Facebook.com or their mobile device. Essentially, if the person posting has set the privacy for their post to anything but ‘public,’ it will not appear in the app.’ Cult of Mac said the app is, more than anything, a ‘wake-up call about privacy.’ The blog notes that Facebook and Foursquare users who don’t understand the importance of privacy are putting themselves in compromising positions. They wrote: ‘Most privacy settings on social networks default to share everything with everyone, and since most people never change those… well, they end up getting sucked up into apps like this.’ Foursquare spokesperson Laura Covington later released a statement following the original report by Cult of Mac. ‘This is a violation of our API policy, so we’ve reached out to the developer and shut off their API access,’ she said. However, the app is still available for download in the iTunes store. It is made by SMS Services O.o.o., which has also produced CoinKeeper, a budget tool, and Grocery Mate, a shopping list app.","App pulls data from women who recently checked in via Foursquare .

A life without cell phones, iPads or WiFi may seem a daunting prospect to many of us, but in the town of Green Bank, West Virginia, where every electronic device is banned, the residents like it that way. The remote town of just 147 people  in the Allegheny Mountains falls in the National Radio Quiet Zone, where wireless is banned across 13,000 square miles. The ban is in place to minimize disturbance next to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, home to the world's largest steerable radio telescope. While it may seem like an undesirable destination for today's tech-savvy citizens, many people are moving to the area as they believe it is better for their health. Silence: Residents living near the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the National Radio Quiet Zone in Green Bank, West Virginia are banned from using phones or wireless devices to lower interference . Diane Schou is just one of the residents who believes she suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, or EHS, which leaves her in pain whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies. Schou explained to Slate that before she and her husband escaped to Green Bank in 2007, she lived in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she suffered headaches, twitching muscles and chronic pain. She first noticed the pains in 2002 when a wireless provider put up a tower near their farm. 'I was extremely tired, but I . couldn't sleep at night,' she told Slate. 'I got a rash, I had hair loss, my . skin was wrinkled, and I just thought it was something I ate, or getting . older.' She soon began to connect the pains with . triggers - mobile phones, driving past signal towers - but the phone . company dismissed her claims, even though she has no doubt of the cause. 'I'll say, ""Oh, I have a headache,"" and then someone's cellphone will ring,' she said. Relief: Diane Schou, pictured with her husband Bert, said that whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies she suffers headaches, twitching muscles and chronic pain, but these have eased in Green Bank .

On trial: Dr Stephen Hamilton, a GP at Heaton Medical Practice in Bolton, is accused of raping the girl from the age of 10 . A family doctor raped a vulnerable schoolgirl from the age of 10 after secretly medicating her with an anti-depressant, a court heard. Dr Stephen Hamilton, 45, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, is alleged to have given the girl the drug citalopram before subjecting her to degrading sexual abuse. Manchester Crown Court heard how he would put his hands around the girl’s neck as he attacked her and told her ‘you deserve to die’. The historic offences are alleged to have occurred over two-and-a-half years between 2006 to 2009. Dr Hamilton, who is a GP and partner at Bolton’s Heaton Medical Centre,  was arrested after the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, complained to a teacher in November 2011. She . went on to describe the alleged abuse in graphic terms to police, . claiming that the GP would ‘restrict her breathing’ and ‘taunted her’ as . he raped her. The victim alleges that she suffered ‘nightmares’ about Dr Hamilton as a result of the alleged abuse. Opening . the case, prosecutor Louise Blackwell QC told the jury that the . complainant described Dr Hamilton as ‘very manipulative’. She said: 'In essence, what she described is that he controlled her in every way possible - including secretly medicating her.' The . court heard that a colleague at Dr Hamilton's practice reported him to . the General Medical Council when he learnt that he had prescribed the . girl citalopram, an anti-depressant not licensed for children. Dr Hamilton denies six charges of rape, three charges of sexual assault, four charges of child cruelty and a charge of administering a noxious substance. He answered ‘not guilty’ to each of the 14 charges when they were put to him in front of the jury moments before his trial began. Dr Hamilton is a partner at Bolton's Heaton Medical in Greater Manchester . During police interviews following his arrest, Dr Hamilton said he had been ‘completely exonerated’ by the GMC for the alleged offence. Miss Blackwell added: 'He threatened her that if she ever told anyone about anything of the sexual abuse that was taking place, that he would prove that she was making it up.' A relative of the complainant is alleged to have said the girl was ‘frightened’ of Dr Hamilton. The alleged victim told police Dr Hamilton would tell her she was ‘dirty’ and ‘filthy’ - leading her to ‘apologise to him’, the court heard. Miss Blackwell also told the jury that Dr Hamilton had been described by a key witness as someone who would ‘regularly speak about others in a derogatory way’. The witness described him as ‘being prejudiced against those less intelligent than he is and those less physically fit than he is’. Judge Richard Mansell QC warned the jury to ‘adopt a calm, dispassionate attitude’ to the evidence during the trial, which is expected to last up to four weeks. He said: 'Allegations of sexual offending, especially rape, can cause people to experience a range of emotions. 'It can engender feeling of sympathy or pity, outrage and disgust. Bear in mind these remain allegations unless and until you as a jury of 12 decide so that you are sure that the defendant is guilty of one or more of the allegations. 'Do not allow such feelings, if you have them, to affect your judgement in this case.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Dr Stephen Hamilton, 45, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, on trial .

A Yale expert said limiting a baby's exposure to mobile phone radiation would be 'warranted' Pregnant women who use mobile phones may be putting their babies at risk of developing behavioural problems, scientists have warned. Researchers from Yale University found exposure to radiation from mobiles during pregnancy affects the brain development of offspring, potentially leading to greater activity, anxiety and poor memory. They concluded mobiles could have a negative effect on babies in the womb after studying pregnant mice. However, a group of British scientists have poured scorn on the study labeling it 'alarmist and unjustified.' They pointed out that the unborn mice would have received a dose of radiation that was proportionally far higher than an unborn baby would get. They added that while the whole bodies of the mice were exposed a pregnant woman would tend to hold their phone a metre away from their uterus. The experts, from the University College of London, among others, added that a comparison is impossible between rodents and humans because mice are born after just 19 days with a brain that's at a far earlier stage of development compared to human babies. The introduction of the Yale study, published in the latest issue of the journal Scientific Reports, focuses on the rising number of ADHD cases in children, implying it could be linked to their research in mice. ADHD is a development disorder characterised by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.Between three and seven per cent of school-age children suffer from the disorder. Affected children tend to perform poorly at school and are at increased risk of delinquency. Diagnosis has increased at an average rate of three per year since 1997, making the condition 'a growing public concern,' according to the scientists. The researchers measured the brain . electrical activity of adult mice that were exposed to radiation as . foetuses and conducted a series of psychological and behavioural tests. They found that the mice that were . exposed to radiation tended to be more hyperactive and had increased . anxiety and reduced memory capacity. Senior author Professor Hugh Taylor said: 'We have shown that . behavioural problems in mice that resemble ADHD are caused by mobile . phone exposure in the womb. 'The rise in behavioural disorders in human children may be in part due to foetal cellular telephone irradiation exposure.' Professor Hugh Taylor (left) from Yale said behavioural disorders could be due in part to phone radiation exposure in the womb but Professor Katya Rubia (right) from UCL said the claim was 'alarmist and unjustified' In the study the authors concluded human tests would be needed before 'extrapolating these behavioural findings to humans.' But Prof Taylor, who is a member  of EHHI - an organisation 'dedicated to protecting human health . from environmental harms through research'  - added that limiting a foetus' exposure to mobile phone radiation seemed warranted. However, Professor Jim Stevenson from the . University of Southampton denounced the study as 'irresponsible.' He told the UK charitable trust, Sense about Science: 'There is to date only little . evidence of an association,' adding that no evidence from the . latest mouse study supported the conjecture. Professor Katya Rubia, from . the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, added that the link . made between mice and humans was 'alarmist and unjustified.' Non-comparable: Mice are only pregnant for 19 days . She said the fact the exposed mice in the study were more active could not be translated to complex disorders such as ADHD. She pointed out that anxiety levels decreased in exposed mice whereas it is typically higher in children with ADHD. Professor Eric Taylor from King's College London said the rate of ADHD . problems has actually been steady for more than 20 years and any increase is . most probably due to greater recognition of the disorder. A spokesman from the Health Protection Agency, told Mail Online: 'There is no hard scientific evidence that radio signals from mobile phones pose a risk to public health providing they are within ICNIRP (international body) guidelines. 'Very many studies into the effects of radio waves on health have been published over the past several decades. The authors of this study acknowledge themselves that their work had certain limitations. 'The Health Protection Agency constantly monitors and reviews this scientific research and will consider this study, along with other peer reviewed research, as part of that process.' The latest controversial study comes just two years after scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles, found children exposed to mobile phones in the womb had a 30 per cent rise in behavioural difficulties at the age of seven. The study looked at 29,000 youngsters, but some British scientists said the findings could be due to lifestyle factors rather than mobiles. They pointed out that mothers glued to their mobiles may very well be less likely to interact as much with their children.","Yale expert says it would be 'sensible' for pregnant women to limit their baby's exposure to mobile phones .

Mugshot: Alicia Gray was charged with two counts of second-degree sodomy and one count of second-degree sexual abuse . A married Alabama math teacher has been indicted on sex charges after she allegedly gave a 14-year-old student oral sex in February. A Mobile County grand jury has indicted Mary G. Montgomery High School math teacher Alicia Gray on charges of first-degree sodomy, sexual abuse and being a school employee who engaged in a sex act with a student younger than 19. Gray faces 10 years to life for the most serious charge, sodomy, which is a Class A felony. The other felony charge is punishable by up to 20 years. A judge had just found probable cause last week to send the case to a grand jury, AL.com reported. It can take months for a grand jury to act on a case but Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson said they had a sitting grand jury, which helped speed the process along. Gray, 28, remains free on bail and on paid leave from the Mobile County school system. According to NBC-15, the student told investigators his relationship with Gray started around New Year's Day and became more serious, ultimately leading to 'an exchange of oral sex' near or at the victim's home. The boy also told police Gray 'took several nude pictures' of herself and sent them to him via cell phone. A Mobile County District Court Judge on February 20 granted warrant to search Gray's home and officers seized several flash drives, two digital cameras and a cell phone. Patterson said there was 'additional evidence' to support the student's statement.

"By . Annabel Cole . PUBLISHED: . 17:21 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 24 April 2013 . To the deafening sound of One Direction, mothers and their pubescent daughters roam the giant basement toting enormous shopping baskets filled to the brim. But the baskets do not contain Capri pants, sundresses or other summer fashion staples, but thongs, push-up bras and skimpy knickers in neon shades, lace and leopard prints. Welcome to Pink, the teenage fashion department of U.S. lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret on London’s Bond Street. Risque: Annabel and Elsa, 13, with the racy underwear on sale at Pink . The brand, which is known for its risqué advertising campaigns and multi-million pound fashion shows featuring supermodels dubbed Victoria’s Secret Angels, opened its doors in Britain last summer, bringing its signature brand of overtly sexy underwear to a nation reared on M&S smalls. I turn around, keen to ask my 13-year-old daughter Elsa what she thinks of the store. But she is long gone — rifling through the rows of candy-coloured padded ‘plunge’ bras. A woman in front of me is combing through piles of bottom-revealing ‘mini cheeksters’ and eye-wateringly skimpy ‘V-strings’, until she emerges, triumphant, with a pair of extremely brief, lace-trimmed purple knickers. I assume she is buying them for herself, until she hands them to the 12-year-old schoolgirl by her side. The store seems to be heaving, but just last month the brand found itself mired in controversy with the launch of ‘Bright Young Things’, part of their Pink lingerie range aimed at teenagers featuring slogans such as ‘call me’ and ‘feeling lucky’. Parents were outraged, accusing the company of seeking to ‘sexualise’ very young girls. An online petition started by a mother to protest against the range has collected almost 19,000 signatures. After the outcry, some items were removed from the website and the company released a statement describing Pink as ‘a line for college-age women’. Capturing a younger market: Victoria's Secret said their Pink range is intended for 'college-age' girls . Speaking at a conference to publicise the new collection, Stuart Burgdoerfer, the company’s chief financial officer, reportedly said: ‘When somebody’s 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? 'They want to be older and they want to be cool like the girl in college and that’s part of the magic of what we do at Pink.’ The strategy is working. By 2010, six years after its launch in the U.S, Pink had recorded £650million in sales and had become so popular that stand alone stores had been launched in North America. But, as any mother knows, if something’s targeted at 16-year-olds, it’ll be 12 and  13-year-olds who covet it most. In fact, when the London store opened last year, my daughter and her friends went wild with excitement. They knew all about Pink from its glamorous advertising in fashion magazines and couldn’t wait to buy in to the brand. One of Elsa’s friends even attended the shop opening. Yet step inside London’s Victoria’s Secret, and it’s clear that Pink couldn’t be more dissimilar to Gap Kids, H&M or any other mainstream teen brand. In order to reach Pink, youngsters have to walk through the main store, which is kitted out like a bordello. The walls and floor are covered with gleaming black lacquer, mannequins display risqué underwear and numerous French mirrors reflect sheer lace babydoll nighties, corsets, thongs and suspenders. Concerns: Elsa thought the store was like a 'girls' dream world' but her mother worries it's too raunchy . Once downstairs, many of the items in the Pink collection are far from suitable for girls of that age. Lingerie . ranges have names like ‘the Pink flirt collection’ and bras are . categorised as ‘the heartbreaker plunge,’ ‘date bras’ and ‘campus . push-ups’, and are typically padded, under-wired or trimmed with lace. Many . of the knickers are blatantly provocative: there are piles of lacy . thongs and bright pink knickers which invite you to, ‘enjoy the view’. Looking through one of the many displays of knickers are 14-year-old Sophie Clarke, 12-year-old Jessie, her 11-year-old sister Amy and their mum Nikki, here from Winchester for a day’s shopping. ‘I am happy to be here with my mum,’ says Sophie quietly. ‘I think if I came with people my own age, I would feel under pressure to buy some of the more sexy items to show off.’ Pink was conceived as a transition range, to introduce teenage girls to the Victoria’s Secret brand before moving to the more adult lines — like a McDonald’s Happy Meal, but for lingerie. But not all the teens shopping in the store are plumping for modest, age-appropriate choices. Mags McLaren from Woking is shopping with her daughter Allana, aged 12. ‘Most of the bras are underwired and when we first came last year, Allana wanted desperately to have one. But I felt uncomfortable about my young daughter wearing something which would give her “cleavage”. As for the main Victoria’s Secret shop upstairs, it is totally off limits.’ Last month I wrote in Femail about the huge pressures which I, as a mother, feel that young teenagers are under to grow up too soon. Looking around Pink, which is positively humming with middle-class mothers and daughters, I feel depressingly vindicated. Of course, the fear for parents like me is that, in buying sexy underwear, our daughters will send out the message that they are ready to have sex long before this is the case. Provocative: Annabel fears the Pink range is encouraging young girls to grow up too fast . Dr Aric Sigman, a psychologist specialising in child health education, explains that this is not unfounded. ‘Through a label like Pink, Victoria’s Secret is clearly playing to the aspirational tendencies of the young. There is a clear line which can be drawn between exposing children to premature sexual cues and increased underage sexual behaviour.’ I spot Elsa again, bursting with excitement and keen to show me the contents of her basket which includes several underwired bras as well as T-shirts and a sweatshirt. Fortunately, she has avoided the more provocative knickers and looks disparagingly at those emblazoned with slogans. As we approach the changing rooms —– styled as gold and white mini-boudoirs — I am struggling to understand the appeal of Pink. Elsa explains: ‘Teenagers want to buy underwear because it’s something that ten-year-olds can’t do. ‘We are more image conscious than you were at my age and that means getting the whole look, not just clothes but hair, make-up and underwear too.’ But if raunchy underwear is part of that look, doesn’t she feel that there is a danger of giving out the wrong signals? Emulating the Victoria's Secret Angels: But by wearing sexy underwear, young girls are sending out the message they are ready for sex before they actually are . ‘Well obviously by 13, you are starting to think about being more attractive to boys, but my friends and I like it more because it’s fashionable and gives us a confidence boost.’ We end up buying T-shirt and a pastel-coloured bra which are both definitely at the acceptable end of the spectrum. As I hand over my credit card, I am conscious of the vast video wall at the top of the stairs which is playing footage of the Victoria’s Secret runway shows — a clear reminder of the very adult world just steps away — and suppress an involuntary shudder. I ask Elsa what she thinks of the store. ‘It’s like a girls’ dream world,’ she replies without hesitation. ‘Raunch culture’ or ‘dream world?’ As a parent, I know what I think, but as we leave behind queues of young girls waiting to pay at the tills, I am left with the distinct impression that in this debate, there is only one winner and her name is Victoria.","Lingerie giant's Pink range appeals to young girls .

Its fleet of modern military hovercraft projected the image of a combat-ready force at a time of mounting tension with the United States. It fitted, too, with warnings by the Communist dictatorship that it is preparing for an offensive to break the armistice which ended the Korean War 60 years ago. Scroll down for video . Propaganda: Image shows just how handy the North Koreans are with Photoshop as they get to work doctoring a picture to turn five military hovercraft into eight . Similarities: Close examination of the first two hovercraft approaching the shore appears to show identical patterns of surf flying up the side of the vessels, while parts of the background have been crudely erased using photographic software - with the one on the left a copy of the one on the right . But on closer examination the photograph seems to have been doctored, with images of two hovercraft each used twice and another pasted in. Thus five craft seem to have been turned into eight. The photo, issued by the Korean Central News Agency and widely  carried in the international media onTuesday, was said to show the hovercraft coming ashore on North Korea’s east coast the previous day. Troops of the Korean people’s army and navy could be seen running ahead, watched by the country’s new leader Kim Jong-un. Clones: The hovercraft furthest from view appears to be a copy of the one on the left of this close-up suggesting the rogue state only have six . In this picture which does not appear to have been doctored, troops are seen disembarking and storming up the beach. But there are only six hovercraft visible - so what happened to the other two? However photographic expert Alan Taylor believes the photo was digitally manipulated. Writing in Atlantic magazine’s In Focus section, Mr Taylor said: ‘Two hovercraft crashing through the surf, nearest to the photographer, appear to be just a single hovercraft, with a digital twin copied and pasted nearby. 'Two of the more distant craft appear to be digital twins as well. 'A third vehicle in the scene has some of the hallmarks of digital pasting, including colour mismatch, a slight halo, and soft edges.’ Scenes from the South: Meanwhile in South Korea tanks were seen being rolled out in Pocheon, around 28 miles north east of Seoul and nine miles south of the demilitarised zone separating the country from its neighbour to the North . Firepower: A South Korean army tank participating in a military exercise at the training field in Pocheon today, as North Korea announced it was severing its military hotline to the south . Heightened tensions: Cutting the military hotline with the South is the latest in a string of provocative moves by North Korea . Military might: Several South Korean army K1 tanks were seen in action at the Seungjin fire training field today, as tensions between the two Koreas rose even further . It is not the first time that North Korea has been accused of doctoring images for propaganda effect. A photograph taken at the December 2011 funeral of the state’s previous leader, Kim Jong-il, showed half a dozen men, apparently TV journalists, looking away from the cortege in the capital Pyongyang. In the manipulated version, the men and their cameras had vanished, giving the impression that all eyes were on the spectacle. Tension between the two Koreas has risen sharply since the North conducted its third nuclear test last month, triggering new UN sanctions against Pyongyang.

With an unruly head of hair and scruffy beard, he hardly looks like the best connected foreigner in China. But Daniel Foa, 36, will soon become just that when Xi Jinping ascends to become the country's next paramount leader in mid-November. The British entrepreneur is married to, and has a child with, Mr Xi's niece Hiu Ng. Powerful friends: Daniel Foa, 36, will soon become China's best connected foreigner when Xi Jinping ascends to become the county's next paramount leader in mid-November . Related: Mr Foa's wife Hiu Ng (left) is the niece of China's leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping (right) Mr Foa's powerful connections were . shown to be on the rise when, three years ago, he hired The Great Hall . of the People in Tiananmen Square to host a private dinner for Chinese . and Western businessmen. Holding . such an event in the home of Chinese politics - where the Communist . Party will next month reveal its new line-up of leaders, including Mr Xi . - is almost unheard of. For . it to have been hosted by a British-born businessman, albeit with his . connected wife, is a testament to how deep Mr Foa's links with the . Chinese establishment now extend. High-profile guests included Maurice . Strong, 83, a former under-secretary general of the United Nations, and . Yang Guomeng, the chief executive of Chinese communications company TOM. One . guest told the Daily Telegraph: 'Both of them were very professional. They are not just socialites. She got the room, and she seemed to be in . control and he was supporting her. She is smart at business, and he . seems to be too.' All this is a long way from Mr Foa's more modest routes back in Britain. Born in Wimbledon, he attended the nearby Donhead school before taking his A-levels at Esher college in Surrey. Following a stint at Portsmouth University, Mr Foa arrived in Shanghai a 'buccaneer', according to one friend, at the age of 23. He set about working his way up . through a succession of multi-national companies, including IBM, and . making inroads with the expat community, where he is remembered for . enjoying the city's bars and nightlife. He also captained a local football team, the Virgin Red Stars. One . expat who knew Mr Foa said: 'I have no negative opinions about him at . all. But I did not consider him likely to be able to penetrate China to . the extent that he has. How does a guy like that make contact with the . niece of Xi Jinping?' Mr Foa moved to Beijing in 2005. He now lives with his wife, who speaks fluent English, in the Shunyi suburb of the city. They have run a number of businesses focusing on charity and sustainability over the last five years. Mr Foa and Chinese actress Li Bingbing at the Sustainable Innovation Student Competition in Beijing in 2009 . Exclusive: Mr Foa's powerful connections were shown to be on the rise when, three years ago, he hired The Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square to host a private dinner for Chinese and Western businessmen . But friends now say it is increasingly difficult to maintain social contact with Mr Foa, such is the high security that comes with marrying into what will soon be China's first family. One told the Telegraph: 'These Red families are the aristocracy of China. They will have done their due diligence on him, he will have signed the contract and he is now living that closed and highly controlled existence. Would you do it? I would not.' Mr Foa's parents, Marco Foa and Mila Hurst, have separated. His father lives in a modest £250,000 terraced house in Cheltenham, situated just 200yards away from the home Zara Phillips shares with husband Mike Tindall. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I know Marco, but only to say hello. He's a quiet man who keeps himself to himself. He seems nice though.' Mr Foa's rise to prominence comes just one week after it emerged that a leading Chinese politician linked to the murder of Neil Heywood, another British entrepreneur, is to be tried for allegedly covering up the killing. Former leadership contender Bo Xilai has been expelled from the ruling Communist Party after being charged with abuse of power, taking bribes and other crimes including the alleged cover-up. His wife, Gu Kailai, 52, and her butler were found guilty in August of poisoning Mr Heywood, 42, with cyanide. If found guilty, Mr Bo, 63, could face the death penalty.

Gu claimed he had threatened to harm her 24-year-old son, Guagua, if he did not receive a larger pay-off for laundering millions of pounds. It is the latest step in a scandal that has overshadowed the political transition now set to take place in early November. The party's Politburo said that Mr Bo had been a candidate for top office until caught up in the scandal that included the murder of Mr Heywood.","Originally from Wimbledon, Daniel Foa is married to the niece of Xi Jinping .

Long form: Amanda Knox, who was acquitted of murder in 2011, is releasing her memoir on April 30 . While sitting in her prison cell in Italy, thousands of miles from home, Amanda Knox contemplated how she could kill herself. The shocking new detail is one of many penned in the American student’s new memoir, ‘Waiting to be Heard,’ which is slated to be published at the end of the month. The Seattle-native spent four years in a prison cell in Perugia after being convicted for the murder of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox also revealed that while living in her flat abroad, ‘marijuana was as common as pasta.’ Those details are only a few reported by the New York Times, which obtained an advance copy of the memoir. Knox writes that she at times felt trapped and pondered ending her life. ‘I started to understand how you could feel so locked inside your own life that you could be so desperate to escape, even if that meant that you would no longer exist.’ She writes that she was shocked to . learn she was put on suicide watch after her 2009 conviction, and was . equally surprised when a prison psychiatrist asked her if she had ever . contemplated it. According to the Times, Knox at one point considered suffocating herself with a garbage bag. Innocent: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead (file photo) Release: Knox, pictured right at Rome's airport, . gave an emotional press conference once she got back home in . Washington, left, a day after she was acquitted of murder in October . 2011 . Two weeks from now, readers will discover the ins and outs of the Seattle student’s grueling ordeal and the transformation from a carefree college student to an internationally-recognized convicted murderer. The memoir, published by . HarperCollins, is due to be released on April 30, and contain . first-person accounts from the trial and its immediate aftermath. But . according to ABC News, it does not include her life after the trial, or . her reactions after Italy’s highest court demanded last month that she . face a retrial. Miss Knox discussed how she is dealing with her emotions in an interview with ABC News, which will be aired later this month. She revealed: 'Things creep up on me and I'm overwhelmed by the feeling of helplessness, desperation and fear to even hope. My heart races and it leaves me paralysed until I can breathe it away.' In her memoir, she writes: 'When . Meredith was murdered and I was arrested, it was so shocking. It was . paralysing, Everything toppled.' The Seattle-native also writes that . being naïve and proud contributed to her initial guilty conviction, . judging herself for acting ‘like a lost, pathetic child’ when dealing . with Italian authorities. Capture: Knox, pictured in 2010 being escorted out of court by Italian law enforcement officials . She also denied that she was . performing cartwheels outside the police station after she was arrested, . an infamous action that was widely reported at the time of the trial. According to the book, the police interrogated Miss Knox for hours and would slap her on the back of her head. Italian police are taking legal action against her parents for making similar allegations. According to the Times, HarperCollins . publishers have described Knox as intelligent and charming, and did not . shy away from unsavory facts. In fact, Knox is reported to want to use . this platform to confront the rumors, myths, and confusion associated . with the case that enthralled the world. She writes that the memoir is about setting the record straight. During the murder trial for . 21-year-old Kercher, the Italian prosecution condemned Knox as a ‘she . devil’ and used passages from Knox’s journal where she wrote she would . ‘kill’ for a pizza.' Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007 . Miss Knox writes that the prosecution took these entries out of context, saying that it was merely ‘gallow humor.’ She also claims that she was reading a Harry Potter book, smoking marijuana and watching a film at her boyfriend's flat on the night of the murder. Her time behind bars at Capanne . Prison, outside of Perugia, was extremely difficult for Knox, who writes . that she was taunted by her cell-mates for being a snob, noticing she . spent most of her time behind bars reading and writing letters. She was only allowed outside for one hour a day. She writes: 'My guard wanted to know who I had sex with, how I like it - and if I'd do it with him.' ABC News notes that all throughout the 484-page memoir, Knox professes her innocence. The book will be published in the . U.S., but not in the U.K., amid fears that the memoir could further . complicate the retrial that Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled . last month. Since her release, Knox has been at Washington State studying creative writing. Italian Raffaele Solecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed in October 2011 after their convictions . were overturned due to a lack of evidence. However, both now face a retrial after Italy's highest court demanded it. Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found . semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. Miss Knox . became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she . shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front . of investigators. Sollecito tells how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her. Murder charges: Raffaele Sollecito, left, and Amanda Knox, right, are pictured arriving for a hearing in Perugia's court, in 2009; in Sollecito's book published last September, he maintains his innocence but says he and his then-girlfriend behaved oddly . Next to normal: Since being acquitted, Knox has been studying creative writing at a Washington state university . Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion. In the hours after the gruesome . murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed . kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated. Italian authorities . later described Sollecito’s behavior ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had . no real alibi 'except each other.' They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep. The pair was imprisoned days after the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both would remain there for nearly four years. An appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence against them. Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence. Studying abroad: Knox shared a house with Kersher in Perugia, outside of Rome . Police found their behavior 'odd' and he acknowledged they had no 'real alibi the night of November 1 except each other.' Honor bound: Sollecito's book was released last September . The . couple were arrested several days after Kercher's death and later . convicted in proceedings that made headlines around the world. Prosecutors portrayed the case as a . drug-fuelled sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito were sentenced to 26 . years and 25 years, respectively. The . appeals court found the prosecution's theory to be unsupported by any . evidence. Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal, and Italy's highest . court will hear their arguments next March. Sollecito met Knox at a classical music concert at the Universita per Stranieri, the University for Foreigners, on October 25, 2007 - a week before Kercher's death. He asked for her number, and she told him to come by the bar where she'd be working later that night. At the end of the shift, he writes in his new book, they took a walk, held hands and kissed. She accepted an invitation to come back to his apartment and spent the night. Soon the couple became inseparable. She began spending the nights at his apartment. They shopped for groceries together, and took a sightseeing day trip to Assisi. Guilty: Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, was convicted of Kercher's murder . Meredith Kercher, a British student studying abroad in Perugia, was found murdered in the flat she shared with U.S. student Amanda Knox on November 1, 2007. She, along with Knox and Sollecito were studying at the city’s University for Foreigners. In the days following the murder, Knox, her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and Perugian resident Rudy Guede were all arrested for the grisly crime. The horrific murder of the bright young woman shocked the world, and for the next four years, the world watched as Knox and Sollecito were put on trial for the murder of the 21-year-old, who suffered 43 separate knife wounds. While being questioned by the police following the murder of her flatmate, Knox was reportedly performing cartwheels in the station and sat on Sollecito’s lap during the interrogation. However, during her appeal, Knox addressed her actions, saying: ‘Everyone deals with tragedy in their own way.’ Guede, a drug dealer who was originally from the Ivory Coast, was later convicted of the murder. While Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of their charges, authorities rejected Guede's appeal after his DNA was found inside of Kersher’s body. To this day, there are many unknowns in the case, though the prosecution’s original story – that Guede broke into the cottage and tried to rape Kercher with the assistance of a drug-addled Knox and Sollecito – is deeply flawed and is now known to be far from the truth.","Amanda Knox's memoir, 'Waiting to be Heard,' slated to be published April 30 by HarperCollins .

John McAfee today accused the Belize government of arranging to have a fire started at his property, destroying two main residences and causing $500,000 damage. Two buildings at the software tycoon's $5million island compound in the Central American country were gutted by fire on May 16. Speaking from his home in Portland, Oregon, McAfee told MailOnline today that he believed the Belize government had paid a low-level individual to commit arson. In flames: John McAfee claims that a senior Belize government official arranged for a fire to be set on his property in Carmelita . Nothing left: Two of the structures at the $5million compound were entirely ruined . Scorched: No one was in the properties at the time when the fires took hold . McAfee said that he has a private investigator working on the case who could prove that Landy Burns, the political representative for the town of Orange Walk East, was behind the fire. McAfee said that a woman has been charged with reckless endangerment over the fire but no corroborating reports were found. Orange Walk police department had not responded to an email from MailOnline. No one was in the buildings at the time of the fire. McAfee believes that the fire is part of a campaign against him by the Belize government which began in 2012 when he was asked for a $2million donation which he refused to hand over. He said he was offered land deals as part of the package but refused. A short time later, the tycoon said 42 armed soldiers appeared on his property, shot his dog and left him handcuffed in the sun for 12 hours. The fire is the latest twist in John . McAfee's roller-coaster life that saw the 67-year-old tech pioneer flee Belize in November after he was named a 'person of interest' in the death of his American neighbor Gregory Viant Faull. McAfee has never been named as a suspect in the murder case which is yet to be solved. Scorched: John McAfee's property in Belize was destroyed by a bush fire on May 16 but he claims foul play . Ruins: The $500,000 property was reduced to rubble following the blaze . 7newsbelize.com revealed that the buildings in Carmelita were gutted by a bush fire which started around 1pm on May 16. It is the latest chapter in the surreal life of McAfee. Last November, he went on the run after Belize police wanted to question him as a 'person of interest' in the fatal shooting of Mr Faull. Faull, 52, was shot dead last November on the Caribbean island where both men lived. McAfee had been living in the Central American nation but fled after police . sought to question him about his fellow ex-pat and neighbor's death.

A Florida mother has been charged in the death of her 11-month-old son whom authorities say she left inside her hot car making her third related arrest only months after social workers deemed her children to be 'safe.' Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, was charged with aggravated manslaughter in Miami-Dade County on Saturday after her son’s unconscious body was pulled from her car with a temperature of 109-degrees on Thursday. Police say Bruno left her son, Bryan Miguel Osceola, in the vehicle around noon and forgot about him. Charged: Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, is charged with aggravated manslaughter after police say she forgot her 11-month-old son inside her car . After an undetermined amount of time passed, the boy's father told police that he asked Bruno where the child was. The mother recalled leaving him in the vehicle. That's when the child's father, Amos Osceola, ran outside and pulled his son's body out of the car. A beer can and the mother's purse were also found inside the vehicle, the Miami Herald reports. This week's arrest marks Bruno's third on similar charges. In November Bruno was arrested for child neglect and driving under the influence after she was found passed out behind her steering wheel with her infant son unstrapped in the front seat. Police say she hit several walls before passing out, leaving the car in drive. Behind bars: On Saturday a judge set Bruno's bail at $250,000 and took away her custody of her two surviving children and her right to unsupervised contact with minors if she posts . In July she was also found drinking by police who were called to her home over a report of domestic violence. Her husband was arrested in that incident for beating her in front of their three young children. But despite her arrests, Bruno never underwent alcohol treatment, parenting classes or any other services. The Department of Children & Families said Bruno's children were at 'moderate' risk following July's domestic attack but otherwise deemed 'safe,' the Herald reports. Bruno's attorney told NBC Miami that he doesn't believe her latest arrest shows substantial connection to her previous incidents with the DCF. 'With that underlying case there's a presumption of innocence. She has not been found guilty of that particular case. I don't think there's any allegation that there was any alcohol involved in this particular case. So, I don't think that case bears anything with respect to this case,' Frank Gaviria said. Bruno's bond is set at $250,000 for her latest arrest. A judge has ordered that if she is posts bond she not have any unsupervised contact with minors, custody of her two surviving children, be allowed to operate a vehicle and she would have to wear a GPS monitoring device while on house arrest.","Catalina Marista Bruno, 30, is charged with aggravated manslaughter in death of 11-month old son .

The Treasury analysis warns an independent Scotland's banking sector would be 1254 per cent of the entire economy . An independent Scotland could be plunged into a devastating Cyprus-style crash, the Treasury warned today. If Scotland goes it alone its banking sector would be 1,250% bigger than its national economy, leaving the government powerless to act in the event of a financial crisis. The would also be ‘significant difficulties’ in guaranteeing customers’ deposits in any Scottish banks which got into trouble, ministers claimed. Analysis by the UK Treasury reveals how vulnerable Scotland would be if voters back independence in the referendum in autumn 2014. However the Scottish Government has already dismissed the paper as 'far-fetched' and 'flimsy'. Scotland Secretary Michael Moore and Treasury minister Sajid Javid launched the report today, arguing that after independence the Scottish banking sector ‘would be oversized, with assets totalling around 1250 per cent of Scotland’s GDP’. They added: ‘By way of comparison, before the crisis that hit Cyprus in March 2013, its banks had amassed assets equivalent to around 800 per cent of its GDP – a major contributor to the cause and impact of the financial crisis in Cyprus and the ability of the Cypriot authorities to prevent the systemic effects when it hit.’ When the crisis hit Cyprus in March, long queues formed at cash machines as customers scrambled to access their money. The cash-strapped island needed an £8.5billion package to bailout its lenders, but savers with more than £85,000 in its banks were told they would lose 40 per cent of their money under conditions imposed by the European Union. The new Treasury analysis also warns that the 2008 taxpayer-funded bailout of Edinburgh-based RBS was only possible with the financial backing of the whole of the United Kingdom. The UK Government spent £45 billion recapitalising RBS in order to protect the deposits and savings of thousands of  households and businesses, the report says. The bank also received £275 billion of state support in the form of guarantees and funding. These bailouts alone would have been 211 per cent of Scotland’s GDP, including the geographical share of North Sea Oil. ‘As a range of independent commentators have noted, Scotland would not have been able to afford such interventions alone. ‘Other countries such as Ireland, Iceland and more recently Cyprus were unable to absorb the implications of the financial crisis on their own.’ The new study on the impact of independence on financial services and banking, also states that Scotland could have ‘significant difficulties’ providing protection which would match schemes such as the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) which protects deposits in UK banks up to £85,000. It also states that members of defined benefit pension schemes would not be covered by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), with an independent Scotland required to provide such protection through a similar guarantee fund under EU rules. Queues formed at cash machines in Cyprus when uncertainty over a bailout for the island's banks caused panic among savers in March this year . Mr Moore said: 'There are a number of reasons why this country, and this city in particular, offer so much as a location for the financial sector,"" he told the invited audience at the official launch of the document. 'Some of these factors may not be impacted by Scotland becoming independent, like the excellent universities here or the lifestyle opportunity on offer, especially right here in Edinburgh. 'But Edinburgh and Scotland offer even more as a place to do business as part of the United Kingdom.' The paper is the third in a series of reports assessing the impact of a yes vote in 2014. Scotland Secretary Michael Moore said Scotland offered more as a place to do business as part of the UK . It argues that the UK can afford to compensate savers if banks get into difficulties, as they did during the 2008 collapse, but an independent Scotland would be required to set up its own deposit guarantee scheme rather than share existing UK schemes. The paper says: ‘The UK Government lent around £20 billion to the FSCS during the recent financial crisis. Under European law an independent Scottish state would not be able to 'share' the UK's deposit guarantee scheme, such that it covered firms authorised in both Scotland and the continuing UK. ‘The retail deposit market in a separate Scotland would be dominated by only two large banks (RBS and BoS) and, if one of these were to fail, the costs for compensating the depositors would fall almost entirely on the one remaining bank.’ It continues: ‘If Scotland were to be become independent, it could create particular difficulties for the FSCS. In an independent Scottish state, FSCS-eligible deposits held by Scottish firms (and which would therefore be covered by the Scottish compensation scheme) would be over 100% of Scotland's GDP, representing a significant contingent liability of the state - and a much more significant proportion than in the UK as a whole. ‘As was clear from the 2008 financial crisis, where there are doubts about the ability of the sector to meet claims through the compensation scheme, it can be necessary for governments to step in to guarantee deposits in order to prevent deposit flight.’","Stand-alone nation could not afford to bailout troubled lenders .

The ex-wife of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt says she made a mistake in agreeing to a divorce settlement of $131 million because she claims the value of his MLB team was misrepresented. Jamie McCourt wants the settlement set aside because she believes she . was misled about the value of the Dodgers. The team was valued at $300 million when their divorce was finalized in 2010 but the Dodgers franchise later sold for . $2 billion in May 2012. An attorney for Mr McCourt said in court in Los Angeles on Wednesday that the settlement should stand because the claims made by McCourt's ex, Jamie, aren't credible. Mistake: Jamie McCourt, left, the ex-wife of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, right, says she made a mistake in agreeing to a divorce settlement of $131 million . His lawyer said during closing arguments of a non-jury trial that Jamie McCourt opted for certainty over risk during tumultuous times for the Dodgers. The former couple's marriage was dissolved in October 2010, and less than a year later the Dodgers went into bankruptcy. A ruling isn't expected until summer. In September 2012, the ex-wife of the 59-year-old businessman filed a motion to set aside the couple's 2010 divorce settlement, accusing McCourt of committing fraud by vastly understating the Dodgers’ value. Jamie McCourt's attorney, Bertram Fields, said that attempts to modify what he called a ‘massive imbalance’ in the settlement failed, forcing her to return to court. Big league legal brawl: Jamie McCourt (in LA Court for her divorce trial in August 2010) is seeking to get a larger divorce settlement in wake of the $2 billion her husband made selling the Dodgers in 2012 . The motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court claims Frank McCourt misrepresented the couple's Dodger assets as worth less than $300 million before their divorce in 2010. The team sold in May 2012 for $2.15 billion to a group that includes former NBA star Magic Johnson. Under the terms of the divorce settlement finalized in October 2011, Jamie McCourt agreed to give up on her share of the Dodgers in exchange for $131million. She was also allowed to keep four of the couple's six homes. Fun and games: Los Angeles Dodger manager Joe Torre, left, shakes hands with Dodger owner Frank McCourt on March 31, 2008 . Major investment: Frank McCourt paid $430 million in 2004 to buy the team, Dodger Stadium and 250 acres of land. He sold the team for $2 billion in May 2012 . In late March, McCourt finalized a record-breaking deal with a group of investors called Guggenheim Baseball Management to sell the troubled Los Angeles team. 'This agreement with Guggenheim reflects both the strength and future potential of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and assures that the Dodgers will have new ownership with deep local roots, which bodes well for the Dodgers, its fans and the Los Angeles community,' McCourt said at the time. The businessman paid $430million in 2004 to buy the team, Dodger Stadium and 250 acres of land that include the car parks, from the Fox division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, a sale that left the team with about $50million in cash. The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy protection in late June 2011, just days before the team was expected to miss payroll. The filing came after baseball Commissioner Bud Selig refused to approve a 17-year agreement between the Dodgers and Fox's Prime Ticket subsidiary that would have been worth $ 2billion or more. When times were simpler: Frank and Jamie McCourt were married for nearly 30 years, before their separation sparked one of the costliest divorce fights in California history . Prior to their divorce, the McCourts had six homes and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet and $10,000 a month for Jamie's hair stylist. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing and Frank once shelled out $80,000 on a Caribbean vacation. The couple met as freshmen at Georgetown University. They married in 1979 and have four sons. The McCourts announced in October 2009 that they would be ending their 30-year marriage - and Frank fired Jamie as CEO. Comfortable living: This is the Los Angeles property of Frank McCourt. The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet . The former couple continued their feud over the team’s ownership and then the MLB took control of the club's day-to-day operations in mid-April. The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in June 2011 and lawyers for Jamie alleged that Frank was running the team into the ground. But Frank McCourt’s counsel claimed it was Jamie who was refusing to accept any settlements and was allowing the case to drag on. The Dodgers blamed a cash-flow crisis on the MLB's refusal to pass the television deal that Frank was counting on to keep the team afloat. A judge ruled last December that a post-nuptial marital agreement that gave Frank sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid. That allowed Jamie to seek half the team under California's community property law.","Frank and Jamie McCourt filed for divorce in 2010 after 30 years of marriage .

Not so 'super': Two serious incidents at the maternity department of The Royal Bolton Hospital (pictured) are being investigated . Both women had given birth at the Bolton NHS Foundation Trust maternity department, which was chosen to be a ""supercentre"" in the North West as part of Making it Better and has had £20 million invested in it over the past couple of years. Both women gave birth naturally, and afterwards, staff used swabs - a common procedure in cases where there has been tearing of the skin. A swab can be a cotton wool bud or a piece of gauze used to clean a wound or to apply pressure. But in both cases, the swabs were left inside the women. They have been described as 'Never Events', which means they should not take place if proper safety measures are implemented. Some common medical tools used during childbirth .

Police chiefs are wasting millions of pounds when buying basic kit because they cannot agree on the details - such as how many pockets a uniform should have. The national spending watchdog found widespread disagreement between forces about what kind of high visibility jackets they prefer for their officers and how they like their handcuffs. As well as disagreeing on many pockets a police uniform needs, forces also hold opposing views about what constitutes a good boot. Police chiefs are wasting millions as they can't agree on basic details of uniform such as handcuffs, boots and hi-vis jackets . As a result of their lack of agreement, forces are not using their combined purchasing power to its greatest advantage, and some are spending much more than others on simple items, the National Audit Office has concluded. In a report published today it reveals some forces are paying as much 400 per cent more than others for each high-visibility jacket. The highest price paid by a force was £100 per jacket, compared to a unit cost of just £20 in others. Astonishingly, the report found 20 different specification differences between high-viz jackets. A spokesman for the NAO said these included whether it should be a heavy anorak or a lightweight cagoule, the levels of waterproofing and weight. Damian Green estimates that the force will have saved £110million by March 2012 through better procurement . On handcuffs, forces differed on whether they preferred the steel finish or a black colour, and how the two cuffs should be linked together. Some forces spent just £14 on a set of cuffs, compared to £43 in the most spendthrift constabulary. Riot shields can be round, curved or long, interlocking and vary in weight and thickness. Some forces prefer shields with map holders and dog handling straps. They cost between £31 and £136 depending on the force. Body armour varied in areas such as thickness and colour and in price from £203 to £410. If forces could agree common standards on those five standard goods, they could save 25 per cent of their procurement budgets - or £1.6million a year, the report said. But coming in the way of agreement was that each piece of equipment had at least nine separate specifications. The report said: ‘Forces have found it particularly hard to agree common specifications for uniform, which they spent almost £8million on in 2010-11. The auditors added: ‘If forces cannot agree on such areas, meaningful collaboration will not be feasible. Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It is unbelievable that something as simple as a high-visibility jacket has 20 different specifications, with associated prices that differ by as much as £80. ‘Instead of focusing money on tackling crime, police forces are wasting resources disagreeing over how many pockets they should have on their uniforms.' Forces are facing cuts in Home Office funding totalling £2.1 billion over the five years to 2015. Together they spend £1.7billion on non-IT equipment every year. The NAO said forces could save £2.6 million a year - up to a third of their uniform costs - by agreeing a common specification. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said that it is unbelievable that there were so many differences between the forces . NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘Faced with the pressure to make substantial savings, it makes sense for police forces to examine the scope for cutting the cost of buying goods and services. ‘What is clear is that many opportunities for savings remain unexploited. ‘Agreement between forces on collaborative ways of buying and common specifications for equipment can deliver better value for money - but implementing this is a challenge where forces are used to doing their own thing. Policing and criminal justice minister Damian Green said: ‘The NAO report recognises progress is being made. ‘The police are already required to buy vehicles, body armour and some IT through national agreements and we estimate forces will have saved £110 million by March 2013 through better procurement.’","Disagreed on basic things, such as how many pockets a uniform needs .

Rachael Lewis rushed her daughter Ellie-Louise (right) to hospital after her stomach swelled and her skin turned grey. She was diagnosed with a rare ovary tumour (see X-ray left) Ellie-Louise Lewis in hospital after having a three-hour operation to remove an ovary and the tumour . Four days later she underwent a three-hour operation to have the 4.7in (12cm) malignant tumour removed from her ovary. Mrs Lewis, from Carlton, Nottinghamshire, first took her daughter to the GP who sent them straight to Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre. The mother-of-two said: 'She was massive, if she wasn't seven, I would have thought she was pregnant. 'She had that grey colour that people have when they look like they're going to die.

Most patients with the tumours are adults, but five per cent are in the early stages of puberty or pre-pubescent. The cancer originates in the granulosa cell in the sex cord - a tube that links to testes in males and ovarian follicles in women. Ellie-Louise had an ovary removed along with the tumour and will have four sessions of chemotherapy over three months with MRI scans every three months to check the cancer does not return. Her grandfather Alex Lewis, 48, added: 'When we first saw her in hospital we didn't think she was going to make it. 'The weight of it was stopping her breathing. If I could have taken it off her, I would. I'd have preferred it to be me. 'She looked like she had two footballs in her belly. It was terrifying but we are just so grateful she was diagnosed early.

A woman who worked at a Philadelphia abortion clinic for eight years has testified that patients were routinely given too much medication - to the point that women went into labour 'too fast'. Latosha Lewis, who is a witness in the murder trial against her former boss Dr. Kermit Gosnell, said records were so poorly kept it was hard to know how much medication each woman had been given. Gosnell, 72, is charged with murdering seven babies at Philadelphia Women's Medical Society and with the death of a woman, who suffered cardiac arrest after she was given too much anesthesia. Lewis initially worked as a 'medical assistant' but said she stopped helping him out during abortions because she was concerned about the level of anesthesia used during one procedure. On trial: Kermit Gosnell, pictured, is accused of killing the babies at the Philadelphia Women’s Medical Society clinic and a 41-year-old woman who was administered too much anesthesia and suffered cardiac arrest . 'I was the person who had given her too . much and I was concerned whether she would come up from anesthesia,' Lewis, 31, told the jury, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. She added that the women were given so much medication to soften the cervix that 'people were going into labor too fast. I didn't want to deal with it'. Other witnesses in the case have . revealed that the women began aborting the fetuses so quickly that they . delivered them in the waiting room or the toilet. Instead, Lewis said she started working on the reception desk and carrying out ultrasounds. She has not been charged in the murder case against Gosnell and cooperated with authorities. 'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009 . Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there . However, she was charged in a December 2011 case claiming that Gosnell was selling prescriptions for powerful narcotics and addictive painkillers. Lewis pleaded guilty to drug . distribution charges.

He allegedly killed the babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. Gosnell is also charged with one count of third-degree murder in the . death of Karnamaya Mongar, who was killed by an . overdose of pain medication administered during an abortion procedure. If found guilty, Gosnell faces a possible death sentence. Last week, Lynda . Williams, 44, testified to seeing babies have their . necks snipped by Gosnell. Williams, said Gosnell taught her how . to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she . only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps.'

She . told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients . that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit. She . added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - . and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, . leaving his hand print behind.

Madonna, pictured kneeling among Malawi's orphans, has come in for criticism from the country's President . Bumping along a red dirt road in one of the world’s poorest countries last week, a cavalcade of six luxury four-by-fours eventually came to a halt outside a ramshackle school. It was an entrance you would expect of a visiting head of state. But, instead, the bird-like figure of Madonna emerged from the back of the lead car, hair scraped back and hands still moist from the anti-bacterial gel she had applied seconds earlier. Moments later, she was posing for photographers in the centre of a group of beaming children at the Mkoko primary school in rural Malawi, her image as billionaire pop diva swapped for that of Lady Bountiful and international humanitarian. But if the singer thought her four-day trip to the African state would highlight the school-building programme she helps fund — plus offer some worthwhile personal PR — she was sorely mistaken. Instead, as a result of her so-called ‘goodwill mission’ to the poverty-stricken country, the Material Girl finds herself at the centre of an ongoing diplomatic incident that threatens to tarnish her image as St Madonna of Malawi. She has been accused by the nation’s female president of exploiting her aid work for personal publicity, overplaying her charity’s achievements and of reneging on her promise to build a £10 million state-of-the-art academy for poor schoolgirls. In an unprecedented attack, President Joyce Banda also accused the singer — who adopted two of her four children from Malawi — of ‘making the poor dance for her’. In a final slight, the star and her entourage were made to queue with economy passengers before flying out of the capital Lilongwe this week. A statement issued by President Banda’s office claimed Madonna had bullied state officials and demanded VIP treatment. It read: ‘If [...] because she is an internationally-renowned star, Madonna believes she deserves to be treated differently from other visiting foreigners, it is worth making her aware that Malawi has hosted many international stars, including Chuck Norris, Bono, David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville, who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature.’ More than meets the eye: Madonna, with her adopted two children David Banda, right and Mercy James, left, has been accused of 'patronising arrogance' President Banda has since said that she did not approve the statement, but has offered no apology. Relations have been further soured by a scrawled, and mis-spelled letter 54-year-old Madonna wrote to Mrs Banda, belatedly requesting an audience. To make matters worse, the note was sent days after the star’s people had hinted that Madonna might not be able to grace the country’s leader with her time. And if that were not enough, Madonna’s charity chief, Trevor Neilson, has caused outrage by accusing Malawi government officials of corruption on Twitter. Meanwhile, the country’s education minister has poured scorn on claims that Madonna’s charity, Raising Malawi, has built ten new schools for 4,800 children. ‘The schools were already in existence,’ says Eunice Kazembe. ‘It is classrooms that Madonna has donated. They have built ten classroom blocks. It is helpful, but it is a long shot to call it significant.’ Madonna’s spokesman says that without her involvement, children at the schools would be taught ‘under trees’ and denies that the star requested VIP treatment. Not impressed: Joyce Banda, President of Malawi, has spoken out against the demands and attitude of Madonna . Given that Malawi relies almost totally on aid and Madonna was once said to be its biggest individual benefactor, it is remarkable that the country has turned on her with such vehemence. But behind this bitter PR war are accusations of wasted millions, an obsession with self-publicity and a grudge over the singer sacking President Banda’s sister as the head of her African charity. There are also claims that, despite insistence that her two Malawian children, David, seven, and Mercy, eight — whom she adopted in 2006 and 2009 respectively — would remain in touch with their roots, they have been kept away from family members in the country. David and Mercy took centre stage last week as Madonna and her natural children Lourdes, 16, and Rocco, 12, toured the schools she helped fund. Yet Mercy’s uncle, Peter Baneti, says he was not told of the trip or given a chance to see his niece. He was left shuttling between the department of social welfare and the Kondanani Children’s Village orphanage, where Mercy was placed as a baby, trying in vain to find her. ‘I was not told they were coming and I have spent every day trying without success to see Mercy again,’ he complained. Mood swing: Madonna appears in good spirits as she greets Malawian locals here - but she has been accused of behaving inappropriately by senior officials . Likewise, since Madonna adopted David, there have been angry claims that the boy’s Malawian relatives have been edited out of his life. David was placed in the Home of Hope orphanage, in the western district of Mchinji, after his mother died following his birth in 2005. His father, Yohane Banda, 39, no relation to the country’s president, was supportive of the adoption. But now he says he believed his son would be returned home to him after being educated in America. In a rare meeting in 2009, David apparently did not recognise his father. More recently, Mr Banda has been talking about being ‘cheated’ out of seeing his son grow up. Certainly,he was nowhere to be seen during last week’s trip as David posed for a series of photos, including kissing babies at the orphanage where he once lived. However, there was talk of Madonna allowing David to meet his biological father last Friday, a day before she and her entourage flew back to America on a private Gulfstream jet. It is not known if the meeting took place. Part of the anger within Malawi is centred around the fact that senior members of the government believe the Material Girl reneged on a deal that allowed her to adopt the two children in first place. Bit of a difference: Madonna has claimed she 'built' a number of schools, whereas officials state that she actually constructed a number of 'classrooms' They waived strict rules that state non-Malawians have to be resident in the country for at least 18 months before adopting. But a blind eye was turned because of the star’s promise to build the 400-bed Academy for Girls through her Raising Malawi charity, backed by the Kabbalah Centre in Los Angeles. The allegation is that after promising the £10 million project, Madonna is now doing her charity work on the cheap. Raising Malawi and Success For Kids, did not actually build any of the schools she visited. That job was done by American charity BuildOn, which has been erecting two-room schools in the state for 20 years. In fact, Madonna closed the offices of both her charities in Lilongwe in 2011. According to the Global Philanthropy Group, which oversees her charity work, the singer has donated $400,000 (£260,000) to BuildOn. Given that the charity’s annual income is in the region of $9 million (£5.8 million), Madonna is a fairly minor contributor. Significantly, the woman she appointed to run Raising Malawi, Anjimile Mtila-Oponyo, is the sister of President Banda. In 2011, Madonna sacked Mrs Oponyo and seven of the charity’s executive committee after discovering a black hole in its accounts. It was claimed that Oponyo and her staff frittered away £2.4 million on cars and golf membership before a brick had even been laid. However, staff insist the perks were written into their contracts. None of which is much of a return on the £7 million Madonna has personally pumped into Malawi since her first visit in 2006. Whatever the truth, the Material Girl’s reputation as the self-styled saviour of Africa has taken something of a dent.","Accused of exploiting her work for personal publicity .

"By . Claudia Joseph . PUBLISHED: . 16:01 EST, 2 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:50 EST, 3 June 2012 . Craig Summers (pictured) confessed to burning the body of dead baby to protect the health of BBC staff . A BBC bodyguard has confessed to burning the body of a baby on a funeral pyre made of rubbish after the 2004 tsunami – because he considered it a threat to the health of his reporting team. Craig Summers, 52, discovered the body outside the house in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where he was staying with journalist Ben Brown and his production team as they covered the aftermath of the disaster. But instead of reporting it to the local authorities, he burned the body of the boy and swore two other witnesses, including BBC producer Peter Leng, to secrecy. There is no suggestion that Mr Brown knew about the incident. Writing in his new book Bodyguard: My Life On The Frontline, Summers compared the body to an obstacle such as a ‘blocked toilet’. ‘I pride myself in my work,’ writes Summers, now head of security at Sky TV. ‘Nobody got sick on that trip. Nobody even came close to diarrhoea and I knew that I had done my job keeping everyone else healthy. I ran a tight ship ensuring everyone always washed their hands with wet wipes. ‘The baby was an obstacle to their health; the next day it would be a blocked toilet. I hadn’t known it was coming but I had to deal with it and I would do the same again.’ The revelation comes four months after the BBC’s Head of Newsgathering, Fran Unsworth, and Head of Safety, ex-Army officer Paul Greeves, tried to persuade Summers not to publish the biography. According to the bodyguard, they summoned him to a meeting in January after he sent them a draft copy of the manuscript, and asked him to abandon the project. It is not known what they objected to within the book – although  the confession does not paint the Corporation in a good light. Summers, a former commando, served with British Forces in the Falklands and Balkans before being appointed the Corporation’s safety and security adviser in 2001, working with the High Risk Team – which ‘provides advice to programme-makers deploying to hostile or dangerous environments’. Bodyguard: Mr Summers spent 10 years accompanying journalists to war zones and scenes of natural disasters . He spent ten years accompanying journalists to war zones and scenes of natural disaster, working with reporters including John Simpson and Nicholas Witchell. He was with Simpson, in Iraq in 2003, when their vehicle was blown up and their translator killed. It was also his brief to look after celebrities – including, on occasion, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Gary Lineker and Matthew Pinsent. Summers, who also carried out undercover operations for the BBC, left the Corporation last July, after accepting redundancy, and now works as Sky’s Broadcast Security Operations Manager. It was on January 7, 2005, 12 days after the tsunami, when he woke at dawn to find the body of the baby boy, aged between one and two, with matted black hair and closed eyes, lying on the doorstep. ‘There had to be a reason for this,’ he writes in his book. ‘This wasn’t random or down to chance – someone had specifically left this  baby at what they knew to be the BBC house.’ Yet instead of informing anybody in the house, or contacting the local authorities, Summers took matters into his own hands. ‘I picked it up with my bare hands and looked around,’ he added. Aftermath: The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami claimed more 230,000 lives. In these pictures a Thai woman searches for her relative amidst piles of wrapped bodies (left) and a Swedish national and a Thai mourner release traditional offering to the dead (right) ‘Nobody was watching. I walked over to the rubbish, which night after night would pile high in the streets waiting for the authorities to burn the next day by the side of the roads to stave off the threat of rats. Removing some cardboard from the tip, I covered the baby with it. ‘I heard a voice say, “What’s that Craig?” It was Bob, the Australian paramedic who was staying next door to us. I walked towards him. He didn’t need me to answer. “What are you going to do?” he asked. ‘My response was instant and came from the mouth of a soldier in the zone and on autopilot. My sole priority was to protect the BBC crew from infection. ‘ “I’m going to burn it,” I answered. “That’s the best thing to do.” ’ Bob went to get some petrol from a jerrycan as Summers laid the baby on a box in the centre of the rubbish. The BBC bodyguard then soaked the body in petrol and set fire to it. When the flames burned down ten minutes later, the two men bagged up the smouldering rubbish. Two women comforting each other in Thailand's southern Phang Nga on the first anniversary of the tsunami . ‘I didn’t look to see the remains of the baby,’ Summers writes, ‘both our heads were looking down while shovelling. ‘Nothing was said. We just got on with it. We may have left a skull on the floor – I can’t recall. I just wanted it done.’ The incident was witnessed by BBC producer Peter Leng, who was standing in the doorway of the house used by the Corporation’s staff. ‘I had no choice but to come clean,’ Summers continued. ‘I told him we had to keep this to ourselves – I didn’t want anyone else to find out. “I wondered what all the flies were,” he replied. “How do you feel about it?” ‘ “It’s a sad situation but I am surprised someone has dumped it on our doorstep,” I answered bluntly. Only years later did Peter confess that he had told a couple of people – he also said he was grateful and couldn’t have done the same thing.’ Summers remains convinced that he did the right thing that day. Justifying his behaviour, he writes: ‘I was working and this was the job I had to do. If they were still alive, I couldn’t give the parents that closure because there were no clues on the baby. I didn’t know how it got here but I felt sure it was orphaned and deliberately dumped. I couldn’t change its fate. I did what I had to do. There were no alternatives but to cremate the baby. Two elephants clear the debris of houses damaged by the tsunami disaster to make a path for vehicles in Indonesia's tsunami-hit city of Banda Aceh on January 3, 2005 . ‘It was the most humane thing to do before it became riddled with maggots and was left to rot in the street. I couldn’t put a sign up outside the house saying: “One ex-baby here – please knock.’’ ‘If the parents hadn’t died, why would it be dumped?’ Last night Summers told The Mail on Sunday: ‘At the time we felt it was the easiest and most humane thing to do. There were a quarter of a million dead people there and the majority were being dumped in open pits. ‘The baby was completely unidentifiable – it was infested with maggots and there were no features on it at all.’ A BBC spokeswoman said last night: ‘It’s his account, which he has put into context. ‘From our point of view, we don’t have anything to say. We don’t discuss private conversations but managers sometimes talk to staff, or former staff, who have written books about the BBC – particularly if there are legal or safety issues.’ Last night Peter Leng did not wish to comment and Ben Brown did not respond to calls.","Journalist Ben Brown's security chief said corpse left on BBC HQ doorstep posed same danger as a 'blocked toilet'

Hardliner: Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union Unite, has demanded the sacking of three Blairite members of the shadow cabinet . Union boss Len McCluskey demanded the sacking of three Blairite members of the shadow cabinet yesterday as Labour’s biggest paymaster sought to impose his far left policies. The boss of Unite threatened Labour with the loss of millions of pounds of donations unless Mr Miliband purges moderates and lurches to the left. Mr McCluskey also boasted that he has stitched up the selection of candidates within the Labour Party - a process that has enraged more moderate Labour figures. ‘Because we’re having some success, suddenly these people are crying foul,’ he said. ‘Well I’m delighted to read it. I’m delighted when Tony Blair and everyone else intervenes because it demonstrates that we are having an impact and an influence and we’ll continue to do so.’ In a dramatic challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority Mr McCluskey -- who is calling for a general strike -- made clear that he intends to dictate Labour policy. And he called for shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne, Labour’s defence spokesman Jim Muprhy and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander to be axed. In an interview with the New Statesman magazine, he said the Labour leader, who was elected with union votes, would be ‘cast into the dustbin of history’ unless he does as Mr McCluskey wants. The hardliner accused Mr Miliband of being ‘seduced’ by Blairites in the shadow cabinet and issued a veiled threat that Unite’s money might dry up if he doesn’t get his way. Mr McCluskey said the unions ‘would have to sit down and consider their situation’ if Labour fails to emerge as ‘the authentic voice of ordinary working people’. Unite has donated £8,425,166 to the . Labour Party since Mr Miliband became leader in September 2010. The . union remains Labour’s single biggest donor, giving 32 per cent of . donations in the last quarter. The firebrand union boss has called for the sackings of (L-R) shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander MP, shadow Work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne and shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy . Mr McCluskey said: ‘Ed Miliband must . spend most of his waking hours grappling with what lies before him. If . he is brave enough to go for something radical, he’ll be the next prime . minister. ‘If he gets seduced by the Jim . Murphys and the Douglas Alexanders, then the truth is that he’ll be . defeated and he’ll be cast into the dustbin of history. ‘Liam . Byrne certainly doesn’t reflect the views of my members and of our . union’s policy, I think some of the terminology that he uses is . regrettable and I think it will damage Labour. Ed’s got to figure out . what his team will be.’ McCluskey accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of being 'seduced' by Blairites in the shadow cabinet . Mr McCluskey warned that Labour would lose the next election if it adopted an “austerity-lite” programme and supported cuts in public spending after 2015. ‘My personal fear, and that of my union, is that if he goes to the electorate with an austerity-lite programme than he will get defeated,’ he said. ‘If he [Miliband] is daft enough to get sucked into the old Blairite “neoliberalism wasn’t too bad and we just need to tinker with it a little bit”...then not only will he fail but I fear for the future of the Labour Party.’ Mr McCluskey’s intervention is a major headache for Mr Miliband, who has struggled to shake off the appearance of being in hock to the unions who got him elected against the wishes of Labour MPs and Labour Party members. Last night a spokesman for Mr Miliband risked a rift with the union boss, denouncing his words as an attempt to drag the party back to the 1980s. ‘Len McCluskey does not speak for the Labour Party,’ the spokesman said. ‘This attempt to divide the Labour Party is reprehensible. It is the kind of politics that lost Labour many elections in the 1980s. ‘It won’t work. It is wrong. It is disloyal to the party he claims to represent.” Mr Murphy also hit back. ‘It’s disappointing in advance of important local elections that Len McCluskey turns his fire on Labour,’ the shadow defence secretary said. But Tory Chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband was powerless to resist union pressure. He said: ‘Len McCluskey’s the man who’s really in charge of the Labour party - and he knows it. ‘Dictating everything from Labour policy, to Shadow Cabinet posts and Candidate selection - the unions’ vice-like grip on weak Ed Miliband grows ever stronger.’","Hardliner Len McCluskey is the boss of Unite trade union .

The leader of the young wing of the UK Independence Party has been fired after saying he backed gay marriage. Olly Neville claims he was asked to stand down after being told his remarks were 'quite simply completely at odds' with the official party policy and put gains in opinion polls at risk. UKIP insists Mr Neville was forced out after defying party policy on a range of subjects, including legalising drugs. Former youth leader Olly Neville claims UKIP is on the 'wrong side of history' in opposing gay marriage . Mr Nevile was appointed as interim chairman of Young Independence (YI) at the end of last year but on January 2 backed gay marriage in an interview with BBC Radio4’s World at One. UKIP opposes same-sex marriage, warning it would ‘risk the grave harm of undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves who they will and will not marry’. But after being ousted, Mr Nevile said: ‘On gay marriage the party is on the wrong side of public opinion and the wrong side of history. ‘It could be another burka ban issue for them, where they will look back ashamedly and wonder why we had that as a policy,’ he told The Independent. UKIP Leader has opposed gay marriage plans fearing churches would be threatened will be forced by European courts to hold same-sex weddings . In an email UKIP chairman Stephen Crowther told Mr Neville yesterday: ‘The NEC [National Executive Committee] has resolved that you should not continue to act as interim chairman of YI, owing to the problems regarding party policy and public statements about which we have corresponded over the past week.’ Mr Crowther said the BBC Radio 4 interview was ‘politically inept’. The email said: ‘…your stated position on Gay Marriage is quite simply completely at odds with the Party's policy. 'Our policy on Gay Marriage is extremely important to us at this time. ‘We have said specifically and repeatedly that we are opposed to the government's proposals on this, and that the Prime Minister has got it spectacularly wrong. ‘For you to say precisely the opposite, on national radio, as the representative of YI, is absolutely unacceptable, and risks seriously setting back the party's current growth.’ However, today Mr Crowther insisted Mr Neville was ‘asked to stand down’ because he ‘did not fully appreciate the responsibilities attached to an official Party role’. ‘In relation to the Party's policies on areas including gay marriage, the European elections, the legalisation of drugs and prostitution among others, Mr Neville has been publicly at odds with the Party over the past few weeks,’ Mr Crowther added.","Olly Neville told to stand down as chairman of Young Independence after a BBC radio interview backing same sex weddings .

Jodi Arias answered question after question from the jury on Wednesday as they contemplate her fate in the death penalty case over the killing of her on-off boyfriend. In the state of Arizona, jurors are allowed to ask questions of witnesses during a criminal trial. The panel in Arias' trial had about 100 questions after her 15 days on the witness stand. Judge Sherry Stephens read them one-by-one aloud to Arias, who responded with calm, concise answers in the Phoenix courtroom. Scroll down for video . Filling in the gaps: Jurors at Jodi Arias murder trial had around 100 questions for the suspect as she took the stand in the Phoenix courtroom today . One juror focused on why she didn't call police after she claimed Travis Alexander had repeatedly physically abused her in the months leading up to this death. The questions provided a glimpse into the panel's thoughts after hearing her testify about practically every detail of her life, from a self-described, abusive childhood in California to her stormy romance with Alexander and her conversion to the Mormon faith. Jurors asked her about past relationships with other men and how it could have been so easy for her to get a gun from the victim's closet as they fought on the day of the killing and he chased her in a fury. Jurors also wanted to know why she tried to clean the bloody scene at Alexander's home and a number of questions focused on her memory lapses on June 4, 2008. Arias said: ‘I don’t have an adequate explanation for my state of mind.' She later added: 'I can’t really explain why my mind did what it did maybe because it’s too horrible. I really don’t know the answer why I blacked out and have memory gaps on that day.’ She explained another question, which asked how she remembered every sexual encounter but did not remember stabbing Travis and dragging his body into the shower, by saying: 'I don’t know how the mind works but I know . June 4 was the most traumatic experience of my life. 'I don’t have other . blackouts, I have a very good memory. The only way I can explain it is . like a computer screen that freezes... you hit the keys but nothing . happens. One juror posed the question as to whether Jodi had ever sought treatment for her 'mental condition'. The defendant looked confused before responding: ' I'm not sure what mental condition that refers to.' Explanations: Arias, 32, gave detailed responses to questions from the jury with many queries focusing on why she did not remember much of June 4, 2008, the day that Travis Alexander was killed . Several queries were related to her . Mormon faith. 'Why were the laws of attraction so . important to follow and the law of chastity was not?’ Arias said: 'I believed I was following the law of chastity for a long time - I realize now I was not... There was a lot of temptation and weakness when it came to hanging out with Travis.’ There were more general questions about Arias' personality in other relationships as she answered for the entire day in court. ‘Do you feel the guys in your life cheated because you were controlling?' one juror wanted to know. Arias said: ‘I feel it was the . opposite. I feel they cheated because I was too tolerant, naive and . implicitly trusting. I gave them freedom and took advantage.’ Jurors had dozens of questions for the murder suspect over the details of the day that Alexander was killed. Arias said she grabbed the gun from . Alexander's closet as he came after her, but she didn't know for certain . if he was right behind her. 'I just had the sense that he was chasing me,' she said. After . killing Alexander, Arias took photos of his bloody body and then put . the camera in his washing machine. The jury asked her why she did that. 'I don't know why I would have done that,' she said. One juror wanted to know why it had taken Arias two years to admit to killing 28-year-old Alexander at his Mesa home. She responded: 'I was deeply ashamed, I was horrified with myself. A lot of people believed in my stupid story, I felt fraudulent. 'It started off as a secret that I wanted to take to my grave with me... but it became a really yucky feeling inside.' Arias faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. She says . the killing was self-defense, and hopes that the jury spares her the . death penalty by convicting her of a lesser murder count. Stephens . and attorneys worked on Wednesday morning to whittle down the list of . questions for Arias as objections were raised in private. Many other states, including California, allow jury questions at the judge's discretion, but not all agree it's a good idea. 'It . becomes too difficult, too tempting for a juror to lose their role as . an impartial fact-finder and slip into the role of an advocate, and I . think that's contrary to what the whole justice system is based upon,' said Los Angeles-area defense attorney Mark Geragos. 'In effect, you've deputized the jurors as investigators,' Geragos added. Others, however, say the practice is a . useful tool aimed at getting to the truth of a case, and provides . attorneys on both sides a window in the deliberation room while the . trial is still ongoing, giving lawyers time to change their strategies. Negotiations: Judge Sherry Stephens and attorneys Juan Martinez, left, Jennifer Willmott and Kirk Nurmi, right, go over questions submitted by jurors at the murder trial of Jodi Arias on Wednesday . Phoenix criminal defense attorney Julio Laboy said the questions of a witness, during a case where he was representing a client charged with murder, once led to prosecutors offering a deal to plead to a lesser count. 'In the end, what this is all really about is the search for truth, and any mechanism that allows jurors to get closer to the truth without prejudicing one side or the other, I think, is a good tool,' Laboy said. 'And it really is a window into the juror's mindset,' he added. 'It can help attorneys direct which way you need to go, what path you should take.' Arias initially told authorities she had nothing to do with Alexander's death then blamed it on masked intruders before settling on self-defense. Her repeated lies to authorities, friends and family in the days after his death, and her methodical efforts to create an alibi and avoid suspicion have been center stage throughout the trial as she explained how she remembers little from the day of the killing. Alexander had been shot in the head, stabbed 27 times and had his throat slit. Doomed: Jodi Arias, 32, is on trial for the murder of on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander whom prosecutors say she killed in a jealous rage while she claims self-defense . None of Arias' allegations have been corroborated by witnesses or evidence during the trial, and she has admitted to lying repeatedly prior to and after her arrest, but Arias insists she is telling the truth now. She has acknowledged that she dumped the gun in the desert, got rid of her bloody clothes, and even left the victim a voicemail on his cell phone within hours of killing him and dragging his body into the shower. Arias' grandparents had reported a .25 caliber handgun stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot Alexander - but Arias says she never knew her grandfather had the weapon. Authorities believe she brought it with her.","In Arizona, jurors are allowed to ask questions of witnesses during trial .

The family of a schoolgirl mauled to death by a pack of dogs yesterday told of their disgust that the owner is likely to escape prosecution. Jade Lomas-Anderson’s uncle said it made him ‘sick’ that because the law on dog attacks does not cover private property, Bev Concannon will probably not face court. ‘Can everyone spread the word we want justice over these dogs and the owners so this cannot happen again,’ ‘Tucker’ Lomas, 29, wrote on Facebook. Jade, who celebrated her 14th birthday just over a fortnight ago, is the sixth child killed by dogs in homes since 2007. Anger: 'Tucker' Lomas said it made him 'sick' that current dog laws mean that Bev Concannon, left, will probably escape criminal charges over the death of his niece Jade Lomas-Anderson, right . Ministers have unveiled plans to extend the Dangerous Dogs Act to cover attacks on private property even if they do not involve banned breeds, but have yet to give a timetable for changing the law. Mr Lomas added: ‘This news is making me sick, saying the owners of these dogs might not be prosecuted because it was a private property. Disgusts me. We want justice for Jade.’ Jade’s mother Shirley Lomas-Anderson, 36, also took to Facebook to pay tribute to her ‘golden ray of sunshine’. She wrote: ‘Our beautiful princess – you’re a daughter who’s so cherished and perfect who means more than words can say.’ Police are investigating a posting by a ‘troll’ apparently mocking Jade’s death. In hiding: Bev Concannon's home has been boarded up and she has gone into hiding following Jade's death . The message by ‘Jake Williams’ said: ‘I’m upset she didn’t get raped/murdered; judging by her pics she deserves it.’ As a post-mortem examination confirmed that Jade died of multiple injuries, mother-of-five Miss Concannon, 44, was in hiding. Friends feared she was facing a ‘lynch mob’. Jade, a keen dancer and fan of One Direction, was staying with Miss Concannon’s 16-year-old daughter Kimberley at their home in Atherton, near Wigan, when she was savaged on Tuesday afternoon. Friends said she had warmed a meat pie. Warning: A 'beware of the dog' sign can been seen on a gate outside the house where Jade died . Tributes: Friends and family of Jade left flowers outside the house where the teenager died . The dogs, understood to be two bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers, were shot dead by police. Miss Concannon has not been seen on the Hag Fold estate since the tragedy and her home has been boarded up. A sign on the gate reads: ‘Beware of the dog – enter at your own risk.’ Poignant: Jade is pictured smiling with her mother Shirley . Neighbours said the dogs used to terrify passing children by jumping up at the fence, snarling and barking, but police said no residents had complained to them or other agencies. Miss Concannon, who was out shopping at the time of the attack, is said to be ‘distraught’ and co-operating with police. One friend, Jayne ‘Pandora’ Acton, wrote on Facebook that Miss Concannon was ‘petrified because of muppets going for her to harm her’. She went on: ‘You are all talking about the dogs being dangerous and I have just read there are lynch mobs looking for her. ‘They are just as bad as the dogs, now leave it to the police. ‘We know it’s not right what has happened to Jade, and it could have been one of her own children, don’t forget.’ Danielle Cain wrote: ‘Bev took this dog in after it had a bad start with a bad family. She took care of her dogs. ‘It’s an absolutely terrible thing what’s happened to Jade but if she was a burglar or something we would all be saying good on the dog!’ Alan Leake, 46, the father of two of Miss Concannon’s children, Rebecca, 24, and Anthony, 20, claimed she was no longer on speaking terms with them or her parents. Police are continuing to investigate Jade’s death and have insisted that a prosecution has not been ruled out. Superintendent Mark Kenny of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘I want to make it clear that we have made absolutely no decision on whether any prosecutions will be brought.’ Remembering: A candlelight vigil was held for 14-year-old Jade Anderson at Fred Longworth High School in Greater Manchester .

Return to the 70s: James Caan said he had became negative about the state of the film industry . The Godfather actor James Caan has urged the film industry to ditch movie franchises and return to classic seventies dramas. Caan, 73, who has returned to the 1970s for his role in Guillaume Canet’s latest movie Blood Ties, said the franchise films which have flooded Hollywood in recent years have left him feeling ‘negative’ about the state of the industry. He said: ‘I’ve become very negative about the films of today, and that’s why I leapt at the chance to do a film of the `70s with talent like this. ‘I was very fortunate in the `70s to work with the best actors, the best directors, the best cinematographers. ‘And [the films] had a beginning, a middle and an end, which was something very odd.’ But . he was dismissive of Hollywood’s more modern offerings adding: ‘it . seems like most of the films they’re doing, in Hollywood anyway, are . these franchise films.’ Caan . is best known for his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, for . which he was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1973. In his latest role he plays another patriarch of a divided family in Canet’s Brooklyn-set drama. His younger son, played by Billy Crudup, is a cop while his elder son, played by Clive Owen, is an ex-con trying half-heartedly to go straight. The film also features the actresses Marion Cotillard, Mila Kunis and Zoe Saldana. Clive Owen, Marion Cotillard and James Caan arrive for the screening of Blood Ties in Cannes . Actor James Caan is probably best known for his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather for which he won an Oscar and a Golden Globe . James Caan, the son of a butcher, was born in New York and played football for Michigan State University while studying economics. However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions. Classic: James Caan, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and John Cazale in The Godfather . He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 and the western El Dorado alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino 'Sonny' Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather in 1972. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in Freebie and the Bean, a performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler alongside Lauren Hutton and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady in 1975.","Caan, 73, is best known for his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather .

Sir Mark Thatcher yesterday left the his mother's home in Belgravia, telling reporters the Iron Lady would have been moved by her funeral . Margaret Thatcher could not have had a ‘finer commemoration’ of her life than this week’s extraordinary ceremonial funeral, her son Sir Mark has said. He expressed heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in Wednesday’s service, which he called a ‘splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell’ for Britain’s greatest peacetime prime minister. Writing on behalf of himself and sister Carol, Sir Mark gave his first detailed remarks since the funeral in a letter to Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, seen by the Daily Mail. ‘I wanted to write to thank you and, through you, all those many people who were involved in the planning, organisation and conduct of my Mother’s funeral,’ he wrote. ‘This was an immense and complex task and yet it was accomplished with the utmost skill, sensitivity and attention to every possible detail. ‘The result was a splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell that will, I am sure, live long in the memory of all those present. ‘Carol and I could not have hoped for a finer commemoration of my Mother’s life; and we will always be hugely grateful to you and to all the departments, organisations and indeed individuals represented on the True Blue committee who made it possible.’ Mr Maude chaired the Whitehall committee, codenamed True Blue, which put into place detailed plans for the funeral at St Paul’s Cathedral. They were drawn up under the last Labour government and approved by the administrations of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Officials from the Cabinet Office, Foreign Office, Home Office, Culture Department and the Government whips’ office were all involved in coordinating the event. ‘It was a massive occasion for the Cabinet Office to organise on a tight timetable,’ said a source.

Picture left to right: Carol Thatcher, Marco Grass, Sarah Thatcher, Mark Thatcher, Michael Thatcher and Amanda Thatcher . Baroness Thatcher's grandchildren Amanda and Michael led the coffin into St Paul's Cathedral . Mr Maude has said that the bill for the funeral, criticised by some Labour MPs, will be ‘much, much less’ than a reported figure of £10 million, but no official estimate has yet been released. Whitehall sources said there have been no detailed discussions about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers – Mr Blair, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown. At only 70, John Major is now the oldest living former prime minister – the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since World War Two. But one source added: ‘Francis Maude has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for Tony Blair, who like Margaret Thatcher did win three general elections. ‘Whether you like him or not, that is quite a big deal. Given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this. Margaret Thatcher left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want.’ Thanks: A copy of the letter Sir Mark sent to Francis Maude . The Thatcher family is now expected to grieve in private and wait several months before her ashes are interred alongside those of her beloved husband, Sir Denis, at the Royal Hospital in Chelsea. A range of proposals to commemorate her life and leadership of Britain is being considered, from a Thatcher library to a statue in Parliament Square and the renaming of the capital of the Falklands, Stanley, to Port Margaret. Sir Mark had already said yesterday . that his mother would have been ‘profoundly moved and gratified’ by her . spectacular ceremonial funeral. Speaking . outside Lady Thatcher's home in Belgravia, Sir Mark said: ‘My mother . would have been profoundly moved and gratified by the send-off she was . given.’ It is thought the . ashes will be interred in the autumn. A family friend told the Daily . Telegraph: ‘They are very conscious that there will be a lot of interest . surrounding the interment of the ashes. ‘They . thought it would be better to do it at some point in the future. The . family have heard some of the ideas but they need to think about it.’ Lady . Thatcher’s granddaughter Amanda, 19, who gave a moving reading during . the service, has returned to America to prepare for exams next week at . the University of Richmond, Virginia. She has flown back to the US with brother Michael and mother Diane Beckett, Sir Mark's first wife. Downing Street is expected to publish details of the costs of the funeral as early as next week. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘We will publish the costs in due course. I think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high-profile and significant events such as yesterday’s funeral. ‘That is what is being done, and we will publish the costs.’ Amanda Thatcher, who delivered a reading during the funeral service in St Paul's Cathedral, has flown home to America . Asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday’s event, the spokesman said: ‘It will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the use of taxpayers’ money for Lady Thatcher’s funeral, dismissing the objections of some Labour MPs by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of Mr Blair and Mr Brown. ‘There’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and, of course, former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before,’ he told LBC 97.3. ‘These plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air, these were worked on over a long period of time, were pretty well established in detail by the previous government, not this coalition Government, and of course with the full consent, co-operation and support of the family. ‘Of course, I can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against Margaret Thatcher, everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis.’","More than 2,300 guests attended the spectacular ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral .

Children's reading habits decline at an ‘alarming’ rate when they reach secondary school, a worrying study has revealed. The difficulty of books pupils choose and the amount they read show a steady increase until they are 10. But interest plateaus at this point and then plummets, until by 16 many are picking the same books as eight-year-olds and reading less than seven-year-olds. Developing readers: A child's reading continues to progress throughout their early childhood until they reach the age of 10 . Tests also suggest children’s ability to understand what they have read tails off as they progress through school. The What Kids Are Reading report accused ‘teachers and librarians [of] not successfully encouraging pupils to read harder books’. It added: ‘After Year 6 the book difficulty level flatlines to below the actual age of the pupils, which is alarming. ‘Furthermore, it does so with a step change downwards, rather than a continuation of the gentle decline which is seen in the upper years of the primary school. But teenagers interest in reading plummets until the age of 16 when they are picking the same books as children aged eight . ‘It appears that there is something seriously amiss with the way secondary schools encourage young people to read.’ Pre-A’Level children’s reading peaks at around Year 6, when they read more than 240,000 words in books that are difficulty level four in a system that gives an 11.8 rating for the most difficult books. After this, standards level off. By the end of their GCSE exam year the amount they read each year has sunk around 80 per cent to 53,376 words - 10,000 words fewer than Year 3 pupils get through. They also opt for books with a difficulty level of 3.3, the same as Year 4 pupils. Favourite books among Year 11 and Year 4 pupils include the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, by Jeff Kinney, and Roald Dahl’s The Twits. The report looked at the reading habits of 300,000 British schoolchildren at 1,605 schools between August 2011 and July 2012. It was compiled by Professor Keith Topping, professor or education and social research at Dundee University, on behalf of Renaissance Learning, a U.S. education software company. Books’ difficulty levels were calculated using a formula based on average sentence length, average word length, word difficulty and total number of words. Just one non-fiction book appeared among the list of ‘favourite books’ among all school years - a biography of Wayne Rooney. From Years 7 to 9 the top five non-fiction books were all about sports stars. The report added: ‘Are teachers and librarians in both primary schools and secondary schools giving children enough encouragement to read non-fiction books?’ Sixth formers showed a marked improvement in the amount of books they read and their difficulty - although researchers put this down to the calibre of pupils who stay on at school to do A-levels, rather than a general change in attitude. Basic knowledge: Thousands of teenagers gained a GCSE in English Literature without ever having studied a book written before the 20th Century . Schools Minister Nick Gibb last month said parts of England were plagued by Dickensian levels of illiteracy, with one in six unable to read at 11. He added teachers too often settled for a ‘good enough’ standard for pupils - thousands of whom gain a GCSE in English literature without studying any books written before the 20th century. Of the 300,000 children who took the exam last year, more than nine in ten answers on novels were on just three works - To Kill A Mockingbird, Of Mice and Men and Lord of the Flies. Just 1,236 read Pride and Prejudice and 187 studied Wuthering Heights. Other studies have revealed the woeful state of core skills among schoolchildren. A CBI study of 500 employers last year found 42 per cent were dissatisfied with school-leavers basic skills. And according to Pisa, the global measure of pupil performance, one in five British 16-year-olds have failed to gain the basic literacy and numeracy needed for work.","Study finds the difficulty of books pupils choose increases until they are 10 .

Criticized: Professor Steven Landsburg of the University of Rochester is under fire after a blog post that questions whether it's should be illegal to rape someone if they won't mentally or physically remember it . A University of Rochester professor will keep his job despite uproar after he posed hypothetical questions about whether the rape of an unconscious person should be illegal. Professor Steven Landsburg's provocative blog post followed the conviction last month of two high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio, on charges they raped a drunken 16-year-old girl. 'As long as I'm safely unconscious and therefore shielded from the costs of an assault, why shouldn't the rest of the world (or more specifically my attackers) be allowed to reap the benefits?' Landsburg wrote in a blog entitled 'Censorship, Environmentalism and Steubenville.' The question was posed as part of a series of questions asking whether psychic harm should influence public policy. Although . published last month, the blog has gained recent widespread attention . since appearing on the website Gawker late last week. By . Thursday, an online student petition seeking Landsburg's censure had . more than 500 signatures and the women's rights group Women Organized to . Resist and Defend had called for Landsburg's firing. A protest is . planned for Monday outside Landsburg's class. 'The illegality of rape is not a debatable issue, that's the bottom line,' said graduate student Daniel Nelson, who posted the student petition on change.org. In a lengthy follow-up blog post on Wednesday, Landsburg, an economics professor, said the original post 'was laden with unrealistic hypotheticals' and that he regretted some things about it. 'These things are dashed off pretty quickly, not pored over for months the way a journal article might be,' he wrote. 'They're meant as fodder for thought, and sometimes they work better than other times. Critical thinking: Landsburg, seen speaking at Warwick Economics Summit in 2012, posed the question as part of a series of questions asking whether psychic harm should influence public policy . 'It was a post about where to draw lines between purely psychic harm that should receive policy weight and purely psychic harm that shouldn't,' he said. Landsburg said by email Thursday that the follow-up post said everything he had to say on the topic. The original post referred to the Steubenville case in parentheses: . 'Let's suppose that you, or I, or someone we love, or someone we care about from afar,' he wrote, 'is raped while unconscious in a way that causes no direct physical harm - no injury, no pregnancy, no disease transmission. (Note: The Steubenville rape victim, according to all the accounts I've read, was not even aware that she'd been sexually assaulted until she learned about it from the Internet some days later.) 'Despite the lack of physical damage, we are shocked, appalled and horrified at the thought of being treated in this way, and suffer deep trauma as a result,' he wrote. 'Ought the law discourage such acts of rape? Should they be illegal?' He compared the situation to a neighbor turning on a porch light and causing 'trillions of photons (to) penetrate my body.' 'They cause me no physical harm and therefore the law does nothing to restrain them,' he wrote. 'Even if those trillions of tiny penetrations caused me deep psychic distress, the law would continue to ignore them, and I think there's a case for that.' Outraged: Some students and activists have expressed their outrage after the university's decision not to punish or fire the professor for his hypothetical questions . University of Rochester spokesman Bill Murphy said the university had taken no action against Landsburg, whose comments were made on his personal blog. University President Joel Seligman indirectly referred to the outcry Wednesday while addressing a previously planned conference on confronting sexual assault. 'Academic freedom is a core value of our university and vital to provide assurance that one can hold unpopular or provocative views in safety,' Seligman said, according to a transcript of his remarks. 'This is not always an easy balance, but it is a balance vital to uphold in a university that both values respect for all of our students, faculty, staff and visitors and intellectual freedom.' A year ago, Seligman responded to another of Landsburg's blog posts, this one supporting conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh's criticism of Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke after she testified to congressional Democrats that she wanted her college health plan to cover her birth control. While Limbaugh branded Fluke 'a slut,' Landsburgh wrote that the right word would be closer to 'extortionist.' 'I am outraged that any professor would demean a student in this fashion,' Seligman wrote.","Professor Steven Landsburg of University of Rochester specifically mentioned the Steubenville, Ohio rape case in his blog .

Right-wing politician Marie Krarup went . on to say in a piece she wrote for a Danish newspaper that she was . shocked to be welcomed by a dancing ‘half naked man’. The traditional greeting, known as a powhiri, is given as an honour to visitors to New Zealand, but Miss Krarup has left the Maoris in no doubt that she failed to understand the value they all place upon the ceremony. Offended: Danish MP Marie Krarup has angered New Zealand's Maoris by describing their traditional welcome dance as 'grotesque' (file picture) Miss Krarup recalled that when she arrived at the Devonport Naval Base, the headquarters of the Royal New Zealand Navy located on the North Island, she and the group she was with were greeted by a man shouting and screaming in Maori and poking his tongue out. She felt like an idiot, she said, as she gave a hongi - rubbing her nose with a warrior - and the waiata, a Maori song, performed by naval personnel sounded like a Danish children’s song about a happy ladybird. The song, she said, was accompanied by a ‘kindergarten-teacher-guitar-accompaniment.’ She dubbed the powhiri as an ‘uncivilised’ ritual and a marae, a communal or sacred gathering house, a ‘grotesque’ mark of multicultural worship. Miss Krarup was part of a defence delegation visiting New Zealand last month. ‘When we came to a naval base, we were not received with a handshake or salute by uniformed men as usual,’ she wrote. ‘No we were welcomed with a Maori dance ritual, with a half-naked man in a grass skirt, shouting and screaming in Maori.’ Tradition: The New Zealand rugby team perform a traditional Maori dance prior to matches . The man, she said, performed ‘strange rituals and poked his tongue out.’ Referring to the marae, she said the temple was ‘decorated with God-figures with angry faces and large erect penisis. 'It’s a mystery to me how the poor naval officers could endure both the ceremony and the surroundings.’ Maoris said today that the politician clearly had no understanding about the local culture and should have, at least, had the decency to read about it before arriving in the country. Maori culture expert Dr Ranginui Walker, said her remarks showed complete ignorance. ‘She has a totally monocultural view of the world and doesn’t understand that the welcome she received is the highest honour,’ said Dr Walker. ‘Maori customs had obviously not been explained to her before her visit. ‘Her remarks are very short sighted. ‘Very often politicians are not as well educated as they make out to be,’ he added.","Marie Krarup has offended New Zealand's Maoris .

But with prices in excess of £300 for a full face treatment in a clinic, they cost more than most of us can afford. That could be about to change with the launch of a new £450 laser gun which claims to zap away ageing wrinkles. Wrinkle buster: Lasers are routinely used to tackle skin conditions such as acne as well as unwanted hair . While it might sound like something . you'd see in Star Trek, the laser gun is actually the latest technology . in DIY beauty treatment. The Tria Skin Rejuvenating Laser is the first device to offer clinical-strength laser technology in a device that can be used safely at home. While its price tag of £450 may look steep, it costs the same as just one treatment at a professional clinic, where patients typically undergo 10 sessions of laser blasts to see visible anti-ageing improvements. The hand-held device works by harnessing the same light-based fractional laser technology that is used in professional clinics to fight fine lines and wrinkles, as well as changes in skin texture and discolouration. The laser creates light energy which stimulates production of new collagen, the ingredient that pumps up the skin and irons out wrinkles. Although you won't have to go to a salon to use it, the company does say that it has to be used every day for at least eight weeks to see noticeable results.

'A session in a clinic is more intense and last longer, therefore the recovery time may be longer. 'The effectiveness of Tria lies in the fact that you treat yourself for a few minutes daily, over an eight-week period, so you eventually reach the benefits of an in-clinic laser treatment by small steps. 'It is priced at approximately the same cost of one in-clinic treatment. I would recommend by clients to have at least 10 Tria treatments to see visible anti-ageing results.'

NHS managers responsible for poor care or guilty of covering it up should be banned from working in a hospital ever again, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. The Health Secretary unveiled a new blacklisting system under which failed hospital directors would be effectively ‘struck off’ and prevented from moving to another job in the Health Service. He indicated that the barring regime would prevent Martin Yeates, the chief executive of Mid Staffordshire trust at the time when up to 1,200 died needlessly, from ever running an NHS trust again. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) told MPs that managers who fail patients will be struck off and barred from working in the NHS again and NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson (right) who has come under fire . But, despite conceding that his failings as a manager contributed to the scandal, Mr Hunt yet again rode to the defence of current NHS chief executive David Nicholson. Mr Hunt said Mr Nicholson, who headed up the local strategic health authority for nine months at the height of the scandal, could not be held solely responsible because he was in charge of too many hospitals at the time. And, controversially, he praised the under-fire NHS chief executive for having implemented Labour’s drive to slash waiting times so effectively - despite the fact that the target culture has been blamed for the ‘culture of bullying’ which undermined care at Mid Staffs. The Francis inquiry into poor care at the hospital, which reported last month, recommended that poor managers should be blacklisted and barred from further NHS work. Mr Hunt said yesterday that he would accept this recommendation. Scroll down to watch the Health Secretary's Commons speech . A series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital . He said he wanted to introduce a barring . system to ensure that ‘there is a mechanism in place which prevents . unsuitable board level executives and non-executives from moving to new . senior positions elsewhere in the system’. Ministers are considering whether the . barring system could be extended to managers below board level, in a bid . to end the ‘revolving door’ scandal whereby poor adm . The changes announced by Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt do not go far enough, a leading campaigner for . changes in the NHS said today. Julie . Bailey, who set up the Cure The NHS group after her mother Bella died . at Stafford Hospital in 2007, said the leadership and the ""command and . control type management"" of the organisation had to change. She . told the BBC: 'I really don't feel the changes go far enough... This . was a failing from ward to Whitehall, we lost hundreds of people here. 'I . sat through every day of that public inquiry, all the bodies failed, . all the bodies had to apologise, and I really don't think that's been . addressed in this statement. 'How . many more reviews do we need to tell us the one thing that needs to . change is the culture that needs to change, the very top, the people . that rule the NHS, the leadership, that's what needs to change, and it . works all the way down to the front line. 'We need safe staffing levels and the correct skill mix, that's the start that's needed, then we need to look at the training. 'We need a new leader at the top of the NHS, we need a leader that galvanises and inspires the workforce. 'We've . got staff who don't want to work for the NHS, we've got patients . frightened, older people frightened to go into NHS hospitals. 'This . has got to change, and it's not going to change with this style . leadership, command and control, we need much more emphasis on the . culture and behaviours of the people within the NHS, and that starts at . the top.' inistrators are . given pay-offs to leave but then take on new jobs elsewhere in the NHS. Last week the Mail revealed that up to . 2,200 managers had found another job in the NHS after having made . redundant since the election. Most got to keep their pay-offs - many of whom were six figures. It also emerged that the head of a . health trust which had the highest mortality rate in England received . almost a quarter of a million pounds in severance pay. Tony Halsall was paid the sum despite . leaving his post at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation . Trust in disgrace. A police probe has now been launched into up to 16 . needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers at its . hospitals. Asked whether the former chief . executive of the Mis Staffordshire trust, Martin Yeates, would be barred . under the new regime, the Health Secretary indicated that he would. Mr Yeates was forced to resign after a damning Healthcare Commission study into death rates at his trust. Mr Hunt said: ‘It’s a bit difficult to answer speculatively about an individual. ‘But let me say this. If you’re asking . me: “Should someone who is responsible for the appalling things at Mid . Staffs be prevented from ever running a hospital again?” - Yes.’ However, despite his criticisms of Mr Yeates, the Health Secretary continued to stand by Mr Nicholson. He said: ‘I have an honest difference . of opinion with a number of people about David Nicholson’s level of . personal responsibility for what happened, but I accept that he was a . manager of a system that failed to stop this happening and he shares . some responsibility for that. ‘The key point in there is that he was . in charge of 50 hospitals for a nine-month period when some of the . awful things at Mid-Staffs were happening, and nothing in the system . brought that to the surface; nothing in the system forced the managers - . not just him but all the managers outside the hospital - to do . something about it. ‘What today is about is creating the structure to make it impossible for those kinds of problems to happen without being seen.’ The Health Secretary went on to praise . Mr Nicholson, saying: ‘I have looked at the evidence very carefully, . and I think it is important to say that this is somebody who brought . down waiting times very significantly, which has a very positive impact . on people’s care, and has led the charge against MRSA and C. diff which . is now at its lowest level ever since we started taking records.’ In the Commons, another Conservative MP called on Mr Nicholson to go over his Mid Staffs failings. Bill Cash, MP for Stone, told Mr Hunt that one thing missing from yesterday’s announcement was ‘accountability’. ‘That must include the resignation of . Sir David Nicholson and also apportion responsibility to those former . secretaries of state who were not called to give evidence and who bear a . heavy responsibility for not having done the right thing at the right . time,’ he said.","Failed bosses to be barred from moving to another part of the NHS .

The BBC’s war with ministers over the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal deepened last night as the broadcaster’s chairman, Lord Patten, warned that it is not an ‘agent of government’. The peer told Culture Secretary Maria Miller that the BBC should be left to deal with the matter without interference from ministers, although he conceded that the affair was a ‘tsunami of filth’ and ‘the worst crisis the BBC has ever known’. The row erupted earlier this week when Mrs Miller, whose department is ultimately responsible for the BBC, wrote to Lord Patten expressing concerns about the way it has responded to the Savile revelations. Warning: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten told Culture Secretary Maria Miller that the corporation should be left to deal with the Savile affair without interference from ministers . To the fury of senior Tories, Lord Patten replied by suggesting indignantly that she was questioning the BBC’s independence. But he stepped up the attack last night saying: ‘In view of what some people have said, it’s quite important for people to remember that the BBC is independent, it is answerable to licence fee payers. 'It’s not an agent of the Government. Occasionally people perhaps misunderstand that. ‘We’re a national broadcaster – we’re owned by the licence fee payers.’ His outburst will deepen the concerns of the BBC’s critics that it is determined to resist external scrutiny. Lord Patten was also forced to issue a . humiliating apology to Tory party chairman Grant Shapps over the BBC’s . attempts to gag him. Investigation: Police revealed that they were dealing with around 300 alleged victims of late television presenter Jimmy Savile . The Mail revealed yesterday that Mr Shapps was warned against raising damaging allegations about the Savile affair hours before an appearance on BBC political show Question Time on October 11, as the corporation was fighting to contain the revelations. The email from the BBC’s head of . public affairs, Julia Ockenden, insisted claims that the corporation’s . Newsnight programme had scrapped an investigation into Savile’s . activities because of internal pressure were ‘malicious’. Mr Shapps was told: ‘No pressure was . applied to drop this investigation. None. To suggest otherwise is to . risk impugning the professional reputation and integrity of a number of . journalists.’ The email referred Mr Shapps to a . blog written by Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explaining the decision . not to broadcast claims against Savile. The BBC has since admitted key . elements of Mr Rippon’s defence were inaccurate. Lord Patten was yesterday forced to . concede that the email was ‘misleading’ and too aggressive. He said he . hadwritten to Mr Shapps saying that ‘if I’d been in his position I would . have felt much the same’. ‘The fact that it was misleading – . that’s what was wrong,’ he said. ‘I also think the terms in which it was . expressed were unfortunate.’ The BBC is also facing fresh allegations relating to other stars working for it in the 1970s. A spokesman for the National . Association for People Abused in Childhood said: ‘We have been told of . new allegations of abuse at the BBC. This time by three key personnel on . a flagship BBC programme from the 1970s.’ He added the caller rang the helpline but declined to give further details so was advised to contact the police. 'Baptism of fire': New BBC Director General George Entwistle (left) was forced to deal with 'a great tsunami of filth' within 11 days of taking the job, Lord Patten (right) said . Under pressure: BBC Director General George Entwistle was widely criticised after he gave evidence about the scandal to MPs earlier this week . It comes as the BBC investigates nine . current cases of alleged sexual harassment, at least two of which are . of the most serious grade. None of the claims involve paedophilia. The most serious allegations have been reported to the police, while the others are being handled by the BBC’s HR department. Letter: Culture Secretary Maria Miller, whose department is ultimately responsible for the BBC, wrote to Lord Patten expressing concerns about the way it has responded to the Savile revelations . Lord Patten admitted he would not be . surprised if people lost their jobs or faced disciplinary action over . the scandal once the findings of the inquiries into it were made public. He told ITV News: ‘I would be delighted if there didn’t have to be, but not surprised if there did. ‘We have to find out who made mistakes, where those mistakes were made and what the consequences of those mistakes were. 'It seems difficult to believe there weren’t any mistakes and those have consequences.’ He admitted that he and the BBC had . misled the public because of Mr Rippon’s inaccurate claims about why a . report on Savile’s predatory activities was shelved in 2011, shortly . after the former Top Of The Pops presenter’s death. Lord Patten added: ‘The BBC hasn’t . done as well as we should have done, to put it mildly, and that is an . issue we will have to address in the aftermath of this.’ Mark Williams-Thomas, the former . detective who fronted a bombshell ITV documentary on Savile, said the . ‘true figure’ of the DJ’s victims could be 500. He said: ‘What we do know is that it’s going to be in excess of 300. We are talking about four decades of abuse. 'We will see a criminal investigation in respect of other significant individuals, and not just in the media. 'There are people in significant . standings in the community who will hopefully be sleeping very . uncomfortably, and who will in due course be subject to criminal . investigation.’ Lair: Police investigating the alleged sexual abuse have searched a cottage in Allt na Reigh, in Glencoe, Scotland, where Savile is said to have entertained fellow celebrities .","Tory peer warns that the BBC is not an 'agent of government'

What are your earliest memories? Actor Sir Ian McKellen remembers waving to his mother from the back of an ambulance as he was taken to hospital with diphtheria — ‘or was she waving to me?’ he wondered. Comedian Josie Lawrence has a clear recollection of dancing with her father, with her toes perched on his feet, and Sir Tom Stoppard remembers being chased around a Christmas tree by a man wearing a Devil costume — just the sort of surreal incident to make a playwright of a small child. Most intriguing of all, these memories all date from around the same age: three years old. As Maureen Lipman discovered in If Memory Serves Me Right, the human brain doesn’t store anything permanent from the baby and toddler years. Even nursery children can’t remember anything before their third birthday. Maureen, 66, made a delightful presenter, full of laughs and dry asides. The documentary was shot through with a vein of tragedy — she lost her husband, scriptwriter Jack Rosenthal, ten years ago, a loss that still brings her close to tears when she talks of it. And her interest in memory was sparked by the pain of watching her father Maurice succumb to dementia. ‘He lost so much more than his memory,’ she said. ‘He lost his essence and I lost the father I knew.’ But it was all far from doleful. Maureen threw herself into research: she underwent an MRI scan, analysing which parts of her cortex — the outer layer of her brain — lit up when she focused on recent memories or old ones. She even examined cross-sections of two real human brains: one was healthy, and looked like compressed tripe, and the other was from a patient with Alzheimer’s, and looked like a Swiss cheese. She experimented with false memories, asking hypnotist Paul McKenna to convince her that her dog had won Crufts (and that George Clooney had presented her with the prize). The climactic segment was a bit of a let-down: Maureen embarked on a pointless challenge to remember the names and birthdays of 25 people she had never met. The rest of the programme had shown that memory is about so much more than parlour tricks. Remembering: Maureen Lipman and her former classmates at Newland School For Girls for documentary If My Memory Serves Me Right . It was disappointing, because otherwise the show had taken an innovative approach to science. Instead of being academic and geeky, Maureen infused the topic with human warmth that gave her discoveries relevance and meaning. I’d like to see more of this approach, putting science in a personal context. The right presenter can transmute a leaden concept into TV gold-dust. Danny Baker was an inspired choice for a trawl through the telly archives on BBC4’s new comedy compilation, Brushing Up On . . . This format shouldn’t have worked: the opening episode was a collection of clips from news magazines and children’s shows about Britain’s tunnels. In fact, it ought to have been deathly dull: there were features on pot-holing, on the sewers network, on the digging of the London Underground and on various abandoned efforts to construct a Channel Tunnel. Sounds unpromising. But if you’ve got half an hour to spare on iPlayer, treat yourself, because the show was snortingly funny from start to finish. Don’t try to eat or drink while you watch — you’ll end up with hiccups. From David Bellamy wriggling through Neolithic tunnels in his underpants, to Adolf Hitler surveying the English Channel through a telescope like a holidaymaker on the Calais promenade, these clips were a joy. Sometimes it was the characters who were beyond parody, like the council worker sent into the sewers to hunt for National Health dentures: apparently it wasn’t uncommon in the Seventies for people to lose their teeth down the toilet after a party, presumably during the course of throwing up. In other clips, the voice-overs raised the laughs, like the plummy Pathe News announcer in awe of the navvies digging the Victoria Line: ‘Men with iron in their muscles and buttocks, sons of Ireland almost all of them.’ Marvellously silly stuff.","A look at Maureen Lipman's documentary If Memory Serves Me Right .

Chilling: This surveillance camera image shows Genelle Conway-Allen, 13, minutes before she disappeared on Thursday . A 13-year-old girl who disappeared from her school bus stop in Northern California has been murdered and her naked body discovered in park not far from her home. Police released a chilling last photo of Genelle Conway-Allen, taken by a surveillance camera just minutes before she vanished on Thursday afternoon after getting off the bus on her way home from Green Valley Middle School, where she is a seventh grader. A homeless man found her dead in the parking lot of a park in Fairfield, California, on Friday - about five miles from the spot where she was last seen. Now, police in the quiet suburb between San Francisco and Sacramento are scrambling to find the person who murdered the troubled girl on her way home from school. 'She had a hard life, and this is how it ends. It's tragic,' her aunt Natalie Paasch, 20, told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'She was always the one looking out for her family, even when her family wasn't looking out for her.' Relatives said Genelle was last seen getting off a bus from her middle school. The surveillance camera captured her walking with her backpack about five miles from the park where she was found dead. Her foster parents reported her missing about 5.45pm on Thursday when she didn't come home from school. Her body was found on Friday, but police did not publicly identify Genelle as the victim until Tuesday afternoon. Police haven't said how she died, but have revealed that there was no obvious sign of trauma. 'She looked like a mannequin. It hurts my soul to think someone could do that to a little girl. I'm haunted by the image of her laying there without a stitch of clothing,' said Eric May, the man who found her body, according to the Chronicle. May, 54, said he was questioned by police but later released. Murdered: Genelle was reported missing by her foster parents on Thursday after she didn't come home from school. She vanished after getting of a school bus about five miles from the park where she was found dead . Investigating: Police have sealed off the scene where the unidentified girl's body left naked . The horrific crime has shocked the community and put neighbors on guard about a potential predator on the loose. 'That someone is capable of doing this to an innocent little girl breaks our hearts,' Victor Estrada, a minister who lives near the park, told the Chronicle. 'It's an act of pure evil. It's shocking for this community, and it's up to us as parents not to let this happen again and to find the person responsible.' The park is a popular hangout for vagrants and the homeless, who spend their days milling around. Many of the men said they had been interviewed by police. But, they said they were also horrified by the crime and were cooperating to report suspicious activity in the area. Relatives say Genelle and her brother moved around for much of their childhoods and were in-and-out of foster care while their mother struggled with personal problems. Genelle's father abandoned the family. Despite her problems, friends say she remained a sweet girl who cared deeply about her friends and family. Classmate John Paul Gibson told CBS Sacramento:'I give her a hug every day. It's hard because I don't know why they would do this to a nice person.'","Genelle Conway-Allen, 13, was last seen after getting off a school bus on Thursday night .

Hang on a Mo: Olympic hero Farah will receive £250,000 to run just half of this year's London Marathon and a further £500,000 to race the full distance in 2014 . Mo Farah has been accused of . undermining the spirit of the London Marathon after signing a lucrative . deal to run just half the race. The double Olympic gold medallist is . being paid £250,000 by sponsor Virgin to run half the course at this . year’s 26-mile race and a further £500,000 for the full race in 2014. Farah says running half the race will help him ‘understand the course’ in preparation for the following year. Fellow athletes expressed bemusement . at the ‘race within a race’ arrangement and the extent to which . organisers are prepared to go to accommodate the 29-year-old runner’s . wishes. Paula Radcliffe, who has won the women’s race in London three times, questioned Farah’s decision yesterday. She said: ‘Honestly I find it a little bit strange – it’s not what I would have done. ‘Either you find a good half marathon somewhere or you take the plunge and attack the distance and race it. ‘Here he’s caught between two stools. For me, you go into the London Marathon when you’re ready to do it and . attack it  hard. But everybody has different reasons.’ Former Olympic triple-jumping champion . Jonathan Edwards called it ‘odd’, while Steve Cram, one of the world’s . top middle-distance runners in the Eighties, said the plan was . ‘difficult to comprehend’. A Virgin London Marathon spokeswoman . denied Farah’s decision was at odds with the race’s ethos, saying he . wasn’t competing but simply taking part. Farah has long been seen as the man to revive British interest in the men’s race, which has long been dominated by Kenyans. The last British man to win in the capital was Eamonn Martin 20 years ago. Farah said: ‘As a young boy growing up in London it has always been my ambition to run the London Marathon. ‘I won the Mini Marathon when I was younger and have watched the race every year for as long as I can remember. ‘I will make my marathon debut in the . 2014 London Marathon but will run the 2013 race to half way as part of . my preparation for 2014. ‘It will allow me to understand the course and the systems that I will need when I run the full distance.’ Hugh Brasher, the London Marathon race . director, said:  ‘We have been following and supporting Mo’s career . since he first won the Mini London Marathon 15 years ago and are full of . anticipation for his marathon debut. Short circuit: Farah will not complete this year's race, which will pass the Cutty Sark in Greenwich, although he will run all of next year's 26-mile route . ‘Hopefully, his experience of the . race, the route and the unique atmosphere of the London Marathon will . stand him in good stead when he takes on the full race next year. ‘We are sure he will gain some valuable insights and come back fully prepared for the challenge.’ Farah, who won Olympic gold over . 10,000 and 5,000 metres in London last year, has always said he would . eventually move up to the full marathon.

The family of an American woman whose husband allegedly killed their three-year-old daughter and then ended his own life last night, have spoken of their heartache. They spoke out amid claims that Martin McCarthy killed his daughter Clarissa and himself after becoming convinced his 25-year-old wife Rebecca McCarthy, née Cejnar, wanted to end their relationship. In the hours before the tragedy, the farmer from West Cork feared his wife was going to take Clarissa away, according to local sources. Last night the little girl’s heart- . broken grandfather Harry Cejnar was struggling to come to terms with . what had happened to his daughter’s family. Tragedy: Martin McCarthy, his wife Rebecca McCarthy (right) and their three-year-old daughter Clarissa McCarthy. It is believed that Mr McCarthy killed his daughter and then himself because he feared his wife would leave him . California-based Mr Cejnar said: ‘I don’t understand it at all. Rebecca and Martin were good parents. 'I hadn’t heard of any problems between them at all. I just don’t understand how this could have happened. Something must have gone wrong. Clarissa was a great kid.’ Detectives now believe Mr McCarthy, a prominent farmer, drowned three-year-old Clarissa, whose fourth birthday would have been in two months, before taking his own life. The little girl’s distraught mother arrived home on Tuesday night to find a note and she alerted police. She is believed to have been present when investigators found the bodies of her husband and daughter. Clarissa’s heartbroken grandfather added: ‘Rebecca couldn’t have brought Clarissa back to the United States because Clarissa didn’t have a passport. The laws in Ireland would mean Martin would have to say that was OK. It just doesn’t make any sense at all.’ The home of Martin McCarthy, 50, and his three-year-old daughter, Clarissa, near where their bodies were found in Audley Cove outside Ballydehob in West Cork . Struggling to hold back tears at his apartment in Artesia, about 15 miles south of Los Angeles, Mr Cejnar said his daughter grew up in southern California, going to school in nearby Whittier. ‘I took Clarissa and Rebecca to Knotts Berry Farm theme park in California just last November. She was just three years old and she was already reading and writing. ‘How could anybody hurt a little girl like that? Nobody in their right mind would do that to their own daughter,’ said Mr Cejnar, who held a photograph of his daughter, grandchild and son-in-law, taken in recent months. Mrs McCarthy met her future husband on a school exchange trip to Ireland when she was 16. ‘She came home and told me that she was going to get married to Martin. She said she was going to wait until she was 18. 'She did just that and went to Ireland when she was 18 and got married. They had an online relationship before that,’ he said. ' It just doesn’t make any sense at all. ‘How could anybody hurt a little girl like that? Nobody in their right mind would do that to their own daughter.' - Clarrisa's grandfather Harry Cejnar . They married in a quiet ceremony in Cork when she was 19. He was 44 at the time. Last night, her devastated sister Jessica Cejnar said the family were ‘shaken up’ by the distressing news. She revealed their mother Linda and aunt are making their way to Ireland to comfort her sister. Ms Cejnar said she learnt the news late on Tuesday night, adding that it was a ‘horrible’ phone call to receive. ‘Our mam and aunt will head over to West Cork now to be with her. I don’t really know what happened, I don’t know the circumstances,’ she told the Mail. ‘I am very close with my sister, and have visited West Cork a few times. I don’t know much about Martin. I know he was older than her. We are all pretty shaken up over this. We don’t know what’s happened.’ A note left on the kitchen table was . the first sign that something was terribly wrong when Rebecca McCarthy . returned to her darkened farmhouse home at 11pm on Tuesday. The distraught mother of  one . immediately raised the alarm and so began a frantic search for her . missing three-year-old daughter Clarissa and husband Martin. The 25-year-old Californian was last . night still coming to terms with the devastating discovery of her . daughter’s body in shallow water off a shingle beach a few hundred metres from their remote West Cork home. The couple doted on Clarissa, shocked neighbours and friends said yesterday. But there was speculation last night . that the husband’s devotion to his farm was such that it may have . frustrated his younger wife, and that he began to fear she would return home to America with their child. The unlikely match of the bachelor . farmer – 25 years her senior – with the fun-loving teenager from America . raised eyebrows among locals in the early stages of the romance. Arriving as a college student in the . home of Mark and Terri O’Mahony in the neighbouring townland of . Cappaghglass,  Ballydehob, young Rebecca  Cejnar caught the eye of the ‘big farmer’ next door. She was sent over from California for . her school holidays by  her parents, Harry Daniel Cejnar and Linda Jean . Bailey, who  had mutual friends with the O’Mahonys in LA. The teenager wanted to learn about Irish culture and traditions and the family treated her as their own. Mrs McCarthy ran a local cake business, Audley Cove Cakes. On the Facebook page for that business, she had posted a picture of Clarissa’s second birthday cake from almost two years ago. Parents at the opening day of the . Ballydehob primary school yesterday noted that the little girl, who . would be four in May, was never given the chance to see inside the classroom. Reverend Stephen McCann yesterday . remembered the  family at his morning service at St Mathias and St . Mathew’s Church of Ireland church. Although neither Rebecca nor her . husband are members of  the Protestant faith, he said  he had known Mrs . McCarthy through her cake-baking skills and community participation. ‘This is a small community and . everyone just gets involved in everything regardless of whether they are . members of one church or another.’ He recalled meeting fellow American . Rebecca on several occasions, including at a speech on baking made to . the local Mothers’ Union women’s group last year. But he said he never met her husband. Rev McCann said his thoughts were with the entire family. ‘We need to pray for the families . now. Everyone in this community knows one another and we will just pray . now for them all,’ he said. Martin McCarthy had been afraid that . his wife Rebecca was going  to take their couple’s three- year-old . daughter to the US, gardaí believe. Hours . before he and Clarissa were found dead, arguments between the couple . had been playing on his mind – and he had convinced himself that he was . going to lose the girl, security sources claimed yesterday. According to friends, he absolutely ‘adored’ his daughter and could not face losing her. Yesterday, . two gardaí kept watch at the top of the country lane leading into the . old farmhouse that the 50-year-old farmer had inherited from his parents . John Christopher and Elizabeth McCarthy. It is believed Mr McCarthy had suffered a heart scare in recent times and had finally taken on some staff to help on the farm. He met Rebecca when she was a teenager, locals said. She used to holiday at a house owned by a friend of his. They . struck up a friendship that later developed into a romance. ‘It took a . lot of people by surprise, perhaps because of the age difference,’ said a . friend. ‘The . wedding was a very small and quiet affair. I don’t know that many . people who went to it. Martin was never one for a great deal of show. ‘He was very understated and was never happier than when he was working on any one of his many fields. ‘He wasn’t known to drink or smoke and certainly none of the local pubs regarded him as even an occasional visitor. Instead, one of his few joys outside work was his regular Tuesday night trip to the Health Centre in Ballydehob. There . he played cards in the waiting area with elderly people who were either . waiting for treatment, or used to just pop in for company. On the night of his death, locals noticed that his Jeep was not parked in its usual place. ‘Martin was a creature of habit and routine,’ said a friend. ‘He had a regular routine and he stuck to it.‘Every Tuesday for as long as I can remember, I’d always see him pulling up at around 8pm. He added: ‘When he didn’t turn up on Tuesday, I thought something might  be wrong.’ Described . as ‘an old-fashioned man tied to the land’, Mr McCarthy only ventured . out to go to Mass or attend Fine Gael fundraisers, where he was  a local . activist and regular church-gate collector. The farmer was also remembered as a kind neighbour who was first to help out when machinery broke or anything needed repairing. One neighbour said: ‘He was a man who could turn his hand to anything but he was an all work, no play kind of guy you know. ‘No woman wants that and I think that it eventually took its toll.’ Another visibly upset acquaintance said last night: ‘I am so sad for  what has happened to that innocent little child. ‘I am so sad for her mother.’","Widow's family speaks out after apparent murder-suicide .

It may have been read by teenagers for more than 70 years, but Archie Comics is proving it is still as current as ever. Their only openly gay character Kevin Keller has his first kiss in a forthcoming issue. The Riverdale teen finds his life turned upside down after locking lips with his boyfriend, Devon, in Pop Tate's diner, drawing the ire of at least one disapproving Riverdale mom. Moving forward: Openly-gay character Kevin Keller, right, kissing his boyfriend Devon. The issue will go on sale on August 7 . The woman 'gets very offended and kind of pitches a bit of a fit,' said Dan Parent, who writes and draws the issue, 'Kevin Keller' No. 10 that is released August 7. 'Kevin is kind of used to that, but Veronica records the whole thing and of course uploads it to the Riverdale equivalent of YouTube and that starts a bit of a debate,' said Parent. Life imitating art: Writer Dan Parent said he wrote the story after efforts to remove a comic magazine showing Keller getting married drew at complaints . For Archie Comics it's a bit of art imitating life. Parent said he wrote the story after efforts to remove a comic magazine showing Keller getting married drew at complaints. One Million Moms, a project of The . American Family Association, asked Toys R Us not to display 'Life With . Archie' No. 16 near its checkout aisles. Toys R Us did not, and the . issue went on to sell out its print run. Parent called the new story a 'playful poke' at the protest. Keller debuted in 'Veronica' No. 202 in September 2010. It resulted in Archie Comics' first-ever second printing. It was quickly followed by a four-issue miniseries and the current monthly title. Publisher . and co-CEO Jon Goldwater said the fact that any kiss is being shown in . the pages of an Archie Comics book is a step in and of itself. 'There . aren't that many on-panel kisses in the pages of Archie, but you often . see the lipstick on Archie's face afterward,' he said. Goldwater said Keller's character has let the company weave in contemporary issues to its imaginary world. 'We certainly pride ourselves on being contemporary, but that's not the reason why we're showing  `The . Kiss.' Just like when Kevin first told Jughead he was gay, it was in . the natural course of conversation,' said Goldwater. 'We are creating . this in the same way. It's just part of the story.'

A puppy needed a three hour operation after swallowing a sewing needle which became lodged in her spinal cord. Eight month old golden Labrador Fudge survived the operation unscathed and without any permanent damage despite the 1.5 inch needle piercing soft tissue and becoming lodged in the joint of her spine and skull. The needle was only discovered after Fudge collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy's agony. Lucky: Paul Manville, with Labrador puppy Fudge who survived swallowing a needle and it becoming lodged in her spine . Painful: An x-ray image shows a 1.5 inch needle lodged in Fudge's spinal cord . Owner Paul Manville, 45, said: 'Fudge had broken through the stair gate and demolished the bedroom - she played with a couple of plastic hairbrushes and had bitten them. 'Then three days later when I took her for a walk she dropped to the floor and screamed in pain. 'I thought she had swallowed something and had something in her stomach so I took her to the vets. 'She had an x-ray of her stomach but it didn't show anything so they decided to open her up and have a look at it anyway. He added: 'But they still didn't find anything and her agony remained a mystery. 'It was really stressful as she was still having fits of pain and we thought we were going to have to put her down.

Agony: A scan picture shows the needle lodged in Fudge's spinal cord. She needed a three-hour operation to have it removed . Paul, who did not have pet insurance and had to fork out £4,500 pounds on vet bills for Fudge, took the dog 90 miles north to the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, to remove the needle. Colin Driver, one of the vets who operated on Fudge, said: 'You don't expect to see a dog with a needle in their spinal cord so we were very shocked, it was quite extraordinary. 'We had to be extremely careful not to move the spinal cord when we removed the needle, as like in humans it is connected to all the nerve endings and could leave permanent damage. Costly: Fudge's owner Paul had to shell out £4,500 on vets fees as he had no pet insurance . 'Afterwards I had expected to see some swelling which might have made Fudge weak or have neurological problems. 'I told the owner not to expect her to walk the next day but she was up walking around with no problems and was back to her normal self. 'We were really pleased.'

Soaring numbers of women living with breast cancer will leave the NHS in crisis, researchers warn today. Nearly 1.7million will be coping with the illness by 2040 - three times as many as today. The increase will be partly caused by our ageing population, with breast cancer far more common in the over-50s. On the rise: Nearly 1.7million women will be coping with breast cancer by 2040 - three times as many as today . But better treatment and diagnosis also mean that more women are now surviving the disease and living with it for many years – presenting new challenges for the NHS when it comes to practical support and after-care. Experts say that unless the health service makes major changes, it will be unable to cope with the surge. They fear it will not have the resources to help growing numbers of women deal with breast cancer treatment, side effects and living with the disease. Campaigners are particularly concerned that the NHS will not be able to handle the rise in elderly breast cancer patients. The numbers of sufferers aged over 65 is expected to quadruple by 2040. Critics say the health service is not doing enough to help women cope with the long-term effects of cancer and treatment, which include heart problems, loss of energy and emotional trauma. Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘The NHS is not going to be able to cope unless it learns new ways to provide treatment and support for women with breast cancer. The really big concern is around older people with cancer. That’s what’s going to challenge the NHS. Risk: The rise will be partly caused by our ageing population, with breast cancer more common in the over-50s . ‘I think it’s a potential crisis, it’s a growing crisis. It’s not a crisis now but it will be unless the NHS learns to provide treatment and support more effectively. ‘The NHS doesn’t provide the support that enables women to cope with the side effects of cancer. 'The really big concern is around older people with cancer. That’s what’s going to challenge the NHS. I think it’s a potential crisis, it’s a growing crisis' Mike Hobday, Macmillan Cancer Support . ‘Radiotherapy for breast cancer will affect the heart. Similarly, if they have had surgery, that will affect their upper body strength. ‘Having any form of cancer is a very emotionally traumatic experience for a woman to go through and the NHS needs to provide the right support.’ In a study published today in the British Journal of Cancer, academics from King’s College London calculate that by 2040  there will be 1.68million women living with breast cancer. This figure includes those receiving treatment for the illness at the time, as  well as anyone diagnosed within the past  ten years. Of these, 1.2million will be aged over 65, marking a four-fold increase on present figures. There is widespread concern that elderly . women are often diagnosed with breast cancer too late and are not always . offered the best treatment. Mammogram scan: A cancer charity said too many older women receive inadequate care because of their age . Many are unwilling to go to their GP if they have symptoms as they don’t want to be seen as a burden. Campaigners say that while doctors are good at diagnosing and treating middle-aged and younger women with breast cancer, they are failing older victims. 'We need to change the way we care for older breast cancer patients now, so that we are prepared for such a dramatic increase in numbers' Ciarán Devane, Macmillan Cancer Support chief executive . They worry there is a lack of awareness amongst the over-65s and they are less likely to spot lumps or seek help from GPs if they find them. Some doctors are reluctant to offer surgery to remove tumours for women in their 70s and 80s as they think they are too frail. Studies have shown that some will simply look at a woman’s date of birth when deciding whether to offer her surgery to remove tumours. Ciarán Devane, chief executive of . Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘We need to change the way we care for . older breast cancer patients now, so that we are prepared for such a . dramatic increase in numbers. ‘Older people must be provided with the right treatment at the right time at the correct level of intensity. ‘We can never assume that because a woman . is older that she will not cope with surgery or that she is less . interested in body image than a younger woman. Waiting room: Many elderly women are unwilling to go to their GP as they don't want to be seen as a burden . ‘It is our duty to ensure that every cancer patient has access to the best possible care. We can no longer tolerate the present situation where too many cancer doctors are making assumptions based on age which often result in older women receiving inadequate care for their breast cancer.’ Dr Rachel Greig, senior policy officer at . Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It is startling to think that we . could have a million older women living with breast cancer within a . generation. It shows that we have a rapidly ageing population, but also . that we are getting much better at treating women with breast cancer. 'It is startling to think that we could have a million older women living with breast cancer within a generation' Dr Rachel Greig, Breakthrough Breast Cancer senior policy officer . ‘However, increasingly we should think less about the age of patients, and more about their individual need. This will ensure the best standards of care for women living with the disease.’ Breast cancer is now the most common type of cancer among women, and one in eight is likely to develop it at some point in her life. There are just over 48,400 new cases a year, but 95 per cent will survive longer than ten years. By comparison, in the early 1970s just over 80 per cent could be expected to live for this long after diagnosis. However, as the prognosis improves, experts say the NHS is not offering enough support to help women deal with the  long-term effects of breast cancer. Treatments such as radiotherapy can leave women more susceptible to heart disease, while chemotherapy can cause long-term symptoms of fatigue. Critics say doctors should also be providing more emotional support to help women cope with the trauma of the disease.","Threefold increase by 2040 will be partly caused by our ageing population .

A three-year-old boy is able to walk for the first time thanks to scientists who made him a bespoke body suit. Brandon Conway was left with limited movement in his left side after suffering a stroke shortly after he was born. He suffers from poor vision and epilepsy and doctors feared he would struggle to walk or even crawl. Brandon Conway, with parents Andy Conway and Melanie Davies, was not expected to be able to walk because he suffered a stroke as a baby . Lycra dynamic splinting is a form of support, made from a strong type of lycra, that benefits people with many neurological conditions including strokes and cerebral palsy. The splints are individually designed to fit all, or part of, the body. They can improve tone, posture and muscle control by supporting the body in a healthy position and by stimulating weak muscles. But he can now lead a normal life thanks to the £500 suit which supports his muscles. His mother Melanie Davies, 24, said: 'When he took his first steps, I was in tears. We were on holiday in the Isle of Portland in the English Channel, and he was tottering around the cottage. 'He would let go of one bit of furniture . and go over to the next bit. It was amazing.' Ms Davies and her partner Andy Conway, from Portsmouth, realised that Brandon was unwell when, as a baby, he stopped using his left side and taking milk properly. He was rushed to hospital where a brain scan showed that he had had a stroke. Since then he has been epileptic, has had poor vision, and has suffered from muscle weakness down the left side of his body. However, his life turned around when staff at The Alexandra pub in Portsmouth offered to help raise money for him to have a specially made Dynamic Lycra Splint. Brandon's suit helps him by keeping his hips and back straight. It also stabilises his body and keeps his posture balanced so he can move more normally. Ms Davies said: 'It's very tight fitting and pulls his muscles in the correct directions.' The NHS now replaces it every time he grows out of it. The stroke left the three-year-old with weakness in his left side, epilepsy and poor vision . Brandon has now been fitted with a Lycra Dynamic Splint which supports his muscles and improves his posture so that he can walk . Ms Davies said: 'He's growing quickly and goes through about four suits a year. 'When . he got the suit we knew he would walk, but we didn't know when it would . happen and how soon. It felt like we were waiting forever.' 'Where the stroke affects one side of his body he's very lopsided and his spine had started to bend a bit. 'The lycra suit straightens up his spine and his hip and stimulates the muscles in his left arm as well. 'We are absolutely thrilled that he's walking and he can't wait to run now.' Dynamic Lycra Splints are a relatively new way to help those who have suffered a stroke. Brandon's mother Melanie Davies, 24, said: 'When he took his first steps, I was in tears. It was amazing' They have to be made to measure to achieve a snug fit and increase pressure on the muscles that need support. Talking about Brandon's condition, Huw Jones, neo-natologist consultant at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, said: 'In my first ten years of working in Portsmouth I have seen three cases of strokes in babies. 'It occurs in one in every 2,500 to 5,000 births, not all are diagnosed early on and some would be clinically sound. 'The key difference with infants is they have a better chance of recovery than adults.'","Brandon Conway, from Portsmouth, had a stroke shortly after he was born .

Just a stone's throw from Disney's Magic Kingdom, with five bedrooms, 13 acres of land and its own swimming pool, this 1920s waterside stucco mansion would be the ideal holiday home for anyone with a family. But the property has gained a degree of notoriety among its Florida neighbours - it once belonged to the family with the world's most infamous surname - the Bin Ladens. Khalil Bin Laden, brother of Al Qaeda mastermind Osama and one of 50 plus siblings of the terror chief, bought the palatial mansion for his wife back in 1980. And it is even thought that Osama himself may have stayed at the property while visiting his brother.

The Mediterranean-style mansion, complete with a red tiled roof, in the quiet town of Oakland, some 20 miles away from Orlando, was bought by Khalil for $1.6million. Sitting on the shores of idyllic Johns Lake, the Bin Laden children are once said to have played in the home's vast grounds. With sweeping tiled floors, beautiful arched doorways and an ostentatious marble bath tub, the Bin Laden's would have enjoyed a peaceful life of luxury. One of the home's most impressive rooms is a giant dining room with a fireplace at one end which resembles something more akin to a European chapel than a family home.

Its location even leads you to wonder if its one time owners had a season ticket to nearby Disneyland. But the family fled the US after the 9/11 attacks fearing reprisals because of their immediate link to the mastermind behind the deadly atrocity. The property, which also boasts stables and four detached garages, was boarded up and fell into disrepair after the family left. Haunting pictures of the dilapidated property, taken when estate agents were struggling to sell it because of it's links to the infamous family, have been posted on Florida's Forgotten Past website. It was once described by Forbes magazine as one of the 'creepiest abandoned mansions' in the US but is now partially occupied by a paralegal and part rented out as a wedding venue.

His views on Europe and immigration are well known, but yesterday Nigel Farage lent his typically vocal support to a more controversial issue. The UK Independence Party leader launched a defence of strip joints, calling them a ‘pretty good’ thing and even boasted that he had visited one club in Strasbourg with a former French presidential candidate. He insisted he was ‘absolutely delighted’ that one UKIP candidate runs a lapdancing club in Northampton, calling him a  ‘free-market entrepreneur’. UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured signing a book of condolence after Lady Thatcher's death, suggested she would now join his party not the Tories . At a Westminster lunch, he also . angered supporters of Baroness Thatcher by claiming that she would have . joined UKIP, and claimed the party can win an anticipated by-election in . Portsmouth South. The Right-wing leader angrily  dismissed David Cameron’s barb that his party attracts ‘fruitcakes and loonies’. But he backed Karim Ayoubi, UKIP . candidate in the Abington & Phippsville ward for Northamptonshire . county council elections. Mr Ayoubi is general manager of Urban Tiger, a . ‘gentlemen’s club’ which bills itself as ‘the best  lapdancing club in . the Midlands – probably in the world’. Its website invites customers to ‘get . to know the dancers a little better at your table, or see a little more . with a private show’. Questioned about Mr Ayoubi’s job, Mr Farage said ‘that sounds all right to me’, and admitted he has been to strip clubs himself. Nigel Farage today revealed he had been dragged to a Strasbourg strip club by a candidate in a French presidential election. He was challenged over reports that he was a regular in lapdancing venues. He told journalists: ‘To my knowledge I have been to one during my time in Strasbourg, which I was taken to, unwittingly, by somebody who was then a candidate for the French presidency. 'I had no idea where we were going and when we walked through the door, I thought bloody hell this is pretty good here, I like this.' He refused to name the French politician, but insisted it was not Nicholas Sarkozy. He admitted he 'might well have been to one or two of these establishments' while working in the City in the 1908s. The audience heard how a taxi driver offered Mr Farage a trip to a brothel on one visit to Romania. Mr Farage’s PR man said: ‘No now Nigel, there are journalists here.’ He said: ‘I have been to one during . my time in Strasbourg, which I was taken to, unwittingly, by somebody . who was then a candidate for the French presidency. ‘When we walked through the door, I thought: “Bloody hell this is pretty good here, I like this”.’ Speaking at the Parliamentary lunch, Mr Farage sought to claim Baroness Thatcher as a UKIP supporter, arguing that if a young Margaret Roberts were setting out on the journey into British politics today she would reject Mr Cameron. He said: ‘What is absolutely clear is that Margaret Thatcher from the mid-1990s thought this country should leave the European Union. ‘And I cannot believe that a young Margaret Thatcher leaving Oxford today would join the Conservative party led by John Major. ‘I think she’d come and get involved in UKIP and no doubt topple me within 12 months or so.’ When journalists pointed out to him that Sir John is not the Tory leader, and has not been since 1997, Mr Farage added: ‘Sorry Cameron I meant, but then what is the difference? I can’t spot them.’ Tory MP Therese Coffey dismissed the idea that Lady Thatcher would have joined any other party. 'Farage talking garbage,' she wrote on Twitter. And Conservative MP Conor Burns, a friend of the former premier, added: 'Sadly for him Margaret Thatcher was a tribal Conservative throughout her life and died a Conservative. 'Having talked to her in recent years she felt strongly that only the Conservative Party was a big enough vehicle to achieve the agenda that she would have wanted in the future and it did throughout her long career in the past.' During a combative address, the UKIP . leader dismissed the ‘Westminster village’ view of politics, insisting . 50 miles from Westminster was a different country from which the . mainstream parties have become detached. Mr . Farage claimed his party would make big gains in next month’s local . elections, before winning the 2014 European elections and securing a . ‘substantial number of MPs’ at the 2015 general election. He also suggested UKIP could win a by-election in Portsmouth South, if, as expected, Lib Dem Mike Hanock steps down. But . Mr Farage was forced to defend his enthusiasm for the City of London . from claims he would have done nothing to prvent the 2007 financial . crash. Mr Farage said a young Margaret Thatcher would not join a party lead by John Major or David Cameron . Prime Minister David Cameron was dismissed as a 'social democrat' by Mr Farage, who predicted he would beat the Tories in next year's European Parliament elections . And he admitted his tax policy is ‘incomplete… it need more work’ as he admitted the UKIP manifesto sets out ‘aspirations’ rather than concrete policies if the party wins power in County Halls on May 2. He accused the leaders of the three main parties of never having ‘done a day’s work in their lives’. He added: ‘They look the same, they sound the same. God they are dull, They are not much fun to be with.’ He said UKIP came within a ‘gnat’s whisker’ of wining the Eastleigh by-election, beaten by the Lib Dems by 1,771 votes. He said UKIP would stand a good chance of going further and winning in Portsmouth South if ill-health and allegations of sexual misconduct force Mr Hancock to stand down. Mr Farage hinted at an electoral pact with the Tory party, including not fielding candidates against Conservative MPs who rebelled on European votes. He added: ‘Who would I like to see lead the Conservative party, well it’s not really my affair is it? But all this talk of pacts which people like [Tory MP Michael] Fabricant here keep chucking into the media… . ‘Very difficult isn’t it under any circumstances to see how we would even contemplate doing a deal with a man who thinks because we believe that it’s about time given that more people came into Britain in 2010 than came here from 1066 to 1950…. given we think that a degree of immigration control is sensible, just denounces as being closest races. ‘I would have thought the prospects of a deal with David Cameron are just about zero. ‘Who would I like to see lead the Conservative, who could we do a deal with? I don’t know but I would have thought there are some very good thinking people there like Michael Gove who doesn’t just dismiss somebody’s point of view he listens to it and engages with it. ‘Boris of course is the great pretender but history shows that they rarely win.’ He insisted he does not spend ‘every waking hour’ thinking doing electoral pacts. ‘I am leading a movement that is becoming a very successful modern, different movement in British politics and my job is to push this thing forward. ‘To change the entire nature of the national debate on a whole host of issues and I hope and believe to change the future of how this country is governed and that’s what really matters to me.’","UKIP leader claims a young Margaret Thatcher would join his party .

Wanted: The boat, now parked at the Sheriff's Office impound lot, has been cleaned of its barnacles after it was washed up in California . The boat had travelled a distance of some 5,500 miles. The Japanese found out where the boat was after officials in the U.S. posted a picture on Crescent City’s Facebook page. Just hours later, a teacher from a school in Japan, said the boat was their's. Humboldt State University geologist Lori Dengler says she posted the photos recently after a university librarian translated the name of the high school from the boat. The earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan in 2011 was the most powerful in the country’s history, and killed more than 16,000 people. When the deadly tsunami struck Japan . in March 2011, about five million tons of debris was dragged into the . Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese government estimates.

Man with no shame: Sir David Nicholson will meet senior directors from the NHS Commissioning Board . NHS hospitals last night stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly. The boss of one trust has been forced aside and experts called in to investigate a possible cover-up over death rates. And Professor Brian Jarman, a renowned specialist on hospital performance, believes several other hospitals may be doing the same. The revelations came as the chief executive of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, prepared to meet senior bosses from the new body in charge of hospitals and health services for the first time since the Mid Staffordshire scandal report. The Bolton Foundation Trust – the focus of the latest allegations – had had one of the highest mortality rates in the country. But in 2011, the figures suddenly dropped by 10 per cent and the trust was named as one of only about 50 in the country with ‘lower than expected’ death rates. The fall was initially celebrated as evidence of improving performance but there are now concerns it was merely a statistical trick. In fact, it is feared that since 2001, an estimated 2,000-plus patients may have died unnecessarily at the trust. Yesterday it emerged that Dr Jackie Bene, the chief executive, has ‘stepped aside’ while a joint investigation is carried out by mortality experts and the local NHS body. The NHS’s medical director, Professor Bruce Keogh, said: ‘It is absolutely unacceptable for any part of the NHS to deliberately manipulate any patient information. ‘If we’re to have an open and accountable NHS, where patients and the public know how NHS hospitals are doing, those hospitals must behave openly and honestly about their performance.’ Yesterday the House of Commons heard claims that previous official reports into NHS care had been suppressed because they revealed a ‘pervasive culture of fear’. This came as the chairman of the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal called for an immediate ‘culture change’ in the NHS. The probe at Bolton Foundation Trust will consider whether staff categorised patients as dying from septicaemia – blood poisoning – when they actually died of more easily-treatable conditionsMortality rates are meant to reflect the standard of care in a hospital. As such, deaths from serious illnesses such as septicaemia and cancer do not influence figures as much as preventable deaths from hip fractures and infections. Scandal: Professor Brian Jarman (left) believes that within the last five years other hospitals have lowered their mortality rates by wrongly labelling deaths. Dr Jackie Bene (right) who has stepped aside . There is concern that preventable deaths from hip fractures or urine infections were intentionally labelled as septicaemia to lower the mortality rate. Over the last year there have been 800 cases of septicaemia when there should only have been 200 in a trust this size. Professor Jarman believes that within the last five years other hospitals have lowered their mortality rates by wrongly labelling deaths. They include Medway in Kent and George Eliot, Mid Staffordshire and Walsall in the West Midlands where mortality rates have been slashed by up to quarter in a single year. Investigation: The probe at Bolton Foundation Trust will consider whether staff categorised patients as dying from blood poisoning when they actually died of more easily treatable conditions . He said: ‘I can’t prove it because the hospitals are denying it. They keep saying it’s a coincidence.’ But he added: ‘The whole thing is appalling.’ The investigation at Bolton will go back through the records of 200 patients who died from septicaemia or were diagnosed with the condition. But experts have already looked into 50 cases and say there is ‘sufficient cause for concern.’ Today, for the first time since the Mid Staffordshire report, Sir David Nicholson will meet senior directors from the NHS Commissioning Board – the new body in charge of hospitals and health services. Relatives of patients who died at Mid Staffordshire will stage a silent protest outside the meeting in Manchester to reinforce pressure on him to resign. A spokesman for Bolton Foundation Trust said: ‘We do not believe there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients, but rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust reports information about their care for administrative and financial purposes.’","Sir David Nicholson will meet directors from the NHS Commissioning Board .

At least 1,000 dead ducks have been found floating in a Chinese river, just days after the bodies of more than 16,000 pigs were pulled out of Shanghai’s main waterway. The new discovery has triggered more concern over the safety of the nation’s drinking water. The duck carcasses were fished out of the Nanhe river in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan, officials confirmed. Scroll down for video . At least 1,000 dead ducks were found floating in the Nanhe river in southwestern China . It has not yet been established what killed the ducks, which were disinfected and buried in plastic bags . They were found in over 50 woven bags but the bodies were so badly decomposed it was impossible to tell how they died. The news came as Shanghai environmental workers said almost all of the dead pigs had been removed from the Huangpu river, which supplies 22% of the city’s drinking water. Government officials said 98 pigs were recovered on Sunday and 93 on Saturday, the first time the daily toll had fallen below a hundred in days. Images over the last fortnight of dead hogs in China’s commercial hub has proved a major embarrassment to the city, which is seeking to grow as an international financial centre. Samples have tested positive for porcine circovirus, a common swine disease that does not affect humans. It was unclear last night what killed the ducks. Their bodies were disinfected and buried in plastic bags three metres underground, said Liang Weidong, a deputy director in Pengshan’s publicity department.

Mystery remains over the exact origin of both the dead hogs and ducks. ‘Dead pigs, dead ducks... this soup is getting thicker and thicker,' wrote one person with the username Baby Luck on weibo, China’s version of Twitter. ‘The dead pigs haven’t even disappeared yet, and now the dead ducks emerge - does this society enjoy being competitive?” wrote netizen sugarandsweet.","The carcasses were fished out of the Nanhe river in Sichun .

The nearly two-mile-long runway at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico will have to be extended to accommodate Virgin Galactic's sleek rocket-powered spacecraft, spaceport officials confirmed today. New Mexico Spaceport Authority board members voted to extend the runway by another 2,000 feet. Spaceport America is the world's first terminal, hangar and runway built specifically for commercial space travel. Virgin Galactic, which will be the spaceport's anchor tenant, determined through a battery of test flights and simulations that more room would be needed for landings under certain circumstances. New era: Virgin Galactic's White Knight Two mothership on the runway at Spaceport America . ‘It's really being done for safety,’ spaceport spokesman David Wilson said. ‘It was a guess until they started dropping it and simulating and doing different scenarios, how this thing was going to behave on the runway. This is all a product of the testing and the characteristics of the vehicle.’ Backed by British billionaire Richard Branson, the commercial space line has been developing its craft and rocket engines in California's Mojave Desert. The company plans to begin moving into the hangar and terminal facility later this year, and the runway extension is not expected to cause delays. The runway was dedicated by Branson and other officials in October 2010 with much fanfare. Stretching across a flat dusty plain 45 miles north of Las Cruces, the runway is designed to support almost every aircraft in the world, day-to-day space tourism flights and payload launch operations. It is 42 inches thick and includes a 14-inch layer of concrete. Blue-sky thinking: WhiteKnightTwo on display outside the hangar facility at the spaceport . The extension will cost $7 million (£4million), Wilson said. Money will be reassigned within the spaceport's $209million taxpayer-financed budget to absorb the cost of the change. Designing the extension will take six to eight months. Virgin Galactic has said rocket testing is continuing and commercial flights are at least a year away. Wilson said the extension did not come as a surprise to spaceport board members. As part of the agreement Virgin Galactic had with New Mexico to build the spaceport, any technical changes that resulted from development of the spaceship technology would have to be accommodated by the state. Hitching a ride: WhiteKnightTwo acts as a carrier for SpaceShipTwo, where the passengers will sit . One scenario considered was if the rocket ship's engines did not fire. That would require the craft to glide back to the spaceport, loaded with unburned fuel. That would mean the craft would be heavier and would require more room to land. Other factors involve New Mexico's altitude and high temperatures, which make the air thinner. ‘That dictates longer runways,’ Wilson said. Branson and Virgin Galactic officials have said repeatedly that everything possible will be done to ensure safety once commercial flights begin. Unlike experimental programs run by Nasa, Wilson said Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic are based on business models and investments. ‘Obviously safety has to be at the highest level, especially when you're talking about commercial passenger service,’ he said. Branson announced last week that Virgin Galactic had netted its 500th customer, actor Ashton Kutcher. Others include Hollywood types, international entrepreneurs, scientists and space buffs. At $200,000 (£125,000) a ticket, the space tourists get a two-and-a-half-hour flight with about five minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth that until now only astronauts have been able to experience.","Tickets on craft cost £125,000 with stars such as Ashton Kutcher already signed up .

The severe thunderstorms producing deadly tornadoes - like the one in Moore, Oklahoma - form where cold dry air meets warm moist tropical air. The wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel cloud. The air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air - and objects on the ground - into it. Scroll down for video showing the tornado's progress . Huge: Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes but are generally in the form of a visible condensation funnel. This picture shows the enormity of the Oklahoma tornado . How tornadoes are made: The severe thunderstorms producing deadly twisters - like the one in Moore, Oklahoma - form where cold dry air meets warm moist tropical air . Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes but are generally in the form of a . visible condensation funnel, with the narrow end touching the earth. More often than not, they are encircled by a cloud of dust and debris. The majority of tornadoes have wind speeds which are less than 110 miles . per hour and often measure about 76m across. They are capable of travelling for a . few miles. However, those which are at the most extreme can have wind speeds of . more than 300 miles per hour and stretch more than two miles. Most tornadoes spin cyclonically (counter-clockwise) in the Northern Hemisphere. The twisters are most common in a section of the U.S. called Tornado Alley, with most forming in the months of April and May. Map: Twisters are most common in a section of the U.S. called Tornado Alley, with most forming in the months of April and May . Terrifying: The Oklahoma tornado had wind speeds of up to 200 mph. No two tornadoes are the same, with some even reaching speeds of 300mph . Tornadoes need certain conditions to form, particularly intense heat. As the temperature on the ground increases, moist air heats up and begins to rise. When this meets the cold, dry air it explodes upwards and leads to a storm quickly developing. The upward movement of air then becomes very rapid with winds from many different directions causing it to spin. This then leads to a visible funnel dropping from the cloud towards the ground - which we all recognise as a tornado. No two tornadoes are the same. However, they have occurred on every continent except Antarctica . There are, on average, 1,300 . tornadoes each year in the United States, which have caused an average . of 65 deaths annually in recent years. Conditions on the ground do not generally affect the power of a tornado, including terrain and structures like buildings.

Tesco is to divide its customers into rich and poor by using Clubcard data to personalise its website to display items geared towards your wealth. Upmarket shoppers who click onto the retailer’s new home page will be tempted by smoked salmon and an array of sumptuous fine food. Hard-up shoppers will be presented with tins of baked beans and Tesco’s Value promotions. Reversing its fortunes: Tesco is fighting to improve its sales . For years Britain’s biggest grocer has been able to chart the spending habits of regular shoppers using its loyalty card and now it is using some of that data to tailor its websites with items aimed at individual shoppers. The supermarket giant is fighting a desperate battle to reverse its fortunes in the UK after a dire year in which it has lost out to rivals and posted its first profit warning for 20 years. With its website it wants to recreate some of the personal service that shoppers used to enjoy on the High Street. Tesco boss Phil Clarke said in a speech published yesterday: ‘We are turning Clubcard digital. We’re now making changes to our UK website to highlight promotions that are relevant to the customer who is browsing the site. Speech: Phil Clarke unveiled the proposal yesterday, with the scheme part of the Clubcard going digital . ‘Using Clubcard data, we would show, for example, offers of our everyday Value range to price sensitive customers, and offers of our Finest range to more upmarket customers.’ He said if you think back a generation to the 1980s many retailers would know their customers individually. ‘Some customers you would know by name,’ he said. ‘Others you’d know well enough to give a friendly smile and ask ‘how are you today?’ ‘If you knew and understood each of your customers inside out, you could give them what they wanted. ‘By doing that, you could earn the most important thing of all: customers’ loyalty. Loyal customers are the most precious asset any company can have.’ Tesco has already carried out a trial on its website personalising certain items based on the wealth of shoppers. It carried out a test on mattresses. Clarke said: ‘When a customer visited our website, we would use Clubcard data to tell us if the customer was more swayed by price or quality. We’d then display the type of mattress that best reflected that shopper’s characteristic. Sales grew by 10pc.’ The move to engineer its website socially is likely to be controversial for Tesco. It risks shoppers taking offence at being presented with baskets of low cost items when some might actually enjoy browsing through more expensive products. Other grocers have also found upmarket shoppers like to mix and match the items in their trolleys - filling them with premium products such as meat, where it matters, and buying budget salt and potatoes where it matters less. Catering to different budgets: Some . customers will be presented with offers on basics when they log on to . Tesco's website, while others will see luxury products . Most physical supermarkets already offer a two-tier shopping experience, filling the shelves of stores in more upmarket areas with caviar and fine wines while less prosperous regions get value ranges of pasta and canned food. Clarke says personal service is the way forward and he wants customers to feel part of a ‘special group’ with staff feeling able to surprise the big spenders. ‘It means treating our best customers as we would our friends by giving our staff more freedom to surprise loyal customers with special offers,’ he said. ‘Trusted retailers will be those that do more than simply deliver value, choice, convenience. ‘They will be there in the global online, marketplace, just like those ancient traders in the markets you would have found here thousands of years ago, getting to know their customers, hearing what they have to say, delivering a personal service.’ Tesco is also introducing a raft of new initiatives aimed at boosting sales. It is putting free wi-fi in more of its stores which will give additional service to Clubcard holders using smartphones. The phones will be able to tell the user where goods on their shopping list can be found in the store. And, as they walk around the store, the smartphone will use its Clubcard data to make other suggestions about what they might want to buy, and point out offers. The retailer has also transformed a series of interactive posters at a tube station in Korea into a virtual store. The posters show images of shelves containing different items that simulate various aisles and passengers waiting for their trains can do their weekly shop by scanning the barcode on items they want from the posters and building an online shopping list which can be ordered to deliver at their home.","Supermarket to tailor its websites with items aimed at individual shoppers .

Scotland Yard are also believed to be re-interviewing holidaymakers and staff at the complex where the three-year-old was last seen as part of an ongoing review into her abduction. They have drawn up a list of suspects, including British cleaners and Portuguese manual workers, who have been identified as 'people of interest' during a review of the inquiry. Detectives are believed to be investigating whether a couple comforted a crying Madeleine McCann . Scotland Yard are focusing their investigation on the blocks surrounding Block 5, where the McCanns were staying and believe the abductor may have been staying on the resort in Praia Da Luz, Portugal . Detectives are also probing whether the kidnapper was staying on one of the holiday flats at the Ocean Club. Madeleine disappeared in May, 2007, as her parents Gerry and Kate ate dinner with friends about 50 yards away at a tapas bar. She was left in the family's rented apartment at the resort in Praia de Luz, along with twin siblings Sean and Amelie. Two witnesses said they saw a middle-aged couple enter the apartment to comfort Madeleine, who was crying, The Sunday Express has reported. The newspaper quoted a source as saying: 'Apparently they were concerned about the crying and went to see if they could comfort the girl.'

Gerry McCann and Kate McCann hold their twins Sean and Amelie at the Ocean Club Resort in 2007 . The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where Maddie disappeared. Portuguese police refuse to reopen the case . The investigation is now thought to be focusing on a small number of apartment blocks close to block 5, where the McCann family were staying. The investigation includes identifying the owners, holidaymakers and those who may have illegally been subletting the flats at the time Madeleine disappeared. Blocks four and six, which are situated either side of the McCann building, and block two, which is behind their apartment, are the central to the investigation. There are fears that someone staying in the complex may have been able to watch the family's movements from their flat. Among those detectives want to speak to are British cleaners and 'low-level' workers, such as handymen and gardeners, The Mail on Sunday learned. Some are thought to have been employed by the Ocean Club complex on a . casual basis and may have already been interviewed. Police . are said to be keen to trace six British cleaners who were working in . Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished and who did not appear in the . Portuguese files.

A British owner of one of the apartments said he had been asked about the cleaners by police from Operation Grange and had been told that blocks five, six, two and four were of particular interest. He told The Sunday Mirror: 'Every one of the properties they are interested in is right next door to, or on top of, the one where the little girl went missing. 'The officer said the people of interest were located in one of those blocks at the time'. Detective Chief . Superintendent Hamish Campbell, head of Scotland Yard’s Homicide and . Serious Crime Command, said this week that he believes Madeleine may still be alive - despite it being five years since her disappearance. He said: 'You only have to look at the case in . Cleveland, Ohio, and the European cases. Of course there is a . possibility she is alive. But the key is to investigate the case and, . alive or dead, we should be able to try and discern what happened.’ Despite the extraordinary amount of publicity Madeleine's disappearance generated, she has not been seen since May, 2007. Senior Met Police officers believe Madeleine (pictured left, and in an artist's impression of how she may look aged nine, right) may still be alive and said the Cleveland kidnappings show there could still be hope . Jane Tanner, who was at the tapas bar with the McCanns, told police she saw a man carrying a child the night Madeleine disappeared. However, no one has ever been traced.

"By . Andrew Pierce . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 17 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:52 EST, 18 April 2013 . Until yesterday, Carol Thatcher’s tousle-haired companion’s only regular exposure to British politics was confined to the annual Parliamentary skiing competition in Klosters. Marco Grass, 43, is a leading ski instructor in the Swiss resort and regularly puts British MPs through their paces before the contest with their Swiss counterparts. His place in the Thatcher family line-up was a surprise even to some of Lady Thatcher’s closest friends. A daughter's grief: Carol Thatcher is comforted by partner Marco Grass and her brother Mark's wife, Sarah, at Mortlake Crematorium after yesterday's funeral . Rarely seen in Britain, let alone photographed with Carol, he has studiously avoided any publicity since the pair met on the Alpine slopes in 1992. He has been a constant and discreet companion ever since, though the exact nature of their relationship is ambiguous. They were certainly a romantic item initially. Yet Carol, who at 59 is 16 years his senior, said on one of the few occasions she has talked publicly about Marco: ‘One day I’m sure he will vanish into the distance with someone younger and prettier.’ Two years ago, Marco broke both his legs in a skiing accident, and Carol nursed him back to health. Yesterday, however, as Carol emerged hesitantly from the official car outside St Paul’s, it was easy to see that it was his moment to support her. Her rock: Carol Thatcher - never close to her twin brother - with long-time partner Marco Grass, who also appeared visibly moved . Support: Although Grass, 43, is rarely seen in Britain, let alone photographed with Carol, yesterday he was constantly by her side during the funeral . Close together: Carol stayed by her man's side after the service as they waited for the hearse to take Baroness Thatcher's coffin away . As she walked up the aisle of the cathedral, Carol looked distracted and tense and repeatedly darted her head in Marco’s direction for reassurance. In contrast, only once — and then just briefly as they earlier walked up the cathedral steps — was there physical contact between Carol and her twin brother, Mark. He touched her arm just at the moment her face crumpled with emotion. Sitting in the front row pew, she constantly clasped and unclasped her hands, crossed her legs over each other and back again, fanned herself with her Order of Service and re-arranged her hat. She showed all the outwards signs of inner unease. On the cathedral steps after the service, as they waited for the hearse to take away their mother’s coffin, Carol and her brother stood apart, almost symbolically, in the family group — separated by their respective partners. Strong together: Carol leans on her partner of 21 years, Marco Grass, at St Paul's Cathedral, central London . Marco stood by Carols side outside St Paul's Cathedral nest to Sir Mark, his wife Sarah, and his two children Amanda and Michael . For years, the twins were barely on speaking terms. Carol was always closer to her father, Sir Denis, who died in 2003, while Mark was always his mother’s favourite. ‘They rarely see each other but put on a good show when they are on public parade,’ said a friend of Carol. ‘The truth is that there is little between them. ‘Carol would have felt very isolated without Marco. In fact, I don’t think she could have got through the service without him.’ When they first became an item, Marco, whose family were hoteliers, lived in Carol’s riverside apartment in Fulham, West London, and she referred to him as her ‘lodger’. He soon became an occasional guest at her parents’ house in Chester Square, Belgravia. Mischievously, Marco would ask Lady Thatcher if she thought Switzerland should join the EU, knowing that it would trigger one of her famous political diatribes on the subject of Europe. A hug for Daddy: Amanda Thatcher puts a reassuring arm around a distressed Sir Mark while her brother wipes away a tear and her stepmother looks on concerned . He also got on well with Sir Denis, who advised him to emulate his example: stay out of the limelight and never give interviews. Marco followed that advice to the letter. Indeed, until the funeral, only a handful of Carol’s friends knew what he even looked like. Lady Thatcher would have been pleased that Marco was at St Paul’s because she knew that he made Carol happy and that he has never embarrassed her family. Sir Denis would also have approved, as Marco is a consummate party host back in Klosters, where he and Carol own a small, stylish apartment. Carol divides her time between the Swiss resort and an apartment in Madrid, where she is learning Spanish. Her flight home to Switzerland would also have earned the approval of the famously thrifty Iron Lady. Carol and Marco will leave as they arrived in Britain — on an EasyJet budget flight.","Carol Thatcher's partner supported her at her mother's funeral today .

David Cameron’s political guru Steve Hilton is to make a shock return to Downing Street in a No 10 shake-up. The ‘blue skies’ thinker, who left for America last year because he was disillusioned by the pace of reform in Whitehall, will advise a new policy board set up by the Prime Minister. The board will be run by Boris Johnson’s younger brother, Tory MP Jo Johnson, who will become a Cabinet Office minister and also take charge of the No 10 policy unit in the run up to the 2015 election. New team: Policy guru Steve Hilton (left) will sit on a new board of Tory advisers headed by Jo Johnson, Boris's younger brother . Cameron aides hailed the move as a . return to the days of Margaret Thatcher, when the policy shop was run by . highly ideological Tories. Until now, Mr Cameron’s policy unit has been . staffed solely by civil servants, a situation which has dismayed Tory . MPs who think the Government has lacked drive and focus. Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory donor, . was among several party grandees who had been calling for Mr Cameron to . set up an advisory board to consult his MPs. Mr Hilton will continue to live in . California, flying back for some meetings of the new board ‘a few times a . year’ to help develop and push through Conservative policies. Mr Hilton was the champion of the Big Society concept and urged Mr Cameron to adopt more green policies . The Prime Minister tweeted this pictured of a meeting with some of his new advisers, including Jo Johnson (centre left) Insiders said the aide, notorious for . his scruffy and shoeless attire and penchant for travelling by bicycle, . would also conduct video conferences around once a month. Given the Johnson family’s reputation . for being fiercely competitive, MPs saw Jo’s appointment as an effort to . neutralise the threat from his brother Boris, Mr Cameron’s most . high-profile leadership rival. Margaret Thatcher would be ‘appalled’ at Tories who switch to the UK Independence Party, one of her closest allies has said. Former defence secretary Liam Fox warned that Conservatives flirting with the eurosceptic party will simply open the door to another Labour government. He also argued that Tory politicians should remind the public of Lady Thatcher’s belief that countries shouldn’t spend more than they earn. His outspoken address to the Midlands Industrial Council came after UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed that if Lady Thatcher were entering politics today she would join his party. Dr Fox said: ‘Lady Thatcher used to say that she was born a Conservative, would die a Conservative and would fight for her beliefs inside the Conservative party. ‘I think she would be disappointed, if not appalled, to see Conservatives switching to UKIP rather than argue their case inside the Conservative party. ‘But worse, she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power . . . to her mortal enemy, the Labour party.’ Dr Fox spoke out as UKIP faced the embarrassing revelation that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far-right BNP and another blamed Jews for the Holocaust. It also sparked speculation that the . younger, less ostentatious brother could end up eclipsing his more . established sibling, just as Ed Miliband usurped his brother to win the . Labour leadership. The London Mayor hailed his brother’s . appointment, saying: ‘Great there is finally a Johnson in Number 10. Jo . will be superb.’ In a reference to their other siblings, he added: ‘Now . for Rachel and Leo!’ Rachel is a journalist and novelist and Leo an . entrepreneur. The Mayor was then photographed . wielding a copy of a newspaper which had carried the headline: ‘A . Johnson finally gets into No 10.’ It had been impishly doctored to read: . ‘A B. Johnson finally gets into Number 10.’ His full name is Alexander . Boris Johnson. Their father Stanley said: ‘I’m delighted. The odds on a Tory victory must have shortened.’ Both Jo and Boris were educated at Mr . Cameron’s old school, Eton College, and at Balliol College, Oxford, . where both were members of the notorious and socially exclusive . Bullingdon Club dining society. The creation of the new policy board . is designed to show backbenchers that Mr Cameron is listening to their . concerns and dispel the notion that he runs an exclusive clique in No . 10. But the addition of a third  old . Etonian to his inner circle will do little to help his cause. Among . other appointments to the board are Jesse Norman, who led the House of . Lords reform rebellion and is also an old Etonian, and Peter Lilley, who . was in Lady Thatcher and John Major’s cabinets. ‘I told them I want more ideas to help hardworking people,’ Mr Cameron posted on Twitter after meeting the board yesterday. The PM’s spokesman batted away . questions over whether appointing another Eton-educated figure meant he . was receiving a ‘narrow’ range of advice. Coming for you: One MP says that 'Team Boris' is taking over, after the Mayor's brother was appointed a Downing Street role . Mr Cameron has already sought to . strengthen communications with restive Tory backbenchers after . right-winger John Hayes was recruited as a ‘sounding board’ last month. But not all Tory MPs were  convinced . by the moves. One senior figure said: ‘I love Jo Johnson, but when will . Dave realise it’s leadership we want, not go-betweens.’ Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘The country needs new policies, not a new policy team. ‘These appointments are all about . shoring up this out-of-touch and weak Prime Minister.

Students' grades are being inflated as coursework replaces exams at universities across Britain, with some higher education institutions abandoning them entirely. A study has found that grades are rising as the use of coursework to assess learning increases, sparking fears that students are increasingly downloading essays and plagiarising academic work they find online. The research, conducted by the Sunday Telegraph using data published by universities, shows that coursework is increasingly replacing traditional exams and many courses in history, English, psychology and media are now 90 to 100 per cent coursework, especially at former polytechnics and new universities. Learning: University grades are rising, but some academics fear the drop in the use of exams to assess students is driving grades up . The paper reported that exams at many institutions have been reduced to only 20 or 30 per cent of the overall marks and students are allowed to fail papers yet still get their degree. Critics claimed the figures showed that higher education is 'dumbing down' and claim the trend is behind a spike in first class degrees over the past decade. Figures show that 53,215 graduates gained firsts in 2010-11 compared with 23,700 in the decade before. The survey of 85 universities offering Bachelor of Arts degrees in history discovered 60 per cent of assessment is coursework in more than half, while a fifth grade 80 per cent on coursework. At Worcester University, history degree assessment is entirely done on coursework and in 2011 a total of 20 per cent of all students got a first. In contrast a tenth of the history degree at the London School of Economics is based on coursework and last year 15 per cent of students there gained first-class degrees. Graduate joy: But critics say a rise in first class degrees is down to a spike in coursework assessment. Many universities have dropped exams entirely. File picture . According to the Telegraph, exams are virtually non-existent in English degrees across the UK, and at Plymouth, Brighton and Derby, there are no traditional exams in the subject. A report by the research body Higher Education Academy called 'Coursework Marks High, Examination Marks Low: Discuss' found that students on coursework-intensive courses tend to fare better in terms of grades. Plagiarism: Education experts fear students are stealing or paying to download academic work to complete their coursework (file picture) A statement from the Academy said: 'It is commonly believed that the standard of student performance in coursework tends to be higher than that achieved in formal examinations.' Coursework does have its supporters, who claim that coursework is a better way of assessing long-term learning, but some academics say it is fuelling a rise in students plagiarising essays or simply downloading them. Professor Antonia Payne, head of Worcester University’s institute of humanities, told the Telegraph it dropped traditional exams more than a decade ago. She added: 'There is no correlation between the cessation of three-hour unseen examinations and the proportion of good history degrees awarded at Worcester over the past decade.' Professor Alison Wolf, an assessment expert at King’s College, London, and a Department for Education adviser, said she was 'surprised' about the shift. She said: 'If you use the same assessment technique across a whole degree, you run the risk of only testing a limited number of things.'","Exams are being replaced by coursework at universities throughout the UK .

Seven-year-old Audrey Grevemberg, the daughter of Glasgow 2014 chief executive David Grevemberg, gave the couple a big silver gift bag with Commonwealth Games jumpers inside. William accepted the gift and knelt down to speak to the girl while Kate smiled. When asked if she enjoyed meeting the royal couple, Audrey said she did. Kate also chatted to teenagers who started learning to pole vault three days ago as part of an Easter holiday course. Iona Menzies, 14, from Glasgow, said: 'It was such an honour to meet her. She's so pretty in real life. 'It was quite nerve-wracking but she was really encouraging and said we should keep working at it. 'She said she had never seen the pole vault before so it was nice to be able to show her it up close.'Rachel Campbell, also 14, from Erskine, Renfrewshire, said: 'She was really friendly and just asking us how difficult it is. Kate chats to a little girl who presents the duchess with a rose outside the Donald Dewar Leisure Centre where she is set to launch a new project for their charity. The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is partnering with Glasgow Sport and the Hunter Foundation on a new pilot as part of its national Coach Core initiative . Supporters bestow Kate with cuddly toys and flowers on the visit, which saw Kate greet hundreds of well-wishers on the streets of the Scottish city . The duchess accessorised her coat with her trusty suede boots. Under her tartan coat the hemline of a black skirt or dress was just visible . 'I was nervous but my heartbeat is calming down now.' The Duchess gave Scott Connal, 13, from Lenzie, Glasgow, a round of applause as he completed his vault. 'I do lots of athletics so I'm used to people clapping at big competitions but never from royalty, it was really inspiring,' he said. Mrs Ritchie said: 'She said Shona . looked very pretty and asked her if she had picked the flower from her . garden, but Shona told her she got it from my vase in the house and she . thought that was very funny.' Kate is given a flower by a local girl named Shona - who had earlier allowed the . Prince to look at her flower but would not give it to him, saying she was saving it for Kate . ...and the little girl proved not to be such a fan of William, recoiling as the prince goes in for a kiss . The Duke and Duchess also watched pole vaulters, badminton players and a netball match. They were treated to a performance from the Glasgow 2014 mascot, Clyde, and Clyde's dance crew. Kate . later met Clyde and his designer, 12-year-old Beth Gilmour, from . Cumbernauld. It emerged that the cheeky thistle mascot had earlier asked . if he could pat Kate's bump. Glasgow . 2014 marketing manager Samantha Jones said: 'Clyde doesn't speak but he . was gesturing to Kate about her baby as if to congratulate her. 'Before the visit he was asking if he could pat the bump, but we told him no. 'When he was signalling to her about the baby, she just laughed and said ""Oh yes, the baby. Thank you very much.""

William and Kate, known in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, arrive in Glasgow this morning . Beth, who won a school competition to become the official mascot designer, gave Kate a book named Captain Bristle's Thistle, which tells the story of Clyde. 'I never thought I would win the competition in the first place so meeting royalty was really unexpected, but an honour,' she said. William later donned headphones to play DJ at a homeless centre for young people.The crowd who gathered to meet the Duke were delighted when he agreed to a crash course in mixing on the decks. He tried his hand at 'scratching' but claimed it was harder than his day job flying a helicopter. 'I think I should come better prepared next time,' he said after his attempt at mixing Run DMC's It's Like That with another record, a collection of beats and samples. The Duchess meanwhile turned producer as she called 'cut' during a filming session, one of several workshops available for youngsters at the Quarrier's Stopover Project on Glasgow's southside. Kate reassured the camera-shy 'actors' and applauded when they finished their pieces. Later she admitted that knitting was so far not one of her strong points when a resident presented her with a woollen hat for her child along with a teddy bear and babygro. She said: 'I've been trying to knit and I'm really bad. I should be asking for tips.' She told 17-year-old Caitlin Coffield: 'It's very sweet of you, I'll keep it safe for the big day.' The Stopover Project provides short-term accommodation and support to 16 to 25-year-olds.The centre has beds for 14 needy young people who as well as being homeless often have alcohol or drug addiction problems or mental health issues. The centre works with other agencies to help them tackle their issues and find a permanent home. Sometimes they stay for weeks, while others take refuge at the centre for up to a year. The Duke is patron of Centrepoint, another charity that has been providing support for rough sleepers for decades. Kate's Scottish look was courtesy of the British family-run design company moloh. The firm has a boutique in Tetbury, close to Charles's Gloucestershire home, and another in Pimlico in central London.

'It is much more interesting and challenging to represent a complex set of feelings by framing the model's hair and shoulders in a proper - suggestive, dreamy or even scary and nightmarish - background, instead of simply and plainly picturing her expression. 'This also leads the watcher to actively focus on what the photo makes her/him feel - and possibly to imagine what the photographer's and the model's feelings may have been - instead of passively admire or dislike the final result of the photographer's work - just as straight portraits usually do.'

A mind-bogglingly big sunspot has appeared in the past few days, which could mean the Earth is about to be blasted by powerful solar storms. Known as AR 1476, it was spotted by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, which launched in 2010. Its diameter of 60,000 miles is many times that of the Earth, which measures just under 8,000 miles across. The sunspot is so ginormous that it’s possible to view with home telescopes – though experts warn that these must be fitted with sun filters to prevent permanent eye damage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sunspot AR 1476: It can be seen in the upper left of this picture - and could unleash gigantic solar flares . In a tweet the SDO mission described the sunspot as a ‘monster’ and predicted that a huge solar flare - or coronal mass ejection - could erupt as a result, meaning the Earth would be hosed by radiation travelling at up to 5million mph. Sunspots often travel in pairs and are darker than the surrounding area because they are slightly cooler, which makes them less luminous. They are caused by the sun’s magnetic field becoming twisted – and it’s this twisting dynamic that can produce coronal mass ejections. These contain billions of tons of gases bursting with X-rays and ultraviolet radiation. They are mind-bogglingly hot – around 100,000,000C. Brilliant photo: A solar flare erupting in 2004 and spitting billions of tons of the Sun's gas into space . The Earth is occasionally hit by these ejections, leading to amazing shimmering light shows. They are the result of ionised solar particles becoming imprisoned by Earth’s magnetic field, exciting the gases in the atmosphere and emitting bursts of energy in the form of light. However, these particles can also cause magnetic storms, which in extreme cases have been known to disrupt satellites and electricity grids. In 1989, a CME was held responsible for leaving six million people in Quebec, Canada, without power. Solar activity runs in 11-year cycles, with the current one peaking in 2013, so more violent space weather is on the horizon. Dr Matthew Penn, of the National Solar Observatory in Arizona, said recently: 'Because the sun is becoming more active, it will have an impact on millions of people. Sunspots can cause the biggest and most damaging space storms that occur. 'During the next two years, we are expecting the number of sunspots visible on the sun to reach a maximum. We know that sunspots are the source of a lot of space weather and solar storms, so we expect a larger number of solar storms here at the Earth.’","It could result in a gigantic coronal mass ejection, which would blast the Earth with radiation and possibly knock-out power lines and disrupt satellites ."

Lillia Reading born with muscular myopathy, a condition that caused her to develop just two muscles in each of her legs . A four-year-old girl who was born with just two muscles in each of her legs can finally walk after doctors fitted her with splints. Lillia Reading was born with muscular myopathy, a condition that caused her to develop just two muscles in each of her legs, instead of the normal 15. It also left her with permanently bent knees. But she is able to walk now after doctors cut the tendons behind her knees and gave her a pair of splints to straighten her legs. Her mother, Katie Reading, 31, said: 'Lillia is just like any other little girl now. 'She can walk, run around and play happily with all of her friends. It's amazing what they have done for her. 'She's a proper little princess - she loves her make up, clothes and painting her nails. And know she can strut around like one too!' Lillia, from Sheffield, first showed signs of suffering from the condition before she was born. Mrs Reading, 31, said: 'They could tell something was wrong from the 20-week scan. It was first thought she had club foot.' But after she was born four weeks early, weighing 4lbs 5ozs, specialists confirmed Lillia's condition - a rare form of muscular dystrophy. At just 17-weeks-old, she was put into special boots to try and help straighten her legs. She also underwent 13 gruelling operations, but her treatment was unsuccessful. 'She was very squashed,' Mrs Reading said. 'She struggled to life her head up and couldn't bear any weight on her legs.' The condition also meant Lillia was cross-eyed, and left her with no control of her line of vision, but doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital successfully corrected her vision. Scroll down for video . The condition left her with permanently bent knees . Lillia's mother's 20-week scan suggested that she had a club foot but she was diagnosed with muscular myopathy when she was born . After having the tendons behind her knee cut, Lillia was discharged from hospital, to see how she naturally progressed. Her father, Nick Reading, 32, said: 'It was incredible, one day she clearly found the urge to want to walk. 'She tried to pull herself up on her legs but she didn't have any strength in them. 'It was a massive step because she wanted to do it - before she would just shuffle around on her bum.' She underwent 13 operations to try and correct the abnormalities in her legs that were preventing her from walking . During one of the operations, the tendons in the back of Lillia's knees were cut to allow her to straighten her legs . Following this progress, doctors fitted Lillia with leg splints, which she can put on, as and when she needs them. Mrs Reading, a hairdresser, said: 'They go from under her bum down to her ankle, and bend round her knee so she can walk normally. 'They are like cages that go around her legs - she looks like Forrest Gump! 'If she wants to get up and run around she can just pop them on, and then take them off when she wants to sit down comfortably - it means she can be like any other child. Lilllia has now been fitted with splints that allow her to walk. She is pictured with her parents Katie and Nick, and her brother, Harley . Lillia is now looking forward to starting school in September . 'She wobbled a lot to begin with and her balance and confidence wasn't great, but that quickly grew and it has given her great charisma. 'Lillia now goes to nursery and she can't wait to move up to big school in September.'

A Hollywood smile could be just half an hour away thanks to a new peroxide-free treatment, one dentist claims. Dr Giacomo Favero claims to have taken hundreds of calls from people wanting to try out Megawhite since he first introduced the treatment to his London practice. The procedure, which take less than half an hour and is painless, is changing the face of teeth whitening, said Dr Favero. All white: Dr Giacomo Favero believes his £89, peroxide-free whitening treatment, performed here at his dental surgery on London's Wimpole Street, is the future of teeth whitening . He says that it is the only peroxide-free treatment available in England, using only natural ingredients to deliver immediate results. Dr Favero, 34, said of the £89 treatment: 'I only believe in this product. 'With this treatment there is no pain, no sensitivity. 'I am the only one in England who offers this treatment.' Using a mixture of sodium bicarbonate, peppermint oil and other activators, Dr Favero promises patients they will leave with a natural white smile. He said: 'Every patient wants something fast, no pain, a good price and results guaranteed. And this product delivers on all those points. 'It's made of natural ingredients. Ones you find in toothpaste, so it's great for teeth. 'A lot of patients have sensitive teeth. Faith: Dr Favero is the only dentist in the country to offer the 'pain-free' treatment, which uses a combination of ingredients commonly found in toothpaste . 'They have consumed a lot of acid in the diet which has weakened the enamel on the teeth. This is the ideal treatment for them.' Dr Favero opened his first London practice on Wimpole Street in April last year and has been offering Megawhite for six months. It has become so popular that Dr Favero is fully booked until the end of May. He said: 'Usually a teeth whitening session would set you back at least £300 a time. 'This is an express treatment. We can do it before a birthday or a red carpet event. It's like going to a salon for a beauty treatment. 'I first ask how white they want to go. I take a photo and check the starting shade. 'Then I hand the patient a tray with ready-made gel in it and ask them to place it in their mouth before shining a blue light on the mouth area to activate the gel. 'After 20-25 minutes I ask them to take it out, rinse and that is all. 'I ask my patients 'Did you feel any pain?' And they say 'No, doctor. This is amazing!' 'When I give them the mirror, that is the best bit. They see the results straight away. 'It gives a very natural look as people want natural, healthy-looking teeth.' Innovative: Dr Favero hails from a dental dynasty - his family run dental clinics all over Italy and his father, Gian Antonio, was one of the world's first implantologists . A chance encounter on his honeymoon in Buenos Aires last year led him down this path. Dr Favero, who lives with wife Federica in Holland Park, said: 'I was in the hotel by the pool and I got talking to a man from Scotland. 'He asked me what I do and I told him I was a dentist. He said he did teeth whitening and he told me about this product that only lasted 20 minutes and contained no peroxide. 'We met again and I tried the product. I was really impressed.'The Favero name is already well known in Italy, where Giacomo hails from. His family run dental clinics all over Italy and his father Gian Antonio was one of the first implantologists in the world. 'I wanted to prove I could do it alone so I moved to London. 'This is my first project. I had patients who travelled back to Italy from the UK to get treatment. 'So I thought, instead of them coming back, why don't I go to them. 'I would love to treat everybody.' He added: 'Dentists are stupid, they do not have vision. They want to make money, they think this is too cheap. 'I do think this is going to catch on. 'Dentistry is changing. I'm trying to get rid of the stigma that dentists are scary.' Current teeth whitening can cost up to £800 and all contain peroxide. The treatment can take days to apply, although it lasts years.","Low price puts off dentists who can make £800 from traditional treatments .

Hollywood power-brokers vowed a ‘dialogue’ with the Obama administration concerning depictions of gun violence in American cinema following a high-profile White House meeting with Vice President Joe Biden. Entertainment industry leaders convened for two-and-a-half hours Thursday with Biden and other Obama administration officials to hash out potential solutions to the recent spate of gun violence plaguing America. Finding solutions: Joe Biden speaks today at a meeting with video game industry executives, in Washington, DC. And although no earth-shattering accords were apparently reached, the two sides agreed to work more closely on the issue. ‘The entertainment community appreciates being included in the dialogue around the administration’s efforts to confront the complex challenge of gun violence in America,’ read a joint-statement issued after the meeting by, among other groups, the Directors Guild of America. ‘This industry has a long-standing commitment to provide parents the tools necessary to make the right viewing decisions for their families.' Meanwhile, Biden followed his summitt with Hollywood moguls with a similar gathering Friday with video game manufacturers. All the president's men: The president appointed Biden to head a task force to look into ways to stem gun violence in America . Fact-finding: Biden conducted a run of meetings this week with movie and video game industry reps, as well as the NRA . Beating the bushes: Biden also met with advocates for sportsmen and wildlife interest groups in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., earlier in the week . Important mission: Biden talks to the press after a meeting with Cabinet members and sportsmen's, wildlife and gun interest groups at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. this week . Representatives from the companies that make 'first-person shooter' games such as 'Call of Duty,' 'Medal of Honor' and 'Grand Theft Auto' attended the meeting, in which the veep broached the possibility of utilizing existing technology to ensure that no party other than a weapon's purchaser is able to actually fire it. President Obama has pushed gun controls to the top of his domestic agenda following last month’s school shooting. His administration is assembling proposals that would include a ban on sales of assault weapons, limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines, a crackdown on gun fairs and universal background checks for gun buyers. Few analysts expected Hollywood to make any sweeping attempts to curb violence in films. Change in the air: Obama formed the Biden-led task force following last month's shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut . Due date: Biden's task force reportedly will have recommendations for Obama on the issue as early as Tuesday . Hard stance: NRA president David Keene (pictured) said this week following a meeting with the Biden-led task force that he didn't see an assault weapon ban passing Congress . But Mr. Biden, who is leading a White House task force putting together the new legislation, won a pledge from film and television industry groups that they would work closer with Washington. America’s top gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, also met with the Vice President and told him they will attempt to block any new gun laws. Instead of making it more difficult for Americans to own guns, the group wants to post an armed security officer in every school in the country. ‘I do not think that there's going to be a ban on so-called assault weapons passed by the Congress,’ NRA president David Keene said after the meeting. The gun debate dominated the news in the US as details emerged about another school shooting that happened in Taft, California on Thursday morning. A 16-year-old student armed with a shotgun shot a teenager he claimed was bullying him and fired bullets at his terrified classmates. The confrontation could have been even worse but for a heroic teacher, Ryan Heber, who calmly told the teen to put the weapon down and give himself up. His brave move was enough of a distraction to give 28 students time to escape their classroom at Taft Union High School near Bakersfield, police said yesterday. The victim, who was hit in the shoulder, was in critical but stable condition yesterday and was expected to survive.","The vice president won a pledge from the industry to work more closely with Washington .

Peers are rebelling against government plans to restrict press freedom just days after David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband put together a deal. Labour's Lord Wilf Stevenson has tabled an amendment to exempt small not-for-profit firms while Tory Lord Lucas wants to exclude any publication or website employing under 250 journalists. His proposals, to be debated by peers on . Monday, would also stop local newspapers being classed as 'relevant . publishers' under the new code. Deal: Plans to restrict press freedom were agreed by Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg . Even Labour MP Tom Watson, who led calls for regulation, has asked for 'urgent clarification' over who it will affect. Under the proposals which follow the Leveson inquiry, all blogs would be regulated. Critic: Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown accused David Cameron of a 'strategic blunder' The moves came as the Prime Minister was accused of making a colossal 'strategic blunder' in pulling out of talks on the creation of a new press regulator. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr Cameron had simultaneously . damaged his standing with his own MPs, angered his supporters in the . newspapers, and strained relations with his Lib Dem coalition partners. In an interview with BBC Radio 4's The Week In Westminster, to be broadcast today, he said Mr Cameron managed to achieve the 'Tory nightmare' of forcing Nick Clegg to line up with Labour. He added: 'I have not seen an avoidable strategic blunder made by a British prime minister or indeed the leader of a British political party which matches that of Mr Cameron over Leveson. 'He marched his troops up to the top of the hill and then he had to march them back down again. 'In terms of strategy, this seems to me to make the Grand Old Duke of York look like a military genius.' Breaking ranks: Michael Gove with the Prime Minister. He said he was 'uncomfortable' with politicians deciding how the press should be regulated . Debate: Lord Leveson holds the report which has caused so much controversy since its publication . Mr Cameron dramatically broke off talks . with Ed Miliband and Mr Clegg on the implementation of the Leveson . report on press standards after the Labour and Lib Dem leaders insisted . the planned new regulator was backed by legislation. Demand: Labour MP Tom Watson . Within days he was forced to accede to . their central demand after it became clear that he would face defeat in . the Commons if he did not. Lord . Ashdown said Mr Cameron's 'snatch' decision would have serious . consequences for his relations with the press - who are largely opposed . to the new regulator and may boycott it - with his own party, and with . the Lib Dems. 'The consequence was that he diminished his stature within his own party who must look on this somewhat askance, 'he said. 'It was very badly judged. 'The second consequence is that he forced Nick Clegg to do the one thing that the Tories don't want him to do. He forced him to go and speak to Labour, just the very thing that is the Tory nightmare. 'He also seriously damaged his relationship with the right-wing press that supports him - who now regards him with a sulphurous regard.' Lord Ashdown added: 'I have no doubt that Mr Cameron's actions - very ill-advised, hastily grabbed at, not thought through - could have done the coalition more damage than I think any other act since the coalition was formed, had it not been for the cool head of Nick Clegg.' On Thursday, Education Secretary Michael Gove broke ranks with his Cabinet colleagues to warn he was was 'uncomfortable' about politicians deciding how the press should be regulated. He also queried why journalists are . being held over hacking when police have not acted against bankers or . those involved in the Mid Staffs hospital deaths.","Tory Lord wants to exclude publications with under 250 journalists .

"By . Claudia Connell . PUBLISHED: . 19:35 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:17 EST, 11 April 2013 . No fringe benefits: Claudia Winkleman . Every now and then a TV presenter comes along who is so irritating that, instead of just switching off, you find yourself compelled to watch. Over the years, I’ve done this with Lorraine Kelly, Natasha Kaplinsky and Davina McCall. Now there’s a new contender raising my hackles: it’s Claudia Winkleman, presenter of new BBC series The Great British Sewing Bee. Or, to be precise, it’s her haircut. Seemingly modelled on Cousin It from the Addams Family, Claudia’s trademark hairstyle is a long, heavy fringe that she can’t see out from. Watching her squint at the camera through that curtain of hair is simply excruciating. And I’m not alone in  my irritation – Twitter has been  ablaze with comments. ‘I predict by end of series someone is going to take a pair of fabric scissors to Ms Winkleman’s fringe,’ wrote one viewer. ‘Trim it! Please! Anyone?’ Another begged: ‘Claudia Winkleman – CUT YOUR FRINGE! (Does it bug the hell out of anyone else?!)’ And yet another wrote: ‘Claudia Winkleman’s fringe really annoys me.  How does that woman see past all  that hair?’ There’s even a Twitter account dedicated to Claudia’s fringe. Sewing Bee was viewed by an average audience of 2.57million on Tuesday, up from the 2.56million who watched the first episode last week. But while it is wonderful to finally have a primetime presenter who isn’t an identikit vacuous blonde, I’ve often wondered what horrors she may be seeking to hide beneath all that hair. Since 2004 the fringe has grown about half a centimetre a year. At this rate it will be down to her nostrils by the time she hits 50. Claudia, who’s 41, insists she wears her fringe long to hide the signs of ageing. ‘My forehead is covered in a 100 little lines and a fringe is the easiest way to cover them,’ she once said. In the hairdressing industry a long fringe is often called ‘poor man’s Botox’ since it covers a wrinkly forehead. But when you’re a loaded TV presenter married to a successful film producer why settle for the poor man’s version? After all, as our photos below show . (created with a bit of computer trickery), it’s hardly a flattering . style, making the most glamorous women – from the Duchess of Cambridge . to Jennifer Aniston – look like old ladies peering for the number on the . front of a bus. The Great British Annoying Bee: Claudia Winkleman, pictured with the show's judges May Martin, Patrick Grant, has irritated BBC viewers with her heavy fringe . In addition to that hairdo Claudia also likes to sport heavy eyeliner, pale lipstick and lashings of fake tan. The fringe, along with the squinting, slouching and stomping, is all part of the eccentric, bumbling act that she has perfected during her rise from late-night presenter on lesser-watched channels to mainstream host. Her presenting style is a cross between Liz Hurley’s posh ‘golly gosh, goodie gumdrops’ gushiness and Miranda Hart’s self-deprecating clumsiness. She has a habit of standing  with her toes turned in and holding her dress at the side like a  five-year-old learning to curtsey, while the slightest thing makes  her cover her mouth and collapse in fits of giggles. She regularly describes herself  as lazy, hopeless, chaotic and  disorganised and never misses an opportunity to say that TV presenting is easy peasy and that any idiot could do it. But the fact is that, as the daughter of former Fleet Street editor Eve Pollard and publisher Barry Winkleman, Claudia, a privately educated Cambridge graduate, is anything but the ditzy clot she’d have us believe. With two more episodes of the Great British Sewing Bee to go, I know I will be tuning in. Not because I care how their trouser suit challenge pans out, but because I’m just hoping that one of the contestants will grab her scissors and do what the 2.5million people at home would love to do – cut that fringe off. A reason not to smile: Posh . Wrong recipe: Mary Berry . Cher-alike: Sophie Wessex . Too dramatic: Judi Dench . Not a clever look: Mary Beard . Royal error: Kate Middleton . Severe: Holly Willoughby . U-turn on this cut: SamCam . Not worth it: Cheryl Cole . Unfriendly: Jennifer Aniston . Catwalk ready? Kate Moss . Call the salon!

After years of fruitless searching for love, retired multi-millionaire Dinshah Vimadalal decided drastic action was needed. The 69-year-old travel agency tycoon splashed out £15,000 on a full-page advertisement in The Times of India’s matrimonial section in search of a younger bride. Under the headline ‘He is a Great Guy – Wish to Marry Him?’ the bizarre feature spells out exactly what the Mumbai-born businessman is looking for in a wife. Looking for love: Dinshah Vimadalal placed this advert in the Mumbai edition of the Times of India which describes the sort of woman he wants to marry . His demands include a woman who is slim, under 40, childless and a meat eater. Despite owning his own private plane, a sprawling mansion in Mexico and a fleet of cars and motorcycles, Mr Vimadalal has struggled to find love since his wife died in a car crash three years ago. Multimillionaire: Dinshah Vimadalal has struggled to find a new partner after his wife died three years ago . He boasts about flying the Atlantic, driving his motorbikes at speeds of over 130 mph and, despite being a heavy smoker, he claims any woman older than 40 would have trouble keeping up with his all action lifestyle. ‘You must speak English and have done your basic schooling. I don't care how much money you have or don't have ... you should have a sense of adventure and the desire to live an exciting life,’ he wrote in the ad that appeared in the paper’s Mumbai edition on Sunday. ‘You should be no older than 40 and slim. And please don't be a vegetarian. If you are divorced it doesn't matter, but definitely no children. 'I am much older than 40 but am very young at heart, very young physically, very active and any girl older than 40 would have a tough time keeping up with my active lifestyle,’ he added. Mr Vimadalal returned to his native Mumbai in search of love after trawling Mexico, the U.S. and online and finding 'only idiots'. He first moved from India to Canada to work for an airline company in 1967 before later moving to Los Angeles because Vancouver was 'too cold'. It was there he met his first wife Firoza and the two started up a travel company called Magnum together. But he closed it down in 1994 after he 'had become super rich and didn’t need to work anymore', according to the Mumbai Mirror. He later spent five years building the house in Mexico which he named Palacio de Noelle after his sister. Since his ad was published on Sunday, Mr Vimadalal has 'interviewed' 20 potential brides, but 'there have been no serious possibilities.' 'Two or three were very sweet, nice people, but I place a lot of emphasis on the figure,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'I don't mind if the face is not pretty but I like a slim figure and the girls who have been very nice had big fat bottoms. I don't like that.' But as his advert suggests, he is full of self-belief and says he is determined to find that special someone. 'I won’t leave, till I find a bride. I genuinely miss having a life partner,' he told a reporter from the Mumbai Mirror.","Travel agency tycoon Dinshah Vimadalal looking for love after wife died .

"Female CNN analyst Dana Loesch said: 'I'd urinate on dead Taliban too' Four Marines also had support of comedian Bill Maher . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:29 EST, 15 January 2012 . Show of support: GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry spoke out in support of the Marines who urinated on dead Afghans . GOP presidential hopeful Rick Perry is accusing the Obama administration of 'over-the-top rhetoric' and 'disdain for the military' in its condemnation of a video that purportedly shows Marines urinating on dead bodies in Afghanistan. No one has been charged in the case, but officials in the U.S. and abroad have called for swift punishment of the four Marines. A military criminal investigation and an internal Marine Corps review are under way. The Geneva Convention forbids the desecration of the dead. Perry told CNN that he thinks the Marines involved should be reprimanded, but not pursued with criminal charges. Perry said: '18-19-year-old kids make stupid mistakes all too often and that's what's occurred here.' Although . the vast majority of people are outraged over the deplorable behaviour . of the four Marines shown . in a video circulating the internet, controversial comedian Bill Maher . and one CNN contributor have also said they support their actions. 'A dead body is just, you know a f***ing body that's dead and it just doesn't bother me,' Mr Maher said on his HBO show Real Time With Bill Maher. 'If they were real Taliban, if they were people who burned down girls' schools, and, you know, do honor rapes and throw acid in people's faces, I'm not that upset about p***ing on them,' he continued. Mr Maher's statements came after those of a conservative CNN contributor who said she would happily join the Marines. Dana Loesch made the comments on her own Missouri radio show and not on CNN. Scroll down for video . For and agasint: CNN contributor Dana Loesch (left) said that she would do the same as the soldiers, while Tim Kudo said that their behavior is unlike that of a Marine and therefore he does not consider the men Marines . She said: 'C'mon people, this is a war. 'Do I have a problem with that as a . citizen of the United States? No, I don't.' She added that she wants 'a million cool points for these guys' and would be willing to join them. 'Can someone explain to me if there is . supposed to be a scandal that someone pees on the corpse of a Taliban . fighter -- someone who as part of an organization murdered over 3,000 . Americans,' she said. 'I'd drop trou and do it too. That's me, though…Come on people this is a war.' CNN said its independent contributors often expressed their views, independent of their roles with the network. A spokesman added: 'CNN contributors . are commentators who express a wide range of viewpoints - on and off of . CNN - that often provoke strong agreement or disagreement. Their . viewpoints are their own.' Horrifying: A video posted online claims to show four Marines urinating on dead bodies . On the opposite end of the spectrum, Captain Tim Kudo, a former Marine and representative of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that the men cannot consider themselves soldiers because of their offensive actions. ‘I don't see them as Marines,’ he said . ‘I see them as people who have set . back the war effort, put their fellow Marines in danger, and who stand . in contradiction to pretty much everything the Marine Corps stands for . and America stands for. So, it's very hard to look at them and see them . as Marines in that way,’ Mr Kudo said on CBS. ‘Every Marine was absolutely shocked . by what happened. Nobody would have expected something like this, not . just from a unit, but any Marine in general. ‘These actions are completely outside the norm, and basically a few individuals who went rogue,’ he concluded. Grinning: One of the men can be heard saying: 'Have a great day, buddy' as his colleagues laugh and another jokes: 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' The four Marines in the video have been . identified and are members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp . Lejeune in North Carolina. There has been nearly universal condemnation of the soldiers since the video began circulating earlier this week. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai and Senator John McCain are among the biggest names to express their anger. Florida Representative Allen West, an ex-Army lieutenant colonel, insisted the Marines were wrong but fumed: ‘As for everyone else, unless you have been shot at by the Taliban, shut your mouth, war is hell.’ ‘All these over-emotional pundits and armchair quarterbacks need to chill,’ Mr West told the Weekly Standard of their 'self-righteous indignation'. But he said the men must face a ‘maximum punishment’. A spokeswoman for the Marines said: 'While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps' In addition he suggested they all receive a reprimand letter, issue a public apology to God, the U.S. and their fellow servicemen - and then sing ‘the full US Marine Corps Hymn without a teleprompter’. The Navy's law enforcement arm is heading the main inquiry, which is expected to weigh evidence of violations of the U.S. military legal code as well as the international laws of warfare. Separately, the Marine Corps is doing its own internal investigation. Pentagon officials said the criminal investigation would likely look into whether the Marines violated laws of war. Comments: Florida Rep. Allen West, an ex-Army lieutenant colonel, insisted the Marines were wrong . These include prohibitions against photographing or mishandling bodies and detainees. It also appeared to violate the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs conduct. Thus, some or all of the four Marines could face a military court-martial or other disciplinary action. The psychologist's advice came as U.S. officials spoke out against the footage yesterday and scrambled to maintain damage limitation and avoid another Abu Ghraib scandal. The four were members of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines out of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, reported CNN. An unidentified official said that some of the four are no longer in that battalion. The 40-second clip, which has been described a 'recruitment tool for the Taliban', shows four men in combat gear standing over the three corpses with their genitals exposed as they relieve themselves. There were no further details on their identities. The men can be heard joking 'Have a great day, buddy', 'Golden like a shower' and 'Yeahhhh!' as they groan with relief whilst urinating. It is not clear if the corpses in the video belong to civilians or insurgents engaged in combat, although the film does appear to have been shot in Afghanistan. The anonymous person who posted it included the caption: 'Scout sniper team 4 with 3rd battalion 2nd marines out of camp lejeune peeing on dead talibans.' Camp Lejeune is in North Carolina and is the largest Marine Corps Base on the East Coast of the U.S., home to 40,000 marines. The 3rd Batallion 2nd Marines consists of 800 Marines and sailors and is nicknamed the 'Betio Bastards', a reference to the island of Betio in the Tawara Atoll and the site of one of the most deadly battles with the Japanese in World War II. More recently they have served in Iraq, the Haiti earthquake of 2010 and in Afghanistan. Their motto is: 'We quell the storm, and ride the thunder!' or 'Strength and Honour'. NATOThe NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan described the acts as 'highly reprehensible and disgusting'. ISAF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jimmie Cummings said: 'The behaviour depicted in this video is reprehensible and is not in keeping with the values of U.S. Armed Forces.' Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State . She said it was 'absolutely inconsistent with the standards of behaviour that the vast majority of Marines hold themselves to.'MarinesMarines spokeswoman Kendra Hardesty said: 'While we have not yet verified the origin or authenticity of this video, the actions portrayed are not consistent with our core values and are not indicative of the character of the Marines in our Corps. 'This matter will be fully investigated and those responsible will be held accountable for their actions.'PentagonThe government body's spokesman Navy Captain John Kirby said the video was deeply troubling: 'Whoever it is, and whatever the circumstances, which we know is under investigation, it is egregious behaviour.' Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense'Those found to have engaged in such conduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent,' Mr Panetta said. He told the commander of western troops in Afghanistan to launch an investigation.Hamid Karzai, President of AfghanistanAfghan president Hamid Karzai said in a statement: 'The government of Afghanistan is deeply disturbed by a video that shows American soldiers desecrating the dead bodies of three Afghans.

Jackson’s daughter Paris, 14, is also expected give evidence about his death, and his son Prince Michael, 16, about a conversation he allegedly had with his father about the concert promoter. Lawyers acting for Paris, Prince Michael, their brother Blanket, 10, and their grandmother Katherine, 82, contend that pressure from AEG led to Jackson’s death from an overdose of surgical anaesthetic in June 2009, two weeks before his This Is It concerts were to begin at the O2 Arena in London. Compensation: Prince Jackson (left) Blanket Jackson (centre) and Paris Jackson (right), pictured in 2011, want the record payout from AEG Live for its alleged negligent hiring and supervision of Dr Conrad Murray . Hearing: Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson leaves the sentencing hearing of Dr Conrad Murray . Manslaughter: Jackson's personal doctor Dr Conrad Murray is serving a four-year prison sentence after being found guilty of manslaughter in 2011 . Friends: Michael Jackson with his chimp, Bubbles . Ruling: Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ruled in February that the Jackson family lawyers had shown enough evidence to warrant a trial . After a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a jury trial, the family’s lawyer Kevin Boyle said: ‘The truth about what happened to Michael, which AEG has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day Michael died, is finally emerging. ‘We look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light.’ The family are demanding £6.6billion for loss of future earnings by Jackson, and nearly £20billion in other damages. AEG, which denies any liability for the star’s death, says the huge figure is based on speculation and that Jackson’s career was on a downward spiral. Legal analysts say the billions being claimed are unlikely to be awarded and are a legal tactic to get publicity for the case. A senior AEG lawyer said the company would argue at the civil trial, which is expected to last two to three months, that Jackson’s addiction to prescription drugs made him responsible for his own death. The company is also likely to bring up Jackson’s ‘shopping’ for doctors to prescribe him drugs, as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges. In a TV documentary to be broadcast on Friday, AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam says: ‘I don’t know how you can’t look to Mr Jackson’s responsibility. He was a grown man. ‘Mr Jackson is a person who was known to doctor-shop. He was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else.’ He said Jackson’s 2005 child molestation trial was  relevant because it ‘resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake’. ‘We’re talking about Michael Jackson,’ adds Mr Putnam. ‘This is a man who would show up in pyjamas. ‘This is a man who would go to public events with a monkey named Bubbles.’ At Murray’s trial it emerged that the doctor was paid £100,000 a month to help Jackson get enough rest to perform at the O2. But AEG will argue that Murray was hired by Jackson, not the promoter.","Family seeking payout for promoter's alleged hiring of Dr Conrad Murray .

Verisimilitude: Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge in the classic adaptation A Muppet Christmas Carol . Ebeneezer Scrooge's sudden switch from tight-fisted miser to saintly benefactor is a realistic portrayal of humans going through life-changing experience, a forthcoming study claims. Psychologists investigating the people who have experienced profound, sudden and lasting personal change give Charles Dickens top marks for his portrayal of Scrooge's transformation. They say the fictional Scrooge would fit right in with the 14 people who took part in their study who had all hit rock bottom before they turned themselves around. 'Like our participants, Scrooge was suffering,' said Jan Skalski, former student at Brigham Young University and co-author. 'There was disintegration. There was a world that was ripe for change because of suffering going on.' Though Scrooge had money, he hit rock bottom in terms of relationships. Orphaned as a child and broken-hearted from a failed engagement, his pains intensify each Christmas Eve, the anniversary of the death of his only friend, Jacob Marley. In the story, Marley appears seven years after his death as a voice of warning. Though a ghost, the role he plays is true to life. Most study participants described the presence of a trusted other person during their experience. 'Just by their presence, a trusted friend can open up possibilities and a sense of faith in what's possible that one can't see,' Mr Skalski said. Finding people that fit the criteria of the study was a difficult task, the researchers said. To do so, they employed ads on Craigslist in Illinois and Utah. Notably, the experiences shared by participants were not recent events. On average, nine years had passed between the transformation and their interview. Nevertheless, most of them could still remember the exact time of day when the turning point occurred. 'I've often thought about this, whether these transformations are really sudden or gradual,' Mr Skalski said. 'It's like water boiling – you can look at that as a discontinuous change from not boiling to boiling, but there are certain elements going on beneath the surface that allow for the dramatic change to take place.' The Great Gonzo stands in for Charles Dickens in the muppets' own version: Psychologists say Dickens' portrayal of Scrooge's transformation was an accurate representation of how people change in real life . For an entrepreneur referred to as Kevin in the study, the preceding turmoil arose because his identity as a successful businessman crashed along with his failed ventures. Like Scrooge, he had neglected relationships and said his psyche was 'in a very dark place.' But with his breakthrough moment, life instantly took on a whole new meaning for Kevin. 'I say it's the best thing that could've happened, because my life is so much more rewarding than it once was,' he told the researchers. 'You can't put a price tag on certain ... events that I maybe missed before – certain events, and a marriage, and a family, birthdays, you know? 'Certain things that are just really fun to be a part of are more meaningful, and it is happiness – the kind that lasts. 'I know these truths have been around forever. But for me they're new.' Robin the Frog, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit and Emily Cratchit respectively: At the end of the story, Scrooge takes pity on the impoverished Cratchit family and joins them for the celebrations . Similarly, another participant's world crumbled because she based her worth on how well she did in school. Like Scrooge and Kevin, she emerged with a new focus on other people. 'Now I measure success by my – how much time I spend serving and doing those things, because those – serving and being with people – are really what bring me satisfaction now,' she said. Each of the study participants experienced overwhelming stress prior to their breakthrough. Study co-author Sam Hardy, professor of psychology at Brigham Young and an expert in human development, wonders whether hitting rock bottom is a necessary ingredient for such positive transformations. 'That led me to think, well, is there a way that people can capitalize on these mechanisms of change and initiate them themselves instead of bottoming out,' he said. 'Can you self-initiate this kind of change?' Mr Skalski sees another holiday parallel with his research in the film 'It's a Wonderful Life.' After planning to end his life, George Bailey realizes how other people depend on him in Bedford Falls, prompting his famous line, 'I want to live again!' 'Those stories are stuck within our culture,' Mr Skalski said. 'We all know deep down inside that human beings can and do change in profound and significant ways.'","Researchers give Charles Dickens' portrayal of the miser's life-changing transformation top marks .

The world's smallest known winged insect, Kikiki huna, which has a body length of only 155 micrometres . It may not be as common as the Peter Pan fairy, but this newly discovered insect is the real Tinker Bell. The fairyfly species named Tinkerbella nana was discovered in the forests of Costa Rica. The miniscule specimens were all just 250 micrometres long - or one quarter of a millimetre - and collected by sweeping the forest floor. Tinkerbella nana was collected at the La Selva Biological Station and named as the newest fairyfly species. When viewed under a microscope, Tinkerbella nana's long thin wings become visible. Each is fringed with long hair-like bristles. Mymaridae, commonly known as fairyflies, . are one of about 18 families of chalcid wasps. They are found across the world, except in Antarctica, but are so minute that they are seldomly noticed by humans. Their apparent invisibility and . delicate wings with long fringes resembling the mythical fairies have . earned them their common name. Fairyfly . species include the world's smallest known winged insect, Kikiki huna, . which has a body length of only 155 micrometres. The smallest known adult insect is also a fairyfly. The wingless male of Dicopomorpha . echmepterygis is only 130 micrometres. Fairyflies live off the eggs and larvae of other insects. The eggs are commonly laid in concealed locations, such as in plant tissues or in leaf litter or soil. They are so small and difficult to find that most of the host insects of fairyflies are unknown. The newly discovered species were found in the young forests of Costa Rica . The La Selva Biological Station has a fairy-like quality befitting of an insect names Tinkerbella . There are 1,424 known species of fairyflies spread across the world. At least five are aquatic and live in freshwater ponds and streams. One, called Caraphractus cinctus, uses its wings as paddles to swim along and remain underwater for up to 15 days. The minute insects can survive in all kinds of habitats, from deserts to rainforests. They were first categorised in 1833 by the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday. Several species have been used for pest control, as fairyflies are valued for their ability to find the eggs of their hosts. John . Huber, from Natural Resources Canada, was the lead author of A New . Genus And Species of Fairyfly, Tinkerbella Nana published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. He said: 'If something is physically possible in . living things, some individuals of at least one species, extinct or . extant, will likely have achieved it. 'So the lower size limit, by . whatever measure of size is chosen, was almost certainly already . evolved—somewhere, sometime. 'If we have not already found them, we must . surely be close to discovering the smallest insects and other . arthropods.' The Tinkerbella species were collected at the biological station owned and managed by the Organization for Tropical Studies. Little is known about the lifecycle of fairyflies. They have smaller wing surfaces and relatively long setae - or bristles - are believed to have an aerodynamic function. It may be to reduce turbulence on wings flapping at several hundred beats per second. The new fairyfly species shares a name with Peter Pan's famous friend Tinker Bell .","The specimens of Tinkerbella nana were discovered in Costa Rica .

George Osborne's 3p-a-litre rise in fuel duty planned for January could lead to 35,000 job losses, according to a study. The increase will cost the average family an extra £60 a year in petrol costs and could also see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth, the report prepared for the FairFuelUK group shows. Campaigners will present the report, which claims a fall in household spending will lead to lower national income and the loss of about 35,000 jobs, to the Treasury today. Pain at the pump: January's planned increase will cost the average family an extra £60 a year in petrol costs and could also see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth, a report prepared for FairFuelUK shows . Changing times: The rise and fall, and rise again, of petrol over the last five years . As a result of the predicted job losses and damage to growth, the tax hike would only bring in just over half the expected extra tax revenue - £800million rather than £1.5billion, it said. The study, produced by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said cutting fuel duty by 3p instead of raising it by 3p would create 70,000 new jobs and boost growth by 0.2 per cent. It added that the 6p relative difference between the two options would normally have been estimated to have lost the Treasury about £3billion. However, because of the boost to the UK economy, that loss of revenue is much less - at £1.8billion. FairFuelUK will present the report when its leaders meet Treasury officials in London this afternoon. Warning: George Osborne has been told that raising fuel duty by 3p will lead to 35,000 job losses . Speaking before the meeting, Quentin Willson, national spokesman for FairFuelUK, said he believed Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander understood the problems faced by motorists. Mr Willson said: 'We have always argued that fuel duty shouldn't be the Treasury's sacred cash cow - it should be used as a lever for growth. 'And we've proved our argument with robust financial research and modelling that shows if you raise duty you destroy jobs and damage growth. 'Danny Alexander understands this critical point and is one of the few politicians who's actually listening to the facts and engaging with our argument. 'We appreciate the Government's aspiration to reduce the deficit but know that hiking fuel duty up by 3p in January will only make things much worse.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'It is right that the Treasury engages with FairFuelUK to discuss technical issues around the impact of the cost of fuel on the economy. 'What matters to motorists and businesses is that fuel is now 10p a litre lower than under the previous Government's plans. This Government has done more to support motorists and businesses than any other.'","Increase will see a 0.1 per cent cut in economic growth, report warns .

It would appear that not all students at the Parsons New School for Design were thrilled to hear that John Galliano would soon be teaching a master class there. A Change.org petition, which has garnered over 250 signatures, asks that the New York design college refuse to accept the controversial designer, who has sparked outrage in the past for his anti-Semitic remarks. The petition states: 'Hiring someone who has made such horrific comments shows that the school values Galliano over their entire Jewish student body.' Taking a stand: Students at Parsons School of Design have launched a petition against the hiring of John Galliano (pictured) to teach a master class. The designer was arrested in 2011 for anti-Semitic remarks . The letter continues: 'It is disgraceful to hire someone who has made such inhumane comments.' The 52-year-old British designer - who was fired in 2011 from his position as head of Christian Dior after being arrested in Paris for 'racist comments' - is set to take on a three-day design workshop at the famed school. When it was announced on Sunday that he would be involved with the new course, called Show Me Emotion, The Daily News reported that students were, for the most part, thrilled. But the growing number of signatures on the Change.org petition would seem to indicate otherwise. One person wrote on the website: 'By letting him back into the broad public influence, it sends the wrong message that his anti-Semitic remarks can be swept under the rug.' Keeping his head down: Mr Galliano, who was the head designer at Christian Dior for 15 years, has kept a low profile since his arrest, attending rehab for alcoholism and doing a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta . Another stated: 'A teacher's ethics are . inherent in what they teach, and I do not feel that Galliano is the kind . of person that should be teaching young minds.' The master class will reportedly include . a three-day workshop and a final assessment carried out by Mr Galliano . and Simon Collins, Dean of Parsons. 'It is disgraceful to hire someone who has made such inhumane comments' A letter sent to students describing the new course makes reference to the designer's influence on the fashion industry. It reads: 'The planned master class with John Galliano will be a dynamic and intimate opportunity for our students to learn from an immensely talented designer.' The letter goes on to acknowledge the designer's sordid past. 'We believe that over the past two years Galliano has demonstrated a serious intent to make amends for his past actions,' it stated. Questionable ethics: The petition makes reference to Mr Galliano's disrespect towards the entire Jewish student body at Parsons, located in New York's Greenwich Village . Mr Galliano was arrested in February 2011 after a video showed him uttering anti-Semitic remarks to group of people at a Paris cafe whom he assumed were Jewish. 'I love Hitler,' the designer slurs drunkenly in the clip. 'People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f****** gassed,' he continued. Since the scandal, Mr Galliano has attended rehab for alcoholism and carried out a temporary residency at Oscar de la Renta, where he received rave reviews for his contribution to the designer's fall 2013 show.","Galliano, who was fired from his role as chief designer at Christian Dior after an anti-Semitic tirade in February 2011, is set to teach a three-day master class at the prestigious design school .

Not lovin' it: Student Sarah Finch has been handed £3,000 compensation after she was sacked for sprinkling too much chocolate on a McFlurry . It was just a small favour for a colleague but it ended up getting Sarah Finch the sack from McDonald’s. She had sprinkled a generous helping of chocolate on a 99p McFlurry dessert after her workmate said ‘make it a nice one’. However, her bosses at the fast food chain accused the 19-year-old of gross misconduct for giving away food. Yesterday Miss Finch, who had been called an ‘exceptional employee’ in appraisals, was awarded £3,000 compensation after taking her employers to an employment tribunal. After the case centred on the branch in  Carmarthen, west Wales, was settled out of court, she said in a statement: ‘I was accused of stealing food. ‘The matter was trivial, in that I provided a fellow employee, who was purchasing a dessert, a  generous sprinkling of chocolate pieces. 'There is no standard for such measures – they are always imprecise and will vary among customers. ‘My colleague had asked me “make it a nice one”. So the measure I gave erred on the side of more than – rather than less than – the mean.’ Miss Finch, of Kidwelly, had earned £180 a week when she worked at the outlet run by franchise company Lonetree for 18 months while studying. The student, who is now doing A-levels in chemistry, physics and biology, won the payout after conciliation service Acas was called in. Part of the settlement is that she will receive a good reference. Comments by her former managers had included: ‘You are very polite and friendly to all customers, even when they can be trying. Your smile is very welcoming.’ Another said: ‘You have worked hard and your positive friendly attitude has been recognised.’ Payout: The McDonalds restaurant in Carmarthen, west Wales, where Sarah Finch had worked for 18 months . 'Trivial': Sarah Finch was sacked for sprinkling too much chocolate on a 99p McFlurry . But Ron Mounsey, managing director of Lonetree, had backed the decision to sack Miss Finch. At the time, he wrote to her mother Tessa saying: ‘Your daughter has admitted giving away food without receiving payment. This is classed as gross misconduct as per my Employee Handbook, the consequence is dismissal. ‘You may feel it is trivial, but with 740 employees in my business, if my team were to overlook such incidents, then it would quickly become a free-for-all. ‘There are notices in every one of my staff rooms reminding employees of this policy as well as the Employee Handbook.’ Mrs Finch, an accountant, said at the time of her daughter’s dismissal that the accusation of theft was ‘a terrible stain on her character’. A Lonetree spokesman said: ‘This has been resolved. No admission of liability was made.’","Student Sarah Finch was fired by McDonald's in Carmarthen, West Wales .

One in four patients said doctors talk over them as if they aren't there, according to a new NHS survey . The results of the NHS’s annual survey of hospital patients showed care had improved compared to last year. But campaigners were still disappointed in the findings, considering the efforts made to drive up standards. More than 64,500 patients who had spent at least one night in hospital took part in the survey, which covered various aspects of their care. The results show that 24 per cent felt doctors sometimes talked over them as if they didn’t exist. Twenty per cent didn’t always have trust and confidence in them and 33 per cent didn’t always understand the answers to their questions. Another 13 per cent of patients thought hospital food was poor while 21 per cent said they weren’t always offered enough choice of meals. Almost one in ten was put in a mixed-sex ward when they were first admitted and 14 per cent were made to share bathrooms or toilets with the opposite sex. One in five was not always treated with respect and dignity and 5 per cent had a poor overall experience of care. Although the survey found patient care had improved overall, campaigners said the survey findings were still disappointing . Michelle Mitchell, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘Whilst it is encouraging that there have been small improvements on in-patient relationships with nurses and doctors and that most patients felt they were treated with  dignity and respect, it is deeply disappointing that there has been no significant improvement  since 2011. Do you understand what your doctor tells you? ‘Dignity needs to be a priority for all those responsible for  delivering care and should be a fundamental staple in every  care setting. ‘Patients need to be involved more, asked what they think of the quality of care and if there is a problem then people must know how to complain. ‘To have an NHS that is truly patient-centred and committed to providing dignified care, there needs to be a real change in the caring relationship.’ But Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer for NHS England, the new body in charge of hospitals and GP services, said the findings were broadly positive. ‘The NHS must get it right every time for every patient. This survey is, on the whole, encouraging and demonstrates progress in key areas. ‘However, there remains too much variation in the quality of care provided and hospitals need to look closely at what they need to do to improve.’","Annual NHS survey shows care has improved overall since last year .

A 15-year-old boy who knocked down and killed a pedestrian while driving a stolen Range Rover at 70mph in a 30mph zone was locked up for five years today. Douglas Scott Robertson, 27, was dragged more than 100 yards under the powerful vehicle after teenage driver Charlie Tyers lost control in snow. The car had earlier been taken from a house party in Stockton, Teesside, by the teenage defendant. After it had been spotted by a police car, the teenager sped away before hitting Mr Robertson. Locked up: Charlie Tyers, 15, left, knocked down and killed pedestrian Douglas Robertson, right, while driving a stolen Range Rover at 70mph in a 30mph zone . The car smashed into a lamppost so hard the top section of the light ended in a tree 50ft away, Teesside Crown Court heard. Tyers, of Maltby, Middlesbrough, sobbed uncontrollably when CCTV of the moments leading up to the collision and the loud bang that followed were shown in court. Judge John Walford said the victim was a much-loved son, brother and friend whose loss had ruined the lives of his family. 'You took this Range Rover which belonged to someone else,' the judge told Tyers. 'Why you took it has not been explained. 'You . must have taken it for pure devilment, arrogantly believing you could . drive it appropriately when you neither had the experience or the . qualifications to do so, or not caring what might happen with you behind . the wheel. 'The road conditions were treacherous and while you drove it, the car was damaged.' Tragic: Mr Robertson was walking to his local club in Stokesley High Street, pictured, on a snowy Saturday afternoon in January when he was hit by the vehicle . Mr Robertson was walking to his local club in Stokesley’s High Street on a snowy Saturday afternoon in January when he was mown down. Police were looking for the Range Rover after they received reports earlier in the day about it being driven badly. An officer spotted the vehicle ahead and once it had gone round a corner, he put on his siren and lights, which the defence claimed caused the driver to speed away. David Bradshaw, prosecuting, said: 'At the time the vehicle collided with the deceased he was walking along a footpath carrying an umbrella, minding his own business, making his way towards a social club. 'He was dragged 340ft over some waste ground until the vehicle went through a small wall and tree and hit the side of the working men’s club.' Mr Robertson died at the scene. Tyers, over 6ft tall and well-built, fled from police and asked for help at a nearby house, telling the occupants that men were chasing him, Mr Bradshaw said. The car had been taken from a house party in Stockton, Teesside, in the early hours by the teenage defendant. After he was arrested, Tyers told police his life was over and his family would disown him. 'I have killed somebody’s baby,' he said. 'Oh please, Jesus, no, not this.' Witnesses spotted the driver showing off in the Range Rover in the hours before the crash, sounding the horn to children he knew. He also approached two people in a layby and told them he did not know how to fill the car with fuel, and they tried to warn him that a front tyre was rubbing on the wheel arch. He later got fuel from a petrol station and sped off without paying. The judge said: 'The crash occurred when you were driving at a grossly excessive speed, some 70mph in a 30mph limit, in an attempt to evade the police with pedestrians on the pavement and other vehicles on the road. 'The factors combined make what happened almost inevitable.' It was a 'ghastly irony' that in sentencing the judge had to consider the young defendant’s welfare 'when you had so little regard for the welfare of others that morning'. Tyers, described in a pre-sentence report as assertive and self-confident, was given credit for his remorse and early guilty plea to death by dangerous driving.  He has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder since the crash. The boy was ordered to serve five years detention and was disqualified from applying for a driving licence for five years. Sam Hanlon, 23, from Wingate, County Durham, was a passenger in the Range Rover when it crashed. He pleaded guilty previously to aggravated vehicle taking where a death occurred and was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work. The court heard he only got in the Range Rover five to 10 minutes before the crash. The judge lifted a reporting restriction naming Tyers despite an argument from Peter Makepeace, defending, that it would harm his rehabilitation. The judge said: 'What tips the balance in this case is the significance of this devastating incident in a small community such as Stokesley. 'While I have had due regard to the interests of this young defendant, the nature of the offence and its surrounding circumstances are such to make it in the public interest that full reporting take place.'","Douglas Scott Robertson, 27, was hit by vehicle driven by Charlie Tyers .

A school girl suffers from a rare sleeping disorder, which means she snoozes for up to 44 days at a time. Although it's known as sleeping beauty syndrome, Lois Woods' life is no fairytale as she is also affected by 'zombie-like' trances when she attack herself and her family. When the teenager is suffering an episode she bashes her head against walls, attacks her young brother and gorges on junk food in nighttime fridge raids. She also suffers Jekyll and Hyde-like . personality changes turning her into everything from a babbling toddler . to appearing like a violent drunk. Despite appearing awake Lois is left with no memory of her bizarre behaviour. Her GP believes the A* student, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, suffers from Kleine-Levin Syndrome - a rare and complex neurological disorder which affects just 65 people in the UK. Her mother, Setta Woods, said: 'People call KLS sleeping beauty syndrome, but it's been no fairytale. 'We call her Little Lois when she's in episode, she is unpleasant and it's like she has severe behavioural problems. 'She goes from being like a zombie and ignoring me or huffing and puffing, to like a two-year-old, bouncing off the walls. 'Lois is now afraid to go to sleep in case she doesn't wake up again. It's been soul destroying to watch because she once had everything going for her.' The disorder struck at 14 when Lois came home from school one day and passed out face-down on the sofa. The teenager finds she is scared to go to sleep as she doesn't know when she will wake up . Mrs Woods found her son Luke, eight, . jumping on Lois and laughing. They managed to rouse her briefly but she . then fell back into a deep sleep. Lois said: 'I remember walking into the living room and I was watching TV. The next thing I knew I was awake and the programme I was watching had finished hours ago. It felt like I'd only been asleep for half an hour.' The teenager entered a comatose state for almost two months, quickly falling back to sleep after she was woken to eat and drink. Lois, who was an A* pupil and had always dreamed of playing basketball professionally, saw both her studies and sport suffer as she started to regularly nod off during the day. Even more alarmingly, her behaviour began to change. Mrs Woods' said: 'I got to school to pick Lois up one day and they brought her out in a wheelchair. She had her hands over her eyes like a mask and was shouting ""I'm Batman, I'm Batman!"" When she eventually woke up, she couldn't even remember being at school.' Lois was taken to hospital after she fell asleep unexpectedly while on the stairs. Even doctors couldn't wake her and were baffled by her behaviour. Lois has no memory of her strange behaviour after the episode . Lois had hoped to become a professional basketball player but now can fall asleep on the court . Doctors thought she might be epileptic but after running tests, could find nothing medically wrong with Lois so sent her home. After seeing a paediatric consultant who was also stumped by Lois' unusual sleeping patterns and personality changes, Lois and her mother researched KLS. Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence, and sometimes begins after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day. Episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients return to normal between episodes, however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition. Lois is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. 70% of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the sleeping disorder, and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones. Research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks. In order to be officially diagnosed with KLS, doctors must exclude all other possibilities. Lois said: 'Most doctors haven't even heard of KLS. To an outsider, it could look like I'm skiving or insane. 'They thought I could be narcoleptic, schizophrenic or be suffering from chronic fatigue. But I had seen a documentary about KLS and both me and my mum knew that's what it was.' KLS usually strikes in adolescence and the main symptoms are long and disturbed sleep, altered behaviour and excessive appetite. The cause of KLS is unknown but it can often be triggered by an infection or head injury. Lois now needs full-time care as when she is in episode, she can be a danger to herself and others. She said: 'I've woken up before and my hands have been covered in blood and my knuckles have been all bruised. 'When I looked in the mirror I had this big bruise on my forehead! My mum said I'd been punching a wall over and over again and smashing my head against a cupboard. 'The weirdest thing I've ever done in episode is get my ears pierced and dye my hair red. When I woke up and mum told me that, I thought she was joking. 'I do things in my sleep that I would never do if I was awake. I get so aggressive and will hurt my little brother. I woke up once and he had a bruise the size of an orange. I hate myself for it.' Lois' KLS has meant she has missed most of her vital GCSE lessons at school and has gone from expecting 12 GCSEs to just four. Lois Wood with her concerned mother Setta: During 'trances' Lois can bash her head against the wall and gorge on junk food . Fast asleep: Lois Wood gets some attention from a cat during a sleeping episode in her garden . She said: 'I sat my history GCSE when I was in episode, but I managed to get a C!

Despite its confined size the pedal-powered mini mobile home still has room to squeeze in four seats, a stove, a sink, a table and a bed. Dubbed the 'cramper-van', the invention by custom car fanatic Andy Saunders, is a mash-up of an old Bedford Bambi van and a Butlins-style pedal cart. Scroll down for video . Cramped van: Andy Saunders squeezes himself into the front of his tiny four foot by four foot mobile home . Compact space: The van has a sink plumbed in and a gas hob - as well as a very small table. The tiny vehicle cost £1,000 to build . It may come with all the mod cons, but for campers more used to the wide open spaces of the great outdoors its bijou living area could take some getting used to. A clever use of space means that inside the minuscule motor's cabin seats for four people, although one of the seats folds down over the two-ring hob and sink. The roof space extends out by 2ft 6ins, providing enough room for a small bed. The only other thing that sets it aside . from its bigger brothers is its lack of an engine, instead relying on . pedal power to pull it along. It is officially classed as a bicycle so doesn't have to be registered to go out on the roads - although it must be fitted with lights if it is going out after dark. Uphill battle: Andy said the cramper van is extremely hard work to pedal down the road . Tiny vehicle: Andy Saunders and work colleague Martin Ford ride in the van. It cost £1,000 to build and doesn't have to be registered to go on the roads because it is officially a bicycle . The 'cramper-van' was dreamed up by Andy who chopped 6ft off the front of a Bedford campervan and attached it to the pedal cart before refitting the interior. It took around two weeks to make and cost him £1,000 in materials. Andy, owner of Kampers and Kars in Poole, Dorset, said: 'We think our mini camper is the smallest camper in the world. I certainly don't know of anything else smaller. 'The Bedford Bambi was the smallest camper van ever made, and we've shaved about 6ft off that. If there was anything smaller I'd be very surprised.' Andy, 50, has made a name for himself creating weird and wonderful custom cars including a Picasso-inspired multi-coloured Citroen 2CV, a mini Mini and 21-inch tall car. Andy added: 'The mini camper really wasn't planned - it was just one of those things that popped into my head, which is how the best ideas come about. Tea for two: The cosy space inside the vehicle - which doesn't leave a lot of leg room as the whole vehicle is just 4ft by 4ft . Compact: Andy (front) and Martin squeeze into the back of their tiny mobile home which is far smaller than the one that can be seen in the background (left) Fold down: The vehicle has four seats. The back two seats fold down over the hob and sink to make the best use of the limited space . 'One of my salesmen was talking about a pedal bike and I just thought why not combine it with a camper van. 'The idea evolved at the speed of light - within 15 minutes we had sourced a pedal bike and a camper van. 'We had this old scrap Bedford Bambi camper that had been sitting around for about four years which was perfect for the camper section. 'It can be pedalled but you do have to have legs like Arnold Schwarzenegger. No wing mirrors: Andy looks out the back of his pedal mobile home. He chopped 6ft off the front of a Bedford Bambi campervan and attached it to a Butlins pedal cart before fitting the bespoke interior . 'You certainly wouldn't want to go camping in it around too many hills. 'We wanted the camper to be finished to the highest quality. 'Inside it's fully insulated and upholstered, it has a twin hob to cook on, a sink to wash up in. 'It has four seats although you have to make sure you're finished cooking because one of those seats is on the hob. 'It's got a big side window and even a small bed - you have to tuck up a bit but it's perfect for a power nap. 'It is a little cramped but it's all good fun - everyone who sees it says ""wow"".'","Vehicle is made from an old Bedford Bambi van and a Butlins-style bicycle .

Incident: Safaa Pate, 31, outside London's High Court, where she is suing Coast for £1m claiming she suffered crippling back injuries at work whilst picking up a dropped earring . A FASHION shop manager who says she suffered crippling back injuries while bending down to pick up an earring at work is claiming more than £1million in damages. Safaa Pate, 31, is suing her employers saying she was left in ‘unbearable pain’ after trying to retrieve the earring, which had fallen under a display unit. She has had to undergo a spinal fusion operation for her ‘irreparable’ back injuries and now has no feeling in her left leg and foot. She also says she has not been able to work since. The accident happened when she tried to move the display unit to reach the earring while she was running a clothes and accessories concession at a branch of the House of Fraser department store. She is suing Coast Fashions, the owner of the concession, for more than £1million, blaming breaches of health and safety regulations for her career-destroying back problems. But the company denies any wrongdoing, saying Miss Pate ‘should have used a stick’ to retrieve the dropped earring and arguing that she was ‘the author of her own misfortune’. In a writ lodged at the High Court in London, her barrister, Caroline McColgan, described how Miss Pate, of Bray in Berkshire, was injured at the store in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on January 9, 2009. ‘She was performing a stock-take,’ she said. ‘As she was inventorying some jewellery, she dropped an earring onto the floor. It fell underneath one of the gondolas [display units]. ‘She bent down and put her hand under the gondola to retrieve the earring. However, it had landed too far in from the edge and she was unable to reach it without moving the gondola. As she did so she heard a clicking noise and felt her back give way. ‘She experienced increasing levels of pain over the course of the day. When it became unbearable she was compelled to leave work and attend hospital for treatment.’ The barrister claims that Miss Pate’s employers were guilty of breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992, and had ‘failed to take reasonable steps to provide her with a safe system of work’. In its defence to the action, Coast . admits it ‘owed her a duty of care as her employer at the time’ but . denies responsibility for any harm she suffered. Lawyers for the company, which is . based in Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, said: ‘Miss Pate’s work was . light work. She had to move clothes … but she was not required to lift . or carry anything of substance. ‘It was not her responsibility nor . part of her job to move the stands and gondolas. Miss Pate alleges she . suffered injury when reaching for an earring which she had dropped on to . the floor. It is denied it was sensible or reasonable or other than a . breach of her own duty to take care to try to push or move the gondola . to reach the earring. Court: Ms Pate says she hurt her back at this House of Fraser store in High Wycombe, and blames an alleged health and safety breach . ‘If she proves the earring fell under . the gondola, then she should have used a stick or other method of . reaching under the gondola to pull the earring out, or she should have . left it there until help was provided. ‘She should not have tried to move . the gondola. She acted unreasonably, in breach of her manual handling . training and was the author of her own misfortune.’ The case is due to come to trial in . November. After a preliminary hearing yesterday, Coast’s barrister, . Caroline Allen, said Miss Pate was making a ‘large damages claim’ in . excess of £1million. Coast prides itself on its ‘elegant clothing for young women and ladies’. Its range includes both formal and . semi-formal clothing and its clothes are sold in House of Fraser and . Debenhams. In 2011 a review called for a ‘rebalancing’ of safety laws . and a dramatic reduction in the number of rules in the workplace. According to an estimate by the . Institute of Occupational Safety and Health at the time, worker . accidents cost businesses almost £8billion a year in compensation. The government-commissioned study, . led by Professor Ragnar Lofstedt, of King’s College London, said the . safety rules were a financial burden on companies. Some employees were exploiting the law to sue their bosses for incidents caused by their own carelessness. The reforms on personal . responsibility were backed by the British Safety Council, which said . that in some cases employers were being unfairly held liable for the . ‘negligence’ of their staff. The Government supported the findings of the review and is planning to implement them.","Safaa Pate, 31, has handed High Court writ to clothing brand Coast .

Gay marriage laws are expected to clear their latest hurdle in the Commons tonight, after Labour agreed to back it in a series of votes. David Cameron has faced down his backbenchers to press ahead with his plan for same-sex weddings, despite warnings the party is haemorrhaging grassroots support. It came after former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft warned the party risks being plunged into a 'spiral of irrelevance'. David Cameron is facing a Commons defeat tonight on gay marriage that could cost the Exchequer £4billion . The Prime Minister had been facing a Commons defeat tonight on gay marriage, amid warnings rebel demands to allow heterosexual couples to have civil partnerships could cost the Exchequer £4billion. Mr Cameron is also under growing pressure after backing party co-chairman Lord . Feldman against claims he called Eurosceptic activists 'mad, swivel-eyed . loons'. Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory party treasurer called for an end to the the rows over Europe, gay marriage and 'loongate'. Writing on the ConservativeHome website, the Tory peer said: 'This sort of thing - the habit of distracting ourselves from what matters - has got to stop. 'The Conservatives were elected, albeit in insufficient numbers, to do a job. We hope to be elected in two years' time in rather greater numbers to implement a Tory manifesto in full. 'But we don't look as if either of those things is our priority. We need to pull ourselves out of what threatens to become a spiral of irrelevance.' At least 100 Tory MPs are expected to back an amendment allowing . heterosexual couples to have civil partnerships too. But today Labour announced it would not back the rebels, and tabled their own amendment to allow for a public consultation on opposite-sex civil partnerships. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour was offering to save the bill from being 'sucked into the vortex of Tory infighting'. 'Labour votes have got this bill through so far and Labour votes will get this through the next couple of days, when the Government is deeply divided and fighting itself,' Ms Cooper told BBC Radio 4's World at One. 'We are trying to find a sensible way through which allows us to make that progress and make sure this bill is not derailed either by the Government or by Tory backbenchers.' During early debate in the Commons today, Tory MP Edward Leigh said: 'It seems to many of us if you dare to disagree with the new orthodoxy that gay marriage is the best thing since sliced bread, you are somehow breaking a new social taboo, you are doing something in your workplace, particularly in the public sector, that you should not be doing.' He called for people who disagree with gay marriage to be given protection under the Equality Act 2010. Sources . said the Prime Minister had been ‘very concerned’ about losing the vote, which . he believes would undermine the institution of marriage. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'The Equal Marriage Bill is about the extension of marriage. 'There have been concerns and issues raised in the House with regard to civil partnerships and that is why the Government has proposed a formal review of civil partnerships. 'The Prime Minister is a big believer in marriage and that is why he thinks gay people should be able to get married.' Culture Secretary Maria Miller attempted to head off the vote last week by offering to hold a review of civil partnerships five years after gay marriage has been legalised . Asked whether the Bill will be . dropped if the 'wrecking' amendment is passed this evening, the . spokesman said: 'The Government has its legislative agenda and it is . getting on with it.' Grassroots . Tories warned of a ‘crisis of conservatism’, saying the Prime Minister . was badly out of touch with the party membership over gay marriage. Opening . up civil partnerships to all would be a far bigger move than gay . marriage itself, which affects only relatively small numbers. The . amendment could delay implementation of the entire legislative package . for two years – meaning the first gay weddings would be delayed until . after the next election. It . would also open up the tax advantages of civil partnerships to . 2.8million cohabiting couples – with costly implications for a number of . government departments. Increased spouse’s rights . to public sector pensions alone could land the taxpayer with a bill of . £3-£4billion. Inheritance tax receipts could be significantly reduced. Rebel Tory MPs believe the Treasury could even demand the entire the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is pulled. ‘There is a sense we could be in trouble on this,’ said a Government source last night. MPs will have a free vote on the issue today and Labour indicated the entire Shadow Cabinet and most MPs are expected to back extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples as a matter of principle. Lib Dem policy has long called for equality on civil partnerships and sources said many of the party’s MPs will back the amendment. Culture Secretary Maria Miller attempted to head off the vote last week by offering to hold a review of civil partnerships five years after gay marriage has been legalised. But supporters of the change say this does not go far enough. Today Mrs Miller warned rebels against any action which would delay the introduction of gay marriage. 'I think it would make a fundamental difference to the passage of the bill because what the amendment is trying to import in a very complicated concept which actually took more than 200 clauses to explain in the original civil partnership bill to a bill which is all about extending marriage,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It introduces complexity which would not only I believe delay the passage of the bill through Parliament but it would also put forward a number of quite fundamental policy issues which need considerable thought and consultation, let alone any delays around implementation. 'I want to be seeing the marriages undertaken under this new bill as early as next summer.' Opening up civil partnerships to all would be a far bigger move than gay marriage itself, which affects only relatively small numbers . Labour last night said ministers had . provided no evidence to justify their claims that the Bill will be . delayed or that the amendment will cost lots of money. A . party source said: ‘It would be outrageous of the Government to use . this issue as a reason to delay or kill the Bill. Is that what is going . on?’ More than 150 Tory . MPs are expected to defy the Prime Minister on a separate amendment, . which would mean that teachers would be exempt from prosecution if they . taught gay marriage was wrong, and would provide immunity for registrars . who refused to conduct gay ceremonies. But the amendment is not supported by the Labour and Lib Dem leadership and is likely to be rejected. Senior . Tory activists warned yesterday that gay marriage was making it . ‘virtually impossible’ for the party to win the next election. In a . letter to the Prime Minister, more than 30 present and former local . party chairmen warned Mr Cameron’s backing for a change in the law had . led to voters switching their support to UKIP. The letter to Mr Cameron was organised by the Grassroots Conservative group, whose chairman, Bob Woollard, said: ‘This dilution and unravelling of marriage has demotivated many ordinary loyal Conservative Party members and has undermined their years of hard work for something they believed in. It makes winning the next election virtually impossible.’ Hundreds of Muslim leaders have also attacked the gay marriage plans in an open letter to Mr Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg. More than 500 community leaders and imams signed the letter which stated ‘marriage is a sacred contract between a man and a woman that cannot be redefined’.","100 Tory MPs want heterosexual .

Doctors demanded last night that a new health helpline due to be introduced across most of England within days should be suspended, warning that lives could be at risk. The British Medical Association wrote to the head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, urging him to delay Monday’s full national roll-out of the 111 service. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s GP Committee, said: ‘We cannot sacrifice patient safety to meet a political deadline.’ Fears: The new 111 health helpline number will be rolled out nationwide from Monday but the BMA has written to the head of the NHS and asked him to suspend the service due to fears it will put patient safety at risk . Earlier this week the Mail reported fears about the state of the service, but by last night doctors and health unions were convinced it would be a ‘chaotic mess’. Some patients using limited 111 pilot schemes are already waiting several hours for urgent medical advice, while others have been told to phone back the following day because there is no one available to talk to them. A parent of a sick baby was told by a 111 worker: ‘I don’t know what to do.’ From Monday, the 111 line will replace NHS Direct and GP out-of-hours numbers across most of England. Concerns: The BMA has warned NHS chief executive David Nicholson that the service is being 'run on the cheap' with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses . Patients who are not ill enough to need an ambulance will be told to ring the free number for medical advice round the clock. But pilot schemes have thrown up a string of problems ranging from computer crashes to ambulances being sent out needlessly. Dr Buckman said: ‘There have been . widespread reports of patients being unable to get through to an . operator or waiting hours before getting a call back with the health . information they have requested. In . some areas, such as Greater Manchester, NHS 111 effectively crashed . because it was unable to cope with the number of calls it was receiving. ‘The . chaotic mess now afflicting NHS 111 is not only placing strain on other . already overstretched parts of the NHS, such as the ambulance service, . but is potentially placing patients at risk. ‘If someone calls NHS 111 they need immediate, sound advice and not be faced with any form of delay. When . patients rang the number in Greater Manchester this week they were . played an automated message which told them to ring back the following . day ‘‘when lines are less busy’’.’ In . Wiltshire, where the line was introduced earlier this month, call . handlers have been sending ambulances to people with hiccups, sore . throats and earache. There are concerns that calls are . being handled by staff with just ten days training who read out a series . of set questions from their computer. Mess: Fears about the state of the service in trial areas have been reported, with some people kept waiting for hours. Doctors and health unions were convinced it would be a 'chaotic mess' Dr John Hughes, a GP in Crumpsall, near Manchester, said: ‘I am extremely worried. Within less than 11 hours the service was in meltdown. Calls weren’t being answered for hours, patients were having to ring up 999 ambulances. ‘These are non-clinically trained people. They work their way through a computer system which directs them to the next question to ask. ‘This is an extremely slow system and in some areas the computers weren’t even working and they had to do it on paper. Political decision: Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's GP committee, warned that patient safety should not be sacrificed to 'meet a political deadline' ‘It really can’t go live on Monday because patients’ lives will be at risk. I have had reports of a 90-year-old lady having to wait more than an hour and a half for an urgent call.’ NHS Direct was launched in 1998 to provide medical advice round the clock in an attempt to reduce the number of patients needlessly turning up in A&E. On the whole it is deemed to have been a success although it has occasionally been overstretched during flu and norovirus outbreaks. Now NHS bosses believe that dismantling it and merging it with out-of-hours telephone services for GP surgeries will make it easier for patients to get medical help particularly at evenings and weekends. They will be put through to a call . centre worker who will decide if they need to go to A&E, a GP . clinic, a chemist or can get by with over-the-phone advice. The . operator can potentially send out an ambulance, put someone straight . through to a nurse, book an out-of-hours GP appointment, or direct the . caller to a pharmacist or dentist. In . some areas of the country the new service will be run by private firms . while in others it will be overseen by NHS ambulance services. But . the BMA has also warned that the service is being ‘run on the cheap’ with far higher proportions of untrained workers than nurses. While . nurses represented around 36 per cent of staff at NHS Direct, they only . comprise around 17 per cent of the NHS 111 workforce. The . union Unison claims that 400 nurses who worked for NHS Direct have been . made redundant as there were not enough 111 jobs available. Replacement: The new 111 service replaces NHS Direct, with patients who are not ill enough to need an ambulance told to ring for medical advice . Untrained: There are concerns that calls are being handled by staff with just ten days training who read out a series of set questions from their computer . Some regions are struggling to set up the new service and the NHS Direct 0845 4647 service will continue to be available to callers in these areas. A spokesman for NHS England, the new body in charge of the health service, said: ‘The service has great potential to be a fast, efficient, all-round service that ensures patients get the right care for their needs. ‘This is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe, high quality service that patients and the public can trust.’","BMA wrote to NHS head urging him to delay full roll-out of 111 service .

The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings for south east Scotland and higher ground through central parts of England, where heavy rain is expected to fall today . It might have been reasonable to believe spring was finally here with some of the temperatures the country has been enjoying recently. But parts of the country have had to brace themselves today after forecasters predicted heavy showers, flash flooding and huge hailstones. Heavy rainfall started in parts of Scotland this afternoon, according to the Meteogroup, at times reaching a rate of 50mm of rainfall an hour in areas around Dundee. The showers were moving in a south easterly direction. Forecasters have said the unstable weather was because of the warm humid air in Scotland - Glasgow has so far seen the highest temperature in Britain after the mercury hit 22C earlier today. Meteogroup forecaster Claire Austin said: 'It only really kicked off in the last couple of hours. 'At 2pm we started seeing some of the showers developing and they have started getting properly heavier from about 3pm.' The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for south east Scotland and across the higher ground through the central part of England, where heavy rain was expected to fall today. There has been some good news however, as sunshine is expected for most of the country during parts of the upcoming week, while temperatures were also expected to hit 19C elsewhere today. Helen Chivers, forecaster for the Met Office, said: 'We are expecting some very heavy showers to break out through this afternoon, mostly up the spine of the Pennines, so the higher ground in the central parts of the country, and particularly in south east Scotland. 'We have actually got severe weather warnings out for both of those areas. 'There's an amber warning out for the Scottish regions, where we are expecting the heaviest of the weather to be. 'We could find some flash flooding in areas and large hail stones which could make travelling conditions very difficult.' Ms Chivers said between 20 and 30ml of rain could fall in the space of one hour. She said hail was most likely to fall in Scotland while thunderstorms and heavy winds were likely to hit central parts of England. The showers will dry up this evening, meaning most of the country will be dry going into tomorrow. Ms Chivers said: 'Tomorrow is a bit of a cloudy start but the clouds will break up. While showers are expected in parts of the country today, sunshine could break out later on in the week . Heavy rain has fallen across parts of Scotland including Dundee this afternoon, at times reaching a rate of up to 5mm/hour . 'We . can expect a few showers to break out in the afternooon, not as many as . today, and once again I think they will be over high ground. 'But for most of us it should be a fine day after a rather cloudy start and we should get temperatures in the mid-teens.' And while Wednesday should not be too . bad either, there is the possibility of one or two showers. Ms Chivers . said there was also a possibility of some mountain snow over the Scottish highlands. She said: 'But again, Wednesday looks like being a bright day with some sunshine breaking through. 'On . Thursday and Friday we get a bit of an east-west split.

A diabetic driver has been jailed after he lost control of his car and impaled a pedestrian on railings when his blood sugar level plummeted while he was at the wheel. Darren Lock, 41, from Rushden, had already struck a lamppost and was driving with his front bumper dragging along the road when he hit William Dawkins, 46, in Bedford last June. Lock gave false information to a nurse about his blood sugar levels on the morning of the collision, which left Mr Dawkins in intensive care suffering a punctured lung, broken limbs and broken vertebrae in his neck, a court heard today. Jailed: Diabetic Darren Lock had drifted into a state of automatism when he hit pedestrian William Dawkins in Bromham Road, Bedford (pictured), last June . A judge said the pedestrian was 'very lucky to be alive' after the incident. Mr Dawkins spent a week in intensive care where he was treated for two broken vertebrae in his neck, a punctured lung, a burst artery in his left arm, a broken left arm and broken leg. IT Consultant Lock from Rushden, was jailed for six months and banned from driving for three years, with an order that he must take an extended retest, after admitting to dangerous driving at Luton Crown Court today. His lawyer Mark Nicholls said the married father of two had been suffering from 'hypoglycemic automatism' when he struck Mr Dawkins at around half past ten at night on June 28 last year. He said: 'He drifted into hypoglycemia without being aware of it. He is truly sorry. If he could swap places he would do so in an instant. He has given up his licence and expresses great remorse.' Prosecutor Kevin Barry said that Lock had seen a nurse that morning about his type one diabetes and had given her false information about his blood sugar levels. He then caught the train to work in London, returning to Bedford at around 10pm. Despite knowing his blood sugar levels were low, Lock drove his maroon VW Passatt out into Ashburnham Road where he hit a lamppost at the zebra crossing. Then he drove off and clipped the wing mirror of a Peugeot with his front bumper dragging along the road. 'Deeply remorseful': Lock, 41, from Rushden, was jailed for six months after admitting dangerous driving at Luton Crown Court today . 'As the car went into Bromham Road he caused another driver to swerve. Drivers in the UK are required to inform the DVLA if they have a 'notifiable' medical condition or disability. The list of notifiable conditions includes some forms of diabetes, along with epilepsy, strokes and other neurological conditions, mental health problems, physical disabilities and visual impairments. Government guidelines state that licence-holders must inform the DVLA if they have diabetes that is treated by insulin. Car and motorcycle licence-holders with diabetes that is treated by tablets or non-insulin injections are not required to let the DVLA know, but bus, car and lorry driver licence-holders must flag up their condition. Drivers are also required to let the DVLA know if they develop a new condition, or if an existing condition gets worse. The Agency may then contact the driver's doctor before making a decision on whether they must surrender their licence, exchange it for a shorter period licence subject to reviews, or have their vehicle specially adapted in light of their condition. Then he collided with Mr Dawkins, sending him into the railings on the pavement. 'He was detached from the railings and spent a week in intensive care,' said Mr Barry. Lock's blood sugar level was tested and found to be 1.8, which is very low. He had a zero reading for alcohol. The prosecutor said that as a type 1 diabetic Lock should have informed the DVLA of his condition but they had no records. Mr Nicholls said Lock had 'drifted into hypoglycemia without being aware of it'. He said he had controlled his diabetes for the past 17 years and worked as an IT professional earning over £40,000 a year. Lock had handed back his licence and does not intend to apply again, he said. He had one previous conviction from May 1999 when he failed to stop after an accident on his way to his wedding. Jailing him, Judge Richard Foster said: 'You knew that morning that your blood sugar level was not as it should be. You should have checked your blood sugar levels before you drove. You knew full well the dangers of what you did. 'You came out of Bedford station in a state of automatism. Another driver had a narrow escape and Mr Dawkins is very lucky to be alive.' The court was told that Mr Dawkins' claim for compensation is being dealt with by Lock's insurance company.","Darren Lock, 41, jailed for six months today for dangerous driving .

Jailed: Cagefighter Vincent Graham, 33, who ran a cocaine-dealing gang, has been ordered to repay £700,000 . A cagefighter who quit the ring to lead a cocaine-dealing gang after losing his leg in a road accident has been ordered to pay back £700,000 - or face more time behind bars. Father-of-ten Vincent Graham, 33, lived a lavish lifestyle and drove a fleet of sports cars as the leader of an organisation which smuggled drugs into Britain from South Africa. The playboy, nicknamed 'Big Vin', posed semi-naked on online dating sites and had been seeing a series of women who had been dazzled by his lavish lifestyle. But his drug dealing was exposed after he was arrested and questioned over an alleged kidnap plot in the Netherlands. Dutch police released him without charge but they tipped off their British counterparts and told them to raid a series of properties connected to Graham amid suspicions they were being used to deal Class A drugs. Officers discovered 25 kilograms of benzocaine - a chemical used to dilute cocaine - in a house in Liverpool which would have produced enough cocaine to sell for more than £1m. Graham was renting a £1,500 a month five-bedroom luxury £500,000 home in Brockhall Village, Lancashire, in an exclusive development opposite Blackburn Rovers' training ground. He had a fleet of nine cars including a Lamborghini Gallardo, worth more than £40,000, a Nissan Skyline, worth £35,000, and an Audi Q7 worth more than £20,000. Police recovered £5,000 cash when they raided a series of premises owned or rented by Graham. Motorbikes, jet skis, quad bikes, off-road motorbikes, electrical goods, jewellery and artwork together worth over £150,000 were found in his garage. Examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling over £35,000. They also seized a £50,000 Jacobs watch and a £32,000 diamond necklace. Luxury home: Vincent Graham's five-bedroom detached home in Brockhall Village, Lancashire, which he rented for £1,500 a month . During a police surveillance operation officers watched as Graham would check his Nissan GT-R's wheel arches with surgical gloves. In July 2011, Graham, described by police as a 'significant player' in the supply of drugs in the North West of England, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was jailed for seven years. Drug dealer: Father-of-ten Graham was jailed for seven years in 2011 and faces more time in prison if he does not repay the proceeds of his crime . This week he was brought back to Preston Crown Court under a Proceeds of Crime hearing and was warned he faced a further four and a half years jail if he doesn't pay back £700,000. Today Detective Chief Inspector Paula Parker, from Titan, an elite police squad which tackles organised crime said: 'Vincent Graham was living the kind of lifestyle most of us can only dream about. 'He paid for almost everything with cash and lived in a gated community normally associated with Premiership footballers and business executives. 'However, his income was not legitimate in any sense of the word but in fact came from dealing in Class A drugs. 'He did not care about the damage these drugs would do to the people taking them, or the wider community. He only cared about lining his pockets with drug money and living a film star lifestyle based on other people's misery. 'It is incredibly satisfying to know that not only does he still have a sizeable part of his prison sentence still left to serve but also, when he comes out, all his assets will have been taken and used to take more criminals off the streets.' Undercover officers tracked Graham for about six months after the tip off from their Dutch colleagues. It emerged he was a cage fighter had been linked to a number of organised crime groups in the UK. The court heard former garage boss Graham, who lost his right leg in a motorbike accident in his 20s, never touched the drugs during transactions.

Drugs: More illegal substances uncovered by police as they launched an investigation into Vincent Graham . Haul Drugs paraphernalia linked to playboy Vincent Graham, 33, which was discovered when police launched an investigation into the cocaine gang leader . But he was arrested after police filmed two accomplices engaging in a drug deal in Southport with a third man from Nigerian. Nick Courtney, prosecuting, said: 'Inquiries into Graham's financial affairs by the police revealed a lavish lifestyle wholly inconsistent with his declared income.' 'An examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling more than £35,000 and no evidence of the payment of household bills from his bank accounts. Luxury: A £35,000 18 carat gold and diamond necklace which was seized by police when they raided properties linked to him . 'Although he is connected with two businesses, no accounts have been filed in relation to those businesses with Companies House and inquiries with HM Revenue and Customs show that he has made declarations of only limited earnings, which would not support his lifestyle.' Paul Archer, 36, and Christopher Malpass, 26, both from Southport, were jailed respectively for three years and four years five months at earlier hearings.

Fish and chip shop owner David Graham, 47, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to sexual activity with a boy of 14 in Cambodia in April 2006. He was arrested in France last year after six years on the run. Graham, originally from Bournemouth, Dorset, was jailed for 21 months and ordered to pay £2,500 costs. He today became only the second man to be jailed under a law designed to catch sex tourists. Jailed: Fish and chip shop owner David Graham, 47, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to sexual activity with a boy of 14 in Cambodia in April 2006. He was arrested in France last year after six years on the run . The traveller was caught after charity workers spotted him - and traced him back to the UK. But he fled to France while on bail and was started running a fish and chip shop in Perpignan. At the time of the offence he was aged 40 and had been hanging around the riverside area outside the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh when charity workers spotted him approaching street children. Action Pour Les Enfants Investigators, whose aim is to stamp out child exploitation, followed him as he made his way back to his hotel. He beckoned over the boy, who had been sniffing glue. The taxi driver and former hardware store worker was then videoed for nearly an hour sitting on a bench with his arm around the boy - who had run away from his aunt after his parents had died. He had his hand on the boy and was then seen putting the boy’s hand down his shorts in the incident which lasted half an hour and for which the youngster was paid 6,000 Riel, worth £0.99. Graham flew out of Cambodia the day after, but investigators traced his name from hotel records. Ten days later the father of three was again spotted in the capital chatting to children and was seen buying them food and clothes and taking them to restaurants in April 2006. The charity found the boy and he told them ‘the man held him by the wrist and put his hand inside the man’s shorts... He tried to take his hand away but the man held his hand there. He was scared.’ UK police were alerted and Graham was arrested at his home in Bournemouth two months later. Caught: At the time of the offence Graham was 40 and in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh (file picture) when charity workers spotted him approaching street children . Prosecutor Caroline Haughey said: ‘He said he travelled to Cambodia as part of his love for travelling. He denied seeking out children but accepted he befriended street children.’ However while on bail he fled to France and spent six years on the run until French police traced him to a fish and chip shop he and his fiancée were running in Perpignan earlier this year in January. 'This was a deliberate and sophisticated act of travelling abroad to find a vulnerable victim' Caroline Haughey, prosecuting . French detectives found he had a British passport in a false name. He was extradited back to England and initially pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexual activity with a boy under 13 and the 14-year-old in March. But today at the Old Bailey, Graham admitted sexually assaulting the 14-year-old. The other count remains on file. Ms Haughey told the Old Bailey: ‘This was a deliberate and sophisticated act of travelling abroad to find a vulnerable victim. ‘The victim was specifically targeted because of his age, lack of education and cultural background. The victim was unlikely to report the crime and was paid after the sexual activity. ‘The length of time of the activity was at least half an hour but fell short of an hour.’ His barrister Christopher Strachan said: ‘His interest was in temples and wildlife. What happened on this occasion he acted out of character on that day in April 2006. Abroad: While on bail Graham fled to France and spent six years on the run until French police traced him to a fish and chip shop he and his fiancée were running in Perpignan (file picture) earlier this year in January . ‘He says he was beckoned over by the street child, he did not beckon the boy over. It was touching. It was the sort of activity Mr Graham has never been involved with before.’ Sentencing, Judge John Bevan QC said: ‘It’s an aggravating feature knowing you were guilty, you ran away. ‘You evaded responsibility and racked up huge police costs of £25,000-plus over a period of six years and you pleaded guilty today indicating it last week, having lied in your defence statement maintaining nothing had happened. 'You evaded responsibility and racked up huge police costs of £25,000-plus over a period of six years' Judge John Bevan QC . ‘I am not interested if you paid money to the victim, a street child in Cambodia sniffing glue. I am not particularly interested in whether you were a sex tourist or a tourist who decided to engage in sex. ‘I’m bound to say there is not much you have done to assist yourself in relation to this matter. It’s taken a long time to catch up with you. ‘This is by no means the most serious offence, but you met this child of about 14 (and) put his hand under your shorts for several minutes.’ Graham was ordered to pay £2,500 towards the cost of the UK police investigation and sign the sex offenders register. He was prosecuted under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which allows UK nationals to be dealt with in Britain for offences committed abroad. The first prosecution involved Barry McCloud, who was jailed for life in 2010 for sex offences against a girl in Goa, India.","David Graham pleaded guilty to sexual activity with boy in Phnom Penh .

The family of a woman strangled by her convicted murderer ex-boyfriend are calling for a Stephen Lawrence-style public inquiry to examine why domestic violence victims are not being properly protected by the authorities. Maria Stubbings, 50, was killed by Marc Chivers at her home in Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2008. Today her relatives said they are suing police because they believe she would still be alive if officers had done their jobs properly, as a damning report said today they failed to protect her. Victim: Maria Stubbings (left) was strangled to death with a dog lead by ex-boyfriend Marc Chivers (right) despite her having contacted police several times about the dangerous killer . Chivers had been freed from a German prison less than a year earlier, after serving 15 years for murdering his then girlfriend Sabine Rappold. He was jailed for life in 2009 for Ms Stubbings' murder. Ms Stubbings was strangled with a dog lead and dumped under coats in the toilet of her house, but police were 'fobbed off' by her killer, who said she was away, even though her car was in the drive. It was only the next day when they came back they found her body. Failed: Maria Stubbings, pictured holding her daughter Celia, was failed by police before she was murdered in 2008, the IPCC said today . Ms Stubbings's 15-year-old son Benji had been left in the house with Chivers after his mother died, unaware that he was in grave danger. Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) this morning published a second highly critical report on the failures by Essex police to protect Ms Stubbings and her son. Benji Stubbings said: 'It's horrific to discover the extent of the police's failings - and hard to understand how they got it so wrong. The risk to my mum and to me was clear. I didn't have a clue at the time how close to death I was. 'I don't want other women and other children to go through an experience like that. We're all equal - we all deserve help and protection when we're in danger - and they knew the danger.' Manuel Fernandez, Maria’s brother, said: 'If ever there were a case to be a catalyst for change, it is this one because of the catalogue of failings. 'This man had killed a woman before, he’d already gone to prison for assaulting Maria yet when she called for help, they didn’t provide it. 'They turned off a Panic Alarm at a crucial time when Maria needed it most and at what one point, when police officers were told to find her because of growing concerns, her door was opened by her killer and they gave him a calling card to pass on to her. What kind of protection is that? 'We’re four years on, and yet it’s clear the problems persist. They say lessons have been learned – but then we read about other cases where Essex police and other forces have failed women in Maria’s situation. That’s why we’re calling for a public inquiry. We want justice for Maria and for all women facing domestic violence who are failed by the state.' Three officers are facing misconduct proceedings over the case, but the IPCC report found that it has implications for the whole force. Ms Stubbings had made repeated contact with the police about her ex-boyfriend Chivers - in April 2008 about a possible burglary and again in July that year when he assaulted her. The IPCC found that Essex Police initially responded well, installing a panic alarm in her house and putting high risk warning markers on the address. However their efforts and those of other agencies then failed - the alarm was removed and no risk assessment was made of Chivers despite the fact he spent four months behind bars because of her assault complaint. On December 11 that year, he burgled her home, stealing medication on which she was dependent, but a police call handler took down her address incorrectly so the warning markers did not come up and the call was downgraded. When officers visited the house on December 18, Chivers answered the door to them and said Ms Stubbings was away and that her son was out. They looked in her bedroom and left - not realising that her body was under coats in the downstairs toilet. The following day her body was found. Distraught: Celia Peachey, Maria's daughter says she would have been alive today if police had not bungled, and Essex's chief constable Stephen Kavanagh admitted the force had made mistakes . The family's solicitor, Sarah Ricca from Deighton Pierce Glynn, said: 'The family will now be pursuing the legal remedies available to them, including seeking an inquest and bringing a civil claim. 'Their key concern is to ensure that other lives are saved. Initiative after initiative has been announced by politicians and chief police officers over the years, yet mistakes continue to be made in the way the state responds to domestic violence that cost women their lives. 'Maria's family believe that only a full scale public inquiry - in effect a Stephen Lawrence inquiry for women - can get to the bottom of what's going wrong and bring about the kind of change that is needed.' Root and branch: Maria Stubbings;s family want a Stephen Lawrence style inquiry for women, as the teenager's own murder lead to huge changes about how the police and CPS investigate crime . The report found that there was confusion over whether the December burglary should be classed as domestic abuse. The report said: 'No action was taken to protect Ms Stubbings or her son and vital opportunities to detain Chivers were missed. 'There was a failure to recognise that this apparent ""burglary"" was potentially an extremely abusive and threatening invasion of Ms Stubbings' home by a high risk perpetrator and the taking of her medication, on which she was dependent, may have been a deliberate, calculated and cruel act.' It said that the force missed 'a large number of opportunities' to protect her and her son. 'It is ironical Ms Stubbings was offered the most support and protection whilst Chivers was in prison, when the risk from him was minimal.

Essex Police said it accepted the findings of the report. Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said: 'A combination of factors including missed opportunities and organisational failures led to the brutal murder of Maria Stubbings. As a force we must never lose sight of the impact of her death at the hands of a violent offender and we must respond to the IPCC report in a positive way. 'We fully recognise that this is one of three tragic murders in Essex which has led to an IPCC investigation. We have taken on board the recommendations of those reports, many are already in place and work continues to improve the consistency of our response to domestic abuse. 'There is much being done, both internally, and externally with partners to combat domestic abuse in Essex. It is one of the biggest challenges we face - every day we deal with an average of 80 incidents, each one complex.

Battle-hardened villagers who maintained a round-the-clock blockade for 1,088 consecutive days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp now have to find £20,000 after the travellers won the right for a costly public inquiry. Residents maintained a three-year vigil at the site in picturesque Meriden, Warwickshire, after it was occupied in May 2010. Just a month ago they were celebrating and many members broke down in tears as the caravans left the land. But a fresh appeal means locals will be forced to endure a five-day inquiry as the travellers demand the right to put two caravans back on the eight-acre greenbelt site. Row: Noah Burton, who owns the contentious gypsy site in Meriden, has won the right for a five-day public inquiry as the travellers have nowhere to go . Exit: On the eve of leaving the site last month a caravan was set alight as members of the gypsy community moved from the land . The last camp: Meriden resident Lawrence Arnold starts to dismantle the protest tent after the last travellers finally left the site in the Warwickshire village in April - but they may have to return . The dedicated 200 locals - known as Residents Against Inappropriate Development (RAID) - kept a constant presence at the site to prevent further development of the land. The infamous 'Meriden Gypsies' finally lost their epic three-year legal battle to stay at the site after exhausting their last hope when a High Court judge threw out an application for them to remain on the site in March. They finally abandoned the ruined site on April 21 this year - after burning a caravan and setting fires across the field. Now landowner Noah Burton claims the gypsies have been left 'scattered across the land' with nowhere to go. He has appealed the High Court ruling sparking a public inquiry which will be held in August. Crew: These battle-hardened villagers, who fought for 1,088 days to rid their community of an illegal gypsy camp, now to have to stump up £20,000 for a costly public inquiry . Barren land: An aerial shot of the village and the nearby field, which was turned into an illegal camp site, shows the damage done by the travellers . In recovery: The travellers who lived on the site have been given one month to restore the land to its former green glory . Damage: The field, which has been occupied by travellers since April 2010, was left torn up by vehicles . Doug Bacon, vice chair of RAID, called the inquiry a 'waste of public money' and said it would cost the group around £20,000 out of their own pockets to fight. Mr Bacon said: 'This planning inquiry is a waste of public money. In total, it will cost around £20,000 to hire a barrister and planning consultants. 'We are determined that this is the wrong place for any type of development with highway dangers, flooding, accessibility, and sustainability issues, which mirrors all the reasons for the adjacent site being inappropriate as confirmed by the local authority and courts. 'They say they need these two pitches because they have nowhere to go but they are living somewhere right now. 'This is the nature of what we are dealing with. Unfortunately what happens is that the developer, Noah Burton, is trying to wear down the system with repeated planning applications. 'It's the thin end of the wedge because if they get planning permission, they will try to extend it.' Defiant: A traveller fuels a fire at the site in Meriden before they left . Time to leave: A caravan is towed from the site at the end of a 1,088 day year battle in the courts . But Noah Burton called the protests 'pointless' and issued a chilling warning to villagers when he said there would be 'no end' to their battle for the land. Mr Burton, 48, said: 'There is no ""final"" appeal in this process, we will keep going till the very end. 'We'll try again in October, and probably wait until the next Government and try again. 'If I could sell the land I would, but I have already tried and there are no takers, so I have nothing else to do with it, and no money to do anything with it. Goodbye? Locals had hoped to see the end of the camp but a new legal challenge may change that . Celebrations: Residents Against Inappropriate Development members Maz Crawley and Brenda O'Reilly give the camera the victory sign last month - but the battle over the land started again today . Applause: The protest has been ongoing since the group of travellers first moved to the greenbelt land in the village in April 2010 . Final caravan: Spokesman and leader of 'RAID', David McGrath celebrates the groups initial victory against the travellers by holding a 'not out' sign up as the protest site's caravan is moved away . Remebered: 'RAID' leader David McGrath, centre, speaks ahead of the moment of silence in honour of their fallen protesters who did not see the day of victory last month . 'All we want is for two caravans for elderly people, and space for someone to look after them. 'All this has resulted in is children being forced out of schools, and people scattered around the countryside on the side of roads. 'We just want to use the land, on hard standing, until the council find us somewhere to go.' A Solihull Council spokesman said: 'Solihull Council can confirm that a public inquiry will open on August 8, 2013, further details regarding the venue and start times will be published within the next few weeks.'","Protesters finally got illegal camp in Warwickshire broken up a month ago .

Royal Mail unveiled a big jump in profits to £440million today as it took another step towards privatisation and a £3billion stock market flotation later this year. The result for the year to March 31 is more than double the £152million in 2012 as the state-owned firm benefited from the boom in online shopping and recent efforts to modernise the business, which included offloading £37.5billion in pensions liabilities to the Government. Chief executive Moya Greene, who last year returned the core postal business to profitability after four successive years of losses, said it was a strong performance and that the transformation of Royal Mail was under way. Scroll down for video . Profits boom: Royal Mail is expected to announce a surplus of between £300million and £400million this week. The core postal business, which . delivers the six-days-a-week universal service to 29million addresses, . reported operating profits of £331million and improved its margin from . 0.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Parcel deliveries now account for almost . half of the group's revenues of £9.3billion in the last year. The performance is expected to . encourage the Government to cash in on the turnaround by pressing ahead . with a privatisation this year, despite opposition from unions . representing postal workers and managers. Business Secretary Vince Cable today . insisted there was ‘no alternative’ to privatising the Royal Mail and . said the organisation still faces a ‘fundamental threat’ from email that . meant it must be reformed in order to survive. However, unions warned services will go into decline if the business is sold off. Business Secretary Vince Cable, pictured in Downing Street today, said there was no alternative to selling off Royal Mail . It comes after a decade of . cost-cutting which has seen employee numbers at the Royal Mail Group . fall by around 50,000 to 150,000. In its half-year results in November, . Royal Mail reported that its UK parcel revenues were up by 13 per cent, . with parcels representing 47 per cent of total group revenue. Revenue . from letters was 2 per cent higher following an increase in stamp . prices earlier in the year, although letter volumes fell by 9 per cent. The . amount of junk mail also increased, accounting for around half the . daily postbag. The daily UK mailbag fell by four million over the year . to 54 million items. Ms Greene said at the time that Royal Mail was climbing out of a 'very deep hole', with all parts of the business profitable. The preferred sell off option is believed to . involve the public buying shares alongside City investors, in an echo of . the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign that pioneered the public sale of shares in . British Gas in the 1980s. At least 10 per cent of the shares . have been earmarked for the workforce, although it is not known whether . staff will get them for free. The Communication Workers Union will this week start balloting Royal Mail workers on whether to boycott . the post of rival companies in a move which could lead to millions of . items being left undelivered. Around 120,000 members of the CWU will vote from tomorrow, with the result due on June 19. Private mail makes up 44 per cent of . the daily post bag, so a boycott would leave 26million items undelivered . each day, including energy bills, statements, and business mail . contracts won by companies including TNT and UK Mail. The ballot will also gauge opposition . to the plans to privatise Royal Mail and backing for a campaign of . refusing to co-operate with new efficiency measures. Dave Ward, CWU deputy general . secretary, said today's results offered more evidence that Royal Mail . should be kept in the public sector. He added: ‘Improved productivity and . modernisation has played a role in these good results. Privatisation . isn't necessary and it would destabilise the workforce and the good . progress being made. The support of the workforce is crucial to the . success of the company. ‘Price rises have also clearly played a . role in the rise in profits. Fattening the goose in the short term may . lead to volume decline as customers seek alternatives.

Its 26-year-old founder has played predictably fast and loose with corporate etiquette, signing off news of Yahoo’s  $1.1billion cash purchase of Tumblr with ‘F*** yeah.’ New boss, Marissa Mayer, is thrilled she says at the deal she describes as her ‘stake in the ground’ as the tech giant’s new CEO. But amid all the clamour and noise over Yahoo’s purchase of David Karp’s micro-blogging site, Tumblr, one voice has been curiously absent until now - prompting speculation that this much celebrated deal is not universally welcome. 'F*** yeah': When his Tumblr co-developer quit in 2010 David Karp, pictured, claimed he would never sell out three years on he has sold his site for $1.1billion . But . in 2010 he left Karp to ‘pursue independent projects.’ His initial reluctance to comment on the high profile sale of the site has . re-ignited speculation that the relationship between Karp and Arment . soured in recent years. When approached directly by MailOnline Arment said: ‘I really don’t want to respond in any way until I post my thoughts on my own site.’ Asked if he was pleased for Karp he simply re-iterated his desire not to comment. What's next? The retweet that hints at Marco Arment's true feelings over Tumblr's sale? And while friends, fans and site-users immediately posted on Twitter, Arment waited until the close of the day before issuing a pointedly measured response to the sale, a review of his relationship with Karp and his own role in the creation of the fantastically successful site. Writing on his own site he admitted: 'I didn't have any advance knowledge of the Yahoo acquisition - I got official confirmation this morning, just like the public. When I read the rumor a few days ago on AllThingsD, I didn't know whether to believe it.' He continued: 'Generally, what Tumbrl needs, and what Tumblr has always needed, is to get support and maintenance roles off of David's plate so he can focus on the product.' He described himself as 'optimistic' at the sale, adding, 'This is clearly what David believes is best for his product.' He doesn’t follow his former boss on Twitter and though he lists his involvement with Tumblr on online profiles he rarely refers to Karp by name since leaving his organisation three years ago. Tumblr Past and Present: Former co-developer Marco Arment, left, and David Karp, the man who 'is' Tumblr . The new boss: Marissa Mayer, Yahoo CEO who has bought Tumblr with the promise 'not to screw it up' Arment was just two years out of college when he replied to an advertisement posted by Karp on Craigslist. Reflecting on that time Karp once said he was ‘just stupid lucky’ to meet Arment in this fashion. As for Arment he opted for the . role with Davidville over an offer from Bloomberg though at the time he . was confused as to exactly who his boss would be. With no corporate experience to speak . of, Karp had asked Fred Seibert, the founder of animation production . company Frederator Studios and a family friend who had offered him an . internship when he was 15, to sit in on his interview with Arment. The world at his feet: David Karp with girlfriend Rachel Eakley, the couple live in New York's West Villlage with their Bulldog, Clark . It was during a . lull in client work that Karp and Arment set to work on building the . tumblelogging tool of Karp’s imagination. What began as a side-project . took on a life of its own. A . small group of angel investors came up with $775,000 in return for a . stake in the site then valued at just $3million. Karp enlisted the help . of more experienced men; Arment concentrated on making the site work. Karp was just 20 years old. He was opposed to advertising, visionary in his determination that his site should not show numbers of followers – an online habit that, he has said, ‘poisons the community’ – and unequivocal in his hope to ‘never sell-out.’ When Arment left Tumblr in 2010 to develop his own successful internet project – Instapaper, a bookmark and reading service – Karp was still holding to that line. The Yahoo deal has made Karp an extremely wealthy young man and one who certainly need never worry about money again. 'As for me,' Arment writes, 'David was generous with my employee stock options back in the day. I won't make yacht-and-helicopter money from the acquisition, and I won't be switching to decidated day and night iPhones. 'But as long as I manage investments properly and don't spend recklessly, Tumblr has given my family a strong safety net and..the freedom to work on whatever I want.' It is a decidely restrained response. And perhaps a clue to Arment’s true feelings on Karp's cashing in can be found in his retweet of a humorous message from a friend. Referring to Arment’s dog, Hops – an internet character in his own right with a Twitterfeed of his own – the post simply reads: ‘What next @marcoarment? Are you gonna sell @hopsarment too?'","For years David Karp resisted the lure of Silicon Valley and the money that 'selling out' offered .

"By . Fiona Macrae . PUBLISHED: . 19:56 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:48 EST, 13 June 2012 . The creation of babies with three genetic parents would be an ‘amazing opportunity’ for families whose lives have been blighted by incurable diseases, say an eminent group of experts on ethics in science. The influential Nuffield Council on Bioethics conceded that while those with religious views might view the advance as an ‘abomination’, there is no ethical reason to stop it, provided it is proved to be safe and effective. The approval comes as pressure builds on the Government to amend the law to allow the genetic engineering of eggs and embryos, creating babies free of devastating genetic diseases. Three parents? Ethicists have decided that mixing DNA from more than two parents is acceptable if it is used to cure hereditary diseases . The children would effectively have two  mothers and one father. Those in favour say it would give couples who have endured the  heartbreak of miscarriages and stillbirths, and children who have died while still young, the option of having a healthy family. But critics say the science is too risky and the safety of the baby should take precedence over a woman’s desire to be a mother. There are also concerns about the long-term effects of tampering with the DNA at the first stages of life, something known as germline therapy and banned in most countries. Done differently, it could lead to the creation of designer babies, made to order by hair colour or eye colour. Brenda Almond, emeritus professor of moral and social philosophy at Hull University, cautioned against opening a ‘Pandora’s box’ of problems. She said that if the new technique was allowed, pressure would build to allow  bigger genetic changes. Slippery slope? There are philosophers who say that it could be a stepping stone to other kinds of tampering . Work is being carried out at Newcastle University into incurable diseases caused by faults in mitochondria, tiny  sausage-shaped powerhouses inside cells which turn food into energy. Each mitochondrion has its own DNA that is passed down from mother to child. Serious defects in this affect one in 6,500 babies and cause around 50 genetic diseases, some of which kill in infancy. Women carrying diseased mitochondria often face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be kinder to remain childless. To get round this, the scientists are perfecting two techniques in which the mother-to-be’s diseased mitochondria are swapped for healthy ones from an egg donated by another woman. A successful mitochondrial ‘transplant’ should eradicate disease from future generations of the family. The amount of DNA contributed by the donor would be small and it is not thought  it would affect the child’s looks or personality. For this reason, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, an independent body which tries to steer public opinion and policy on advances in health and science, said it would not be right to class the egg donor as a second mother. It concluded that the transplants would be an ethical option, provided they are shown to be safe and effective.",Critics caution against opening a 'Pandora's box' which could lead to a trend towards 'designer babies'

Concerned: Missing student Jason Fyles has not been seen since last Thursday after he claimed people had turned their backs on him . Police have stepped up their search for a student who went missing after posting a disturbing Twitter message claiming people had turned their backs on him. Jason Fyles, a 19-year-old Newcastle University student, vanished after a night out with friends five days ago. 'I find it really sad that everyone that I tried to get help. From just. Turned. Their. Back,' he tweeted after leaving a friend's house during the early hours of . Thursday morning. He has not been seen or heard from since. Jason's family, parents Ian and Caroline, brother Shaun and sister Kimberley, have now travelled to Newcastle from their hometown of Southport on Merseyside, to help search for him. 'Jason, please get in touch,' they said in a statement today. 'We love you very much and all we want is to hear your voice and know that you're safe. 'Please call us or call the police so that we know that you are alright. 'Whatever it is that is troubling you, whatever has happened to upset you - please give us a chance to help you sort it out. 'We would also ask Jason's friends, or anyone who has seen him or has any information that could possibly help to find him, to get in touch with police.' Earlier his aunt, Wendy, 48, had also made an emotional plea for help to find her nephew. She said: 'We just want him back so we can give him a hug. We just need to know where he is. There's such a big piece missing from the family.' Final message: Jason sent this poignant tweet and has not been seen or heard from since . Hunt: Northumbria Police officers search the Sandyford area of Newcastle where Jason was last seen in the early hours of Thursday May 16 . Jason moved to Tyneside only nine months ago to study town planning, and had been staying in Newcastle University's halls of residence at Bowsden Court in South Gosforth. Methodical: An officer uses a ladder to check the flat roof and perhaps inside this garage for any signs of the missing teenager . His family said he had settled well into student life and was in regular contact with his mother and father. His aunt said he was in good spirits when he confirmed he would join the family on their annual trip to the Yorkshire Show, and asked his mum to buy him a  ticket. 'He said he wanted a ticket and was in good spirits,' said Wendy. 'He was in good spirits and there was absolutely nothing unusual in that phone call.' That night, Jason joined fellow students on a night out and drank with friends at Sam Jacks and Tup Tup Palace in Newcastle city centre before becoming separated from the group. He later paid a late-night visit to his friend Sean Peacock's home in Sandyford. Sean, who is on the same course as Jason, said he phoned him a number of times before knocking on the door. When he realised Jason was drunk, Sean offered him a bed for the night, but his friend refused and left. Then, at just after 3am, Jason sent his final tweet. Jason's friends reported him missing to police, who then contacted his family. 'His dad received a phone call on Friday evening from Northumbria Police to say his friends had reported him missing,' his aunt Wendy said. 'Immediately after that all the family tried his mobile constantly but it wasn't switched on and nobody has seen or heard from him since. 'He hasn't put anything on Facebook or Twitter either, which is unusual as, like most teenagers, he is a regular user of these.' Plea: Jason's family have come to the North East and have urged anyone with information about him to contact the police . Jason's loved ones can think of no reason why he could go missing, and now fear the worst. 'Jason is a quiet, reserved lad but he has a very happy disposition,' said Wendy. 'He's just a really nice kid. He's very academic, he had big plans for the future. 'Our family is very, very close. He's at university but he still speaks to his parents every week, which isn't the case with a lot of students. He was very much enjoying uni. He loved the work, had made friends, and was enjoying life in Newcastle, like most students do. 'It's the most out-of-character thing you could imagine from him. He is the youngest of three children and very, very close to his mum.' Jason's parents have spent the last few days walking the streets of Newcastle and giving out posters with Jason's picture on. Wendy added: 'They have spent hours and hours traipsing the streets.' Message: Northumbria Police fear for Jason's safety and say his disappearance is out of character . Supt Andy McDyer, of Northumbria Police's Newcastle Area Command, said: 'His disappearance is out of character and we're concerned for his welfare due to the length of time he's been missing. 'I'd urge anyone who sees him or who has information about his whereabouts to contact police.' More than 6,000 people have now joined a Facebook group called 'Missing Newcastle Student: Jason Fyles', and scores of messages have been posted.

The offices of Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans have been searched by police investigating claims of rape and sexual assault. Detectives seized ‘parliamentary material’ from Mr Evans’s Westminster offices after being granted a warrant by a judge at Preston Crown Court. The Attorney General and the Solicitor General were informed about the searches and concluded that there were ‘no lawful grounds’ to oppose them. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was arrested earlier this month over allegations of rape and sexual assault . Commons Speaker John Bercow said he had been consulted before officers entered Parliament. At the weekend he faced renewed pressure after it emerged that a third man has told police he was also abused by the Deputy Speaker in the House of Commons two years ago. Mr Bercow said in a statement to MPs at the start of today's sitting, he said: 'I wish to report to the House that the rooms of a Member were searched yesterday pursuant to a warrant issued by the Circuit Judge in Preston Crown Court on 16 May. 'The warrant related to the investigation of a serious arrestable offence.' Mr Evans has been relieved of his duties chairing Commons debates since his arrest on May 4. He will not return to the job until the police inquiries have concluded. According to the Sunday Times a third alleged victim gave a statement to Lancashire constabulary after hearing about the MP's arrest over two other claims of sexual assault. A spokesman for Lancashire Police said today: 'We have confirmed that we have searched offices in London in connection with the investigation but it is inappropriate to comment any further other than to say that we have gone through all the appropriate and necessary procedures before taking this step.' Mr Evans returned to Parliament days after his arrest and release on bail, but will not take up duties chairing Commons debates while police inquiries are ongoing . Mr Bercow told today MPs that the 'precincts of Parliament are not a haven from the law'. In 2008 police controversially searched the office of Tory frontbencher Damian Green over leaks obtained from the Home Office. Commons authorities then set new rules on the execution of search warrants within Parliament. Mr Bercow said he considered the warrant to search Mr Evans' office 'personally' and was advised by Officials that 'there were no lawful grounds on which it would be proper to refuse its execution'. He also consulted the Attorney General and the Solicitor General who agreed with the advice. He went on: 'The Serjeant at Arms and Speaker's Counsel were present when the search was conducted. Undertakings have been given by the police officers as to the handling of any Parliamentary material until such time as any issue of privilege is resolved. 'The investigation is continuing and it would not be right to comment further. I will not take questions on my statement.' After being bailed Mr Evans was pictured outside a pub in his Ribble Valley constituency reading cards from wellwishers . After his arrest Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, read a statement outside his Lancashire home vehemently denying the accusations against him. The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’. Mr Evans, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. He said: ‘The allegations are completely false and I can’t understand why they have been made. ‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Preston Crown Court orders search of rooms in Westminster .

The new reading test for six-year-olds which was taken by 600,000 pupils last year will have little or no impact on literacy, teachers have said. The Coalition government ordered state primary schools to introduce the new assessment which focuses on a phonic system. Children are asked to 'decode' a list of 40 words but the list includes made up words like 'voo' 'blim' and 'spron'. However, a review published by the Department of Education which is based on interviews with 940 teachers and 844 literacy coordinators criticised the test. The report, which has been published online, reads: 'Only a quarter of literacy coordinators expressed the view that the check provided useful information for teachers. 'Most of the teachers interviewed as part of the case-study visits to schools reported that the check would have minimal if any, impact on the standard of reading and writing in their school in the future. 'This view appeared to stem from the fact that many thought the outcomes from the check told them nothing new'. While teachers were positive about teaching phonics, they believed a range of teaching methods should be used. The Coalition government ordered state primary schools to introduce the new assessment which focuses on a phonic system . A Department of Health spokesman told The Daily Telegraph: 'The phonics check ensures children struggling with reading get the help they desperately need.

At just 20 years of age, Joe Harris has already achieved the lofty heights of being elected mayor of his home town. And he has quickly used his new powers to establish a political dynasty in reverse - by choosing his father to be his deputy. A Liberal Democrat councillor, Mr Harris junior was elected as civic leader of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, earlier this month. And he followed his selection on the town council by make selecting his father Mark, 47, as his next in line. Another unrelated councillor had also been nominated for the post but with the votes tied the casting vote fell to the young new mayor. The mayor explained: ‘I need a deputy who shares my vision for the town and what we’ve got to do for the future.’ Joe Harris became the youngest councillor in the UK when he was first elected in 2011 at the age of 18. He is a councillor on Cotswold District Council and Cirencester Town Council and was also recently elected to Gloucestershire County Council. His father, who is 47, a fellow Lib-Dem, was elected to the town council in a by-election in January. Speaking of the moment he watched his . son select him as his deputy, the older Mr Harris said: ‘He looked like . one of those judges off the X Factor when they have to make a decision . they really don’t want to have to make. ‘I wouldn’t have held it against him if he hadn’t chosen me. We have had a few jokes. ‘The banter has mostly been about how we are father and son and now he can discipline me.’ His son added that people were more fascinated by his age than the fact his dad was his deputy. He said: ‘I think the novelty is more the fact they have a 20-year-old mayor. Mark Harris with his newborn son (left) and now, as his junior in local government (right). The 47-year-old says he might pull the 'dad card' on his son if he disagrees with him in a council meeting . ‘I don’t know what it is really going to be like having my dad as my deputy yet as it has only been a few weeks, but I’m sure it will have its moments.’ Yesterday his deputy denied his appointment was down to nepotism. PR consultant Mark Harris said: ‘I’m relatively new to local government and the point of view that Joe was looking for was some fresh blood on the team. ‘He said he wanted a fresh pair of eyes and knows that I shared his vision for the future of the town. ‘I think it sets a really good example to the community that a father and son can work together. ‘I don’t know if I would pull the ‘dad card’ on him in a meeting if I didn’t agree with what he was saying, but it’s always a possibility.’ The deputy mayor, who has two other sons, Tim, 18, and Peter, five, has been separated from Joe’s mother for the past eight years. He added: ‘If they all got involved in politics that would be something. ‘The 18-year-old wants to be an actor, but the five-year-old, you know what they are like, they think they know it all, so I might really be in trouble if he gets involved too.’ Joe Harrisn, who is also on the District and County Council, is single and lives with his mother in Cirencester.","20-year-old Liberal Demoncrat councillor Joe Harris first elected at age of 18 .

The huge tornado with winds of up to 200 miles per hour tore through the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore on Monday, ripping up at least two schools and leaving a wake of tangled wreckage as a dangerous storm system threatened as many as 10 U.S. states. Aerial video showed tracts of homes destroyed, cars tossed about and piled atop one another, and at least one building on fire.

The strength of the storm was able to unlatch cellar doors where residents sought refuge from the tornado. 'We thought we died because we were inside the cellar door, we locked the cellar door once we saw it coming, it got louder and next thing you know is you see the latching coming undone and we couldn't reach for it and it ripped open the door and just glass and debris started slamming on us and we thought we were dead to be honest,' said Moore resident Ricky Stover said.

Two endangered sea turtles that are shells of their former selves after getting stranded during a cold spell are getting some help easing back into the wild — from an acupuncturist. Dexter and Fletcher Moon, juvenile Kemp's ridley sea turtles rescued on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, US, remained calm as acupuncturist Claire McManus tapped more than a dozen needles into their leathery skin. The therapy session was intended to decrease inflammation on their flippers, restore movement and help the animals regain their appetite. Scroll down for video . Acupuncturist Claire McManus treats a sea turtle, which was injured after getting stranded on Cape Cod . Tiny needles stick out of the leathery skin of a Kemp's ridley sea turtle as it gets treatment . 'There aren't a lot of people doing sea turtle acupuncture,' said Mrs McManus, who works alongside a vet. 'There is not a whole lot of literature out there on turtle acupuncture, so I'm basing it on how we treat other animals and humans. 'The needles, they are tiny, no bigger, like having a mosquito bite. You notice there's no blood. 'You can probably fit four or five of these inside the type of a needle you'd use to draw blood, so they didn't really feel it. Dexter and Fletcher Moon were among a record number of more than 400 turtles of various species that got stranded on Cape Cod and the southern Massachusetts shore over the winter. The turtles were there to feast on crabs, fish and jellyfish as cold weather settled over New England, causing hypothermia to set in and render the cold-blooded animals immobile and unable to eat for days. As their stunned bodies floated on the sea surface, their limbs were exposed to extremely cold winds that blew them to the beach. Only 242 of the stranded animals lived, and they were taken to the New England Aquarium's offsite animal care center for treatment. The turtles also had secondary problems such as pneumonia, and were malnourished. Recovering turtles swim at the New England Aquarium in Massachusetts, US . 'They haven't been eating in a couple of weeks, so they don't have the energy that it takes to be able to fight off some of these things,' said Connie Merigo, head of the aquarium's marine rescue team. Vets used laser therapy, antibiotics, enriched meals and other treatments to help turtles recover their health and strength before being returned to the wild. Still, the sophisticated treatments could not help 14 sea turtles. That includes Dexter and Fletcher Moon, who are unable to use their front flippers — making it impossible for them to forage for food in the wild or escape from sharp-toothed predators prowling off the coast. 'We reach a point, sometimes, in the therapy for these turtles that the traditional methods aren't working the way we want them to, and so we've reached out to a licensed acupuncturist,' Mrs Merigo said. One other turtle, a loggerhead, is also getting acupuncture treatment. The other 11 not yet back in the wild are continuing on traditional treatments for lingering infections and orthopedic ailments. The acupuncture is intended to reduce stress, increase blood flow and boost the immune system — just as in humans. Dexter and Fletcher Moon have already had three acupuncture sessions, scheduled once a week, said Mrs Merigo, who broke into a broad smile as she described their improvements over the past three weeks. She said: 'These two turtles really had very limited limb use and they weren't eating. We are seeing improved limb use and improved appetite. 'They are eating on their own, which is fantastic.' Describing her reaction to the results, Mrs McManus said: 'It makes me feel very happy. 'Acupuncture is not an alternative to conventional medicine — they are also receiving Western treatments as well, but the fact that it can work in conjunction with the other treatments they are getting makes me very happy.'","Only 242 of 400 that were hit by cold weather on Cape Cod, US, survived .

"Up to 3,600 mainland officers preparing to cross the Irish Sea . By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 19:47 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:47 EST, 20 May 2013 . British police guarding the G8 summit will be ‘disguised’ amid fears they could be targeted by Irish dissidents. Extraordinary measures are being taken to protect a contingent of up to 3,600 mainland officers preparing to cross the Irish Sea next month. Chiefs fear they could fall victim to well-armed terrorists intent on grabbing the global spotlight with a violent atrocity. British police guarding the G8 summit will be 'disguised' as their Irish counterparts amid fears they could be targeted by Irish dissidents (stock image) As a result all officers on public order duty during the meeting of world leaders will wear boiler suits and an identical custom-made cap. This will mean that mainland officers are indistinguishable from their Northern Irish colleagues, save for their silver collar numbers. The move comes as preparations to secure the two-day summit on June 17 and 18 at Lough Erne golf resort near Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, enter their final stages. Police and the security services are staging the biggest police operation in the province’s history because of the continued threat of a dissident attack. More than 8,000 officers will form a ring of steel around the remote resort, which is based on a lake peninsula, and the route from Belfast International Airport. The top priority of organisers is to ensure the safety of world leaders including Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel and their extensive entourages. But they also face a wave of potentially violent protests by a range of organisations from trade unions to anti-globalisation movements. The biggest protest could attract up to 20,000 demonstrators to Belfast, including known activists from across Europe. Shadow demonstrations are also expected in London and Dublin, mainly because the location of the summit is difficult to reach. All officers on public order duty during the meeting of world leaders will wear boiler suits and an identical custom-made cap . All this takes place against the backdrop of a stubbornly volatile security situation in the province as terrorist alerts take place daily. Some rank-and-file officers have questioned the Government’s decision to stage the summit at such short notice in Northern Ireland. The estimated bill for the security operation has not been disclosed, but sources said it is likely to exceed £10million. Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), said a terrorist attack could take place anywhere. The senior officer, who is responsible for the security operation, said the G8 is a ‘great opportunity’ for dissident groups to grab attention. He said: ‘I’ve got no reason to say that dissidents won’t do something during that period of time. ‘This has been the backdrop, the sad reality of Northern Ireland over quite a period of time. There is nothing to suggest that the rhythm of that will be disrupted.’ Officers travelling from England, Wales and Scotland will be based at military barracks and transported in armoured Land Rovers as part of the security crack-down. They have been issued with state-of-the-art bullet proof vests and will be accompanied by armed Northern Irish colleagues. The travelling contingent have been told they will work under ‘lock down’ conditions and are not allowed to go sightseeing in their own time. Hundreds of officers have already been trained in how to work alongside water cannon, a machine expected to be approved for us on the mainland within months. Police commanders said mainland officers will not be deployed to ordinary incidents because of their lack of knowledge of the political make-up of the area. Their PSNI colleagues plan to use drones for the first time to beam down pictures to commanders.They will join two helicopters patrolling the skies between Belfast International Airport and the summit venue. On the ground a huge security fence will be erected around the venue, with stores and other lower priority areas guarded by private firms. Police in the Irish Republic are also heavily involved as the extensive entourages of some countries are staying in hotels south of the border. The Irish Government is passing emergency legislation to enable it to shut down mobile phone networks in a limited area to prevent signals being used to detonate a bomb. Senior officers said the New IRA and ONH (Oglaigh na hEireann) are the most active dissident groups with ‘real capacity and capability’. Republican dissidents attempted a gun and bomb attack on police in Belfast only last Thursday. Officers in Northern Ireland work under constant threat of attack, with car bombs and armed ambushes a deadly reality. The terrorist threat level in Northern Ireland remains ‘severe’ meaning an attack is considered ‘highly likely’.","British police guarding the G8 summit will be ‘disguised’ amid fears .

An area from Dallas to Little Rock, Arkansas, has the greatest chance of severe weather, while a portion of the central U.S. from Michigan to Texas is at risk, according to the U.S. Storm Prediction Center. 'The real areas of concern are Arkansas, northern Louisiana and northeastern Texas, where you could have the most damaging storms,' said Christopher Vaccaro, spokesman for the National Weather Service in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Moore storm 'is certainly on the high end of the scale' in terms of destructiveness, he said. Oklahoma City has been struck by tornadoes more times than any other place in the U.S., according to government data. Yesterday’s storm came the day after two people were killed and 39 injured in separate storms in the state. At least 30 tornadoes were reported on May 19 from Illinois to Oklahoma. The exact strength of yesterday’s storm won’t be known until a survey team inspects the damage in the coming days, said John Pike, a spokesman with the weather service in Norman, Oklahoma, about 10 miles south of Moore. Preliminary indications were that it was at least an EF-4 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, said Ryan Barnes, a weather service meteorologist. That’s the second-most-powerful classification on the six-step rankings and means the cyclone had wind gusts of 166 to 200 miles (267 to 322 kilometers) per hour for three seconds. Classification is based on damage, not actual wind measurements. Here are the paths of tornadoes over the years in the Moore, Oklahoma area: Red: 1999, Blue: 2003, Green: 2013 . Apocalyptic scene: Yesterday's tornado was a mile-wide . Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour, with the most storms breaking up within 10 minutes, according to the storm center. The swath of devastation shown on television is consistent with an EF-5 tornado, the most powerful kind, with winds of at least 200 miles per hour, said Mark Hoekzema, chief meteorologist for Earth Networks in Germantown, Maryland. 'From everything that I have seen it is undoubtedly an EF-5 and it is one of the worst ones I have seen,' Hoekzema said. 'This appears to have been very wide and to have gone through a substantially populated area.' There were only 58 EF-5 tornadoes recorded in the U.S. between 1950 and 2011, according to the storm center. About 1,300 tornadoes hit the country every year. Severe thunderstorms killed 118 people in the U.S. last year and caused an estimated $27.7 billion in economic losses, second only to hurricanes and tropical storms among natural disasters, according to the Insurance Information Institute of New York.","Same weather front that flattened area set to produce more devastation .

A British dad-of-two begged a jury today to acquit him of pushing an Irish tourist to his death on a Tenerife booze cruise. Kitchen fitter Darren Sapstead, 38, made his impassioned plea at the end of his three-day trial for Garry Walton's homicide nearly 17 years ago. Garry, 21, originally from Leeds, west Yorkshire, drowned on November 7 1996 after falling from a pleasure boat he had been partying on with nearly 50 other youngsters off the popular resort of Playa de las Americas. The apprentice builder, originally from . Leeds, west Yorkshire, drowned after falling from the boat the trio were . on in an incident originally written off by Spanish investigators as an . accident. A Spanish judge ruled out foul play but had Sapstead extradited in December 2005 after British sisters Katie and Lucy Smethurst started incriminating him despite initially telling Spanish and British police Garry had jumped in for a swim or fallen by accident. The defendant, facing up to 12 years in jail if convicted of homicide, told the jury in the Tenerife capital Santa Cruz today after being granted a last court address: 'These have been sad times both for the Waltons and for my family over the past 17 years. 'At no point have I ever changed my statement. 'I have always tried to help Garry, unlike Katie and Lucy as they have lied to the police in Las Americas and then to a judge in Tenerife and the police in England and now they want you to believe their story.' Denying state prosecutors' claims his mum had once threatened Katie, 17 when she took the fateful booze cruise with her then 14-year-old sister, he added: 'I have lost the last 17 years of my life as has the Walton family. 'I lost my business before when I was in prison on remand after my extradition. Drowned: Gary Walton, pictured centre, was on a party boat 'booze cruise' seventeen years ago when he was allegedly thrown overboard by Darren Sapstead who is on trial in Tenerife . Trial: Darren Sapstead, pictured left in court yesterday, denies pushing Garry Walton, right, to his death over the side of a pleasure boat in Tenerife 1996. The trial began on Monday, 17 years after Mr Walton died . Distress: The long-awaited trial comes after a protracted campaign by Garry's parents Robert and Catherine to unlock the mystery of their son's death . 'I went to to five different prisons on the Spanish mainland and I was then taken by boat to Tenerife. 'At no point in my life have I hurt or done anything to hurt anyone or anything. 'I am now here hoping for justice. I swear on my family's life I did not touch or harm Garry on that sad day. 'I tried to help him. I hope you make the correct decision.' His witness stand plea came after state prosecutor Debora Padilla accused Sapstead in a closing speech of depriving tragic Garry, who moved to Ireland with his family when he was a child, of the chance of having a family of his own. She added: 'From the moment of his death the lives of his parents and other loved ones have been cut short.' Describing Katie and Lucy Smethurst as 'young, frightened and intimidated' when they failed to point the finger at Sapstead in their first statements, she told the jury of eight women and one man: 'Many of you are mothers and know how vulnerable young girls can be at that age.' On trial: Darren Sapstead, pictured on the second day of his trial is on trial in Tenerife for allegedly drowning Gary Walton seventeen years ago . Agony: Gary Walton's parents Catherine and Robert are fighting for 'justice' for the son, who drowned on a 'booze cruise' seventeen years ago . Agony: The victim's father Robert Walton was in the Tenerife courtroom to watch the trial . Fight: Robert and Catharine Walton have been seeking justice for their son's death for 17 years . Pathologist Fernando Laino told the court earlier he found no signs of violence on Garry's body.But he said his drunkenness could have affected his ability to react and defend himself if he was suddenly lifted off his feet by someone bent on throwing him overboard. Tests revealed the apprentice builder was more than three times over the UK drink-drive limit when he died. Sapstead's defence lawyer Carlos Valenciano, in summing-up, said Katie Smethurst could not be considered a credible witness. Return: Mr Sapstead voluntarily returned to Spain to stand trial and could face 12 years in prison . Hearing: Proceedings opened on Monday after a long-running legal battle over Mr Walton's death . He accused her of trying to deflect . attention towards his client for fear she would be accused of killing . Garry or covering up his death. Mrs Smethurst admitted in court on . Tuesday she warned Darren off jumping into the Atlantic to try to save . Garry because it was too dangerous after he had thrown his alleged . victim a life ring. Mr Valenciano said: 'The death of . Garry Walton and the suffering it produced for Garry Walton's family as . well as Darren Sapstead and his family is tragic. 'But contrary to what the prosecution maintains, Darren is not responsible in any way for Garry Walton's death. 'In fact he was the only person to help him. Garry Walton died after falling from the Albatros off the coast of Tenerife, pictured . Mr Sapstead has voluntarily returned to stand trial on homicide charges in Tenerife . 'There is no material evidence someone threw Garry into the water and no material evidence that if someone did do it, that it was Darren.' Insisting Garry drowned because of the time he spent in the water, he added: 'If Katie had acted more quickly and had not prevented Darren from jumping in to help Garry, Garry and his family would be still enjoying the happiness of being together.' Jurors are due to be sent out tomorrow morning to consider their verdict. Homicide, a charge that does not exist in English law, is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder which in Spain is a wilful killing which must also be premeditated.Sapstead denies the charge and remains on bail. Garry's builder dad Robert and mum Catherine are attending the trial and were today joined by Robert's two sisters Debbie and Rachel.

Mark Sanford has reached a new low in his effort to reignite his congressional campaign as he debated a cardboard cut-out of Democrat Nancy Pelosi. The stunt was meant as a jab at his competitor Elizabeth Colbert Busch who has received a sizable portion of her campaign funds from the Political Action Committee run by House Minority Leader Pelosi. 'My opponent continues to run a stealth campaign, avoiding public appearances and refusing to commit to televised forums for the benefit of 1st district voters,' the former South Carolina governor said to the cardboard poster of Mrs Pelosi. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stunt: Mark Sanford resorted to hosting a 'debate' with Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who he credits for largely funding his Democratic competitor's campaign . Different tact: The disgraced former governor is trying to win back votes fast as the election is in less than two weeks . Mr Sanford, who infamously got tied up in ethics charges after his extramarital affair with an Argentinian journalist was discovered following his fake trip 'hiking the Appalachian trial' in 2009, is trailing Mrs Colbert Busch by nine points in the latest poll. He claimed that since Mrs Colbert Busch has only agreed to one debate, which is scheduled for next Monday, she is trying to avoid him and hiding behind quick-spending Democrats like Mrs Pelosi. As a result, he took aim at the largely unpopular former Speaker of the House rather than the lesser-known Mrs Colbert Busch, whose biggest endorsement arguably came from her comedian brother Stephen Colbert. During the awkward press conference on Wednesday, Mr Sanford addressed each issue by saying 'my question for you, Nancy' and quipping 'she's not going to answer that one'. 'Context matters': Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford told MailOnline that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election . In the lead: Elizabeth Colbert Busch is up by nine points in the latest tracking polls, which comes as a shock as she is a Democrat in a heavily Republican district . Mrs Colbert Busch's team responded with a statement: 'While Mark Sanford continues his desperate campaign to deceive voters, Elizabeth Colbert Busch is spending her time with real people who support her campaign.' Last-ditch effort: Sanford's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election . 'She doesn’t have to resort to phony . cardboard cut-outs to talk with the people of South Carolina,' Colbert . Busch's spokesman James Smith said. Even though the first congressional district in South Carolina is a heavily Republican one, last week was a tumultuous one of the campaign. His ex-wife Jenny Sanford filed a lawsuit against him alleging that he broke the terms of their divorce by going into her Sullivans’ Island home without her permission. He then took out a full page ad in the local newspaper over the weekend explaining that he did in fact go into her home in early February, but it was because he didn't want their 14-year-old son to watch the second half of the Super Bowl alone. As an especially desperate measure, he even listed his cell phone number in the ad, and MailOnline spoke to him directly when he picked up. 'I think that people always want to know the real story, the full story,' he told MailOnline by phone. The first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the court documents that Jenny Sanford's legal team filed, saying that he was seen leaving the back door of her Sullivans’ Island home using his cell phone as a flashlight. 'That's a rather spooky story- it would creep anybody out,' he said. Among those who were spooked were the National Republican Congressional Committee, who pulled their funding from the race following the news of the lawsuit. That wasn't the end of the bad news for the former Governor, however, as his ex-wife confirmed reports that his primary victory party was the first time that their 14-year-old son had met his mistress-turned-fiancée Maria Belen Chapur. Ex-couples court: Former governor Mark Sanford .

Awkward: Mark Sanford's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father's mistress-turned-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, a woman he had met for the first time just moments before . When asked by MailOnline if the public venue was really the first time that his son had met his future stepmother, he said: 'one of them had and one of them hadn't'. 'That's the nature of a surprise- I didn't know she was coming,' he said of his fiancée Maria Belen Chapur. The race ends in less than two weeks when the special election is held on Tuesday May 7.

Energy Minister Michael Fallon is trying to recreate the success that America has had with fracking . Drilling for gas could take place across the south of England in the constituencies of 35 Tory MPs. A new analysis of the areas where shale - a type of rock rich in natural gas - is plentiful and drilling licences have been handed out, covers the constituencies of several cabinet ministers. Most are situated around the Weald Basin in Surrey and Sussex including the seats of Education sectretary Michael Gove, Cabinet secretary Francis Maude, Defence secretary Philip Hammond, Justice secretary Chris Grayling and Health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Last week, the energy department . announced fracking, the controversial technique of extracting gas from . rock, would go ahead in earnest in the coming months despite . environmental concerns. Energy . minister Michael Fallon said the government ‘owed it to the next . generation’ to explore new energy sources which may bring down household . fuel bills. He told the . Mail: ‘Let’s get fracking. There has been a lot of interest already, . particularly in southern England and we are hoping to attract the big . firms to come and drill here.’ In . the USA fuel prices have tumbled due to shale exploration. On his trip . to Washington last week David Cameron said: ‘Frankly, I am pretty . jealous of your fracking success here in the US.’ But fracking, which involves drilling a . well thousands of feet underground, and pumping in water and chemicals . at high pressure to crack the rocks beneath, is fiercely opposed by . local residents and green campaigners. They say it will ruin the . environment, creating traffic and pollution, and potentially . contaminating underground water supplies, and increase Britain’s . dependence on fossil fuels. Only one shale project is already underway, with the firm Cuadrilla Resources which has wells near Blackpool. The energy minister is proposing building facilities like this one in Lancashire, across the south of England. An MP has said that people won't want to see gas production in the rolling hills of Surrey . The firm has another licence to drill at a beauty spot near Balcombe, West Sussex, but residents have pledged to ‘fight it all the way’. Analysis by Greenpeace show 38 out of 62 MPs in the shale-rich south have land with existing oil and gas drilling licences - and 35 of them are Conservatives. These are areas highlighted by the British Geological Society as having potential for shale, and a company which is or has expressed an intention to drill has a licence to exploit it. It was revealed last year that in the . northwest, constituencies with shale gas licences include Tatton, home . of chancellor GeorgeOsborne, and north Shropshire, where Owen Paterson, . environment secretary,is MP. Some . MPs are already privately concerned. One Tory said: ‘It’s one thing to . have fracking in the vast plains of America. It’s a whole different . matter when people will see gas production in the rolling hills of . Surrey. A new round of . licences will be handed out next year. Mr Fallon said areas to be . targeted are Bath, South Wales, West Sussex, Hampshire, Kent and an area . of the East Midlands and North East known as the Bowland Shale. Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and Michael Gove's seats in Surrey are likely to be hit by the drilling plans . Jeremy Hunt and Chris Grayling are the MPs for Surrey constituencies. 38 out of 62 MPs in the south already have land with existing drilling licences . The . resource been hailed as an energy revolution which could reduce . Britain’s dependence on expensive imported gas, create tens of thousands . of jobs and possibly lower household fuel bills. The Tories are determined to try and kickstart a shale gas revolution despite the reservations of energy secretary Ed Davey who has said it will not be a ‘silver bullet’ and some energy expects saying it is unlikely to lower bills. Mr Fallon said: ‘It’s not only growth and jobs but the potential for cheaper gas bills for households and industry which has already seen huge benefits in the US. We owe it to the next generation to see if we can make that happen here. ‘It must be safe and properly regulated, and firms will consult the local community, which will receive either a direct reduction in their energy bills or a sizeable cheque for their local area.’ Greenpeace energy campaigner Lawrence Carter said independent experts at Ofgem, Deutsche Bank and even Mr Davey had all agreed it would not lower bills. He said: ‘Fracking clearly has the government’s backing but it across the Tory heartlands, where so far it has been bitterly opposed. When this gets going it will make wind farms look like a walk in the park.’","Energy Minister Michael Fallon said England needs to 'Get Fracking' for new energy sources .

For 100 years, the Chelsea Flower Show has been a showcase for what’s hot in horticulture. This year’s show is no exception – but you’ll literally need to throw in the kitchen sink to keep up with the latest trend. Not to mention a fridge, a woodburning oven and under seat heating… . Yes, outdoor kitchens are the latest must-have for green-fingered hosts who want to impress their guests with something more than a soggy sausage on the barbecue. Or so say the experts. Piping hot: Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver demonstrates his outdoor oven at the horticulture show yesterday . ‘There’s an increasing trend for outdoor living and entertaining, for using the garden as a place where people and families gather,’ said Geoffrey Wheating, director of upmarket garden furniture firm Gaze Burvill which had its new top of the range line on display at the show yesterday. ‘People are entertaining outside more and the British weather is no barrier – you just have to plan how to deal with it.’ It was an overcast day at the show in London yesterday as it celebrated its centenary with a host of VIP guests but the alluring smell of garlic flatbread wafting from a £2,000 wood-burning stove – designed and demonstrated by Jamie Oliver at Mr Wheating’s stand – certainly set Jerry Hall’s taste buds tingling. The supermodel ex-wife of Sir Mick Jagger, dressed in a black leather biker’s jacket, shades and leopard print shoes, made a beeline for the freshly cooked treat. Outdoor life: A Gaze Burvill stand showing a large oval table, sofa and 'A la Carte' kitchen in the background . Behind her was a row of hand-made oak kitchen units housing a fridge by Sub-Zero Wolf, a plate warmer, and enamel sink by Shaws of Darwen. Worktops are available in granite or quartz. A common sight in meadows and hedgerows, cow parsley is often considered to be a nuisance weed in gardens. But the tall, rapidly growing plant with its white flowers is in favour with some designers at Chelsea this year. Other plants in vogue include ragged robin, also often seen in roadside verges, and native wildflowers such as shepherd’s purse and hop. Rhododendrons are also increasingly back in fashion. Other humble varieties that feature predominantly this year include foxgloves and daisies. The kitchens are made to order, with prices on application, but each individual unit including appliance is understood to cost around £3,000. A further £2,145 gets you the snazzy matching kitchen trolley complete with a slot for a champagne bucket. Oak chairs, a table with parasol, . loungers with a ‘classic but contemporary’ look completed the display – . and there was even a grate housing electric heating elements placed in . the floor under the table and seats to keep diners warm. Press . day was also an opportunity for the royals to turn up in force to lend . their support to an unexpected garden designer – Prince Harry. The 28-year-old helicopter pilot was at . Chelsea for the first time with his charity Sentebale, which helps Aids . orphans in impoverished Lesotho. The prince has been closely involved in . the creation of the charity’s garden – even examining designs while . stationed in Afghanistan. Colourful pose: Absolutely Fabulous actress Joanna Lumley was at the show promoting the cause of weeds . Prince Charles looked proud as punch at . his son’s efforts and when Prince Philip arrived Harry said: ‘You were . meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors, Grandpa, I didn’t know . you were coming. Fantastic!’ 'You were meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors, Grandpa, I didn’t know you were coming. Fantastic!' Prince Harry . The prince even teased Philip that a . circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights . was rather like a nightclub podium. ‘Really?’ Philip enquired earnestly. ‘No, Grandpa, they wouldn’t let us,’ Harry joked. Last to arrive was the Queen who was . delighted at her grandson’s efforts but apparently told Harry to send a . few plants to his father’s stumpery at Highgrove as he ‘needed a bit of . greenery’.

The two monks set themselves alight in an assembly hall at the Taktsang Lhamo Kirti monastery, where they died, but details of the female protester's death are not yet known.

The monks at the monastery held prayers for the two who died before their bodies were to be cremated today. Self-immolations in Tibet have become so common in recent months that they happen on an almost weekly basis. There have been 110 self-immolation protests in the fight for an independent Tibet since the first was reported in 2009. The . protests, which sees individuals douse themselves in flammable liquid . and set themselves alight, are reportedly inspired by the acts of . Buddhist monks during the Vietnam war in the 1960s. Tibetans currently have no legal recourse to protest against Chinese rule, making traditional demonstrations impossible. Those who do face severe repercussions, with reports of physical assaults on Tibetans by Chinese security forces. The monastery has become a focal point for protests over the past few months. Another two monks died there recently. Kunchok Phlegay set himself on fire there in December last year and Lobsang Thogme in March this year. More than 110 Tibetans have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Chinese rule and to call for the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, from exile. Opposition to Chinese rule led to a violent uprising in 1959, when Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled to India. China claims that Tibet has always been part of its territory, although Tibet has enjoyed long periods of autonomy. In March another woman, identified as .

Patients who go to the gym and eat their five-a-day should be able to queue-jump NHS waiting lists, a think-tank  has suggested. Those who can prove their lifestyles are healthy would be given priority for all non-emergency appointments, operations and treatment, it said. The think-tank Demos also wants patients on benefits to be given extra cash if they take exercise and eat a balanced diet. Patients should be able to dodge the waiting room queue if they eat their five-a-day a think-tank has suggested . In a report today, it makes a number of controversial recommendations to encourage the public to take responsibility for their own health. The authors point out that the current system is unfair, as patients who don’t make any attempt to be healthy are more likely to need the NHS’s scarce resources. Instead, the think-tank wants  to encourage the public to take regular exercise and eat more fruit and  vegetables by rewarding them for doing so. One suggestion is to allow patients to earn points by going to the gym or buying certain healthy foods at the supermarket. These could then be used by doctors to assess whether they deserved priority treatment on the NHS. Another is to reward patients on benefits with cash top-ups if they could prove they had been to the gym or bought fruit and veg. The think-tank says the Government must take a more radical approach to tackling the obesity epidemic. A quarter of adults are obese although this proportion is expected to double by 2050. Figures also show that the NHS spends an estimated £5.1billion a year on conditions caused by being overweight or obese, such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers. Patients on benefits to be given extra cash if they take exercise it was also recommended in the think-tank report . Max Wind-Cowie, author of the report, said: ‘These proposals are about more than just saving money; they are about helping people make informed decisions and take greater personal and collective responsibility – an attitude that has become even more salient now that there is less in the coffers. ‘Government and the private sector should adopt an enabling and pro-active approach to supporting individuals, families and communities into doing the right thing and taking more responsibility. ‘It is no longer enough to simply step back and assume people will fill the gap. ‘Polling has consistently shown this view strikes a chord with the general public, and these nudge-plus proposals offer some practical idea of how we could see it in action.’ The Government has been criticised for failing to do enough to tackle obesity with the likes of TV chef Jamie Oliver describing policies as ‘utterly inadequate’. Other campaigners have accused ministers of ‘cosying up’ to the food industry by allowing them to set their own rules to limit salt, sugar and fat.","Experts suggest system is unfair and recommend NHS 'points' for treatment .

Lord Lucan’s brother has told the BBC that the fugitive aristocrat died in 2004 and is buried in Africa. Hugh Bingham is said to have made the startling disclosure in an ‘unguarded moment’ after an interview at his Johannesburg home. When the cameras stopped rolling, he was pressed by a journalist on the Inside Out programme about whether Lucan – accused of murdering his children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett, in 1974 – was ‘dead or alive’. Twist: The startling revelation was revealed by Sandra Rivett's son Neil Berriman . Mr Bingham, 72, replied: ‘I know  for a fact  my brother died in 2004 and that his grave is in Africa.’ The alleged admission – which would . mean Lucan was 70 when he died – was revealed by Mrs Rivett’s . 46-year-old son, Neil Berriman. He took part in the same programme . and has remained in close contact with reporter Glenn Campbell, who . interviewed Mr Bingham. Mr Berriman, from Liphook, Hampshire, said . yesterday: ‘The BBC and Glenn Campbell have since been desperate to find . the grave and make another documentary.’ Only two minutes of the 90-minute . interview were broadcast last  December. It is largely unremarkable, . with Mr Bingham repeating his previously aired view that his brother . escaped after Mrs Rivett, 29, was bludgeoned to death at the peer’s . London home. Resources: Detectives thought Lord Lucan, left, fled abroad helped by his powerful friends including billionaire Sir James Goldsmith after the murder of Sandra Rivett, right, . ‘I believe my brother was innocent . but I don’t believe he would commit suicide,’ he said. ‘He was a man of . considerable resourcefulness, so I imagine he used those resources to . remove  himself from the picture.’ But Mr Bingham’s subsequent claim is likely to be seized on by detectives. Police said they were unaware of it last night. The Mail on Sunday has been shown a . 2002 police report that details the  evidence against the Earl and . outlines Scotland Yard’s strategy. It reveals that officers looked into . sightings of Lucan in Mozambique, where he was said to be living under . an assumed name. Africa: Scotland Yard detectives had looked into sightings of Lucan in Mozambique where he was said to be living under an assumed identity . The report says: ‘Recent developments . have included alleged sightings of Lucan in Africa. Enquiries have . yielded photographs of a  person who is the subject of these reported . sightings. ‘With a little imagination, these . photos are sufficiently close to Lucan’s possible appearance to warrant . submission to a facial imaging expert.’ It adds that the man was living on an estate containing a ranch and several small holiday chalets. ‘Locals refer to this complex as Lord . Lucan’s house. Should enquiries be desirable in Mozambique or South . Africa, a potential source (a recent former London Met police officer), . who is familiar with the locale, is available for low-level intelligence . gathering.’ It is believed that Lucan, a . professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife Veronica, from . whom he was estranged, and hit her with lead piping. Lady Lucan was also . attacked but managed to escape. Lord Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect his children, and then drove to a friend’s house in East Sussex. He left hours later and was never . seen again. Detectives have long thought the 7th Earl fled abroad helped . by his powerful friends, including billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Despite sightings across the world, . most detectives who worked on the case believe Africa would have given . the peer the best opportunity of living anonymously. Although Mr Bingham dismissed the . Mozambique sightings, he has said in a previous interview he was ‘sure’ his brother fled to Africa. Last night, he said he did not wish to speak . about his brother. The BBC declined to comment.","Nanny Sandra Rivett was found dead at Lord Lucan's London home in 1974 .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:06 EST, 20 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:06 EST, 20 May 2013 . Owen Paterson has taken the recommendations of an independent task force set up to look at tree and plant health . Ministers are set to ban imports of sweet chestnut trees to prevent a repeat of the ash dieback crisis threatening to devastate Britain’s countryside. The planned embargo from affected countries will help protect Britain from a fungal blight which has already killed most of North America’s four billion sweet chestnuts and is prevalent in much of Europe. The announcement by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was made following the recommendations of an independent task force set up to look at tree and plant health. He also intends to implement a national plant health risk register, which would identify new threats from pests and disease, allowing the authorities to take preventative measures to tackle future outbreaks. There are 44 million sweet chestnuts in Britain, with the tree particularly prevalent in the south-east of the country. Officials hope the sweet chestnut ban, which they hope to impose before the next planting season in the autumn, will stop a repeat of ash dieback. Britain’s 80 million ash - one of the nation’s most common trees - are under threat from a deadly fungus which is spread on wind-blown spores, making it almost impossible to eradicate. Ian Wright, plant health specialist at the National Trust, said it was crucial to keep our stock of sweet chestnut healthy, as the species is one of the main candidates to replace the ash which will be lost. He said: ‘The risk is that everyone will try to plant sweet chestnut and won’t be able to acquire enough of UK grown sweet chestnut and will look to the Continent. But where is sweet chestnut blight? On the Continent. ‘We could have a second crisis on our hands before dealing with the first one.’ Speaking following the announcement of the ban, Mr Paterson said: ‘There are real concerns about this new disease which could be a real threat. We showed that we were going to be serious on ash. ‘It is the first time that a Government has ever put plant disease on the same level as animal disease.’ Experts hope the sweet chestnut ban which they hope to impose before the next planting season in the autumn, will stop a repeat of ash dieback . Ian Boyd, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs said the Government has learnt the lessons of ash dieback which was already present before decisive action was taken, and the ban would put Britain ahead of the sweet chestnut blight. Although pockets of infection have been discovered in Britain, it has so far been successfully tackled. In contrast, the main hope for ash was trees that are disease resistant. Head of the task force, Professor Chris Gilligan, said trees were worth £3.5 billion a year to the British economy and called for the appointment of a chief plant health officer to co-ordinate action. ‘We’ve really got to prioritise the threats in terms of the likelihood, the where, when and how they might arrive, what the impact would be economically and for biodiversity and importantly what we could do about it,’ he said. ‘By increasing our understanding of what pests and diseases are the biggest threats and how best to mitigate their impact, we can minimise potentially devastating outbreaks.’","Embargo from affected countries will help protect British trees from fungus .

Jailing him, Recorder Denis Desmond said: 'You took her property to your home, you came back and you got into her car and then you fell asleep.' Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court Rollinson targeted the house after seeing Miss Goodyear drinking in a pub in Sedgley. The crook knew her home was empty and smashed a side window with a brick to gain access. The missing goods - apart from the camera - were later recovered from Rollinson's home in Sedgley and returned to Miss Goodyear.

Playing dirty: Robert Hartshorne, former top scorer for non-league Glossop North End, controlled a gang who moved cocaine and other drugs around the north-west . A semi-professional footballer who lived a Premier League lifestyle while leading a £1m drugs ring has been jailed. Robert Hartshorne, former top scorer for non-league Glossop North End, was also the leader of a seven-strong criminal gang who moved cocaine and other drugs around the north-west. The 28-year-old, who plied his trade at several non-league teams, owned six houses worth over £600,000, while organising the gang in Hyde, Greater Manchester. When police stormed Hartshorne’s home . in Hyde, they found wardrobes brimming with expensive designer clothing, . over £30,000 worth of designer jewellery and photographs of his many . luxury holidays. The footballer was then arrested, and has since been jailed for 11 years. Officers tried to arrest Hartshorne . earlier as he met with someone at a takeaway in Hyde, but he ran away by . jumping over nearby gardens and fencing. His car was searched, where £5,000 in cash was found along with a passport. In a separate search, police stopped a car driven by another gang member on the A556 in Cheshire, and found £77,000 in cash stashed in a specially-modified boot compartment. Hartshorne was sentenced along with eight other gang members for supplying cocaine. Alan Page, 35, was the last member of the gang to be jailed after a long police investigation. The gang were sentenced to more than . 54 years in prison, after police seized over £900,000 worth of drugs and . £110,000 in cash in a long investigation. All members of the gang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine. Haul: Police recovered cash, including this stash of £77,000, during a long-term investigation into Hartshorne and his gang . Alan Page, Michael Gaskell, Sean Cannon, Michael Tingey, Douglas Merron and Stephanie Merron were sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court. Ill-gotten gains: Police who raided the home of Robert Hartshorne found cash, designer clothes and jewellery . The investigation was launched in November 2010 when police stopped a car in Stockport and recovered a large bag of cocaine, which had a street value of more than £95,000. The fingerprints of Michael Gaskell were discovered on the bag, and the investigation uncovered the dealings of the gang led by Hartshorne. Officers swooped on houses and cars during the investigation, uncovering huge amounts of money and cocaine - up to £345,000 worth at one time. Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Rick Williams from Greater Manchester Police’s Force Drugs Unit said: 'This case clearly illustrates that GMP will go to great lengths in order to bring to justice criminals such as these, who seem to think they are beyond the reach of the law. 'Over many months, this group were evidenced running a highly organised drugs supply business, whereby high quality cocaine was diluted with cheaper adulterants in order to maximise profits and fund the lavish lifestyles of the ringleaders. 'It was the actions of Hartshorne and his criminal associates that caused misery to the lives of the law-abiding members of the local community, and it is for that reason that I take great satisfaction in the sentences handed down to them.'

Last week Alice Fredenham was accused of faking her stage fright to endear herself to the judges. It is not clear whether tenor Richard, 22, and his 19-year-old baritone brother Adam told the show’s producers in advance  that they were more than just ‘sandwich makers’. During their performance on Saturday’s show the jumper-wearing brothers were at pains to emphasise their family roots and humble credentials. Their grandmother Lorna Slack, 70, joined them briefly on stage and couldn’t contain her pride. Interviewed beforehand, Richard explained: ‘We’ve been singing really for three years around the house, as you do. Anywhere and everywhere and really we always sing for Nan.’ Once they got on stage, judge Amanda Holden asked: ‘Have you got a day job?’ Richard replied: ‘Yes, we both work in sandwich shops, don’t we?’ Simon Cowell quipped: ‘So you’re classical sandwich makers.

Like so many others, she decided to take . a chance and play in the Powerball lottery on Wednesday when the . jackpot stood at $360 million. Unllucky draw: Nobody won the $330 million Powerball jackpot on Wednesday night . The next morning, Arrobio tuned into ABC's Good Morning America for the winning numbers and found out that her ticket matched all six. Confusingly for her, the news was reporting that no winning ticket had been sold. 'I called my gas station where I bought the ticket and I said, 'I don't get it. I have every number and yet they say there's no winner,' Ms. Arrobio told KABC. But the store that sold her the . ticket of her dreams neglected to inform her that at 8pm (PDT) on Wednesday night, she was . already too late to enter that evenings draw. The numbers had already been announced. Ms Arrobio said she was first shocked and then disappointed. There have been tales of unlucky lottery losers before.

He had missed making the payment because he was on sick leave for three months due to a back problem. He ended up suing his colleagues after he was told he was not going to get any of the prize.

Britain's largest supplier of caviar is being investigated after one of its most desired products was apparently mislabelled as top-grade caviar when it contained a cheaper quality type. King's Fine Foods, which supplied the incorrectly packaged caviar to Harrods and to Fortnum & Mason, which is the grocer to the Queen, is now under investigation by Richmond Council after a DNA sample taken during a routine inspection of their premises revealed the product had been mislabelled. Among other high profile customers are Buckingham and Kensington palaces, the Ritz, the Groucho Club and Claridge's, although it is not thought that they were sold any of the batch. King's Fine Foods supplied the incorrectly packaged caviar to Harrods and Fortnum & Mason (pictured) The practice of mislabelling caviar could be widespread, as even the most discerning palates appeared to have failed to identify the lesser sturgeon roe, experts warned yesterday. One of the two DNA samples taken from the supplier’s premises in October was from King's sevruga caviar, priced at £1,280 per kg. An analysis revealed that a tin marked as sevruga, the name for roe from the acipenser stellatus breed of sturgeon, contained roe from acipenser ruthenus - a cheaper breed whose eggs are considered inferior. An analysis revealed that a tin marked as sevruga contained roe from a cheaper breed whose eggs are considered inferior . King's has removed the product and sent all its other caviar products for DNA testing, according to the Times. Laura King, the founder and co-owner of King's, said the company had bought the batch in good faith and had asked her supplier for DNA evidence that the sturgeon farmed was stellatus, but she had not received any. She said she contacted Harrods and Fortnum & Mason to say that 'there might be a problem with the Sevruga'. She added: 'Ms King said: 'As a result of this incident, we have written to all our other suppliers, asking for DNA tests to support our purchasing. 'With the exception of a farm in Canada, all the suppliers who have responded to us have informed us that they consider DNA testing unnecessary as they are experts in the farming of the fish concerned. 'Although we value and take very seriously these assurances, we have already taken the decision to implement our own DNA testing programme, to ensure that our customers can be certain of both the nature and quality of caviar that they buy from us. 'The results of our testing programme will be regularly published on our website and sent to all our trade customers.  I am sure that all the other caviar dealers in the UK will now want to follow suit in this regard. ' The caviar trade is now putting pressure on the BBC to re-edit a scene in a forthcoming episode of The Apprentice, in which the winners are given a King's caviar tasting. The tasting features the mislabelled sevruga and. Lucia Fortucci of the BBC's complaints department wrote: 'If you feel that the BBC is endorsing a company which is engaged in an illegal activity it is up to you to bring your complaint to us following the broadcast.'

The deadliest attack occurred when two bombs exploded outside a Sunni Muslim mosque in the Iraqi city of Baquba as worshippers left Friday prayers. It killed at least 43 people and was one of the deadliest attacks in a month-long surge in sectarian violence. Scroll down for video . Devastating: At least 49 people have been killed in Iraq today following two separate devastating bomb attacks at a mosque and funeral procession.

Another eight people were also killed . and more than 20 wounded today when a roadside bomb hit people . gathering for the funeral of a Sunni Muslim cleric killed in Baghdad in . an attack a day earlier. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. Today, one bomb exploded outside the . mosque in Baquba, about 30 miles northeast of the capital Baghdad, and a . second explosion tore into crowds of people rushing to help victims of . the first attack, police said. Local television showed images of bodies, pools of blood and the victims' scattered shoes. 'I . was about 30 metres from the first explosion. When the first exploded, I . ran to help them, and the second one went off. I saw bodies flying and I . had shrapnel in my neck,' said Hashim Munjiz, a college student at the . site. Attacks on Sunni and Shi'ite mosques, security forces and tribal leaders have mounted since troops raided a Sunni protest camp near Kirkuk a month ago, and fears are intensifying of a return to all-out conflict. Horrific: A second explosion tore into crowds of people rushing to help victims of the first attack outside the mosque in Baquba. At least 43 people were killed. This picture shows an injured man being treated in hospital . The increasingly sectarian civil war in . neighbouring Syria is emboldening Iraqi Sunni insurgents and straining . relations between the two Muslim groups in Iraq, where tensions are at . their worst since U.S. troops pulled out at the end of 2011. Shi'ite Islamist militias, which fought U.S. troops for years after the 2003 invasion, have said they are prepared in case they need to return to war. Sunni insurgents also sometimes hit Sunni targets to provoke conflict. Sunni Islamist insurgents and al Qaeda's local wing, Islamic State of Iraq, have stepped up attacks since the start of the year to try to provoke a wide-scale sectarian confrontation like the slaughter that killed tens of thousands of Iraqis in 2006-2007. The Sunni militants accuse Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shi'ite-led government of discriminating against their sect. Grim: A street is littered with bodies in Baquba after the two bombs detonated outside a Sunni mosque . The United Nations said leaders from all groups needed to end the violence. 'Small children are burned alive in cars. Worshippers are cut down outside their own mosques. This is beyond unacceptable,' said U.N. envoy Martin Kobler. April was Iraq's bloodiest month for almost five years, with 712 people killed, according to U.N. figures. Since the American withdrawal, Iraq's coalition government has been caught up in a power struggle between majority Shi'ites, minority Sunnis and ethnic Kurds who split cabinet posts between them. Sunnis, who lost their dominance when the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein, have been protesting for months against Maliki, demanding reforms to tough anti-terrorism laws they say are used to unfairly target their sect. Iraqi Sunni insurgents, some linked to al Qaeda, say they have formed an alliance with the al-Nusra Front Islamist group fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Shame: Deal or No Deal contestant Caroline Banana arriving at court today, where she wept as she admitted benefit fraud . A mother of two who scooped £95,000 on TV’s Deal or No Deal was warned she faced jail today after tearfully admitting being a benefits cheat. Caroline Banana, 40, pleaded guilty at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court to hiding the giant windfall she won on Noel Edmonds’s Channel 4 gameshow. The court heard Banana filled out a benefits form in April 2011, weeks after her appearance was filmed on March 22. On a section of the form which asks applicants to declare any money they are owed, the ex-GP receptionist said she was not due any cash - despite her massive win just weeks before. Banana won the cash on the Channel 4 . programme telling viewers she would use her good . fortune to buy her own home and help her family in Africa. After her win, the mother of two, . from Stoke-on-Trent, hugged host Noel Edmonds and posed for pictures . with him and her husband Michael, 48. Prosecutor Trevor Vernon told the court Banana had submitted the bogus income support claim in April 2011. He said: 'The trigger to the whole episode was Miss Banana completing an income support application on the 12 April 2011. 'To the question ""is there money owed to you or your children?"" she ticked ""no"" on that form. 'This was quite clearly not the case because in March that year she won the £95,000 and was awaiting payment of that money and that payment was due in May.' On the show, each contestant is assigned a numbered box which contains a cash value unknown to them or the audience. During the game, they reject the . other sealed boxes, which contain amounts ranging from 1p to £250,000, . one by one, hoping not to lose the higher value sums. The show’s mysterious ‘banker’ regularly tries to tempt the contestant to ‘deal’ by making offers to . buy their box depending on which sums remain in the game. Scroll down for video . Victory: Banana, pictured with Noel Edmonds after making her deal, appeared in court today and sobbed as she admitted the offences . In the hot seat: Banana failed to tell the authorities about her winnings from Channel 4's show Deal or No Deal . Banana’s box originally contained £250,000 but she accepted a swap that left her with a box containing just £5,000. After initially rejecting a £35,000 offer from the banker, she then sold it to him for £95,000. She said at the time: ‘I felt a  bit nervous [appearing on the show] as it was the moment I was waiting for. ‘When I was walking on stage I could feel myself trembling but when I stood next to Noel I calmed down a little bit. ‘I was thinking that I was not a lucky person but something made me carry on.’ A statement on the show’s website . said the win meant ‘Caroline can buy a home, allow Michael  to finish . his degree and help her family back in Africa’. Just 14 months after her . television appearance, however, Stoke-on-Trent  City Council accused . her of being a benefit cheat. Caroline Banana with Noel Edmonds and her husband Michael on Deal Or No Deal in November 2011 . As well as income support, the court heard that Zimbabwe-born Banana had submitted bogus claims for housing and council tax benefit. In total, the court heard she had claimed £6147.92 in handouts to which she was not entitled between April 8, 2011 and March 23, 2012. She also claimed free school meals - a total of £1,129.90 - between May 2011 and April 2012, but the court heard these are classed separately to other benefits. Caroline Banana struck lucky on the show but was prosecuted after ticking a box saying she was owed no money . Wearing a smart trouser suit and gold earrings, Banana wept as she entered guilty pleas to six fraud charges. Mr Vernon added that the Department for Work and Pensions had received an anonymous tip-off about her win after she was spotted on the show. He said: 'The investigation into Miss Banana’s benefits claim began as a result of an anonymous call saying that she had had appeared on ‘Deal or No Deal’, broadcast in November 2011, and that she’d won a prize of £95000. 'She was interviewed under caution by investigators on the July 7 2012 and to be fair she co-operated and admitted not declaring her employment and admitted she had won £95,000 on the TV show. 'She agreed that she should not have been entitled to the free school meals for her three children.” The court heard that Banana, who previously lived in Stockport, Greater Manchester, had been working for three different employers between September 2011 and December 2011. She was employed by a local GP surgery, hospital and chemist’s in Stoke-on-Trent. Prosecutor Mr Vernon also revealed that Banana had a previous conviction for shoplifting in 2002. District judge David Taylor ordered a pre-sentence report on Banana before passing sentence, but warned her that he may impose a custodial sentence. He said: 'All options are appropriate in this particular case'. David Green, defending, said Banana had a ‘complicated’ home life. He said: 'There is a significant amount of personal mitigation in this case which will be reflected in the (pre-sentence) report.' Judge Taylor bailed Banana and ordered her to return to court next Monday for sentencing. Banana refused to comment outside court.

An art gallery displaying work by Rolf Harris was vandalised after staff told an angry member of the public they would not be removing his pictures because of his arrest on allegations of sexual offences. Officers were called after paint was splashed across the outside of the Triton Gallery in Torquay, Devon. Staff say they first received angry threats from a member of the public who insisted they take the artwork down. Paint attack: Black paint smeared across the window of the gallery in Torquay, Devon, apparently because they are displaying Rolf Harris' work . They refused but when they arrived at work Tuesday they found the window covered with spray paint to obscure the Australian's work. Arrest: Rolf Harris was held by detectives under Operation Yewtree . Harris, 83, was arrested over historical . allegations of sexual offences in relation to Scotland Yard's Operation . Yewtree investigation. The inquiry was launched to probe allegations against Jimmy Savile although his arrest was unrelated to the former DJ. Triton gallery owner David Phelps said he was unfazed by the vandalism and would continue to sell paintings by Harris. Mr Phelps said: 'Someone has put black paint on the window. It is only superficial and has been removed. 'I don't think my staff are perturbed by what's happened and I am not worried at all. 'We are going to continue to sell Rolf Harris' paintings. They are continuing to sell well throughout the country irrespective of the allegations. 'I have checked with the publishers who have over 60 galleries across the country and they have not had any incidents like this anywhere else. Everyone is welcome to their opinion, but the person who has done this is in a massive minority. 'His actions do not reflect the opinions of members of the public who are coming in here.' Devon and Cornwall Police are treating the attack as criminal damage. They said the offender used his hands to smear the paint over the window between 1am and 1.20am on Tuesday. Attack: Police said the damage to the Triton Galleries cost £300 to have repaired. It happened in the early hours of Tuesday . Rolf's work: Paintings by the television personality who has found himself at the centre of a police investigation . A force spokesman said: 'A male suspect has used his hands to smear black paint over the shop window before making off from the scene. 'Damage has been estimated at £300 as specialist cleaning was required. The man is now being sought by police.' Torquay town centre manager Rachael Weaver said: 'I was saddened to hear about the attack on Triton Galleries. 'The gallery is an excellent feature to our harbour-side and does not deserve to be the victim of vandalism by any vigilantes. Probe: A police officer can be seen inside the gallery as an investigation into the vandalism gets underway . 'Rolf Harris has yet to stand trial over the allegations, it's not an excuse to commit a mindless act. This attack would not of directly affected Rolf but a town centre business. 'Torquay is fortunate to have excellent CCTV coverage throughout the town centre so hopefully the person responsible will be caught.' Triton Galleries, which have several galleries across the South West, list Rolf Harris as one of numerous top international artists whose paintings and drawings they stock. Fifteen of his works are currently advertised, including Reflection Eilean Donal Castle, listed at £950, and Single Gum Tree and Devil's Marbles, priced at £575.

A stalker who made a married doctor's life a 'living hell' has been jailed for nearly four years. Raymond Knight, 72, harassed Dr Eleanor Aston for five years, forcing her to quit her job because she was so traumatised. He regularly photographed her when she left work and at . her home, and even followed her husband to a children’s birthday party, . where he stabbed his car tyre with a knife. Mr Knight, who has a delusional disorder, told people that he was having an affair with the married doctor and that he was the father of one of her children. Mr Knight, a former builder, and Dr Aston met in 2006, and . had a normal patient doctor relationship at the Hadwen Medical Centre in . Abbeymead, Gloucester, but a year later Knight began to make . 'inappropriate contact'. He visited more than 1,000 websites in an attempt to find out information about her and started turning up her house unannounced. In June 2009 he was convicted of . harassing Dr Aston by sending her unsolicited cards and flowers and . repeatedly driving to her home. He was given a retraining order in June 2009 - and again in July 2010 and today he pleaded guilty to six counts of breaching the order between June and August 2012. In July 2012 police searched Knight’s . car and found details of Dr Aston’s accountant, a . close friend and a party which her daughter was due to attend. Mr Knight called the friend pretending to be her accountant in his pursuit of the doctor. Dr Aston of Benhall, Gloucestershire, . has since been forced to give up work due to the 'severe psychological trauma' caused by Mr Knight's harassment. Deluded: Raymond Knight believed that his GP was in love with him and had fathered one of his children . Once confident and outgoing doctor, the court heard that she now  'hides behind the sofa' at home because she is scared he is outside. Judge Tabor QC told Mr Knight: 'Your actions have made her life and that of her family a living hell. 'She suffers now of deepest paranoia. You appear to be completely oblivious to the consequences of your actions.' Prosecuting, Kannan Siva said: 'She has become paranoid and jumpy and suffering from insomnia.

'Star Trek: Into Darkness' has warped its way to a $70.6 million domestic launch from Friday to Sunday, though it's not setting any light-speed records with a debut that's lower than the studio's expectations. The latest voyage of the Starship Enterprise fell short of its predecessor, 2009's ‘Star Trek,’ which opened with $75.2 million. Since premiering Wednesday in huge-screen IMAX theaters and expanding Thursday to general cinemas, ‘Into Darkness’ has pulled in $84.1 million, well below distributor Paramount's initial forecast of $100 million. Star Trash? The follow-up to 2009's hit is an easy winner at the box office, but its mission falls short of some analysts' forecasts . The film added $40 million overseas, pushing its total to $80.5 million since it began rolling out internationally a week earlier. The ‘Star Trek’ sequel bumped ‘Iron Man 3’ down to second place after two weekends on top. Robert Downey Jr.'s superhero saga took in $35.2 million domestically to lift its receipts to $337.1 million. Overseas, ‘Iron Man 3’ added $40.2 million, raising its international total to $736.2 million and its worldwide tally to nearly $1.1 billion. While ‘Iron Man 3’ and ‘Into Darkness’ did well overseas, they were outmatched by the debut of Baz Luhrmann's ‘The Great Gatsby,’ which followed its domestic debut a week earlier with a wide rollout internationally. ‘Gatsby’ pulled in $42.1 million overseas, coming in a bit ahead of both ‘Iron Man 3’ and ‘Into Darkness.’ Crash and burn: The opening weekend fell short of forecasts, which projected a weekend haul of $90 million to $100 million . Domestically, ‘Gatsby’ held up well at No. 3 with $23.4 million, lifting its total to $90.2 million. In today's Hollywood of bigger, better sequels, follow-up films often outdo the box office of their predecessors, as each ‘Iron Man’ sequel has done. While ‘Into Darkness’ earned good reviews and is getting strong word-of-mouth from fans, the film did not quite measure up to the opening weekend of director J.J. Abrams' ‘Star Trek’ reboot from four years ago, at least domestically. 'Star Trek' remains a fan-boy movie. It doesn't seem to have the same kind of cross-over appeal as say an `Iron Man' or some of these others,’ said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com. ‘It's a very specific brand, but I think the general public would love this movie, because it's such an action movie. But to get a hundred-million-plus opening weekend, unless you're `Twilight,' you really have to cross over to all audiences.’ Failure: Four years of anticipation and help from 3D ticket prices hasn't given Into Darkness much of a boost . Paramount points out that overseas business is up in many markets, though, so that worldwide, the sequel is off to a better start. ‘Because of the nature of the franchise, because of how many movies have been made and the various forms of the TV shows, I'm not sure that `Star Trek' goes by the rules of normal sequels. I think each movie stands on its own, because it's a unique franchise,’ said Don Harris, Paramount's head of distribution. ‘My goal was always that we grow the franchise. We're clearly seeing by today's numbers that the movie is being embraced on a worldwide basis in a way we've never seen before.’ Harris said that domestically, ‘Into Darkness’ finished its first weekend 6 percent ahead of revenues for 2009's ‘Star Trek,’ which got a head-start with $4 million in Thursday night previews to give it a $79.2 million haul through the first Sunday. Actor Chris Pine: An impressive 89% of moviegoers on Rottentomatoes.com said they liked the movie . Actress Zoe Saldana arrives at the Premiere: Analysts have suggested the disappointing debut could force a quick exit from theaters .

But the man who looks after Kate Middleton’s hair has confessed that in the race for most popular haircut, the Duchess of Cambridge is beaten by ‘The Rachel’. Twenty years after it was first made famous by Jennifer Aniston in hit American sitcom Friends, the style is still regarded by Richard Ward as the one that women really wanted. Most wanted: Jennifer Aniston sporting the famous Rachel cut in 1996, left, and, right, Kate Middleton whose hair hairdresser Richard Ward praised as 'beautiful' The Chelsea-based hairdresser, whose team has tended to the tresses of not just Kate but the entire Middleton family, was speaking at the launch of shopping site tothetops.com . He said: ‘I really don’t remember another time in my whole career where people have come in and asked for a haircut as many times as they have asked for a Rachel. Not even people wanting their haircut like Kate Middleton and she has the most beautiful hair.’ He added the only other celebrity style to have come close to The Rachel was the bob Victoria Beckham sported a few years ago. The royal-mother-to-be is a loyal client at Mr Ward’s salon and it is believed he even cut in the fringe she debuted last November days before she confirmed she was pregnant. Mr Ward said: “I’ve done so many . celebrity haircuts that I’m proud of- Kate Middleton being one of them . but, you know what, if I could actually create something like the Rachel . – Jennifer Aniston’s haircut in Friends - or Meg Ryan’s haircut, those . kind of classic haircuts I wouldn’t work any more.’ Last week the man behind Miss Aniston’s most famous hairstyle revealed he was high when he created ‘The Rachel’. Chris McMillan made the confession during an interview saying 'I'm 14 years sober - so I feel safe enough to say that.' Mr McMillan created the cut for Miss Aniston, 44, for the role of Rachel Green in hit TV show Friends, between the first and second seasons of the sitcom. The Rachel duly became one of the most requested styles in salons around the world during the 1990s and according to one poll remains the most popular of all time among British women. In interviews with the US media, Mr McMillan said he designed the look because Miss Aniston’s hair was originally long and frizzy.","Kate Middleton is a loyal client at Richard Ward's Chelsea salon .

The ancient Egyptians had prosthetic toes - and they still hold up today, according to research from the University of Manchester. Two ancient replica toes - one found on the foot of a mummy - suggested that the Egyptians were had prosthetic body parts. Now, for the first time in nearly 3,000 years, researchers have tried 'Walking like an Egyptian' - and confirmed the replica toes did help those missing one of their own, particularly when wearing sandals. False toe: The replica, presumed to date from around 950BC, was found near on a mummy in Lexor . Researcher Dr Jacky Finch wanted to find . out how successful the two discovered toes were at helping people walk. The first toe was created from wood and leather, and dates from between 950 to 710BC, and was found on a female mummy buried near Luxor in Egypt. The second one is the Greville . Chester artificial toe from before 600BC, and made of cartonnage (a sort . of papier maché mixture made using linen, glue and plaster). Both display . significant signs of wear and their design features also suggest they . may have been more than cosmetic additions. Dr Finch says: 'Several experts have examined these objects and had suggested that they were the earliest prosthetic devices in existence. 'There are many instances of the ancient Egyptians creating false body parts for burial but the wear plus their design both suggest they were used by people to help them to walk.' The toe, seen here both attached and un-attached, appears to have been designed to be worn with sandals . Dr Finch, who is based in the Faculty of Life Sciences' KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology, recruited two volunteers who were both missing their right big toe. Design replicas of the ancient toes were made to fit each volunteer along with replica leather ancient Egyptian style sandals. The tests were carried out at the Gait Laboratory at Salford University's Centre for Rehabilitation and Human Performance Research. Each volunteer was asked to walk on a 10 metre walkway bare foot, in their own shoes and wearing the replicas with and without the sandals. Their movement was tracked using 10 cameras and the pressure of their footsteps was measured using a mat. The 10 best walking trials were recorded for each foot, using their normal left foot as the control. Walk like an Egyptian: The big toe was put to use, with volunteers saying the replica sandals made for a comfortable walking experience . It was surprising how well both volunteers were able to walk using these devices although one volunteer performed much better than the other. The camera footage revealed that when wearing the sandals with the cartonnage replica, one of the volunteers achieved 87 per cent of the flexion achieved by their normal left toe. The three part wood and leather design produced nearly 78 per cent. Interestingly the ability to push off using the prosthetic toe was not as good when this volunteer wasn't wearing the sandals. The second volunteer was still able to produce between 60-63 per cent flexion wearing the replicas with or without the sandals. An . ancient Egyptian kingdom close to the Nile collapsed more than 4,200 . years ago because it failed to adapt to climate change, according to new . research. During Egypt’s Old Kingdom - the . pyramid-building time - 4,200 years ago, droughts and fires plagued the . region, causing famine and social unrest. Scientists examined 7,000-year-old . ancient pollen and charcoal samples from the Nile to piece together the . time - and found evidence of a 'mega drought' in the the area. Marcia McNutt, of the US Geological . Survey (USGS), said: 'Even the mighty builders of the ancient pyramids . more than 4,000 years ago fell victim when they were unable to respond . to a changing climate. 'This study illustrates that water . availability was the climate-change Achilles Heel then for Egypt, as it . may well be now, for a planet topping seven billion thirsty people.' When wearing the replicas the pressure measurements showed that for both volunteers there were no overly high pressure points. This indicated that the false toes were not causing any undue discomfort or possible tissue damage. However, when the volunteers wore just the replica sandals without the false toes the pressure being applied under the foot rose sharply. Dr Finch says: ""The pressure data tells us that it would have been very difficult for an ancient Egyptian missing a big toe to walk normally wearing traditional sandals. 'They could of course remained bare foot or perhaps have worn some sort of sock or boot over the false toe, but our research suggests that wearing these false toes made walking in a sandal more comfortable.' Alongside the test data Dr Finch also asked her volunteers to fill in a questionnaire about how they felt when doing the trials in the gait laboratory. Despite it having performed well the comfort scores for the cartonnage replica were disappointing although it was felt to be an excellent cosmetic replacement. Describing the performance of the three part wooden and leather toe both volunteers found this one to be extremely comfortable, scoring it highly, one volunteer commenting that with time he could get used to walking in it. Assessing the volunteers' experience Dr Finch said: ""It was very encouraging that both volunteers were able to walk wearing the replicas. 'Now that we have the gait analysis data and volunteer feedback alongside the obvious signs of wear we can provide a more convincing argument that the original artefacts had some intended prosthetic function.' The findings from this study, which have been published in full in the Journal of Prosthetics and Orthotics, means the earliest known prosthetic is now more likely to come from ancient Egypt. The three part example pre-dates by some 400 years what is currently thought to be the oldest, although untested, prosthetic device. This is a bronze and wooden leg that was found in a Roman burial in Capua, Southern Italy. That has been dated to 300 BC although only a replica now remains as the original was destroyed in a bombing raid over London during the war.","Disabled volunteers tested replicas of Egyptian false toes - and found them good enough for daily use .

Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Paul McCartney have today spoken out about how they believed Jimmy Savile was creepy and disliked him during the 40 years they knew him. Both stars spent time with the paedophile at various points of their professional lives but were convinced he was a 'suspect' character. Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce said today: 'I never liked him' and expressed his sadness that Savile used charity work to build a saint-like reputation when in reality he was a child-abuser with hundreds of victims. Meanwhile Sir Paul has revealed that The Beatles had spent long periods with Savile as he had compered some of their UK shows in the 1960s but they thought his behaviour was strange. Bizarre: Jimmy Savile acted as the Beatles' MC at the height of their fame but the group thought he was a very strange man. George in particular looks less than impressed in this photo from the 1960s. In unison: Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir Paul McCartney have both spoken out today and said that they were unsure of Jimmy Savile and believed he was a strange and unlikeable . At the height of Beatlemania they toured the country in their van and sometimes gave Savile a lift home because they found him 'entertaining', but the DJ would refuse to let them inside for a drink or toilet break. 'When he’d gone we thought why doesn’t he let us in, what is it, because most people would have let us in that we gave a lift to,' he told the Independent, adding: 'We always thought there was something a little bit suspect.' He also spoke about the sexual climate of the 1960s and 1970s, but said he, John, George, Paul and Ringo were very clear that there was never any underage sex. 'We knew with under 16s it was illegal, so we didn’t do it', adding, 'There was a definite no-no involved in underage kids and that the Beatles had so many adult groupies it was never an issue.' Meanwhile in a separate interview today Sir Bruce Forsyth declared from the moment he met the Top Of The Pops host: 'I never liked him. I can honestly say that.' Admission: Sir Paul said when the Beatles toured Britain with Sir Jimmy Savile at times but he would not let them in his house . The pair were two of the BBC's biggest stars but never saw eye-to-eye. 'There was something very difficult to like. It wasn't because he was so brash about everything,' he told The Sun. 'He had this manner that you thought: ""What is behind this man? Now we know what was behind it all - which is terrible to find out'. Jimmy Savile raised as much as £40million for charity is his lifetime, but Sir Bruce said today those who trusted him will be very hurt by the revelations since his death. He set up the Jimmy Savile Charitable . Trust and Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust but both have . been left destroyed by his legacy of abuse. 'I feel sorry for his family and the charity people that put so much trust in him. But of course he was making so much money.' In .

Some . were abused at his home, others in schools and hospitals he visited, . and the broadcaster even groped or raped on BBC premises. It . later emerged that the BBC's Newsnight was also probing his abuse but . the investigation was dropped just after her died, at the same time as . the corporation ran tributes to the DJ around Christmas 2011.

'The trust is pro-actively working with the police to fully support their investigation.

Cry for help: A letter from an 11-year-old telling of her fears at having her 'private cut' has been published by campaigners against female genital mutilation (file picture) A heart-breaking letter from an 11-year-old girl begging for a charity for help to avoid female genital mutilation reveals the very real threat for many girls in the UK. The girl’s cry for help was prompted by her discovery that her 12-year-old sister had been taken to her grandmother’s home in Gambia, west Africa for the procedure. 'I really hope you can help me, not to have my private cut,' she writes after discovering her sister's horrific fate. The letter, sent in 2010, was today . published by campaigners in a bid to alert teachers to the importance of . reporting suspicions of female genital mutilation (FGM) to the authorities. In . the letter to charity Equality Now, the 11-year-old girl says her . sister ‘had her private cut’ by her aunties and grandmother in their . native Gambia. She explains . how her mother, sisters and brothers came to the UK from west Africa in . 2005 to join her father who was studying at university in the UK. Five . years later, as the family was watching a ‘TV programme on African . culture showing girls having their privates cut’, she describes how her . sister suddenly burst into tears and a few days later told their father . what had happened. ‘She said it was done one weekend by my aunties at my nans house. Last Friday mum took her to our GP to have her checked and the doctor said it was done to her.’ According to the 11-year-old’s letter, the older sister had been told ‘the spirits will come and kill her immediately’ if she spoke of the procedure. The little girl got in touch with the charity after telling one of her school teachers, who directed her to Equality Now. ‘Please madam help me, and my dad,’ she begs. ‘I really hope you can help me, not to have my private cut.’ ‘I am reallye confused expessically seeing my dad so un-happy and not knowing what to do.(sic)’ After they received the letter in 2010, the charity contacted police and the girl is now believed to be safe. No . prosecution has been brought but this is believed to be due to the . perpetrators, the girl’s aunts and grandmother, being overseas at the . time police were alerted, and difficulty obtaining evidence. Heartbreaking letter: 'Please madam help me, and my dad,' she begs. 'I really hope you can help me, not to have my private cut' ‘Practising communities think that the UK doesn’t have the guts to prevent and prosecute for FGM,’ Efua Dorkenoo, director of Equality Now’s campaign against FGM, told the Evening Standard. ‘The key reasons for the lack of prosecutions are the young age of those involved and the fact that FGM is a hidden practice within families and affected communities.’ Following the revelation in her letter that her teacher advised her to contact the charity instead of reporting the incident, Efua Dorkenoo, director of Equality Now’s campaign against FGM, warned teachers that they must alert authorities if a child displays any indication of having fallen victim of female genital mutilation. ‘If (teachers) and other frontline professionals do this, we will get prosecutions and come closer to ending this horrific abuse,’ Ms Dorkenoo added. Female gender mutilation was made illegal in 1985 in the UK but Equality Now estimates that 24,000 girls in the UK are at risk. 8th November 2010 . Dear MadamMy name is XXX and I am 11 years old. I and my mum, sisters and brother came to England in 2005 when I had just turned 6 years old to join my dad who was at University. We come from Gambia in West Africa. Three weeks ago we were watching a TV programme on African culture and as they were showing girls having their privates cut, my older sister who is 12 years old started crying. After 2 days she told my dad that she also had her private cut. Mum and Dad never knew about it and she was told if she ever tells anyone the sprits will come and kill her immediately. She said it was done one weekend by my aunties at my nans house. Last Friday mum took her to our GP to have her checked and the doctor said it was done to her. This morning when I went to school I told one of my teachers about it and together we went on the computer and found your group. The teacher asked me to write to you and ask for your help. I don’t want my private cut by anyone. My dad loves us very much and he did not like what they done to my sister and he is very confussed. We should be going back to Gambia any time after Eid and he is worried and upset that they would do the same to me. I don’t what that too. If you reply to this letter I will showe my dad and I am shore that he would be very glad to have your help. He is my best friend and if he knows what to do he would do it, he would not want anything to hurt us – I know that. Please madam help me, and my dad.

But now it looks like the 10-year-old could truly be a life saver, after donating his bone marrow to his little brother who has leukaemia. All of Aston's family, from Church Gresley, in Derbyshire, were tested to see if they could help him, but it was Dane who turned out to be the best match. Dane Bradford-Disney (left) was a perfect bone marrow match for his little brother six-year-old Aston, who has leukaemia . Aston is still desperately ill in hospital and his family are by his bedside anxiously waiting to see if his body will accept the tissue. The family described Dane as 'a total hero' after the operation went ahead at Sheffield Children’s Hospital last week. Aston needed a bone marrow transplant to give him a chance of going into remission after a programme of chemotherapy failed to beat the childhood cancer. After family members flocked to offer their assistance Dane proved to be a perfect match, and gave up his bone marrow in an operation last week. Little Aston remains in hospital, with his father, Mark Disney, a constant presence at his side. The boys’ aunt, Sharon Hussain, from Burton, said: 'Aston has handled it all amazingly and doesn’t moan or complain about anything. He’s a little superstar. 'When we were told he would need a donor we all said straight away we’d do it. It turned out two of his brothers were a perfect match, so we chose the eldest. 'Dane is a total hero but he just wanted to make his brother better. I’m sure when they are older they will really appreciate each other. 'For . all the chemotherapy he’s had Aston has done really well, and was in . remission and out running around before his operation, so to see him at . the weekend and how poorly he was, it just made me cry.'

The family say Dane is 'a total hero' after the operation went ahead at Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) last week . While Dane is now out of hospital, the family are anxiously monitoring Aston’s condition at Sheffield Children’s Hospital. Mrs Hussain said: 'His body has got to accept the bone marrow into the system, because it’s a foreign body. It’s just a waiting game now.' Diagnosed with leukaemia in June, the youngster has spent most of the past five months on the children’s cancer ward at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, and his family are planning a series of fund-raising efforts to thank the staff there who cared for him.

Police in charge of keeping the Olympics safe have lost the keys to Wembley Stadium. Scotland Yard admitted last night that it was to blame for the shocking breach. Search teams spent days desperately hunting for the keys after they were mislaid during the final preparations for the Games. Farce: Police who are responsible for looking after Olympic venues have admitted that they have lost the keys to Wembley stadium . The announcement of the lost keys came hours after Great Britain beat the UAE in a match at Wembley in the group stages of the competition . Celebrating: Ryan Giggs scored the first goal for Great Britain in their 3-1 win . Sources said it would cost up to £40,000 to replace the hi-tech laser keys. The latest fiasco threatened to further damage already fragile confidence in security arrangements for the Games. It also provoked a furious behind-the-scenes row between the police, Locog and private security firm G4S over who was responsible. But late last night, Scotland Yard admitted a team of officers mislaid the ‘internal security keys’ during last minute checks. Claims that a set of keys were lost at the Wimbledon Championships in similar circumstances were flatly denied by tennis bosses and G4S. It is the latest blow to Olympic security after serious questions were raised about the £284million Government contract with G4S to secure the Games. Military personnel were drafted in after the firm admitted it could not supply enough guards. More than £600million has been spent securing Games venues, using more than 13,000 police officers from across Britain. Special guests: Prince William and David Beckham watched the match at the stadium . Beckham's son Brooklyn also watched the game alongside his father . The Met said staff discovered the Wembley Stadium keys had been lost last Tuesday as final preparations were made for Olympic football matches at the venue. It originally said officers were ‘alerted’  to the loss at lunchtime, sparking a criminal inquiry over fears they were stolen. But a spokesman later admitted the keys had been mislaid earlier that day by a police team who had returned to check the venue several weeks after it had been secured and sealed by colleagues. The officers then spent several days at Wembley Stadium retracing their steps and trying to find the missing set of keys. One source said: ‘These were hi-tech laser keys which cost anything up to £40,000 a set as they cannot be copied. They are the same as you get at prisons.’ Denial: Claims that a set of keys were lost at the Wimbledon championships in similar circumstances were flatly denied by tennis bosses and G4S . In action: Andy Murray during his victory in the first round of the Olympic tennis tournament yesterday afternoon . Support: Fans were out in force to back Murray in his straight sets victory over Stanislas Wawrinka . A Met spokesman said: ‘On July 24, officers from the Olympic policing operation at Wembley Stadium reported that internal security keys which had been used by them as part of a search were missing. ‘Officers attended the venue to assist in the search for the missing items but nothing was found. ‘Detectives also went to ascertain if there was any evidence of criminal offences, however at that time there were none.’ A spokesman for Games organisers Locog said: ‘These were internal keys, locks have been changed and the security of the venue has not been compromised in any way.’ A spokesman for G4S said: ‘We have no record of losing any keys.’","Search teams hunt desperately for keys after they were lost during final preparations for the Games .

They are less than a month old but the Turner quads are already getting used to beating the odds. First their parents Julian and Sharon went through four rounds of IVF – and all their savings – to conceive them. Then they survived being born by emergency caesarean more than 11 weeks prematurely, with each weighing just over 2lb, after their mother developed complications in the pregnancy. Hello little brother: James Turner, left, was the first of the quads born, followed by his identical twin Joshua. Both weighed 2lb 4oz . When nurses revealed they were expecting quadruplets, sales director Mr Turner, 43, and his wife were overjoyed and stunned . And to cap it all, James, Joshua, Lauren and Emily are two sets of identical twins – a one in 70million occurrence. Mr and Mrs Turner married in 2007 and when their attempts to conceive naturally were unsuccessful, they decided to try IVF treatment. The first three rounds failed but finally last year, after spending a total of £40,000, 36-year-old Mrs Turner fell pregnant at the fourth attempt. Until the 12-week scan, the couple, from Upper Lambourn, Berkshire, believed they were having only one baby. When nurses revealed they were expecting quadruplets, sales director Mr Turner, 43, and his wife were overjoyed – and stunned. ‘I just couldn’t believe it. It was like it was a dream,’ said Mrs Turner, a foreign exchange team leader at Heathrow. ‘I was over the moon, so happy, but at the same time it didn’t feel like it was happening to me.’ Julian and Sharon Turner welcomed Emily, the twin sister of Lauren, who weighed 2lb 4oz . Lauren was the heaviest of the quads, weighing 2lb 6oz after she and her siblings were born prematurely . Son: James was the first of the four babies to be born, weighing just 2lb 4oz . Next! Joshua, 2lb 4oz, then followed his slightly older, and identical brother James into the world . But specialists at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford put a dampener on their happiness by pointing out some stark realities about the difficulty of carrying quads. Mrs Turner said: ‘They gave us three options: get rid of all of them, get rid of two of them or keep them. There was no way we could get rid of them. We were happy to let nature take its course.’ Then during a routine check-up last month, doctors found that Mrs Turner, who had not been due to give birth until June 13, had pre-eclampsia – a dangerous high blood pressure complication – and a low blood platelet count. On March 30 doctors performed an emergency caesarean. ‘There were no guarantees but they said they hoped they would all survive and be okay,’ said Mrs Turner, who was 29 weeks into her pregnancy. James was first, weighing 2lb 4oz followed by his identical twin Joshua, 2lb 4oz, Lauren, 2lb 6oz and Emily, 2lb 4oz. Proud dad: Smiling father Julian and mum Sharon hold the two sets of identical twins in the hospital room where they are caring for their children . Hard work: Look after the pairs of identical twins is, as you can imagine, taking the family some time already . Mr Turner, who watched the births, said: ‘It was slightly like an out of body experience, being there and watching it was unreal. ‘I was largely excited but very concerned about whether everything was going to be okay. It was great that they were out and crying but there was a little way to go.’ Mrs Turner said: ‘What was hard for me was that I couldn’t see the babies until the day after. I heard each one crying as they came out and then they got whisked away and checked over and taken to the special care baby unit.’ Relief: The survival of Sharon's four babies defied the odds by living after being born nearly three months early . Doing well: After being cared for by staff at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Joshua and his sibling are growing stronger all the time . Complications: Boys James and Joshua had breathing difficulties but soon recovered and the twins were all home within weeks . On the second night after they were born, both the boys developed difficulties breathing but quickly recovered. Mr Turner said: ‘After about day five or day six we began to feel a bit more optimistic.’ The couple expect to be able to take their quads home from the special baby unit at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading within weeks. Mr Turner, one of triplets himself, said: ‘We are ecstatic, words can’t describe the feeling. It’s all good news. They are doing well and getting bigger and stronger which is the main thing. Eventually we will get them home.’ They are confident of coping with the demands of mass late-night feeds and nappy changes. ‘My mum and dad have sold their house and moved in with us to help us out,’ said Mrs Turner. The couple plan to buy a much bigger car and say shopping has been bewildering. ‘I suppose it starts to hit home when you go into Mothercare,’ Mr Turner said. ‘When you tell the staff you’re having four, they just look at you blankly.’","Born 11 weeks prematurely weighing just over 2lb .

A teenager who was struck down with an agonising bowel condition says dancing has helped him to overcome his debilitating illness. Macaulay Selwood, 17, was diagnosed with Crohn's two years ago and was so unwell that he was often left in agony on the floor unable to move. But his determination to continue his promising dancing career gave him the spur he needed to battle through. Lord of the Dance: Macaulay at his practice studio. He was diagnosed with Crohn's in September 2010 after collapsing in agony during a dance class . Recovery: 'Dancing has helped me overcome it (Crohn's). It kept me motivated' Now the teenager from Bristol has made it to the finals of the Irish dancing world championships in Boston, USA, and is hotly-tipped for glory. He will then have a trial at the famous performing arts school, ArtsEd, in London. At shows he has been compared with Riverdance star Michael Flatley while others have taken to calling him Billy Elliot, after the film character who overcomes the odd to becoming a dancing star. Macaulay did ballet at college before focusing on Irish dancing for the world championships and works at Tesco to fund his passion. In 2010 he won the British and American national . championships and came second in the world championships. But that September he suddenly started suffering from terrible stomach cramps. 'I was at a dance class and I fell to the floor screaming in agony,' he said. He stopped going to school for eight weeks and his weight dropped two stone after he struggled to eat. He was diagnosed with Crohn's, which is a bowel disease caused by inflammation of the lining of thedigestive system. It can cause painful symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fatigue, recurring diarrhoea and weight loss. High-flyer: Macaulay, from Bristol, hopes to win the Irish dancing world championships . Doctors were able to stabilise his condition with a series of injections and iron tablets . 'When it comes on you can't do anything,' he said. 'I didn't end up eating because I was worried about the pain. It was pretty debilitating for me - I was scared, I thought my life was over. 'I was such a healthy kid - it was a shock when I got it because I'm so active. It was overwhelming for me, I thought my dance career was over. I didn't expect to be better now.' The teenager, who has been dancing since he was six, was treated at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, before continuing his treatment at Bristol Royal Infirmary. Doctors were able to stabilise his condition with a series of injections and iron tablets. He is now able to manage his condition and is able to perform at competitions again. He hopes to one day become a professional dance and join touring shows. Macaulay said: 'Dancing has helped me overcome it - if it wasn't for dancing I wouldn't be as well now. 'It kept me motivated - because I wanted to get back to it. I didn't let it beat me.'","Macaulay Selwood, 17, first starting suffering from Crohn's disease in 2010 .

Myleene Klass is embroiled in a bitter legal battle with her estranged husband as they hammer out the final details of their divorce. It is understood that businessman Graham Quinn, who provides security for pop stars including JLS and Bruce Springsteen, is demanding the entire proceeds from the sale of their five-bedroom detached property as part of the settlement. Classically trained musician and TV presenter Miss Klass, 35, is believed to have bought the house in Cuffley, Hertfordshire, in her own name for £1.2 million in December 2009. Bitter: Myleene Klass and her estranged husband Graham Quinn, are embroiled in a legal row as they hammer out the final details of their divorce. The couple, pictured in 2005, were together for 11 years but married for just six months . Legal battle: Mr Quinn is demanding the entire sum from the sale of their five bedroom home, which was believed to have been bought in her name . Neighbours in the area include England and Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe and Sir Terry Leahy, the former chief executive of Tesco. The house was put on the market with an asking price of £2.5 million just weeks after the couple split in April last year. It was sold in January for £1.8 million. Since then Miss Klass and her daughters – five-year-old Ava Bailey and two-year-old Hero Harper – have been renting an £8,000-a-month house in Highgate, North London. Miss Klass, who shot to fame as part of the pop group Hear’Say, is said to have offered Irish-born Mr Quinn, 39, half the proceeds from the sale of the house as a goodwill gesture, but he is demanding the entire sum. Wealth: Myleene has built up an estimated personal fortune of £11 million from television deals such as her appearance on 'I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here' and promotional deals . Rise To Fame: Myleene shot to fame as part of the pop group Hear'Say with, from left to right, Suzanne Shaw, Danny Foster, Kym Marsh and Noel Sullivan .

It’s a lot of money.’ Miss Klass and Mr Quinn were together for 11 years, but were married for only six months before he walked out. His lawyer said: ‘My client has no comment to make about matters relating to his private life.’ And a spokesman for Miss Klass declined to comment. In an interview with The Mail on  Sunday last October, the singer said  that going through the marriage breakdown was as painful as being shot through the heart. ‘When it first happened and I was in the middle of the storm I was just so very, very hurt,’ she said. ‘I felt that I would sooner have taken a bullet. Actually, at the beginning, every morning when I woke up,  I thought that I had taken a bullet to my heart.’ Out and about: This week Myleene was seen filming an episode of Lemonade at Thorpe Park in Surrey with Leigh Francis, aka Keith Lemon .

A model railway fan has been ordered to dismantle his £10,000 train set in his loft by his housing association on health and safety grounds. Father-of-three Robert Burdock, 61, has 63 locomotives which whizz along 70ft of track around the perimeter of his attic. His train set includes hand-crafted stations, depots, streets and tiny figures - which are all enjoyed by his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Train enthusiast: Robert Burdock, 61, with his model train set in his attic in Buckfastleigh, Devon . Models: The track which runs round the perimeter of Robert's attic is 70feet long. He had been ordered to take it down by his housing association . But a social housing firm now says . Robert has made 'alterations' to the two-bed 1950s property in . Buckfastleigh, Devon, without permission - breaching strict planning . regulations. Robert, who has lived in the home for . fourteen years, says a housing official arrived to inspect a leaky . chimney and told him the train set had to go. They want the set removed while they . carry out a safety assessment - but Robert would rather be evicted than . tear up his treasured track. Retired builder Robert said: 'I've . been building train sets since I was 11. It's been a lifelong passion of . mine and I take a real pride in creating things. 'When I moved into this house I . decided I needed a project to keep me going as a hobby and I decided to . build a railway in the loft. 'Some people like to spend their money down the pub or play a few games of snooker, but for me I build railways. 'I've made much of the scenery myself and spent anything from £8,000 to 10,000 on it. Miniature station: The stations and depots are all hand-crafted and there are even model people . Steaming: The train set, which includes 63 locomotives, must be taken apart, Robert has been told . Intricate: Robert has been building model train sets for the last 40 years and started building his current set in his loft 14 years ago . 'There's absolutely no way I'm taking it down now - if they want to evict someone over a train set that's up to them.' Robert's woes began when he rang . Teign Housing to report a leaking chimney at the £140,000 ex-council . property where he lives with his disabled wife Linda, 64. He says the only work he's ever done . to make room for the train set was to put down flooring and replace a . single, faulty electrical socket. Robert, who retired due to ill . health, said: 'They have said that unless I dismantle the railway, they . will send in their workman to pull it apart so they can put right the . changes I've made. 'All I've done is put down flooring . that meets all the required regulations and I've even coated the little . buildings I make in fire-retardant. Control panel: Robert has been ordered to take the set apart - but has challenged his housing association to try and evict him rather than take the set apart . Eviction? Robert Burdock, who lives in this housing association property in Buckfastleigh, Devon, has vowed to keep his model train set together - even if he faces being thrown out of his property . 'Everything is based on trestle . tables. I've not damaged a thing. This house was a tip when I moved in. I've spent thousands down the years doing it up.

An obese mother shed three stone and transformed her shape after her four-year-old daughter gave her blunt opinion about her size. Laura Middleton, 25, was just shy of 15st and dreaded going to the park with her little girl Amy. She suffered from asthma and would be left exhausted by the mildest activity. But she was shocked when her daughter bluntly told one day last spring: 'You're too wobbly, mummy - you eat far too much.' Transformed: Laura before she decided to tackle her figure (left) and on the last day of her bootcamp (right) Today: Laura now cuts a far trimmer figure in the playground with her daughter Amy . It was the stark wake-up call she needed. She decided to spend her savings and a recent inheritance on an eight-week stay at a weight-loss boot camp. After dropping her daughter off with relatives, she headed to the No1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, where a gruelling diet and fitness regime meant she was losing 1lb a day. A typical day consisted of circuit training, spinning, boxing and a hikes of up to six miles. The camp specialises in military physical training with former Royal Marines as fitness instructors. She tucked into a diet that added up to 1,000-1,200 calories a day, with meals such as caluflower soup and salmon with Chinese vegetables. In less than two months, Ms Middleton had lost almost three stone –  going down from 14st 9lb to her current weight of 11st 11lb. Her dress size went from a bulky 16 to a far more shapely 12. She had shaved inches all her problem areas, with her waist measurement dropping from 37"" to 34"" and her hips slimming down from 41.5"" to 37"". Laura with her daughter Amy, whose brutal honesty forced her to take stock of her health . The punishing bootcamp was designed by former Royal Marines but Laura (right) loved it . Toning up: Laura after one week at the bootcamp (left) and after several weeks of intensive workouts (right) After leaving the camp, which cost £3,500, she found she could play in the park with her daughter without getting tired. 'I was like a completely new woman,' she said. 'But the most satisfying thing for me was seeing Amy’s reaction. She told me: ""Mummy, you are beautiful – your fat tummy has gone."" The single mother, who is studying for a degree in public sector management in York, piled on the pounds over many years. She said: 'I didn’t particularly eat unhealthily, I just ate too much. I was eating for four people. And my weight just kept on going up and up. 'I hated what I was doing to myself, but whatever I tried I couldn’t seem to shift it.' She tried various popular diets and slimming clubs but found none of them worked for her. She . said: 'I was suffering quite badly from depression and my obesity was . so bad that they were talking about my having a gastric band operation. 'I . wanted to have one last chance at losing the weight naturally and that . is why I checked in to No 1 Boot Camp. I wanted to see if you could . change your life through hard work, dedication and eating the right . things.' Laura spent most of last summer at the exclusive weight loss camp in Norfolk . She said: 'It really suited me. I had booked in initially for six weeks but enjoyed it so much I booked for an extra two weeks. 'It didn’t just help me to lose the weight – I was able to change my whole lifestyle. Overweight: Laura said she didn't eat unhealthy food but she simply ate too much . 'It introduced me to a whole new way . of eating which meant that I didn’t return to the bad habits of old. My . asthma is cured and I no longer suffer from depression. 'And I was finally able to achieve a . level of fitness which meant that not only could play for as long as I . liked in the park with Amy but I wanted to carry on exercising after I . had left the camp.' Her weight has remained stable since checking out of the boot camp last September. 'That is the ultimate tribute,' she said. 'With other diets, I would quickly go back to the bad old habits but this has brought about a permanent change. 'Amy loves the new me. She says that her mummy isn’t wobbly any more.'","Laura Middleton, 25, weighed 14st 9lb and suffered from asthma .

If they were slow starters on the property ladder, Tony and Cherie Blair are certainly making up for lost time. After adding a seventh home to their portfolio only last September, they have already registered the purchase of property number eight. Like the previous £1.35million house, cash was again paid when they snapped up a £600,000 cottage for the former prime minister’s younger sister, Sarah Blair. Woodland retreat: The £600,000 cottage situated near the village of Wotton Underwood in Buckinghamshire was purchased by the Blairs in February for the former PM's younger sister Sarah . Close family: Tony Blair , pictured centre after his election as the Labour MP for Sedgefield in 1983 with his sister Sarah, left, father Leo, mother Olwen and older brother Bill, right . The pretty woodland retreat – about a . mile from the Blairs’ Buckinghamshire mansion for which they paid . £5.75million in 2008 – was bought three months ago on Valentine’s Day. Land . Registry documents show it is owned jointly and ‘equally’ by Sarah and . Cherie Blair. The homes the Blairs bought for their children are also . co-owned by Mrs Blair. Nestling on the edge of a wood, the picture-postcard cottage has three bedrooms and an expansive lawn with views across the grounds to stately home Wotton House. The cottage was sold by the Gladstone family, descendants of Victorian prime minister William Gladstone, who own Wotton House. In 2011, the cottage was available to rent unfurnished for £1,350 a month. An estate agent’s photographs showed spacious rooms decorated in buttermilk yellow, with wrought iron fireplaces and chandeliers. Yesterday the cottage was swarming with builders carrying out a refurbishment. Miss Blair, 56, was said to be abroad while the work was being done, and preparing for a freelance career in publishing. She recently left her job as chief executive of a small London publishing house specialising in the field of equal opportunities. Mr Blair, 60, is said to be protective of his sister, who is unmarried, has no children and shuns publicity. He has said that they and their brother Bill were all very close and that he would often turn to his siblings for emotional support. Until recently Miss Blair lived in a £450,000 flat in Islington, North London. The Blairs also lived in Islington until the 1997 election when they moved to No 10 and sold their home only to see it rocket in value. Now the combined estimated value of the eight properties in their portfolio is nearly £21million. Mr Blair reputedly earns £20million a year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy work and has amassed a fortune of up to £60million. Yesterday, neither the Blairs nor Sarah Blair wished to comment. Tony and Cherie Blair have come under fire after it emerged that their charities were given nearly £1million from the US government’s foreign aid budget. The grants came while Mrs Blair’s friend Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and would have been responsible for the cash. In December the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women was given £405,000. In 2011, the African Governance Initiative, one of Mr Blair’s charities, was given £550,000. The Blairs have denied their relationship with Mrs Clinton had anything to do with the awards. But the National Taxpayers Union, a US campaign group, has called for an investigation, saying ‘more transparency is needed’.

The main thrust of the livestock protection officer’s work on Dartmoor is to prevent pet dogs from making a nuisance of themselves - and Mrs McKechnie has witnessed some horrific scenes during her first year in the job. 'There’s a pretty serious problem with dogs on the moors,' she says. 'This year alone there were 41 recorded dog attacks - 20 of those logged with the police. 'Some of the time dog owners say ""It’s only playing - it doesn’t mean any harm,"" after it has chased a sheep half a mile leaving its lamb behind. 'Dogs don’t actually have to attack the animal - abortions are high in sheep. 'And even if it’s only slightly got hold of a sheep, dog bites are nasty and the wounds will go septic.' Gruesome: Many of the sheep were relieved of their best meat joints with butcher-like precission . Earlier this year Dartmoor Livestock Protection Society gave evidence to the House of Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee - and the organisation is pressing for the national park authority to take a much greater role in patrolling hot-spot areas, particularly near Plymouth, and prosecuting dog owners whose pets are out of control.","Experts have reported animals are being dismembered on Dartmoor, Devon, or stolen alive .

Despite the fact that they are located on remote coastlines and are impractical to live in, a pack of prospective buyers queue up whenever one comes on the market. This question is one that Robin Beckmann, 54, is in a good position to answer. He is selling Point Lynas lighthouse on the north-east coast of Anglesey in North Wales, where he has lived with his wife Iona, 46, and their two adult children for 11 years. Bright home: The Point Lynas Lighthouse on Anglesey is on the market for £1.3million and comes with a fully functioning light as well as three cottages . ‘There’s so much more to a lighthouse than a normal house,’ says Robin, who works in education administration. ‘There’s all the history that comes with it, and there’s an air of mystery and danger about being on a little bit of land confronting the sea.’ Robin’s own story of how he came to buy this lighthouse is a romantic one. It began in the 1980s when he and Iona would come to Anglesey on holidays. ‘We would walk by the headland and we’d always talk about what it would be like to live in the lighthouse – it was special to us,’ he recalls. ‘Then, in 2002, Iona saw it was for sale. We just had to have it.’ Financially, it seemed like a madcap idea. The lighthouse, which was on the market for £230,000, came with three keepers’ cottages but these dwellings were virtually falling down and they were not allowed to live in the lighthouse tower itself. When Robin bought it, he had to lease it back to Trinity House and Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at a peppercorn rent so that they could maintain it. Flashy lifestyle: The 1,000-watt lamp at Point Lynas lighthouse is encased in a circular room in the front of the building and is on 24-hours a day . Romance in the lighthouse: The bedroom in the main house on the property . The lighthouse is still in use. The 1,000-watt lamp shines for nine seconds out of every ten, 24 hours a day. Its beam can be seen for 18 nautical miles. Robin spent £700,000 restoring the cottages, rented two of them out as holiday homes and lived in the third with his family. All three cottages have three bedrooms. Robin charges £350 a week in the low season and £950 in high season for the two holiday homes. The lettings made a gross profit of £42,000 last year. While other holiday cottages can be difficult to let out in winter, he found plenty of interest at this time of the year because holidaymakers are keen to witness the dramatic storms that lash this stretch of the coast around Christmas time. As a result, he found he was able to let out the cottages for 40 to 45 weeks of the year. But Point Lynas has always been more than a simply an investment to Robin. Over the years he has become obsessed – ‘to the point of nerdiness’ – with everything to do with lighthouses. He has joined the Association of Lighthouse Keepers, an organisation of like-minded enthusiasts that runs visits to lighthouses around the country. He has also researched Point Lynas’s history with academic diligence, finding the grave of its first keeper, a certain Captain Beaver, in the nearby Llaneilian churchyard. Spot on: Point Lynas Lighthouse on its headland in Llaneilian, Anglesey, from where its light can be seen for 18 nautical miles . It transpires that as a young man in the 1750s, Beaver was a pirate who caused havoc in the Caribbean. Robin has also made contact with the son of a former keeper and the wife of another. ‘The curious thing is that both of them often walk around this way,’ says Robin. ‘It’s as if the lighthouse continues to cast its spell over them.’ A number of lighthouses have gone on the market recently. Strathy Point and Tod Head, on the east coast of Scotland, sold for above their asking prices of £75,000 and £145,000 respectively. And along the North Wales coast from Point Lynas, at Talacre Bay in Flintshire, the Point of Ayr Lighthouse found a buyer at £90,000. As the tower is cut off from land at high tide, the new owners will experience the thrill of waves breaking all around them. As a permanent dwelling, it is unusable, having no mains services. Anyone looking for a more realistic buy-to-let opportunity might be interested in The Old Lighthouse at St Ann’s Head in Pembrokeshire. Currently used as two holiday lettings, its observation lounge in the former lens room gives fantastic views over the islands of Skomer and Skokholm. It is for sale for £975,000. Point Lynas’s price of £1.375 million is obviously going to put it beyond the budget of many people. Would it be possible to buy the cottages individually? ‘I’d be reluctant to split them up because they are worth more as a single business than as separate cottages,’ says Robin, who is leaving to take up a new job in mid-Wales. ‘Also, there is a reason why there are three keepers’ cottages here. ‘In the 1800s there were two keepers at The Smalls lighthouse off West Wales and one of them died. The other tied the dead body in some tarpaulin and hung the corpse outside the window. ‘By the time the survivor was picked up, he had been driven raving mad and the authorities stipulated that every lighthouse in the country must be manned by three keepers. ‘To break up the three cottages would be going against this old lighthouse keepers’ code.’ Williams and Goodwin: tppuk.com, 01248 343018 .","Lighthouse in Anglesey, North Wales on the marked for £1.3million .

An Iraq veteran has been reunited with a bomb-sniffing army dog who saved his life after battling more than five years to adopt him. Logan Black, 34,  served on nearly 40 missions with Diego the Labrador retriever in Iraq between 2006 and 2007, searching for hidden weapons and homemade bombs. But he feared Diego would be transferred to another law enforcement agency or go to a stranger's home after he retired and set up a Facebook campaign to adopt him. After thousands supported his cause to help convince the Air Force to hand over Diego, Black, from Kansas City, Missouri, has now adopted the eight-year-old dog, who he calls 'my best friend'. Scroll down for video . Reunion: Iraq veteran Logan Black has been reunited with his bomb-sniffing army dog Diego after five years . They were reunited last Tuesday, when Black travelled to Texas to collect Diego from Lackland Air Force Base, where he was stationed to train other bomb-sniffing dogs. 'This feels fantastic,' Black told KCTV5. 'I've been waiting for this for a really long time.' Black trained Diego and they were deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in 2006. Black, who worked as a specialised dog handler, credits Diego with saving his life. 'He comes up and starts sniffing right next to where I'm standing and gives a full indication that, ""Hey dad, something's here"",' Black told KCTV. Best friends: Black trained Diego and they served on 40 missions together in Iraq between 2006 and 2007 . Fighters: Black worked as a specialised dog handler with Diego in Fallujah, Iraq, pictured . 'And it turned out there were two roadside bombs that had been buried too deep for metal detectors to find.' After Black returned to the United States in May 2007, he often feared for the dog's safety, and sought to be reunited with him as soon as he retired. 'He was my best friend and my partner in . Iraq,' he said. 'No matter how bad things go in Iraq, I had something . that loved me unconditionally. 'No doubt Diego would have found a home somewhere, but a home with me is different than with a totally new stranger.' Loyal: Black said that Diego saved his life by sniffing out deeply-buried bombs right next to where he stood . Good dog: After Black left Iraq, Diego stayed on before helping to train other army dogs in Texas . The veteran launched a Facebook and .

'After that attack, any kind of loud noises would send him into a similar state,' Black told Msnbc.

Controversial: Anthony Seldon says that Michael Gove is wrong and that children need longer school holidays . Michael Gove said this week that he wants to see shorter school holidays and longer school days. The long summer holiday, he believes, is the product of a 19th Century agricultural economy and has no place in the 21st Century. He wants pupils to compete with Asia, where students work harder and longer. As always, Gove is right in intent but  imperfect in execution. I so admire the Education Secretary’s guts and zeal. Every week this pugilist force of nature comes up with a pronouncement which delights or enrages the country. The BBC would be much duller if it wasn’t devoting hours of its output talking about the latest Gove-ism. This weekend sees people slugging it out on each side of the ‘holiday and hard work’ debate. But he is plain wrong to think he will improve schools or the lot of children by shortening holidays. He wants more school time and less home time, because he thinks pupils will work harder and exam results will improve, with holiday time en masse given over to lessons. I am all in favour of longer school days, which would also help working parents, but not for the reasons Gove advocates. Children need extra time in school to experience enrichment in the arts, sport and character education. Too much time in class and pupils switch off,  or they become too tired for homework – a key part of the discipline of learning. As a headmaster I know it is counterproductive for students to spend more than five hours a day in lessons. Exam results have improved massively in the schools I’ve run, not because I have extended time in lessons, but because of better teaching and smarter learning. This is where Gove should focus. So we need longer school days, but, in the state sector, longer holidays, too. It is shortening school holidays which harks back to the 19th  Century. Great school lessons are available at home on computers and students benefit from independent study – both of which can be done in the holidays. Holidays benefit parents and teachers, too. Improved results come from teachers who are highly motivated. Play time: Anthony Seldon believes that time away from school benefits children and staff . A major incentive to join the profession is the prospect of a six-week summer holiday in state schools, as well as two weeks at Christmas and Easter. Most teachers don’t squander this time, but use it to enrich their minds, travel, read, attend courses, and simply to relax. They deserve it. Gove’s change would undermine the fabric of family life. The opportunities holidays provide for the young – to explore, go on visits and attend activities – are invaluable. More purposeful pursuits should be available for children during the holidays. The Education Secretary  greatly admires independent schools, which achieve results far outstripping state schools in Britain, and indeed the schools in the Far East and in Scandinavia which he so admires. But we do so with much longer holidays than state schools enjoy. Reforms: Michael Gove wants to cut school holidays . At Wellington College we have 19 weeks of holidays, compared to 13 in state schools, which Gove wants to cut still further. And why on earth are we trying to emulate Asia anyway? When this country’s economy led the world in the 19th century, we did not do so by copying anyone else. Here again, Gove is drawing the wrong lessons from this time. Delve into it deeper and you find that Asian schools are dull, dull, dull – it is why their governments are looking to Britain’s best schools. That’s why we should start leading the world with our education, and learn from our best independent and state schools, rather than merely trying to follow others and spending vast amounts of public money on jaunts studying schools abroad. For me, the school holiday debate sets major alarm bells ringing. If Michael Gove doesn’t start listening soon, he will put his achievements in education policy since 2010 in jeopardy. The week of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral provides a historical perspective from which Michael Gove can learn. I worry that he is only listening to an-ever narrowing circle of those who tell him what he wants to hear. Thatcher fell into that same trap and look what happened to her. Gove is the greatest success story of the coalition Government. He is driven by a profound passion to enhance educational opportunities for all pupils, regardless of social class and the schools in which they learn. He believes children have lost out because policy has been driven in the interests of education providers – the teachers, university education departments, the administrators and local authorities – rather than the children themselves. He is right, and his campaign is magnificent in its ambition. Lady Thatcher was one of Gove’s heroes, and more than any other cabinet minister in this Government, he is driven by a Thatcherite determination to drive his policy through, confront vested interests and defeat them. Like Lady Thatcher, he has taken on the unions and they are resisting, threatening strikes and mayhem. But Gove will not stop until he has consigned them to history, as Thatcher did Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers. Long breaks: Wellington College has 19 weeks of holidays, compared to 13 in state schools, which Gove wants to cut still further . He has built on Lady Thatcher’s work with her introduction of the national curriculum. He believes rigour and scholarship have been sucked out of many schools. Too many teachers, he believes, patronise children by underestimating their academic depths. ‘La-la subjects’ take precedence over real ones, such as modern languages, maths and physics. Each child must have a solid core of factual knowledge. He has gone further than Lady Thatcher in working to bring outstanding young people into the profession and taking on failing schools. All work and no play: Mr Seldon thinks that pupils switch off if they are in class too long . He is moving teacher training out of universities and into schools, and is working to encourage the brightest and best undergraduates to become teachers. Thatcher took the academically strongest children out of state schools and put them in independent schools with her ‘assisted places’ scheme. This demoralised state schools. Gove instead wants to affirm the state sector, but to make schools more independent of local authorities by them becoming ‘academies’ or ‘free schools’. Thatcher would have applauded, even though she dared not make this move. I support and admire all these efforts. But if Gove wins an A* for his objectives and effort, he achieves a B/C for execution. He wants to remain Education Secretary for all five years of this Government to embed changes which the next government would never dare undo. But to embed change, you need to carry people with you. Many of his supporters feel bruised and confused by his pace of change and by the lack of clarity. Many parents, teachers and heads are on your side, Michael. Don’t spurn us. Thatcher learned  from her predecessor, Ted Heath, that you have to introduce change step-by-step. Praise heads and teachers more, and don’t fight on all fronts. Let those who want to run extra courses in the holidays do so, but don’t impose shorter holidays on the whole system. My advice is a long summer holiday this August: you’ll see the value.","Michael Gove said this week that he wants to see shorter school holidays .

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:39 EST, 16 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:48 EST, 16 May 2013 . Education Secretary Michael Gove said opponents of planning reform undermine social mobility . Opponents of planning reforms are undermining social mobility, aspiration and the family by helping to keep home ownership ‘the preserve of those with wealth’, Michael Gove said last night. In an attack on Nimbys – ‘Not In My Back Yard’ protesters opposing housebuilding plans near their homes – the Education Secretary insisted that property ownership was ‘the foundation of a free society’. Insisting Britain needed ‘many, many more’ houses, he warned that the proportion of first-time buyers who do not rely on financial assistance from their families or others had crashed from 69 per cent in 2005 to 34 per cent in 2011. ‘No-one who believes in social mobility, in aspiration, in pro-family policies, in thrift and in freedom can be anything other than delighted by the release of more land for housebuilding,’ he said. His remarks came in a speech that roamed well beyond his education brief amid increasing suggestions from Conservative MPs that he is a potential successor to David Cameron. On Wednesday, appearing before MPs, Mr Gove described himself as an ‘heir to Tony Blair’ which only fuelled speculation. His aides denied the remarks were any kind of leadership bid, saying he had been talking in the context of schools reform. But Nick Clegg hit out at Mr Gove for speculating about his position as leader of the Liberal Democrats, telling LBC radio: ‘Michael, who I think is a perfectly nice chap, doesn’t know the first thing about the (Lib Dems)... of course, he knows a thing or two about leadership ambitions, but that’s a different matter.’ However, the Education Secretary, who insists he will not run in any future leadership contest, cast himself more as the Government’s latter-day answer to Sir Keith Joseph, the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism. Mr Gove said Sir Keith’s involvement in reform of healthcare, repair of the welfare system, expansion of home ownership and attempt to improve state education over his ministerial career were reflected in an ‘uncanny’ way in the principal aims of Conservatives in today’s government. He said the ‘animating mission’ of the Conservative Party was ‘the determination to ensure all our citizens have the chances to live fulfilled lives’. He said people who oppose undeveloped land, such as this village green in Alfriston, East Sussex, being used for house building do not believe in 'aspiration or pro-family policies' ‘We are fighting to make opportunity more equal, and to ensure that every citizen enjoys the dignity, autonomy and freedom which allow them to become truly fulfilled,’ he added. Mr Gove said the Government’s reforms of the bloated welfare state, the education system to give heads and parents more power and the NHS to put patients and doctors in charge were all about ‘giving every individual a solid stake in our society’. He said his greatest concern in education was ‘the forgotten 40 per cent’ of children who had become known as ‘the tail - the underachievers concentrated in areas of disadvantage’. ‘England is one of the most unequal nations in the developed world in terms of educational achievement,’ he said. ‘Just five schools - four independent and one sixth-form college in Cambridge - get more students into Oxbridge than 2,000 state schools and colleges put together. 'More boys get to Oxbridge from Eton alone than from the entire cohort of children - 100,000 or so - eligible for free school meals. ‘Our reforms are explicitly targeted at ending this scandal.’ Gove said people should not think about 'losing some undeveloped land' but creating something of 'grace' Mr Gove said a pupil premium - investment rising to £2.5 billion by next year - directed funds towards the poorest children to raise their attainment. The Government’s academies and free schools programme, allowing schools to free themselves from state control, was allowing ‘visionaries with a commitment to the highest possible standards... to transform the lives of our poorest children’. Mr Gove also launched a staunch defence of the City and warned against ‘clumsy and ill thought-out interventions’ by Brussels to impose new rules on the nation’s economic powerhouse. ‘It has become fashionable to criticise the City and its workers, deprecate bankers and bash banks, look askance at financial services and look down on those whose trade is in money,’ he said. ‘And certainly, given the behaviour of a number of egregiously greedy and foolishly reckless individuals, there had to be a change - of culture, attitude and regulation in the City. ‘That is why George Osborne is introducing comprehensive banking reform - not to punish the city, but to protect an institution tarnished by a series of terrible errors. ‘But we would be making a grave historic error if we were to allow a determination to cleanse the stables to harden into a prejudice against those individuals and institutions we need to win in the global race.’","Micheal Gove said opponents of planning reforms undermine aspiration .

If so, you aren't alone, according to a new poll which found that couples make love more often when the sun is shining. The survey asked more than 2,000 people to reveal the month in which they had the most sex and sunny August came out on top. It took the title with 18 per cent of the vote, while February brought up the rear with just two per cent - in spite of Valentines Day. Sunshine: According to the poll, sunnier days equal more sex for most couples - particularly in August . After August, the most popular months for lovemaking were the equally balmy July and June, with 14 and  10 per cent of the vote each. Beautiful May came next with six per cent, surprisingly followed by the chilly month of December on five per cent, which would suggest that there's more than one way to get into the Christmas spirit. By contrast, the remaining autumn and winter months were considered the least sexy by respondents, with February proving least popular, followed by November, January, March and October. Spring months did better, with April appearing in seventh position, just behind September in sixth. Researchers put the results down to the higher melatonin levels seen in most of us during the winter months, which can lead to a lower sex drive, depression and lethargy. Similarly, tests have shown that men have 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January. Timing: Sex is less likely to appeal during the colder months (left) but the sap starts to rise come Spring . Since men with more testosterone have more orgasms, more sun spells more and better sex. The findings were also backed up by a study conducted by scientists at the University of South Brittany in France which found that people are more likely to flirt when the sun is out. According to researchers, girls were more likely to give their phone number out when approached by an attractive male when the weather was good rather than overcast. A spokesman for sex toy website Lovehoney which conducted the survey, said: 'We have just had the bleakest winter in history, but now the sun is out and we are all feeling frisky. 'The sun shining changes everyone's moods and, of course, means we are wearing far few clothes.

It was a naughty but nice look that set the scene for what was a . show of contrasts that gently subverted the long legacy of this heritage brand. Britain's most infamous showgirl and political mistress was referenced in the show's title - Trench Kisses: A collection of classics and Christine Keeler - setting a mischievous tone for the hint of sexiness - and wickedness - to come. Scroll down to watch the show in full . Subverting tradition: Cara Delevingne walked . second in an outfit that embodied the very spirit of the show - vinyl . skirt with heart-print knickers beneath that managed to be at once both . prim and kinky . 'I like the idea of taking something that has gravitas, this 158 year old brand, but making it subversive and kinky,' Christopher Bailey said afterwards. That translated as traditional fabrics and classic shapes given edge . with vinyl, patent leather and metal. Glossy gold collars topped corset dresses, trimmed the collars of coats and formed gleaming belts that encircled slender waists, cinching in wool and cashmere. With the launch of Burberry's new beauty . range, those shimmering gold collars and embellishments were intended, Bailey said, to . cast their light onto the models' faces and really make them glow. And they did (though having 22-year-old models with the skin of a radiant cherub helped, I'm sure). But while there was plenty of sauce and a fair few pairs of knickers on show, this was by no means a gimmicky collection. Colours were iconic Burberry tones: red, white, camel, oxblood, black and gold. Coats, dozens of them, and each more darn covetable than the last, streamed endlessly down the catwalk. There . was black wool, leopard print mink and camel; oxblood leather, vinyl, python print; tan suede covered in . amorphous gold metal plates, leather-fringed with metal eyelets, studded . with dozens of gold rings, heart-print calfskin, laminated leather, laminated jacquard... Traditional with a twist: Classic with a touch of the Christine Keelers in this mink Caban coat . Luxe: A mink gabardine trench with gold belt, accessorised with the studded Crush bag . Heartprint calfskin trench: 'I wanted to clash the contrasting worlds of sweet and sexy', Bailey said . Golden girl: Cara Delevingne modelled a metallic collar Bailey said was . intended to cast light on to the models' faces to make them really glow . Iconic: A red corset dress with oxblood trim was in typical Burberry tones . Classic: A trad camel coat was given edge with gold metal eyelets and a shimmering metal belt . Return of the kitten heel! Cara and the rest of the models wore low, pointed kittens for a prim walk . Cara's navy double-breasted coat with its wide lapels and gold belt was stand-out, as was a creamy camel number with gold eyelets, teamed with a fringed leather bag in oxblood. Only a true fashion insider could have all the words necessary to tell of the veritable army of styles that we saw - but I can tell you there were trench coats, cabans, Chesterfields, Regimental greatcoats and cropped bikers... and that was just for starters. Happy Together by Misty Miller . Picking Up The Pieces (acoustic version) by Paloma Faith . Hold Me by Tom Odell . The theme of the show made for a playful yet provocative vibe, Bailey said backstage afterwards. 'It's sassy, sexy. I like the idea of an inverted world. there's traditional trench coats mixed with rubber,' he said. Or little sweethearts under rubber skirts. 'It's the idea of these two worlds clashing. Something sweet contrasting with something sexy. Heritage and established with something sassy and naughty. There's an air of elegance, but underneath there's this kinkiness.' Bailey said his models were actually quite prim - providing a backdrop that allowed him to add a touch of sauce with the styling. 'I put the girls in these kitten wedges so they had quite a prim walk,' he said. 'But then I put them in these vinyl skirts, patent leather, rubber, metal. Something to make the heart race.' And race it did - no more so than during the epic finale, when a stage opened at the back of the catwalk and the haunting voice of rising Brit star Tom Odell's Hold Me soared to a crescendo accompanied by a cello, the piano and a heavenly choir. The benches vibrated and a moved crowd simultaneously developed goosebumps from head to toe. Tinie Tempah - a man not often moved . to tears one might suppose - declared the show 'emotional', while Bailey . himself said he almost had a little weep during the pre-show . run-through, so powerful was the setting and the music. If it all sounds a little hyperbolic, I'll just say you had to be there. The spectacular staging of his shows is certainly no . accident. The man who never rests says he is already thinking about the . production for his Spring/Summer show, which won't take place until . September. 'Usually at the end of a show I'm thinking about the next one,' he says. 'I'll go back to the office now and write them down.' 'Music is so important to the shows. because shows are all about . entertainment and they're about emotion, and about making people feel . something.' 'People have to feel it in the fashion, but also in the lighting, the . music, the atmosphere. It's a combination of all of those things.'

"By . Katie Silver . UPDATED: . 12:41 EST, 11 December 2011 . Happy: Chris Huhne says the new deal is a 'significant step forward' Countries agreed to a deal today to push for a new climate treaty, which will cut emissions in poorer countries, costing British taxpayers £6billion. Energy Secretary Chris Huhne hailed the £64billion deal as a ‘significant step forward’ which would deliver a global, overarching legal agreement to cut emissions. But environmental groups said negotiators had failed to show the ambition necessary to cut emissions by levels that would limit global temperature rises to no more than 2C and avoid ‘dangerous’ climate change. Britain and the EU had come to the talks in Durban, South Africa, wanting the world’s biggest polluters – the U.S., China and India – to agree for the first time to ‘legally binding’ caps as they account for nearly half the world’s emissions. The treaty, which was to cover all major emitters, would be agreed upon in return for the bloc signing up to a second period of emissions cuts under the existing Kyoto climate deal. But in a surprise move yesterday evening, options for the new legal deal had been watered down to add a ‘legal outcome.’ European ministers warned they could not accept the weakened deal, but India led the countries pushing for it, claiming they could not sign up to negotiate a legally-binding deal without knowing what would be in it or if it would be fair to poorer countries. The deal was reached after the South African president of the talks urged the EU and India to go ‘into a huddle’ in the middle of the conference hall in the early hours of this morning, in a bid to work out language both sides were happy with. Appeal: Greenpeace campaigners dressed as trees ask passing delegates to donate to a Forest Fund . A compromise saw the EU and Indians agree to a road map which commits countries to negotiating a protocol, another legal instrument or an ‘agreed outcome with legal force’. The treaty will be negotiated by 2015 and coming into force from 2020. The deal also lays the ground to address the ‘emissions gap’ between the voluntary emissions cuts countries have already pledged and the reductions experts say are needed to effectively tackle climate change. Mr Huhne, who had warned the meeting ‘may go pear-shaped’, insisted the agreement on the legal language was not ‘a fudge’ and said that while the EU had not secured everything it wanted from the talks, it was a great diplomatic success for the bloc. It sends a strong signal to businesses and investors about moving to a low carbon economy, he added. He said: ‘What we have got is a very significant step forward because we've got a road map leading to a global overarching legal agreement, which is exactly what we wanted, we've got a timeline on it. ‘And we've got a very clear process for dealing with the emissions gap in the interim.’ Since the Kyoto Protocol was signed 25 years ago, China has become one of the worlds largest emitters of greenhouse gases. The picture shows Beijing shrouded in a smoky haze . The Green Climate Fund is set to cost Britain £1billion a year, or £6billion by 2020, to fund solar panels, flood defences and technology. It was agreed two years ago, but talks this year have focused on how it will be funded, as countries grapple with low growth and cuts. Britain has already committed £1billion since 2009 to climate aid through the Fast Start Programme and has committed to spending £3.4billion by 2015. But Mr Huhne has pledged ‘support’ for the Green Climate Fund – also backed by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – if it becomes operational during this parliament. Since 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol was signed by developed countries, China has become the world’s largest polluter – accounting for 25 per cent of greenhouse gases. Previous talks in Copenhagen in 2009 collapsed in bitter recriminations over this point but last night the U.S. and China, as well as Canada and Brazil, signalled they may agree this time. India pushed for the deal to be less stringent, debating whether it was fair to poor countries. Environmentalists say the treaty is not strong enough. ‘By acknowledging that current emissions targets are inadequate and must be raised, and by re-establishing the goal of a legal treaty, this agreement should help build such confidence,’ said Michael Jacobs, a climate change expert from LSE. Still environmental groups criticised the deal for a lack of ambition in cutting the greenhouse gas emissions which drive global warming. Keith Allott, Head of Climate Change at WWF-UK, said: ‘Governments have salvaged a path forward for negotiations, but we must be under no illusion - the outcome of Durban leaves us with the prospect of being legally bound to a world of 4C warming. ‘This would be catastrophic for people and the natural world. Governments have spent crucial days focused on a handful of specific words in the negotiating text, but have paid little heed to repeated warnings from the scientific community that much stronger, urgent action is needed to cut emissions.’","Countries agreed to a 'watered-down' legal agreement to cut emissions .

Victim: Officials have confirmed reports that the victim was Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse, pictured . A Texas prosecutor who was heavily involved in the investigation of members of the Aryan Brotherhood was shot dead on Thursday morning as he walked from his car to his county courtroom office. Officials identified the victim as Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse. The 57-year-old was assaulted and shot multiple times by at least one gunman, police said. The apparent assassination took place at around 8:50 a.m. in a parking lot near the courthouse where Hasse worked as a felony prosecutor who headed murder and drug cases. Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes said he had never seen such a case in his four decade career. 'I've been doing this 43 years and I have never experienced anything like this before,' he told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference. Hasse was rushed to hospital where he died of his injuries. He was unmarried and had no children. Witnesses . told police they saw two suspects flee the scene in an older, silver . Ford Taurus. However, the number of suspects had not been verified. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crime scene: Law enforcement officers investigate the scene of a shooting in downtown Kaufman, Texas . Suspects: Authorities said they were searching for two suspects in the shooting which took place at 8:50 a.m. today . Lockdown: Many buildings in the area near the courthouse were in lockdown today following the shooting . Kaufman Chief of Police Chris . Aulbaugh said the shooting appeared to be targeted at Hasse for a number . of reasons. 'The fact it was not an ongoing rampage, it was one . individual being shot and then (the gunmen) leaving the scene,' he said. 'It was a very small, very short confrontation.' The . suspects were of unknown race but were reportedly wearing all black, . with one or both of them wearing a tactical-type vest. Some reports . claim they were wearing masks. Brotherhood member: James Marshall Meldrum is one of the alleged white supremecists involved in the trial Kaufman was prosecuting . A widespread manhunt is underway for . the culprits with the help of police and sheriff's . departments from across the county. 'Every police department in the county is involved,' county spokesman Pat Laney said. No arrests have been made as yet. The Dallas County District Attorney's Office told the Dallas News  that a suspect had been arrested in the case but the Kaufman County police later said DA Craig Watkins had been mistaken. The initial $10,000 reward for . information leading to the arrest of the gunmen has been doubled to . $20,000 after a local business offered to match the cash offered by . Kaufman County Crimestoppers. Investigators are searching through Hasse's . case files, trying to identify any potential enemies he may have had, . including any members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang. The Dallas News reported that Hasse  had been heavily involved in the investigation of members of the Aryan Brotherhood. Shortly after the prosecutor was shot and killed, the Department of Justice put out a statement crediting the Kaufman County District Attorney's Office with helping in the investigation of two known members of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas gang. The gang members pleaded guilty today to racketeering charges, after Hasse's shooting. The release states that Ben Christian . Dillon, aka 'Tuff', of Houston, and James Marshall Meldrum, aka 'Dirty' both 'agreed to commit multiple acts of murder, robbery, arson, . kidnapping and narcotics tracking' for the Aryan Brotherhood. Tragic: Mark Hasse, pictured in older footage, was unmarried and had no children but gave everything to his job . Kaufman County DA Mike McLelland said . in an afternoon news conference that the county had suffered a . 'devastating loss' today. However, he said Hasse had been fully aware of . the . dangers of his job and 'accepted them readily'. 'When you deal with bad people on a . regular basis, you know there's the potential for these bad people to do . something bad to you because they have done bad things to other . people,' he told reporters. Though he said Hasse . didn't have any active cases dealing with the Aryan Brotherhood. McLelland . said his team of 13 prosecutors were mourning the shock death of their . colleague. '(We're) a family not just an office,' he said. 'And trust me . the entire office took this very, very badly. 'Mark was an absolutely stellar prosecutor and good friend.' The . DA appealed to anyone who had any information to come forward. 'Anything you folks can do to help us get our hands on this scum would . be appreciated,' he said. Sheriff . Byrnes said the courthouse had surveillance cameras but they were . directed at the buildings not the parking lot so didn't capture the . shooting or the suspects as they made their getaway. He said his office was beefing up security for Hasse's colleagues. 'We will have a uniformed officer in the parking lot for the foreseeable future ,' he said. McLelland added that the walk to the courthouse would be 'humbling... unhappy' now his friend was gone.

Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told the Dallas News earlier today . that he did not know what cases the assistant district attorney had . been working on before his death but said he was not aware of any . heightened security. 'It's a horrible situation,' Wood . told the Dallas News. 'None of us would have ever expected anything like . this to ever happen in our county.' The county courthouse went into lockdown and was later closed after the shooting. Tonya . Radcliffe, a board member on the Kaufman County Appraisal District . whose office is adjacent to the scene of the shooting, told NBC that a staff member heard the gunshots and called police. Radcliffe said she and her staff of . about 25 were in the building and under lockdown along with seven Kaufman . Independent School District campuses. Lawyer .

'When you hear a DA at 8:40 in the morning is gunned down by two people, I think there's a reasonable presumption that it's not random,' he said. Defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the Dallas News that he immediately feared Hasse had been targeted. 'I felt it very certainly had to be work-related,' he said. Smenner added that Hasse parked in the same area of the courtroom parking lot each day. 'So if somebody was out to get him all they'd have to do is watch him a little bit,' he told the Dallas News. According to CBS, Mark Hasse graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1981 and had been licensed to practice law since 1982. The 57-year-old had been a Kaufman County District Attorney since July of 2010. He was chief of the Dallas County district attorney’s organized-crime section from 1985 until 1988. Steinke said: 'Mark was really a great guy, . he was the consummate prosecutor, he was hard-working, loved his job, . and juries loved him for some reason. He wasn't very large in stature, . but juries loved him and he exuded confidence.' Hasse had recently bought a house in Kaufman County and was in the process of renovating it, McLelland said. 'It's a scary deal,' Dallas attorney Ted Steinke told WFAA.com regarding the role of a prosecutor. 'Every prosecutor every once in a while gets a death threat, and we take . them seriously, but this is the first time in 20 years that I can . remember here in North Texas a prosecutor actually being assaulted.'

The International Polo Club Palm Beach tycoon charged with vehicular manslaughter in the death of another driver while intoxicated reeked so strongly of alcohol it seemed to be coming from his pores, according to testimony at his trial today. John Goodman, 48, is accused of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter in the death of 23-year-old Scott Wilson in February 2010. Palm Beach County Sheriff's Deputy Richard Safford, testified that the defendant smelled so strongly of alcohol that it ‘was like it was almost coming directly from his pores.’ Describing the smell of alcohol, the police officer told the court he had to let down the windows of his patrol car ‘to let it just clear out.’ On trial: Polo tycoon John Goodman is charged with DUI manslaughter in the February 2010 death of 23-year-old Scott Wilson . Evidence: The crumpled car driven by Scott Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by John Goodman, right, on the night of the crash that killed Scott Wilson was shown to jurors in the Goodman's DUI Manslaughter trial . Victim's family: Attorney Jack Scarola , Lilli Wilson, mother of Scott Wilson, and Scottís sister Christi Wilson today looked at the Bentley that John Goodman drove the night of the accident . Fellow deputy, Mitch Rieger, also agreed that Goodman had a ‘strong smell of alcohol.’ Robert, an emergency medical technician who was at the scene, testified that Goodman appeared to have been drinking. 'I felt he had a couple of drinks. He stated that to us,' Perreault told the court, but added that he did not believe Goodman has consumed a large amount of alcohol. Goodman, 48, told him he had 'a couple glasses of wine,' Perreault said. Witness Lisa Pembleton, who was awakened when Goodman, walking from the crash site, banged on her door and asked to use her phone, spoke in court. She overheard Goodman make a phone call to a 'lady in Georgia,' telling the woman 'I really f***ked up' and had been in 'an end of the world accident,' Pembleton recalled. Pembleton said Goodman asked how he 'seemed to her.' She told him she couldn't tell and told him he should call 911. As he left her trailer home, Pembleton said he offered her a 'wad of bills' - money she did not accept. Goodman's girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, took to the stand today and said she didn't remember Goodman telling . her of an 'end of the world accident,' but said he told her he had been . in an accident. She also said Goodman did not mention a car malfunction . or having a head injury. Witness box: Goodman knocked on Lisa Pembleton's door asking to borrow her phone after the crash, she testified that Goodman offered her money . Distraught: The victim's mother, Lili Wilson, cried as the 911 call from John Goodman was played in court today . Victim: Scott Wilson, 23, a graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign in his Bentley convertible on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Goodman was charged with DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. In a stunning move last fall, Goodman adopted his adult girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins, 42, entitling her to up to a third of his biological children's trust fund, worth $300million. Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. The adoption papers state that Ms Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins have been dating in 2009, according to her testimony. The Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets.

'It cannot go unrecognised that [Goodman] chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court 'into a legal twilight zone.' Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told MyFoxOrlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. 'It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Arrested: John Goodman is currently on trial for the DUI death of Wilson . Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. Yesterday was the second day of testimony in the case, in which Goodman faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty. Jury selection began on March 6. The Wilsons have already settled . privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had . been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children.

One in three patients is putting their health at risk because they do not take their medication properly, costing the NHS an estimated £500 million every year. Fears about potential side-effects and poor understanding of doctors' instructions are partly responsible for the issue, according to a study. Researchers analysing one million prescriptions found that the absence of symptoms and a lack of trust in pharmacists also played a part in people deciding to stop taking their medication. Understanding: The Aston Medication Adherence Study analysed one million prescriptions and found that a number of factors, such as side effects and poor instructions from doctors, were responsible for people not taking medication properly . The Aston Medication Adherence Study, is thought to be the first research project looking at adherence to medication in the UK. It found that certain ethnic groups are more likely to experience difficulties in understanding how to take medication. People whose primary language is Urdu or Bengali are particularly susceptible, as are those living in poorer inner-city areas. They found that people aged over 60 struggled with adherence to medication patterns. The study, carried out by researchers at Aston University’s Pharmacy School, was centred on the Heart of Birmingham Teaching Primary Care Trust, looking at those suffering from type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism and high cholesterol. Health bodies are facing increasing pressure to manage treatable, long-term conditions in an attempt to reduce hospital admissions. Findings: The study, carried out by researchers at Aston University¿s Pharmacy School, looked at those suffering from type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism and high cholesterol . The report recommended that healthcare systems should take account of a patient's first language and offer more advice to those taking medication for long-term conditions. Professor Chris Langley, principal investigator for the AMAS said: 'What is important about the AMAS is that it identifies adherence patterns within an ethnically diverse inner city area with high levels of deprivation; this is currently unchartered territory. 'The results from this study have provided an intriguing insight into adherence behaviour within an inner-city population, whilst the focus group data provided context and understanding of the barriers to adherence from the patients’ perspective.' Dr Joe Bush, investigator for the AMAS added: 'We identified numerous groups in which adherence levels were lower than in the general population, but it is not possible at this time to identify why adherence is lower in these groups. 'Whilst the focus groups suggested possible reasons for non-adherence, we hope to explore these issues further and identify the primary reasons for non-adherence in these patient groups in future research.'","Aston Medication Adherence Study analysed one million prescriptions .

CJ could not reach her from the towpath and when she slipped under the water he ran the half mile home to raise the alarm.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 9 April 2013 . One of Britain’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested after fleeing to Cyprus. John Anslow, 32, had been on the run since January 2012 – when he escaped from a prison van near HMP Hewell in Worcestershire. He is charged with the murder of 27-year-old businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010. Anslow, from Tipton, West Midlands, was arrested on Wednesday in Alancak, Northern Cyprus, for immigration offences and deported by the Turkish Cypriot authorities. He was then arrested at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning and transferred to a high-security prison. Anslow will appear via video link at Stafford Crown Court tomorrow over his failure to appear at court in January 2012. Accused: John Anslow is charged with the murder of 27-year-old businessman Richard Deakin in July 2010 . That month he was sprung from a prison . van by a gang of masked men armed with knives and sledgehammers. Anslow was en route to an appearance at Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by the three men. Anslow, who faces a murder charge after a father-of-two was shot dead with a sawn-off shotgun as he lay in bed, was being driven to Stafford Crown Court when the vehicle was ambushed by three men at around 8.20am on 24 January. The gang smashed the windscreen of the GEO Amey escort vehicle before punching the driver and threatening him with a knife. They then escaped with then 31-year-old Anslow in a silver Volkswagen Scirocco, . The car was found dumped around ten miles from the scene of the ambush. It is believed the gang switched to a silver Mercedes. The ambush took place on a narrow, secluded road in Tardebigge, just outside Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, shortly after the vehicle had left HMP Hewell Grange. Anslow was one of five men charged with the murder of businessman Richard Deakin in Chasetown, Staffordshire, in July 2010. Police said Mr Deakin's family have been updated about the latest development. Anslow  was charged with murder on January 18 2012. He became the first category A prisoner to escape in 17 years when he was broken out of the van last year. It was originally thought he may have fled to Spain or North Africa.

A mother and her six-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in a horrific double murder at their seaside home. The alarm was raised yesterday morning after a concerned family member apparently alerted police. Officers rushed round to the semi-detached dormer bungalow on a quiet suburban street and broke into the property. Murder probe: Police stand guard outside the house in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, where a woman and child were found dead yesterday . The little boy was found knifed to death in his upstairs bedroom while his 41-year-old mother was lying dead downstairs. Police sources said the house was a scene of carnage with both victims suffering a sustained and frenzied knife attack. It is understood the woman and her son were found lying in pools of their own blood and had been repeatedly stabbed. A 34-year-old man, believed to be the father of the child and the woman’s partner, was found with serious knife wounds. Probe: A police forensics officer outside the property yesterday as a double murder investigation got underway . He was arrested on suspicion of murder . and was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital where his condition is . described as serious. Police said they were confronted with a . ‘distressing scene’ as they entered the property, where the body of the . child was found in the front bedroom. Detective Superintendent Paul Withers . said: ‘This is a murder inquiry, but we are not looking for anybody else . in connection with the investigation. ‘It was a very distressing scene. The . deceased people have been attacked with a knife. I can only imagine the . stress the family is going through.’ Police discovered the gruesome . scene at 11.40am yesterday morning in Bolton-le-Sands, near Carnforth, . Lancashire. The house is believed to have been rented by a couple who moved in with their son only three weeks ago. It is understood they were refurbishing the property and carrying out other maintenance in recent days. Neighbours reported seeing the downstairs lights on in the dormer bungalow into the early hours of Tuesday morning. Police said yesterday that they . believed the killings had happened ‘within the last 24 hours’ and post . mortems were being carried out last night. The suspect is being treated for knife . wounds and was said to be in a ‘serious condition’ with detectives . monitoring his situation. Neighbours said they were stunned and shocked that a brutal double murder could occur in a sleepy residential street. Investigation: Police broke into the property yesterday and found a woman and a child had been brutally stabbed to death . The murder suspect was arrested and airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital, pictured, to receive treatment for his stab wounds. Today he remains in a serious condition . Peter Hammersley, 46, a Tesco night . manager, said: ‘You don’t think anything like this could happen in . Bolton-le-Sands – anywhere but here. It is such a nice quiet place to . live. ‘You just never know what kind of . stress people are living under. It is such a shame for the family and . everybody around here is in shock.’ Another neighbour, who didn’t want to . be named, said: ‘I’m horrified by what’s happened. Whatever went on, . no-one deserves to be killed. What on earth did that little six-year-old . boy do to deserve that?’ Another local resident said: ‘I think . they had only just moved in to the house in the past couple of weeks. The only thing I noticed which was odd, was that when I got up in the . middle of the night, their downstairs lights were always on, even at . 4am.’ Yesterday, the curtains of the little . boy’s upstairs bedroom were drawn, with just a little England football . mini-kit visible on the window. The downstairs curtains were also drawn as forensic teams and detectives searched the property. A white Peugeot van, believed to belong to the 34-year-old man, was parked outside the address.

Just one in four thugs caught with a knife were jailed last year - despite public demands for robust sentences. Official figures show knife thugs are less likely to be locked up on the spot than a year ago. Nearly one in five is given a mere caution and hundreds get off with a community sentence. Walking free: Official figures have shown knife thugs are less likely to be locked up on the spot than a year ago . Only 25 per cent of criminals caught in possession of a knife were jailed on the spot in the last 12 months. That compares with nearly one in three in 2011. In the year to September 2012 a total of 3,376 adult offenders were sentenced for possession of a knife or other offensive weapon. Of those 23 per cent - some 865 offenders - were handed community service by the courts - leaving them free to walk the streets. Eighteen per cent were simply cautioned - a total of 683 criminals. Some 15 per cent - 579 individuals - were given a suspended sentence, meaning they would be locked up only if they committed a further crime. Plans: The Tories' pledge, before the election, to jail anyone caught with a knife in public was ditched by then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke after he was advised it would put up to 8,000 more offenders behind bars . One in 20 walked away with just a fine, while 149 criminals were given a ‘discharged’ offence - little more than a slap on the wrist. That left one in four, a total of 949 individuals, who were given an immediate custodial sentence. That knife thugs are less likely to be jailed on the spot will raise concerns about sentencing. Review: Justice Minister Damian Green said the Government has been conducting a review with the police on the use of cautions . Before the election, the Tories pledged to jail anyone caught with a knife in public. But the pledge was ditched by then Justice Secretary Ken Clarke after he was advised that it would put up to 8,000 more offenders behind bars at any one time. Instead ministers introduced a new offence of aggravated knife carrying, which they said would lead to more mandatory knife sentences. The crime - which is committed by anyone using a knife to ‘threaten or endanger others' - became law in December. Since 2007 the proportion of possession offences leading to immediate custodial sentences has risen, in particular during 2008 when sentencing guidelines were toughened up. The average jail term for possessing a knife was seven and a half months, the figures showed - around three months longer than it was at the end of 2007. Overall the number of cautions or convictions for carrying a knife is down nearly a fifth since 2011. It could mean fewer criminals are carrying the weapons or simply that the police are less likely to catch them. Justice Minister Damian Green said: 'Overall, knife crime has fallen but this is not enough. That is why we have just introduced a new offence of using a knife to threaten or endanger others which carries a mandatory custodial sentence. 'In conjunction with police, the Government is conducting a review of the use of cautions to make sure they are being used appropriately.'","Knife thugs less likely to be locked up on the spot than a year ago .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:54 EST, 4 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:55 EST, 4 April 2013 . More than one in three victims of anti-social behaviour say their calls to police have made no difference. And the problem is even worse among those whose lives are made a misery by yobs in their neighbourhood. Nearly half of the victims who suffer the most said officers took no action. Details of the scale of police failings over anti-social behaviour were revealed in a report by academics published yesterday. Calling the police about antisocial behaviour makes no difference, according to a third of victims (stock image) Tragic: Fiona Pilkington suffered years of abuse . A survey of nearly 10,000 victims revealed that people tormented by gangs of thugs were most likely to ‘fall through the net’. Critics said the study showed forces cannot be relied on to protect the public from threatening behaviour, vandalism and intimidation. It came as one force was criticised for plans to categorise attacks on goths and punks as ‘hate crimes’. Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘Greater Manchester Police have announced they are going to pay special attention to groups identified by their lifestyle, clothing and make-up, such as goths and punks. 'This is another example of the police spending too much time trying to please pressure groups that demand preferential treatment. Instead, they should devote their resources to providing equal protection for all.’ The Cardiff University study comes more than five years after police were castigated for their failure to protect Fiona Pilkington and her disabled daughter Francecca. After ten years of abuse and repeated failures by police and council officials, Mrs Pilkington killed herself and her daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car in a layby near their home in Barwell, Leicestershire. The survey found that people tormented by gangs of louts were mostly likely to 'fall through the net' (posed by models) The study found that ‘the repeat and vulnerable victim’ was most likely to ‘fall through the net’. It said 35 per cent of victims who made initial complaint calls to the police saw ‘no difference’, compared to 45 per cent of repeat victims. The study looked at 9,311 victims who called police in England and Wales in a one-month period in 2011. More than half said they called the police three or more times in a year and one in five made ten or more calls over a 12-month period. It found the well-off and middle classes were among the most likely to be repeat victims. The survey found 47 per cent of those targeted more than once were from the A and B social classes. The authors of the report, Professor Martin Innes and Dr Helen Innes, said their study ‘reaffirms that this type of problem is pervasive and has the potential to cause significant harm to the individuals concerned’. The Civitas think-tank said the police could no longer be relied upon to protect the public from gangs (file image) They added that, ‘the repeat caller is often an individual who feels that their first report of anti-social behaviour has been, or continues to be, unsuccessful’. A police spokesman said they would get better at identifying vulnerable victims. The report was published alongside data from the police inspectorate which scored forces on how well they were tackling the problem. The Met, the country’s largest force, was among the worst performers, along with the Gwent, Wiltshire and Essex forces. Top were Lancashire and West Mercia.","Survey by academics at Cardiff University looked at 9,311 crime victims .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 10:40 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:32 EST, 10 May 2013 . A mobile phone designed for four to nine-year-olds has been launched by OwnFone. The 1stFone which has been dubbed the 'dumbphone for smart parents' is the size of a credit card and weighs 40g. It can only make and receive calls, and it doesn't have a screen - instead it has the names of up to 12 close friends and family shown in a list with corresponding physical buttons. Scroll down for video . The 1stFone, designed specifically for four to nine-year-olds can be customised. Options including Orange Splat, pictured front, Skulls, Leopard and more. The 12 pre-assigned contacts can only be changed and added to by a parent. A 999 button can also be added that must be pressed three times to activate . The 1stFone, from manufacturer OwnFone, has been specifically designed for four to nine-year-olds. It doesn't have a screen. Instead it shows a list of up to 12 pre-assigned contacts. The handset can only make and receive calls and a single battery charge can last a year when the handset is on standby . A couple recently designed software called C-Caller to give phones simple screen displays for people with poor vision. Dena and Simon Marks came up with the idea after Dena's cataracts prevented her from reading the display on her mobile phone. The pair developed the device to make phones display a large letter that relates to frequent callers. For example, if someone called Victoria calls, a large V will appear. Letters can be customised for different calls. This means that the child can only call the 12 pre-assigned numbers. And only the parents can add or change this list of contacts. Makers OwnFone believe that the basic functionality of the 1stFone reduces the risks of text or cyber bulling, finding inappropriate material online, 'sexting' or being mugged. They base this on a recent study from Southampton Rape Crisis of 7,000 school children which found those as young as 10 are routinely sending explicit pictures of themselves to classmates. In the top-left hand corner of the handset are volume buttons, sat next to large Answer, and On/Off buttons. The 1stFone has been designed to be hard-wearing and can withstand being thrown about and dropped by children. Makers OwnFone also believe the handset is perfect for seniors, as well as as an alternative to a work phone on a building site, for example. Clips can secure the phone to a child's clothing or a work belt . The child's name is also programmed to appear at the top of the handset. Children . can customise the handset with different colours and patterns including . 'Green Dinosaur', 'Pink Leopard' or 'Orange Splat'. In . addition to the 12 names, parents can also choose to have a 999 button . programmed which has to be pressed three times to activate. Makers OwnFone claim it can be used on a daily basis, or charged and kept only for emergencies. It adds that if the phone is charged and then stored away, it will hold that charge for up to a year later. Tom Sunderland, founder of OwnFone, said: 'In a world dominated by smartphones parents face a difficult choice when it comes to finding a first phone for their child. 'We wanted to design a fun product that appeals to children but puts parents in complete control and minimizes usage while still providing a vital connection between parent and child.' The 1stFone costs from £55 and is available through the OwnFone website. The site also says that the 1stFone is ideal for seniors, as well as a work phone, because its been designed to be hard-wearing. OwnFone plans to launch the 2ndFone - an inexpensive handset that can be taken to festivals, for example. For more information go to: www.myownfone.com .

Jailed: Osas Odia, who returned to Britain after being deported, has been jailed for two years for his role in a £2.7million lottery scam . A Nigerian who returned to Britain after being deported has been jailed for his role in a £2.7million lottery scam. Osas Odia, 33, was booted out of the UK in 2005 after immigration officials discovered he was using a forged stamp in his passport to work. However, the management graduate was allowed to return on a marriage visa after marrying a British nurse. Upon returning he joined a group of Nigerian fraudsters who sent thousands of letters to people across the world telling them they had won millions on the lottery. The scam letters told readers they would have to send money to 'unlock' their huge windfall. One victim, Betty McClellan, 62, wired £264,000 to the fraudsters to release her 'lottery win'. When it never arrived, Mrs McClellan was shot dead by her husband Hersey McClellan, 63, in their Los Angeles home in 2010. He then turned the gun on himself. Meanwhile an elderly woman living in Bristol lost £312,000 after she wrongly believed she had won £1.8million on the Australian lottery. Prosecutor Andrew Evans said the loss of the money had a devastating impact on the Bristol woman. 'She was buying a new home and intended to settle the balance from the winnings she was expecting,' he told Croydon Crown Court. 'She is now living in sheltered accommodation and feels vulnerable and extremely embarrassed and her family have lost their inheritance.' Marriage: The management graduate was allowed to return on a marriage visa after marrying a British nurse . The victims included a farmer from Indiana who lost £339,000 in the hope of winning £14.9million and a Venezuelan businessman who lost £163,000. Police identified 13 victims worldwide, who each lost an average of £207,000, after they became convinced they were due huge pay-outs. Odia's role in the conspiracy was to launder some of the money which was sent by the victims through three bank accounts in his name. Victim: Betty McClellan, 62, wired £264,000 to the fraudsters to release her 'lottery win'. When it didn't arrive, she was shot dead by her husband in their Los Angeles home in 2010. He then turned the gun on himself . The Nigerian pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder criminal property and was jailed for two years on Friday. Odia, of Erith, south London, had been allowed to finish his degree before he was sentenced. Judge Jeremy Gold QC told him: 'You are a man of some ability and you have just completed a degree and I hope that means you will not be tempted to return to this sort of offending. 'You played a full part in laundering the proceeds of a sophisticated fraud.' His lawyer Paul Brill said: 'He is alarmed and upset by the nature of the fraud and did not realise people's life savings were being taken so callously in the way they were. 'His previous conviction was for a false stamp in his passport that allowed him to work. He is not workshy and has a strong work ethic.' It is understood that Odia will be allowed to stay in Britain when he is released because of his marital status. The plot's ringleaders, who spent the money on property, were jailed at an earlier hearing for conspiracy to defraud. Obinnam Nwokolo, 37, of Erith, was jailed for six years and four months and student Uchechhukwu Onuoha, 40, also of Erith, was jailed for five years and two months. Another money launderer, Sergius Ene, 44, of Ilford, was jailed for 16 months.","Osas Odia deported in 2005 after using forged stamp in his passport to work .
