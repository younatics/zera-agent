"By . Hamish Mackay . The Spanish football federation, the RFEF, has announced that its referees will use vanishing spray in the country's top two leagues from the beginning of this season. The spray, which consists mainly of water and butane, is used by referees to stop players encroaching at free-kicks. It evaporates within a matter of seconds. Versions of the spray were trialled in England in the 1980s but it never became a permanent feature of the game. Three decades on, that appears to be changing across Europe. World Cup: The spray is used to ensure the Croatian wall remains 10 yards from the position of the free-kick . The Italian football federation have already announced that they will use the spray in Serie A and Serie B while the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 are also expected to adopt the spray in the near future. The FA have given no suggestion that they will follow suit but with it being used so effectively at the World Cup in Brazil there appears to be little rational opposition to its use. Vanish: The spray disappears after less than a minute .

The incident happened on Thursday last week and neither player featured in weekend’s 4-2 defeat at Notts County. Vale boss Micky Adams says the club will hold an internal investigation. Sacked: Daniel Jones has had his contract terminated by Port Vale after a training ground incident . Injured: Skipper Doug Loft suffered a broken cheekbone during the incident . Issues: Port Vale manager Micky Adams says the club will hold an internal investigation . But the club have already decided to sack 27-year-old Jones who has a year remaining on his contract. Captain Loft - who suffered a suspected broken cheekbone - is contracted until the end of the season. Loft's solicitor Paul Dodds said: ‘Doug is genuinely shocked by what has happened to him. He is focusing on obtaining the best treatment so he can get back  playing as quickly as possible. ‘However, given the type of injury, it cannot be ruled out that legal proceedings will follow.’ The defeat to relegation threatened County now means it is unlikely that Vale will make the play-offs as they are 10 points off with four games left to play. 'It's been a poor week for us,' Vale boss Adams told the BBC. 'For legal reasons, there's very little I can say other than on Thursday there was an incident between two players. 'The training ground incident resulted in one of the players, who I might add is an innocent party to this, receiving a facial injury that has consequently ruled him out for the rest of the season. 'It's another negative headline that, for some reason, this club attracts. But it has to be dealt with internally. 'Incidents like we had are disappointing, but they happen. 'The players who have represented the club over the past two years should feel proud. Even in the season when we went into administration, I was proud of everybody's efforts.'","Daniel Jones has been sacked by Port Vale after a training ground bust-up .

Fulham were sent crashing into the Championship after a woeful season which saw the club drop into the second tier for the first time in 13 years.

But now Apple is rumoured to be rolling out an in-store service that could mean iPhone 5C owners with a cracked screen could have them repaired while they wait. The service is thought to be being rolled out across the world from today. Oops:  Apple is rumoured to be rolling out an in-store service that could mean some iPhone owners with a cracked screen (illustrated) could have them repaired while they wait . Apple rumour website 9to5Mac claims owners of the company's colourful ‘budget’ handset - the iPhone 5C - could have a cracked screen replaced for $149 (£90) in a matter of hours. The website’s ‘multiple sources’ also claim that Apple will begin to trial iPhone 5 screen repairs too in selected U.S.stores. Apple has not confirmed the rumours but it has been offering in-store iPhone 5C screen repairs in a number of U.S. shops over the past couple of months. A member of Apple’s tech support team was vague about whether the in-store service is available in the UK this week. He told MailOnline that if staff working in one of the company’s stores can help, they will. Apple rumour website 9to5Mac claims owners of the company's colourful 'budget' handsets - the iPhone 5c - could have their screen replaced for $149 (£90) in a matter of hour. The handsets were unveiled by Paul Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at the company, in September of last year . He said that an iPhone is considered out of warranty if it is smashed  - so the repair will cost money, but the repair option is cheaper than buying a brand new handset. Currently, the screens of various models can be fixed if they are sent away, with a screen for the iPhone 4S costing £160 and an iPhone 5s £220. Apple's patent shows a weight inside the phone can alter its centre of gravity, ensuring the screen doesn't smash . The new in-store service is expected to be . rolled out in the UK and other major Apple markets this week, with the . exception of Hong Kong and Canada. A study by case maker Tech 21 claims that 90 per cent of people drop their phones every month, The Telegraph reported, suggesting that Apple's service could prove very popular. Approximately four out of five people think a repair is essential if they crack their screen, while 20 per cent said they would carry on using their phone when it is broken. However, future models of the iPhone might not need an in-store screen fixing service at all, if future plans of an indestructible handset come to fruition. A patent application filed in March of last year by Apple, showed a phone that can automatically protect itself. Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's 'Protective Mechanism for an Electronic Device' patent uses sensors to work out when the handset is falling. Once this is worked out, the patent shows a number of ways the handset can be 'saved'. They include grips on the headphone cord, a weight inside the phone to alter its centre of gravity, 'wings' and even a gas canister to keep it from hitting the floor.","Apple is rumored to be rolling out its in-store screen fixing service this week .

"By . Sarah Johnson . A contract to operate the shortest scheduled flight in the world has been awarded after a bidding war between three rivals. A Scottish airline won the contract for the flight between Westray and Papa Westray which usually lasts less than two minutes but, depending on the wind direction, has been as short as 47 seconds. The route, which is just over a mile, was among those in Orkney offered as a bundle of the islands' air services in a contract worth up to nearly £4million. Scroll down for video . Flight of fancy: A contract to operate the shortest schedule flight between Westray and Papa Westray in Orkney has been awarded . Current operator Loganair won the contract for the flight which usually lasts less than two minutes . The contract was today awarded to its current operator Scottish airline Loganair. Services will include flights between Kirkwall and the islands of Papa Westray, North Ronaldsay, Westray, Sanday, Stronsay and Eday. The contract will start in April and run for three years with the option of a 12-month extension. The Orkney Islands Council (OIC), which issued the tender, estimates the cost will be around £3.3million, or £3.9million if the council decides to extend the contract period. The service would include both passengers and freight transportation. According to the OIC, three bids were received for the Air Services Public Service Obligation Contract (PSO). All were assessed against a number of operational and service requirements. Approximately 30 per cent of the total passengers using the service are carried on behalf of the council's education service, which includes both teachers and pupils. A number of passengers are health staff and patients, carried on behalf of NHS Orkney. Runways at both Westray (foreground) and Papa Westray have been extended as part of a £300,000 upgrade by Orkney Islands Council . But Loganair also introduced its own flight offering tourists the chance to take the world's shortest scheduled flight between Papa Westray and Westray. Loganair, which has operated the Orkney inter-island service since 1967, began offering the £39 return flight in 2011 following feedback from customers keen to include the island-hopping trip in their travel plans. The move proved so popular with visitors that Loganair offered an extended season for last summer running from June to early September, with an additional morning service every Saturday. The runways at both Westray and Papa Westray have been extended - as part of a £300,000 upgrade by Orkney Islands Council of all its runways - by 197feet each to comply with new take-off regulations. The new runways are 1729feet. The shortest scheduled flight in the world is just over a mile long and between two islands in Orkney . Little over four miles long and one mile wide, Papa Westray has been hailed by travel writer Bill Bryson as his favourite place in Britain. The island is home to just over 70 people, and 60 archaeological sites. Finds include the Westray Wife - also known as the Orkney Venus - a small Neolithic figurine, carved from sandstone, that was discovered during an Historic Scotland dig at the Links of Noltland, on Westray in the summer of 2009. It was the first Neolithic carving of a human form to have been found in Scotland, and to date it is the earliest depiction of a face found in the UK. A second figurine of about the same size and shape as the Westray Wife, but made from clay, and missing its head, was discovered by archaeologists at the same Links of Noltland site during the summer of 2010.","The flight between Westray and Papa Westray in Orkney usually lasts less than two minutes .

Lucky: Ashley, now spends most of her time running around large open meadows with her four other furry friends . Happy: Ashley poses for a picture with a friend and two of Home for Life's volunteers . 'Ashley underwent many surgeries but because her back was broken she was instantly paralyzed in her back legs and there was no way to reconnect the severed nerves that connected her spine to her back half. 'Because she was a puppy when it happened, her constant growth made it difficult to keep up with surgeries, every time her legs grew, they had to be reset. 'Thankfully, his neighbours interceded and saved her, she did nearly die, but thanks to her tenacity, she's survived and thrived. Growing pains: Ms O'Fallon says because she was a puppy when the attack happened, her constant growth made it difficult to keep up with surgeries - every time her legs grew, they had to be reset . Wheelie easy: As soon as she was fully grown, she was fitted with a wheelchair and took to it right away. Now, she's not the only one in the sanctuary to be fitted with wheels to help her walk . 'As soon as she was fully grown, she was fitted with a wheelchair, she took to it right away and now plays in the Home for Life meadows, greets visitors to the sanctuary, and chases her housemates. 'Ashley now lives in a house with five other dogs, the house is connected by doggie door to an outdoor run, so she and her housemates can go in or out whenever they please and the the inside has heated floors in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. 'There are also couches and dog beds filling the interior and the dogs she lives with are the most energetic of the bunch, she enjoys running outside with them and racing, even with her wheels.' No action was taken against the unidentified man who attacked Ashley.","Ashley the Chow-Chow mix had back, pelvis and femurs broken as puppy .

"By . Kate Lyons . An anti-violence activist who stood up to superstar rappers Tyler the Creator and Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg) has revealed that she was terrified to leave her house and lived in fear of attack after receiving thousands of messages of vile abuse from fans of the rappers. Talitha Stone, 25, has told MailOnline about the heavy toll her work has taken on her saying she wanted to 'hide away and never do anything like this again' after her attempts to have the rappers banned from entering Australia led to threats of rape and death from rap fans. The abuse, which mainly took place on Twitter, included 'death threats and saying things like  they're going to grab me in the alleyway, that I need a good f***, that they're going to go for my family first. One said that they would hire someone to cut my t**s off,' she said. Scroll down for video . Talitha Stone, 25, is an anti-violence campaigner who received thousands of messages of abuse on Twitter after she protested Snoop Lion and Tyler the Creator being allowed in the country . A high school student in Melbourne even posted what he thought was Talitha's address online. The address was wrong, but it was only a street away from where Talitha was sharing a house with another girl. 'Who knows what could have happened. It was not a fun time, I didn't sleep much and jumped at noises. Every time I was alone I was panicked, I was so afraid, but at the same time I was so angry that this was my reality,' she said. The abuse started after Talitha created a petition to have Tyler the Creator denied a visa to enter Australia last year, on the grounds that his lyrics incited violence against women. His songs include lines like: 'You call this s*** rape but I think that rape’s fun, I just got one request, stop breathing' and 'I wanna tie her body up and throw her in my basement, Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went.' Talitha came to the attention of Tyler the Creator when she tweeted that he would be at a signing event in Sydney and suggested that the event organisers needed a lesson in what misogyny was. Tyler the Creator retweeted her comment to his 1.7 million fans and suddenly her phone went crazy. 'It was instant, oh my gosh, the barrage of threats, I couldn't believe it. I was just sitting there looking at my phone, I was like: ""Holy crap, what is happening? What have I done?""' When Talitha went to the police about the thousands of messages she had received, she said they laughed at her. 'They were like: ""Do you think we're going to do anything about this? Do you know how often people come in here about threats of abuse and death on Twitter?"" They just laughed at me like I was so stupid, they gave me a cyber safe brochure and sent me out.' The 25-year-old began working as an anti-violence campaigner in 2012 after she heard about the work of Collective Shout, a grassroots organisation run by Melinda Tankard-Reist . Tyler the Creator singled Talitha out at his show, not realising that she was in the audience filming his performance . The tweet that started it all: Tyler the Creator retweeted this comment from Talitha, leading to thousands of his followers posting abusive messages to Talitha . Talitha received thousands of abusive and threatening tweets from fans of Tyler the Creator. This was one of the least offensive, many of them contained threats of serious violence against the activist . Talitha ended up going to Tyler the Creator's Sydney show to film evidence of misogyny and she stood in horror as the rapper mentioned her during his set, dedicating his song, B**** Suck D***, to her. Video of the concert shows Tyler the Creator, who seemed unaware that Talitha was in the audience, call out to the 'f***ing w****' who tried to get him kicked out of the country. 'F***ing b****, I wish she could hear me call her a b****, too, f***ing w****. Yeah, I got a sold-out show right now b****. Hey this f***ing song is dedicated to you, you f***ing c***.' He also said he hoped Talitha's children 'get some messed up STDs'. Talitha said she was petrified that someone in the crowd would recognise her. 'I honestly didn't believe what I was hearing when he called me out. I was terrified.' She reported him to the police, but they said there was nothing they could do. The abuse continued for months after the concert and led to Talitha meeting with two executives from Twitter, which led to the introduction of the 'Report Abuse' button on the site. 'I was like: this is ridiculous, where's the protection for women? I got told to delete my account, that was my option. They were like, ""Why are you fuelling this?"" Me fuelling this? Are you kidding me? I'm speaking out against rape and I'm getting rape threats in return, yeah that makes sense,' she said. 'So much in me wanted to hide away and never do anything like this again, but at the same time it also fuelled me to keep doing this, I was like: There's no way they're going to silence me. It made me more determined,' she said. In January, Talitha launched a petition to have Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg) banned from the country and received social media abuse, which lasted for months . Ready to take on the world: Talitha has returned to her work as an anti-violence campaigner and in July will start a new role with Collective Shout, speaking at schools about sexual violence . This determination gave her the energy to try to get Snoop Lion (aka Snoop Dogg)'s visa revoked when he came to Australia in January. Her main objection to Snoop Lion was that he had admitted to pimping out girls in a Rolling Stone article in 2013, saying he had a bus follow him on his 2003 tour with ten women on it. 'I could fire a b****, f*** a b****, get a new ho: It was my program. City to city, titty to titty, hotel room to hotel room, athlete to athlete, entertainer to entertainer,' he said. Again Talitha petitioned (unsuccessfully) to have Snoop Lion denied access to the country, again she was hit with an onslaught of abuse from the rapper's fans. She said that this time she received less abuse and Snoop Lion did not engage with her directly, but the impact of the abuse was a lot worse. 'I didn't have anything left in me, I couldn't do it. I was completely drained. It's just so exhausting and you just feel like, what's the point sometimes, when is there ever going to be change?' The Snoop Lion campaign was the third campaign the young activist has headed up, the first involved her trying out for the Lingerie Football League in 2012. Talitha said she wanted to see what the experience was like and whether the League's insistence that the women would be treated as athletes was true. She found that it wasn't. She said that walking into try-outs 'was like walking up to a nightclub. We got told we had to have a dress code at the try outs – sports bra and short shorts. I had to take my top off so I had my sports bra on. 'If we lost they would scream at us and call us a pussy and make a 'pussy symbol' above our heads. It was a huge joke.' The reaction to Talitha's exposé was her first experience of serious online abuse, with people taking to Twitter to threaten and attack her. 'They were trying to scare me, with rape or death,' she said. The first campaign Talitha participated in was in protest of the Lingerie Football League. She tried out for the team and then wrote about the experience . Talitha is speaking out as she is about to return to work with women's advocacy group Collective Shout after a six-month hiatus. The Sydney woman became involved in advocacy work for women and girls after 'frequent unwanted sexual experiences' as a child and teenager. 'It's so sickening, I hate that this is a reality for women and it's becoming more and more common,' she said. She began researching different organisations and read news articles before she stumbled on Collective Shout, a grassroots Australian advocacy group headed up by Melinda Tankard-Reist. After the draining experience of her campaigns against the two rappers, Talitha took some time out – travelling to Europe, working a series of odd jobs and spending time with family and friends. It is only in the last few weeks, almost six months after Snoop Lion was in the country, that she has felt able to pick up her advocacy work again. 'I took a lot of time out. I had to put in boundaries. I've only just in the last month slowly, slowly got back into it,' she said. The next step for the young activist is a new role at Collective Shout speaking at schools around the country about issues to do with violence, pornography, eating disorders and the sexualisation of children. She has been visiting schools for years alongside Melinda Tankard-Reist and can't get over the fact that many of the students recognise her. 'The young people at schools I'm going to, they've heard of me. I have young kids come up to me and say: ""It is an honour, can I please shake your hand? You're my hero."" It makes no sense to me. It is just overwhelming. 'I'm doing this because I have to. I need to do this for them.'","Talitha Stone protested against Tyler the Creator and Snoop Lion entering Australia .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti believes Louis van Gaal will find it hard to take Manchester United back to the top of the Barclays Premier League in his first season. Ancelotti’s Real Madrid team come face to face with United in front of 109,000 fans at the enormous Michigan Stadium with Cristiano Ronaldo, who is not yet match fit. The Italian believes Van Gaal will succeed at Old Trafford but thinks it may take time. VIDEO Scroll down for Cristiano Ronaldo enjoys rub-down from Real Madrid physio... a lot! Out: Cristiano Ronaldo won't play against Manchester United after Carlo Ancelotti admitted his star man isn't fit . Pity: The Portugal international won't be able to face his old side when they play in Michigan on Saturday . Doing battle: New United boss Louis van Gaal will face a stern test against Carlo Ancelotti's Real . 'He is a very good and very experience manager, he has fantastic experience and he will do a fantastic job at United,' said Ancelotti at a press conference ahead of Real training. 'He is a manager who has nothing to learn. After Sir Alex Ferguson, it was more difficult for United, but they now have to rebuild a team. 'They have signed good players, but building a team is not easy and the Premier League is a very competitive league. 'It will not be easy to win in the first year because there are many competitive teams who want to win. 'It is not easy to implement a new system. It is important that the player is convinced, but it is difficult to say how long it will take.' Ancelotti won the Premier League title with Chelsea in his first season in 2009/10 and led Real to the Champions League crown last season. He was on United’s short-list to replace David Moyes after Ferguson’s successor was sacked last April. Asked about this on Friday, he said: 'These are rumours that usually happen, but I am at a fantastic club. 'I have lots of respect for United, but I am happy here and I think they have made a good chance in Louis van Gaal.' Injury problems: Ronaldo will not face his former employers on Saturday for Real Madrid . Ronaldo has joined up with Real here in Michigan but will not play against his old club on Saturday. Ancelotti said: 'He has been working individually, separate from the team, but he will not play tomorrow and will train when back at Madrid because we will use him in the Super Cup. 'The plan for Cristiano was right. We gave him one month of rest and started back on July 26, but he needs to recover completely and for this reason we don’t want to take a risk tomorrow. Disappointing: Ronaldo will be gutted at the news he will miss this Saturday's game against his former side . 'It’s never a friendly against Man Utd. It is a fantastic team in a fantastic stadium, but it is the last game of our tour and we want to finish well. 'We need to play a good game tomorrow because we play a fantastic team. 'I am not surprised by the crowd. The people here have a fantastic culture, they support our team and soccer is improving really quickly in the USA.' During his press conference, Ancelotti was informed by English reporters that his former Chelsea midfielder was about to join Manchester City on loan. He said: 'I didn’t know this. I’m really surprised because I thought he was coming here to play in USA to play. 'It’s too late for me to take him to Madrid but I’m really happy for Frank as I have a good memory of him.

"By . Kate Lyons . A Queensland man says he has not paid a toll since the government switched to an electronic-only payment system on toll roads, no longer providing an option for motorists to pay cash. Bob Jarvis, 68, a former councillor from Tewantin says it is his 'constitutional right' to pay by cash and that Queensland Motorways should provide an option for people to pay tolls using coins. Mr Jarvis, who frequently drives across the Gateway Bridge between Brisbane and Noosa, said the first time he drove across the bridge after they removed the option for motorists to pay by cash he did not understand the e-toll system and thought Queensland Motorway had removed the toll. Bob Jarvis says he would be happy to pay tolls if he could pay them in cash . The 68-year-old says it is his constitutional right to pay via 'gold and silver coin' and he does not understand the electronic payment system or feels safe sharing his credit card details over the phone or online . 'I made sure I had plenty of change in my ash tray and I thought ""Oh hello, there's no way I can pay this toll, there's no baskets."" I was completely unaware of how to pay it,' he told MailOnline. A short time later he received a 'nasty bill in the mail', which demanded not only the $4 toll, but also a $7.71 administrative fee. Mr Jarvis called up to complain and eventually paid the money, after deducting the cost of the phone call and postage – sending Queensland Motorways a cheque for 17 cents. Since then he has continued to refuse to pay tolls via electronic means, insisting he would pay in cash if someone would give him that option. 'I'm certainly not going to give them my credit card details over the phone or pay it online. Blokes in my age group have been warned in the papers and warned all over the place not to give your credit card details to people. 'So I wrote a handwritten, signed and dated letter explaining that I had the money in my hand but there was no way to pay for it – they could come out and collect it from me.' The Tewanten man has received numerous fines for failing to pay his tolls, each time he writes a handwritten letter in reply explaining his views . Mr Jarvis says he knows his legal rights so well because his father used to make him read the Australian constitution and quiz him on it . Mr Jarvis bases his views on this article from chapter five of the constitution . Mr Jarvis, who calls himself a 'bush lawyer' said he was quizzed on the Australian Constitution by his father as a child and remembered a clause that, he believes, gives his position legal backing. 'In Chapter Five, section 115 it says: ""A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payments of debts."" 'They kept sending me notices and they got debt collectors onto me and stuff, eventually I said I'm quite happy to go to court about this and I'll just ask the magistrate what part of the constitution don't these toll people understand and I'll explain it to them.' In September 2012 after numerous letters and fines, some of which escalated to the State Penalties Enforcement Registry (SPER), the Queensland Motorways dropped their case against Mr Jarvis for the fines, despite having listed a hearing date. Mr Jarvis continued to receive and reply to fines until June last year when they stopped altogether, despite the fact he has travelled on the Gateway Bridge toll road several times since then. Queensland Motorways were unable to provide specific information relating to Mr Jarvis's case due to privacy laws. But Queensland Motorways CEO Brendan Bourke told MailOnline: 'Electronic tolling on the Queensland Motorways network is a much safer and more efficient system as it keeps traffic flowing helping to reduce congestion.' He also added that tolls can be paid by cash at Customer Service Centres in Murarrie and Heathwood, as well as at participating retail stores. A constitutional expert told MailOnline that Chapter Five, section 115 was instituted to stop states setting up their own currency and that courts regularly dismiss cases such as this one.

"By . Dan Bloom . Sisters Tallulah and Sequoia Ferguson spent today basking joyously in a poppy field - and things can only get better. Thursday could be the hottest day of the year so far with south east England expected to nudge 27C or 28C - seizing the current record from Cuper in Fife, an honour Scottish regions don't often hold. The first day of July saw walkers and picknickers stream into the sunshine and the usual array of pleasure boats in spots like the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park and the River Cam in Cambridge. Heavenly! Three-year-old Tallulah Ferguson and her two-year-old sister Sequoia bask in the summer weather in a poppy field overlooking Mount's Bay, Penzance. Britain could enjoy the hottest day of the year so far on Thursday with temperatures nudging 27C or 28C in the south east - which is set to steal the crown from Cuper in Fife . Sun! The first day of July saw walkers and picknickers stream into the warm weather and sparked the usual array of pleasure boats and sun-worshippers . But those who want to enjoy the weather had better make the most of it. Although things will clear by Thursday, tomorrow will see bands of showers sweep down from northern Scotland with up to a centimetre of rain falling in an hour in some areas. And on Friday, once the mini-heatwave has passed, large parts of the country are set to be hit by rain again especially towards the evening. Showers are expected to persist through some of the weekend - which could mean a damp welcome for the glitterati of the cycling world when they descend on Leeds for the first stage of the Tour de France on Saturday. And strawberries and cream sales at Wimbledon could be affected as the eyes of the world fixate on Centre Court for the ladies' singles final on Saturday, followed by the men's final on Sunday. A Met Office spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Tomorrow’s looking fairly dry and sunny – there’s bits of cloud around for most people and there’s a chance that there could be some showers moving into north west Scotland in the afternoon. ‘Some areas could have 10mm in an hour as the band of showers moves down across the north of the country. Picturesque: With these scenes today in the south west of England, the rain and mud of Glastonbury seems like an age ago - and things are due to peak on Thursday . Careful! Tallulah Ferguson, three, (pictured) had better not be a hayfever sufferer as Thursday's hot temperatures and clear skies will send pollen counts soaring . Enjoy it while you can: Showers will begin to sweep across Britain on Friday and could persist into the weekend, dampening Wimbledon and the Tour de France . ‘Thursday is probably going to be the warmest day of the week. We could see temperatures in the mid-20s for most of England and Wales and the south east will see temperatures of 25C or 26C. ‘We may just bump a 27C which was the warmest day of the year so far on June 18 in Cuper, Fife – a rare honour for Scotland. ‘Unfortunately grass pollen levels will be high or very high which isn’t helped by the hot weather and clear skies. ‘Into the weekend it becomes a bit more changeable. The south east will hold on to that dry weather the longest but we’ll see increasingly showery weather.' The warm weather comes after seven warmer-than-average months in a row - which have brought autumn forward and led to a bumper year for British wine. Growers claim 2014 could be a vintage year for British plonk, once widely sneered at, with growers at home taking on the legendary names from historic European vineyards and the New World. Clive Vickers, who co-owns the Halfpenny Green Vineyard in . Bobbington, Shopshire, said: 'We've been growing grapes here for 30 . years now and going back to the 1980s there was definitely a stigma . attached to what we were doing. Idyllic: The River Cam was as crowded as ever today as tourists flocked to Cambridge, where temperatures could reach their highest level of the year so far on Thursday . A dog's life: Pleasure-seekers of all species enjoyed the sunny weather today on the River Cam, and there could be more to come, but only while most people are at work . Plonk: There is plenty for those punting on the River Cam to drink while they enjoy themselves, as a warm seven months have led to bumper British wines . 'But during the last two or . three years, as a country, we have realised we can now make really . decent wine, which is now winning awards on a regular basis. 'Such is the interest we are no longer producing enough wine to deal with the demand.' English Wine Producers, a group representing many top vineyards, said: 'The 2013 harvest figures for the UK revealed the highest production on record, a total of 33,384 hectolitres, equating to just below 4.5million bottles. 'This is the highest volume ever, breaking the previous record of four million bottles in 2010. The increase reflects the on-going rise in planting that the industry continues to experience. In the last seven years, hectarage has doubled. 'Sparkling wine now accounts for around two thirds of England's total production with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier accounting for just under 50 per cent of recent plantings, followed by Bacchus.' Today conservationists, including from the National Trust, Woodland Trust and RSPB, united to say our fields, woodlands and hedgerows are displaying signs of change they would not usually expect to see until August or September. Sizzling! Crowds enjoyed a bright day at Wimbledon, but things could turn before the weekend - bad news for the ladies' singles final on Saturday and the men on Sunday . Looking bright: Through their sunglasses, thousands of people watched Swiss ace Roger Federer win his fourth-round match against Tommy Robredo today . Forecast: Which areas could be facing rain over the next few days. Despite some rain Thursday could be the hottest day of the year in the south east . Hawthorn berries are already turning red, holly berries are ripening, and beech and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule. Leon Brown, meteorologist at The Weather Channel, said the first tropical weather system of the summer is due to move over the northern Atlantic towards the end of this week. He said: 'It looks like we will see quite a drop in temperatures this weekend as a cold front moves south east from Friday night to Saturday morning. North west England and north Wales may receive over 30mm of rainfall. 'Wimbledon should be fine and sunny for the women's final with the roof open, but there is risk of showers on Sunday afternoon for the men's final. 'For the Tour de France early rain Saturday morning should clear to sunshine and isolated showers, and much of the afternoon fine and quite sunny with a moderate west wind.' Mr Brown agreed Thursday could be the hottest day of the year - saying temperatures may nudge 28C in the south east.","Three-year-old Tallulah Ferguson and her sister Sequoia, two, basked in sun by Mount's Bay in Penzance, Cornwall .

"By . James Groves . Support for Scottish independence is crumbling as the referendum approaches, a new poll revealed yesterday. The YouGov poll for the Times found that just 35 per cent of Scots would vote ‘Yes’ in a referendum tomorrow, with 54 per cent saying they would vote ‘No’. Just 11 per cent said they were still undecided or would not vote. First Minister Alex Salmond has staked his future on Scotland voting yes for independence . The findings are a major blow to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond, who has staked his credibility on achieving a close result in the September 18 independence referendum. The poll suggests that concerns about Scotland’s economic prospects are uppermost in the minds of voters. Just 27 per cent believe the country would be better off economically on its own, while 49 per cent believed it would be worse off and 11 per cent said there would be no difference. Meanwhile, just 17 per cent said they would be personally financially better off under independence, compared to a substantial 43 per cent who said they would be worse off, and 23 per cent believed it would make no difference. Better Together leader Alistair Darling takes a tour round the Royal Highland Show . Blair McDougall, campaign director for the pro-union Better Together, said: ‘This poll is a major setback to Alex Salmond’s negative and divisive campaign. ‘The more people think about the consequences of breaking up the UK for jobs, pensions and public services, the more they are saying no thanks to separation.’","YouGov poll found that just 35 per cent of Scots would vote ‘Yes’

Thousands of fans risk being turned away from matches if they buy tickets through unofficial vendors, but The Mail on Sunday found firms on the internet brazenly offering illicitly obtained tickets at up to 14 times the face value. Our investigation found the internet is flooded with websites offering inflated prices for England’s games, all of which are now sold out on the official Fifa website. Many of the tickets are believed to have originally been allocated to sponsors, partners and officials, but resold for a profit in strict breach of Fifa’s rules – and Brazilian law. Instead of cod and chips, England’s fans . in Manaus will be able to try deep-fried tambaqui, an Amazonian fish – . and member of the piranha family. England fans could be served piranha and chips when they land in Brazil for the World Cup . Restaurant boss Mario Freitas Do Valle . says England coach Roy Hodgson gave the piranha and chips snack – which . will be sold in paper cones for £2 – his blessing when he visited Manaus . earlier this year . Viagogo, founded in London and now based in Switzerland, is offering top category 1 tickets with a face value equivalent of £91 for England’s match with Costa Rica on June 24 in Belo Horizonte for as much as £974 – a  mark-up of more than 1,000 per cent. The tickets appear along with category 3 tickets – £47 at face value – for the game against Uruguay on June 19 for as much as £676. For England’s opening World Cup game against Italy in Manaus next Saturday night, £91 tickets are on offer at £884 on website Ticketbis. Elsewhere on the web, Live Football Tickets and 1st 4 Football Tickets – operated by the same company – are selling the same category tickets for £501 each. Both sites advertise a UK phone number, with one boasting that they ‘proudly accept’ Visa. Last night Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, co-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ticket Abuse, criticised the firm, saying: ‘Visa, as one of the main sponsors of the World Cup, should not be facilitating and profiting from the dubious sale of these tickets. Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, the co-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ticket Abuse, criticised vISA . ‘Are they going to refund fans who have bought tickets using their Visa card and are left disappointed when they  can’t get in the stadium? I think they should. ‘Every ticket a tout is reselling is one a genuine fan has been deprived of buying at face value. If the ticket has somebody else’s name on, they’re going to be hugely disappointed if it is checked and they’re not allowed in. ‘It’s great The Mail on Sunday is highlighting this issue.’ When a reporter posing as a prospective buyer called the 1st 4 Football Tickets sales line, a staff member said: ‘We sell them on behalf of sellers who obtain them through their ways that they get them – could be corporate sponsorship, it could be balloting systems… not quite sure. We don’t really care as long as they work.’ When asked whether it was legitimate, the employee, who claimed to be working in Madrid, said: ‘It’s not and it is. It’s not in terms of you’re not buying them through Fifa. 'If you’re calling us, chances are that you’ve already tried that route and it didn’t happen and you’re looking for tickets. So that’s what we do.’ Asked about the chances of being turned away when using a ticket with someone else’s name on, he added: ‘I highly doubt it… they’re not going to check 90,000, or whatever the capacity of the stadium is.’ Ticketnetwork, which operates out of the US, is selling the same tickets for as much as £542. Asked by an undercover reporter whether the sales broke Fifa’s rules, a staff member said: ‘To my knowledge, it does not.’ Kevin Miles, of the Football Supporters Federation, said: ‘We have dealt with hundreds of heartbroken fans who have been ripped off by their genuine attempts to buy tickets through less than genuine websites. 'They have paid good money for tickets which don’t exist or were originally stolen, then cancelled, rendering them worthless. Fifa officials have been accused of ‘hijacking’ the £30 million Viaduto Sao Cristovao walkway linking Rio’s Maracana stadium and the nearby Quinta da Boa Vista park. Opened last month as a vital route for residents over a busy road, the mayor’s office has said it will be used only by ‘Fifa VIPs’ during the tournament – much to the anger of locals . The £30¿million Viaduto Sao Cristovao walkway linking Rio¿s Maracana stadium and the nearby Quinta da Boa Vista park is the subject of controversy . ‘A health warning should be placed against any site offering World Cup tickets outside official channels.’ Thierry Weil, Fifa’s marketing director, said fans ‘paying a fortune’ for tickets through Viagogo ‘will be disappointed’ when their tickets are rejected at stadiums. Fifa has identified some tickets sold on the platform and invalidated them, he said. Viagogo admitted the company openly flouts Fifa’s ticketing rules, but added: ‘We do not make World Cup tickets available to anyone in the UK or Brazil. We have tickets to every game available to people in other countries, from well below face value, to above face value for high-profile games. ‘It is legal for people to resell tickets on our marketplace in those countries, and gives people who didn’t get a ticket from Fifa a chance to go.’ Visa said: ‘The issue of ticket reselling is the responsibility of Fifa and they have an enforcement team in place to deal with these matters. ‘Cardholders who transacted with unofficial sellers and didn’t receive promised goods should contact their bank to report non-receipt of promised goods and determine next steps for remedy.’","Fifa has vowed to clamp down on ticket touts who are selling some tickets at 1,000% above face value .

"By . Nick Craven And Martin Delgado . Embroiled: Christopher Cully, founder of celebrity security firm Greymans Ltd . The Mail on Sunday has uncovered new evidence showing direct links between one of the firms on the Soca list – celebrity security firm Greymans Ltd – and the notorious blagger at the heart of the case, Daniel Summers. Greymans, which had offices in London, Los Angeles and Dubai, and worked for at least two major Hollywood stars, first came to police attention when Soca arrested the four corrupt PIs in 2009. We previously revealed that Greymans was hired by Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson to trap a cyber-stalker targeting a relative, and rock singer Courtney Love to trace her ‘mislaid’ bank accounts. But we have also seen several 2007 emails showing that a Greymans executive passed illegal and unambiguous orders to Summers, 34, described as the ‘linchpin’ of the blaggers. Greymans’ financial controller at the time,  Andy Driver, who died of alcoholic poisoning in 2011, even invited Summers to Greymans’ Christmas party in a London pub. In several of the email exchanges, Driver is clearly asking Summers to illegally obtain bank statements or itemised telephone bills on third parties. On June 1, 2007, Summers asks: ‘Andy, looks like your subject has an account with Lloyds. What would you like me to obtain?’ Driver replies: ‘Everything please. A months statement et al?’ Later he adds: ‘Can we make it 3 months please?’ The following month, Summers emailed bank statements and telephone bills to Driver’s Greymans email. He wrote: ‘Hi Andy, Please find attached last month’s financials and the last two months of calls (at last!!!) made from the subject’s landline.’ Driver replied: ‘Thanks Dan – you are a star.’ The messages are among several Greymans ‘orders’ this newspaper has seen, and featured in the criminal charges against Summers. No one from the firm appears to have been interviewed or prosecuted. Greymans was founded by ex-paratrooper Mike O’Neill, 56, and former Metropolitan Police Special Branch officer Christopher Cully, 54. It went into liquidation in 2011. On his profile on social media . website LinkedIn, Mr Cully states that from 2001 to 2010 as operations . director he was ‘responsible for .  .  .  management of all operations . undertaken by the company’. His . methods came under scrutiny more recently after he started his own firm . called Dilitas and became embroiled in an espionage scandal involving . one of Britain’s richest women. He . was accused of spying on a nanny employed by super-rich hedge-fund boss . Elena Ambrosiadou during a rancorous legal battle with her estranged . husband over their £200 million fortune. Spying claim: The £16million-a-year hedge fund boss Elena Ambrosiadou and her £60m yacht Maltese Falcon . Ms Ambrosiadou claimed that Mr Cully was hired  by her husband, financial mathematician Dr Martin Coward, to gather personal information about the nanny which could then be used to persuade her to inform  against Ms Ambrosiadou. Greek-born Ms Ambrosiadou was named in 2004 as the UK’s highest paid woman with a £16 million salary. With her husband she founded asset management firm Ikos, and owns several expensive homes and a 300ft yacht, Maltese Falcon, worth £60 million. The couple, both aged 55, parted in 2008 amid allegations that Dr Coward had tried to set up a rival hedge fund in Monaco using mathematical formulae taken from Ikos. The pair dropped lawsuits each was bringing separately against the investigators suspected of spying on them. Mr Cully said last night: ‘The allegations against Dilitas and me are false. A week before the matter should have gone to court, she withdrew them and paid 60 per cent of the costs.’","MAIL ON SUNDAY reveals links between celebrity security firm Greymans Ltd and blagger Daniel Summer .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Jordan Belfort has revealed that he will spend the next year working to pay off the millions of dollars of debt he owes his previous investors. The real-life Wolf of Wall Street said that he aims to make $100 million over the next year in a non-stop road tour across the United States. The motivational speaker confirmed that exactly half of what he makes will be given to the U.S. government in restitution. Jordan Belfort says he will pay back $50 million of the $110 million he owes his previous investors after a motivational speaking tour of the US . The real life Wolf of Wall Street plans to keep any money he earns during his Australian tour, kicking off in June . It will go towards the $110 million he owes to his 1513 victims as part of his sentencing agreement, after spending only 22 months in jail in 2004 for fraud and money laundering. 'It's an amazing thing for me that I am having this opportunity to pay it back,' Belfort told the Sunday Telegraph. 'It takes the redemption story for myself to a whole different level. I am doing it because it's the right thing to do.' So far, The Wolf has only paid back $11.6 million to investors. But any money he earns during his Australian tour, kicking off in June, will go straight into his pocket. The former stockbroker was recently brought to life on the big screen as Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed him in The Wolf Of Wall Street . This is despite him being convicted of raking in $200 million from his Long Island-based brokerage, Stratton Oakmont, during the late 1980s and 90s. The US Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Belfort's firm in 1998 and he was then convicted and sentenced to four years in jail in 2003. But Belford won't stop trying to make the big bucks once his debt is paid, saying that he'll probably continue to work, but just at a slower pace. 'It's more about focusing about lifestyle, family, charitable stuff. I still love to have fun, to travel, to drink occasionally. I am not going to let loose with a bag of cocaine and three hookers, I think I have grown out of that,' he said.","Jordan Belfort aims to pay $50 million of debt back to previous investors .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . New Orleans marked the 40th anniversary on Saturday of one of the saddest days of its history and a tragic event which is regarded as the largest mass murder of gay people in U.S. history. The Upstairs Lounge arson attack occurred on June 24, 1973 when a flash fire tore through a gay bar in New Orleans’ French Quarter. In less than 20 minutes, 32 people were killed, dozens more critically injured and those who managed to escape watched helplessly as friends and lovers burned to death before their eyes. The Upstairs Lounge arson attack occurred on June 24, 1973 when a flash fire tore through a gay bar in New Orleans' French Quarter, killing 32 people in less tan 20 minutes . Back in 1973 local politicians and religious leaders wanted nothing to do with the fire and little effort was made to bring whoever started the suspected arson to justice . At the time local politicians and religious leaders wanted nothing to do with it and little effort was made to bring whoever started the suspected arson to justice. The powerful Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans at the time, Phillip Hannan, did not offer his support or sympathy to victims. Now 40 years on, the event is gaining greater recognition for its significant role in the fight for greater rights for gay people. This year’s milestone anniversary was marked with a special mass in New Orleans, while the current Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has apologized for the church's silence over the tragic event. 'In retrospect, if we did not release a statement we should have to be in solidarity with the victims and their families,' Archbishop Gregory Aymond recently wrote in an email to TIME. 'The church does not condone violence and hatred. If we did not extend our care and condolences, I deeply apologize.' This is a view inside the UpStairs bar following the flash fire that left 32 dead and 15 injured. Most of the dead were found near the windows in the background . Archbishop Gregory Aymond, right, has apologized for the lack of compassion shown by the then Archbishop Phillip Hannan, left . At St. George's Episcopal Church a Mass was held on Saturday 22 June to remember the 32 people who died. It was the one of only two churches to eventually carry out services for the dead. The fire is believed to have been started by an unruly patron who returned to the UpStairs Lounge some 30 minutes after being thrown out and deliberately set the stairwell on fire. On discovering the blaze, the barman immediately led some thirty patrons out of the back exit to the roof until the group could climb down from another building's roof to the ground floor. Sadly some thirty others were left inside the second-floor club, and some attempted to squeeze through barred windows in order to escape. One man managed to squeeze through the 14-inch gap, only to fall to his death while burning. Another man clung to the bars of one window until he died, his charred remains were visible to onlookers for hours afterwards. George ‘Mitch’ Mitchell managed to escape, but returned to rescue his boyfriend, Louis Broussard; only for both to die in the fire - their remains showed them clinging to each other. 40 years on the Upstairs Lounge arson attack is gaining greater recognition for its significant role in the fight for greater rights for gay people . Mayor Mitch Landrieu, right, has issued an official certificate commemorating the anniversary of the fire, something would have been unthinkable for his father Moon Landrieu, left, to do at the time of the fire . The likely suspect who was arrested in relation to the attack was Rogder Dale Nunez. When questioned, Nunez went into convulsions and was taken to hospital, where he escaped. Nunez was never picked up again by police, despite frequent sightings in the French Quarter afterwards. A friend later told investigators that Nunez confessed to the deed while drunk on at least four occasions. He had told the friend that he . squirted the bottom steps with Ronsonol bought at a local Walgreens and . tossed in a match. He didn't realize, he claimed, that the whole place . would go up in flames. Nunez killed himself a year later. His autopsy revealed a brain tumor. New Orleans in the early 1970s was an extremely homophobic place as typified by the response of authorities following the fire. Neither Mayor Moon Landrieu or any other government official made a public statement about the tragedy. The exterior of the Upstairs Lounge as it looks today . No arrest was made in the case, even though authorities knew who set the fire. Out of fear and shame, some family members of the deceased refused to claim the ashes of their 'loved' ones. On the issue of identifying the victims, Major Henry Morris, a detective with the New Orleans Police Department said, 'We don't even know these papers belonged to the people we found them on. Some thieves hung out there, and you know this was a queer bar.' Churches were either silent or subtly suggested the victims deserved what they got, most refused the use of their facilities for a memorial service. Father Bill Richardson of St. George's Episcopal Church, however, believed the dead should have a service. He graciously allowed, over the protest of many parishioners, the use of St. George's sanctuary for a prayer service, which was attended by roughly 80 people. A plaque now exists at the site of what was the Upstairs Lounge in 1973 and the scene of the largest mass murder of gay people in U.S. history . He was subsequently chastised by his bishop and received no small amount of hate mail. Days later a Unitarian Church also held a small memorial service. A larger service was held on July 1 at St. Mark's United Methodist Church on the edge of the French Quarter. The UpStairs Lounge fire was a seminal moment in the history of gay New Orleans and significant advancements have been made in the years since and now the city leads the South in extending civil rights to gay city employees. Other events being held to mark the 40th anniversary of the tragedy include a lecture at the Historic New Orleans Collection, a jazz funeral procession from there to the site of the fire and even a musical. The city recognizes domestic partnerships for gay and straight couples, and Mayor Mitch Landrieu - son of Moon Landrieu - has issued an official certificate commemorating the anniversary of the fire, something that would have been unthinkable for his father to do at the time of the fire. Independent filmmaker Robert Camina is making a documentary about the tragedy which documents what happened and how far the . advancement of gay rights has come in the ensuing 40 years. He is currently in pre-production on this full length feature entitled 'Upstairs Inferno' and is aiming to primarily tell the story through emotional interviews of the survivors, families of the victims, and key players in the aftermath.

"By . Marc Weinreich . Former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry is on the wrong side of the law again . Former Washington D.C. Mayor Marion Barry's Jaguar has been towed and impounded over more than $2,800 in unpaid traffic fines following a car accident on Saturday. The current D.C. Councilman drove the car into traffic on Saturday night. He was released from the hospital on Sunday after suffering what the diabetic said was a 'hypoglycemic attack' that caused him to become disoriented and drive into an oncoming traffic lane in D.C. Mr Barry, 78, owes $2,824 for 21 outstanding tickets that date back to February 2012, according to The Washington Times. The traffic tickets aren't the first time he's been caught on the wrong side of the law. In 1990, Mr Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine and was subsequently arrested by FBI officials on drug charges. Footage of the crash on Saturday obtained by Fox DC shows the fender-bender. Following the accident, he was cited by . police for driving on the wrong side of the road, expired tags and for . not having insurance. According . to the Washington Times, Mr Barry accrued eight of the fines - totaling . $1,460 - for failing to show current tags -- the tags were out of date . because they belonged to an old BMW he had once driven. Scroll down for video . Towing for owing: D.C. Councilman Marion Barry will have to pay more than $2,800 in unpaid traffic fines -- dating to 2012 -- to get the Jaguar back .

He . also given five speeding tickets after he was picked up by cameras for . driving 11-15 miles per hour over the speed limit in the past two years. Those tickets will cost him $684. The former Mayor also reportedly ran a red light, which will cost him another $150. Mr Barry even had the Jaguar booted on two different occasions and the car had also reportedly been stolen at one point, according to the Times. Most recently, he picked up a ticket last week -- a day before the crash -- for reportedly parking his car too close to a fire hydrant. In his defense: Marion Barry claimed on Twitter on Sunday, a day after the accident, that low blood sugar levels caused him to crash . D.C. laws allow city council members and members of Congress to park in 'any available curb space' while on 'official business' -- as long as they don't block hydrants, loading zones or violate rush-hour traffic laws, the Times reports. On Monday, two days after the accident, his only son, 34-year-old Christopher, was arrested for driving with a revoked license, according to Fox News. The license had been revoked after he was found to be driving under the influence near the White House in May. Last week, even though he had been ordered not to drive because of the May incident, the son was arrested for driving and was found to be in possession of synthetic marijuana, and was subsequently arrested.

"By . Nick Craven . Romantic notion: Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt with Chinese wife Lucia pictured earlier this year . Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has been accused of ‘hypocrisy’ for saying British people don’t care enough for the elderly – when Coalition cuts mean nearly 33,000 older people have lost access to day care centres. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the dramatic cuts amount to a 37 per cent loss since 2010 in the number of places at the centres, described as a ‘lifeline against isolation’ for many. Charities said it was hypocritical for Mr Hunt to launch a fight against loneliness among the elderly while slashing budgets and forcing the  closure of the day centres. ‘Policy rhetoric about preventative services without funding is surely hypocritical,’ said Richard Furze, chief executive of the charity Friends Of The Elderly. ‘The Government should not be too quick to tell others what more they should do when they are cutting funding for services such as community transport and day centres that  are a lifeline to so many older people.’ The day care centre figures from the NHS Information Service show that in 2010 there were 88,498 elderly people using centres in England, which fell to 68,160 by 2012 and 55,655 by 2013. In some regions such as the West Midlands, the numbers plummeted by 52 per cent while the drop was 46 per cent in London. Meanwhile Mr Hunt, who used China as an example of a society where the elderly are better treated, was accused of a ‘romantic’ and outdated view. Caroline Abrahams, director of Age UK, said: ‘We were not wholly convinced by Mr Hunt’s rather romantic suggestion that we have lessons to learn from China. Life is changing quite fast there. Several generations ago, families there would stay together, especially in rural areas, but they are industrialising so quickly and younger people are moving to the  cities in search of work, very often leaving the older people behind.’ Mr Hunt, who has a Chinese wife, Lucia, had spoken ten days ago of  ‘a forgotten million who live amongst us – ignored to our national shame’. Placing the onus on families, he had claimed: ‘Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship.’ He added: ‘I am struck by the reverence and respect for older people in Asian culture. ‘In China and Japan, it is quite normal for elderly parents to live with their children and their families.’ Campaigners also derided a recent government suggestion that one way for the elderly to combat isolation was to connect to the internet on tablet computers and hold video conferences with friends and relatives. The suggestion was made in response to a critical House of Lords committee report on ministerial plans to cope with the care crisis. Alone with their troubles: Charities say that too many old people are being left in their homes without any company . But Jane Silk, director of the newspaper Mature Times, said: ‘It’s the ultimate insult. ‘So the elderly are to sit in the only heated room in the house with a television and a tablet for company – is that their only solution?’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Day centres can provide a valuable service but the wider problem of loneliness needs to be tackled by a change in attitude by society. There is no substitute for each and every lonely person having someone to visit them. ‘We have allocated an extra  £200 million for local authorities for 2014-15, and created a £3.8 billion budget for health and social care in 2015-16. This investment will help to drive forward better health and wellbeing for thousands of older people.’","Cuts amounting to 37 per cent since 2010 have slashed the number of places at day centres for the elderly .

"By . Mark Nicol . A Royal Marines officer who spent a year training and fighting alongside Afghan tribesmen has been honoured for inspiring a local resistance to the Taliban – drawing comparisons with Lawrence of Arabia. Captain Owen Davis, 25, who immersed himself in the culture and lifestyle of villagers in southern Afghanistan, has won the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC), Britain’s second-highest battlefield honour. Since the UK-led campaign in Helmand Province began seven years ago, hundreds of British officers have attempted to mentor Afghan personnel, with varying success. Captain Owen Davis of the Royal Marines immersed himself in Afghan culture, growing a beard, wearing a neck-scarf and learning to speak  Pashto . Few have gone to the lengths of Captain Davis, who spent every day and night with a 25-man unit of Afghan Local Police (ALP), cooking and eating with them, learning their language and gaining their trust. Captain Davis has been credited with turning the hope for a functioning ALP force into a reality in Helmand’s strategically significant district of Nahr-e Saraj. So successful was his influence that his commanders tore up the cultural advisors’ rulebook and granted Davis ‘artistic licence’ to live as an Afghan. With a wispy beard hanging six inches from his jaw and a traditional black Afghan scarf wrapped around his neck, by day Davis led the local policemen on patrol missions and firefights with rebel insurgents. In order to gain their trust completely, he also lived, ate, and slept with them, becoming so fluent in their Pashto language that he could participate in traditional night-time poetry recitals. The CGC – second only to the VC as a gallantry award – is intended to recognise his willingness to remain so perilously exposed for so long, and his bravery when confronted by the enemy. Now his feats have attracted comparisons with T.E. Lawrence, the British officer who inspired the Arab revolt against Turkish Ottoman forces in Northern Africa during the First World War. His exploits were celebrated in the epic 1962 adventure film starring Peter O’Toole. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Davis modestly dismissed any comparison and praised his bosses from the UK’s newly formed Defence Cultural Specialist Unit (DCSU) for giving him such personal freedom. He said: ‘So long as I was providing intelligence I could just get on with it. ‘My job was to go into areas where we didn’t have a lot of knowledge, to speak to the villagers and to train the local police officers. ‘In these areas allegiances could change in a moment, everyone knew somebody in the Taliban. I would lead these Afghan elements in engagements against the insurgents.’ He added: ‘Sharing a bed with the Afghans wasn’t the done thing, nobody else was doing that. I suppose I went a bit bush, especially with the really horrible beard. 'I got accustomed to the title “Toran” too, which means captain in Pashto. Owen Davis only joined the Marines after a back injury robbed him of his dream to row at the Beijing Olympics but has now been awarded The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the second highest honour . ‘Fluency in Pashto was really important as I would have lost a lot of the wit and banter without that. 'We were getting attacked by the Taliban every day. Then in the evening we’d prepare food together and recite poetry. ‘The Pashtuns have a history of great poets. We’d listen to this verse, which is often set to dreadful disco beats, until about midnight then fall asleep together on mattresses or these wicker beds outside, gazing at the stars. ‘We’d tell jokes too. They had a good sense of humour, a lot of slapstick. If somebody fell over they’d burst out laughing. 'They loved cricket and being fairly ignorant about it I had to learn fast. We’d play together. ‘Family matters were also very important, so I’d always ask about their parents and children. 'These were young guys from the villages, eager to do their bit and after a month or two together I did trust them. ‘Had there been any insurgents among them I’m sure those ALP I was closest to would have protected me.’ Davis’s friendships with his Afghans were tested to the extreme on June 13 last year when the ALP joined soldiers from the Grenadier Guards on an operation to capture a Taliban sniper – a mission which cost the life of Lance Corporal James Ashworth, who was later awarded the VC. Davis recalled: ‘Me and the Afghans knew there was enemy inside the compound so we pushed in. 'The guy with me was cut down pretty much straight away, killed after taking a burst of 15 to 20 rounds. He was touching distance from me. ‘As I moved forward to drag him out a grenade rolled around the corner. I jumped over a wall, landing upside down in a ditch. The guy who died was in his late 20s and was someone I was very close to. So I was really, really sad. Losing a close colleague is the worst feeling in the world.’ On a follow-up assault, L/Cpl Ashworth was killed trying to post a grenade through the window of a Taliban mud hut. Davis cleared the remaining enemy from the building and rescued another British casualty. Davis, who stands 6ft 4in and weighs 15 stone, joined the Marines after a serious back injury shattered his dreams of winning Olympic rowing glory in Beijing. Now he is leaving the Marines to retrain as a doctor, and is hoping to work with medical charities in Africa. But Afghanistan will forever be in his heart. ‘I was distraught to leave that country and feel so privileged to have got so close to the people,’ he said. ‘My hope is that we’ve done enough in terms of security to allow the Afghans to be educated, because that is how the next generation will build their country.

"By . Aaron Kanaan . Model Katie Cleary is beginning to share the details of the days leading up to the suicide of her estranged husband, Andrew Stern, 40, who fatally shot himself in the head at a California shooting range on June 22. ‘His last e-mails and text messages to me were very truthful and heartfelt conveying the message that he was trying to do whatever he could to make his life better despite his own personal challenges,’ Katie wrote in the caption of a photo of Andrew she has posted on Instagram. The former America’s Next Top Model contestant also shares the last message she ever sent to Andrew, as he fought his losing battle with crippling depression: ‘Whatever God brings you to, He will bring you through.’ Scroll down for video . Harbinger of healing: 'I had to post this picture again after watching Heaven Is For Real,' she writes. 'An angel appeared in our pic in Lake Como. I know Andrew is healed and at peace with the angels in heaven' Good times: Katie says she will never forget the man she shared some of the most important things in life with . Katie was caught cozying up to Leonardo DiCaprio and Adrian Grenier in Cannes just weeks before Andrew's death, with some friends believing the revelation of Katie’s flirtations sent her husband over the edge. It’s a claim Katie denies, and the animal rights activist went on CNN’s HLN on July 28 to refute the rumors before talking about the plight of Borneo’s orangutan population, which is in danger of losing their habitat to palm oil plantations. ‘I loved him very much,’ Katie, 32, said. ‘He was my heart and soul and the fact that this happened the way it did is so tragic and he was a huge animal lover and I wanted to do something to honor his memory. 'And so me and my foundation, Peace 4 Animals, decided to purchase a piece of land in Borneo on behalf of him through World Land Trust and I think this is the best way to honor him.’ Cozy: Katie was photographed in Cannes with Leonardo di Caprio last May, a month after Andrew filed for divorce . As MailOnline reported, just days before the television interview Katie learned Andrew left her nothing in his will, which he signed in 2007 — three years before their marriage. Instead, the late entrepreneur’s parents are the sole beneficiaries of his estate, including $408,000 of savings. But Katie seems to harbor no anger toward Andrew, who had filed for divorce in April after four years of marriage. ‘I will never forget my love, best friend and someone who I shared some of the most important things in life with,’ she writes in her tribute message on Instagram. Katie's father, Thomas Cleary, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, told MailOnline last month that his daughter is distraught by her husband's death. 'This is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my son-in-law.' The one-time Deal Or No Deal beauty reveals the extent of her pain. ‘My heart is heavy with such a sadness of loss that I had never thought imaginable. Andrew was a wonderful human being with such a big heart who did so much to contribute and help others,’ she writes. Grief: 'My heart is heavy with such a sadness of loss that I had never thought imaginable,' says Katie . Last photo: Just hours before he killed himself, Andrew was partying with a group of friends at a trendy Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. He posted this picture on his facebook page . ‘He was always a person who went out of his way to be a mentor and leader to those closest to him. Andrew had a smile and laugh that radiated and that will always be etched in my memory.’ ‘The last 5 years we spent together have been some of the best and most challenging times of our lives and helping Andrew through these trials and tribulations in his life have given me a perspective that shows how life is so precious and fragile and should be cherished every moment of every day,’ says Katie. She has maintained she officially split from Andrew eight months before his death and that the photos of her with Leonardo at the Gotha nightclub during the Cannes Film Festival in May were harmless. Katie . recently posted another Instagram photo that shows her with Andrew at . dinner on a vacation they had taken to Lake Como in Italy. In a corner . of the photo a bright orb hovers over them — and Katie claims it’s a . sign Andrew is now okay. ‘I . had to post this picture again after watching Heaven Is For Real,’ she . writes.Heaven is for Real is a films about a little boy's trip to heaven. ‘An angel appeared in our pic in Lake Como.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Many Labour MPs privately think Ed Miliband will not win next year’s general election, according to former frontbencher Diane Abbott. The outspoken MP told a fundraising dinner that a ‘substantial minority’ of her colleagues did not believe they would form the next government – despite being ahead in the polls. She suggested even those at the top of the party doubted Mr Miliband’s credentials, saying it was ‘problematic’ that many of the Shadow Cabinet had not backed him as leader in 2010. Diane Abbott suggested even those at the top of the party doubted the leader, saying it was ‘problematic’ that many of the shadow cabinet had not backed him as leader in 2010 . Miss Abbott was at the dinner at Monty’s Nepalese restaurant in west London to raise money for Labour’s candidate in Ealing Central, Rupa Huq - the sister of the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq. She was heard saying to senior local Labour figures: ‘Most MPs are worried that we won’t win in May - and that’s not based on figures. ‘Let’s say a substantial minority of Labour MPs don’t think we can win in May — despite the fact that statistically it can look like that. But then they tend to be MPs from outside of London. ‘Ed’s problem, one of his problems, is that he has a Shadow Cabinet and most of them didn’t vote for him, so that is problematic.’ Miss Abbott also apparently said during the unguarded exchange that whichever party forms the next government they would ‘have to put up taxation’, according to the Evening Standard. The MP for Hackney North and regular television personality, was sacked as a public health spokesman by Miliband in his shadow cabinet reshuffle last year. But she was recently revealed as Labour supporters’ top candidate in the next London mayoral elections fuelling speculation she will run. She was responding to a question from chair of the local Labour branch Steve Donnelly, who said: ‘So how does it feel inside the tent Diane at the minute?’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has struggled to overcome doubts even among his own MPs that he has what it takes to be Prime Minister . Over a buffet supper and beers, she said: ‘Whoever wins will have to put up taxation if they are serious. They won’t admit it, but they have to’. And she raised concerns about the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, saying he ‘reminds people of the Brown years, and it allows the Tories to say over and over again, ‘These were the people who crashed the car.’ But actually he is very able.’ Miss Abbott claimed today that the remarks were taken out of context, and insisted that she and most Labour MPs were very confident Labour would win next year’s election. She said: ‘All the polls point steadily in the direction of Ed Miliband winning the election. I did say some Labour MPs are worried, but I don’t think they are a substantial minority.’ Labour currently have a 3-point lead in the polls, but fewer than one in five voters think Ed Miliband looks like a future prime minister. Due to the way the electoral system works, however, the Conservatives will need a 6 per cent lead to win a majority next May. Miss Abbott, who has been an MP since 1987, embarrassed Mr Miliband last year after he made a major speech on immigration. In a newspaper article, she accused him of being too worried about opinion polls, and called on him to resist the ‘steady drumbeat of pressure’ to move to the right on the issue.","Ex-frontbencher reveals doubts about Labour leader's credentials .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Louisiana line cook got some divine inspiration on Monday when he sliced into an eggplants and found God. Clearly spelled out in the vegetable he cut for his job at Gino's restaurant in Baton Rouge were the perfectly formed letters: 'GoD..'

Undeniable: A Louisiana line cook made this miraculous discovery while slicing eggplants at a Baton ROuge restaurant . Brady showed one of the restaurant owners the miraculous sight and posed for photos in which he proudly displayed his vegetable. Co-owner Gino Marino was as shocked as Brady. 'You could cut one million eggplants and you'd probably never see it again,' Marino told WAFB. Brady said the discovery had a meaning far deeper than mere coincidence. 'Through the road, he's showing me that ""hey, I'm real"" and that's the only thing I can depend on,' Brady said. His boss agreed. 'He's showing me that ""hey, I'm real""': Jemarcus Brady made the discovery Monday and believes it is a subtle sign from God . 'God is within us,' Marino said. 'this is just one way of showing it.'

Last spring, a Hindu caterer in Leicester, England found what he believed was the undeniable likeness of the elephant-headed god Ganesh in an eggplant. In 2007, a Pennsylvania woman found the word God spelled in her eggplant, just like Brady. And holy eggplants aren't just for Christians and Hindus.

"By . Sarah Dean . A father who sought surrogacy overseas in India after trying for five years to adopt in Australia has called the case of rejected surrogate baby Gammy 'abhorrent'. Sam Everingham, who runs a support group for Australian families going through surrogacy, said he is appalled by the couple who left six-month-old Gammy behind with his poor Thai surrogate mother because he has Down syndrome. The couple from WA took Gammy's healthy sister home to Australia and left 21-year-old mother Pattaramon Chanbua to care for him despite his congenital heart condition. Scroll down for video . Australian couple Philip Copeland (left) and Sam Everingham (right) with their twin daughters . 'I was appalled by that. We want best practice around the world. For many of our parents the thought of leaving one behind is abhorrent, it’s really hard to understand,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Speaking on Monday, Everingham called for the Australian government to better support the hundreds of desperate families seeking surrogacy overseas. He suffered a 'tough' and heartbreaking experience after he and his partner were forced to go to India to have children. He lost two baby boys in a Delhi hospital in 2009 before a surrogate gave birth to his three-year-old twin girls in 2011. Everingham said he and his partner Phillip Copeland travelled to India because 'same sex couples were placed at the bottom of the waiting list for adoption' in Australia. He explained there was at least a seven-year waiting list for heterosexual couples which made the adoption process 'beyond consideration'. ‘We didn’t have any sisters, my partner or I, that were able to carry for us and we weren’t willing to ask a friend to carry. We thought that was too risky, emotionally, psychologically.’ Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua (left) holds with her six-month-old baby Gammy who was born with Down syndrome . The couple had been trying for about five years to adopt and he said overseas surrogacy is only usually an option after ‘most couples have thought long and hard for many years’. Everingham believes Australia’s laws discriminate against all childless couples. 'There is no support. That needs to be changed. There should be Medicare rebates for at least the heterosexual market that can’t carry children instead of them paying $16,000 for each IVF cycle,' he said. Describing his surrogacy experience in India, Everingham said 'it was a pretty touch journey'. He and his partner first created embryos with his sperm and a donor's eggs in 2009. Their Indian surrogate gave birth prematurely at 26 weeks to twins. One of the babies was stillborn and the other was seriously ill and died seven weeks later. 'That was one of the reasons we set up the not for profit organisation,' Everingham, who is the director of Families Through Surrogacy, said. 'There was no support for us at home or abroad and we continue to see situations with no support or counselling,' he explained. Everingham and his partner’s second try for babies led to two different surrogates having one healthy girl each in 2011. Talking about his children Ruby and Zoe, Everingham said: 'It's wonderful, it's changed our lives. 'I can see why some many people ego through so many hard years. It is so wonderful.' He explained how he now understands why 'people will go to great financial and emotional risks, and people will travel and break laws' to have children.","Sam Everingham is appalled by the Australian couple who abandoned six-month-old Gammy .

"By . Sarah Dean . Carlton . A columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald has been ordered to apologise to readers after using offensive language towards them when they questioned his criticism of Israel's attack on Gaza. Mike Carlton has come under fire for using abusive language in response to reader feedback, including calling one reader a 'Jewish bigot'. The newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir issued an apology on Tuesday night for Carlton's behaviour saying it was 'completely unacceptable'. 'I have asked Mike to apologise for these actions. Mike regrets his behaviour and will be contacting affected readers to apologise,' Mr Goodsir said. 'On behalf of the Herald, I too apologise for any offence caused.' It's the second apology from the newspaper in recent days after they were forced to recognise a cartoon showing a Jewish man watching Gaza be bombed from his armchair had caused some distress for some readers. The cartoon accompanied a column written by Carlton on the Gaza conflict. In an email obtained by the Australian that was reportedly sent to a reader named Yury, Carlton accused him of being 'the one full of hate and bile'. 'The classic example of the Jewish bigot. Now f*** off,' the email read. 'Looking forward to hearing from you after you have joined the IDF and gone off to kill some kids. Reluctantly, of course. Until then, f*** off,' another email read. Carlton also took to Twitter to fend off the criticism. 'The accusations of anti-Semitism are getting a bit tedious. My much-loved son-in-law is actually Jewish. Sorry for that inconvenient truth,' he tweeted on Monday. 'Now the loony Likudnik racists are infuriated I have a Jewish son-in-law. That's okay. I'll have him taken out and shot...' he posted not long after. The Herald was slammed earlier this week by the Attorney-General and the Jewish community for using the drawing of an old man seated in an armchair emblazoned with the Star of David, watching comfortably from a hill as bombs dropped on Gaza. 'The cartoon had its genesis in news photographs of men seated in chairs and lounges, observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot,' Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir said on Monday . The cartoon was reportedly based on the Israelis (pictured) who stood on a hill at the Israeli town of Sderot, overlooking the Gaza Strip, as they watched smoke rising following an Israeli strike on Gaza, on July 12 . Mr Goodsir said on Monday said it was a 'serious error of judgement' when they published the cartoon drawn by Glen Le Lievre on July 26. 'The Herald now appreciates that, in using the Star of David and the kippah in the cartoon, the newspaper invoked an inappropriate element of religion, rather than nationhood, and made a serious error of judgment. 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form,' Mr Goodsir wrote. His apology came after the Attorney-General George Brandis reportedly accused Fairfax Media of publishing anti-Semitic commentary on the Middle East. The Herald said the cartoon was based on real life photographs that showed men seated in chairs 'observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot'. Carlton tweeted examples of such photographs on Monday. 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form. We apologise unreservedly for this lapse, and the anguish and distress that has been caused,' the Herald's apology continued. Carlton told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that although he does not wish to comment on the cartoon that was used to illustrate his column, he stands by every word that he wrote. 'It is not anti-Semitic to criticise Israel. Just this morning the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon,  condemned an Israeli air strike on a school as a ""moral outrage and a criminal act"". 'While I have been fiercely slandered by the Jewish community, I have received overwhelming majority support from the wider Herald readership,' he said. Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mike Carlton says he has been 'fiercely slandered by the Jewish community' over his column . The columnist received a huge reactionto his strongly-worded column on July 26 . In his strongly-worded article, which came as a reaction to the death of hundreds of Palestinians, Carlton said Israel 'is waging its own war of terror on the entire Gaza population of about 1.7 million people. Call it genocide, call it ethnic cleansing: the aim is to kill Arabs'. He said he believed that the Israeli response to attacks from Hamas 'has been out of all proportion, a monstrous distortion of the much-vaunted right of self defence'. However, the Australian Jewish News website criticised Carlton's column, calling it 'insidious'. 'This column was no longer about a country, this was about a people and a race,' the editorial said. 'How low can a columnist in a mainstream newspaper sink? How low can a mainstream newspaper sink?,' it asked. The Sydney Morning Herald's apology came on the same day as an apology was demanded from The Australian newspaper for a Palestinian cartoon by Bill Leak that they ran on 31 July. The former Anglican bishop of Canberra and current APAN president George Browning told Crikey the cartoon 'expresses not the slightest sympathy for those whose children have been killed in Gaza'. The illustration shows a member of Hamas rather than a normal Palestinian, The Australian's Editor-in-Chief Chris Mitchell said as he defended it. The cartoon shows a man in military gear with a gun, patting a child on the head and saying 'there! Now you go out to play and win the PR war for daddy'. The drawing is titled 'How the West was won over' and suggests Hamas are using Palestinian children to win sympathy from the West. Liam Hogan wrote on Twitter: 'Now that the SMH has apologised for LeLievre's cartoon, it's probably time the Oz took away Bill Leak's set of brown watercolours.' And Jane Cattermole asked: 'When will The Australian be apologising for the Bill Leak cartoon? Many people offended by that as well.' 'But not Bill Leak? No. Accusing a race of killing their own children is fine and dandy,' Darryl Snow said. Around 1,700 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since the latest conflict began more than three weeks ago. It's reported 66 Israelis - all but two of them soldiers - have also died.","Columnist Mike Carlton was responding to reader feedback on a column he had written in which he criticised Israel's attack on Gaza .

"Bendigo West Liberal candidate Jack Lyons has resigned over offensive remarks posted to his Facebook page . A Victorian Liberal Party member has resigned from his seat in Bendigo West after racist and sexist comments posted on social media were brought to light. The Facebook posts from 2009 and 2010 were posted on Jack Lyons' personal page and included 'jokes' about poverty in Africa, and referred to Bendigo's historic Golden Dragon museum as 'ching chong gardens' The Herald Sun uncovered the offensive remarks on Monday and alerted the Victorian Liberal Party, who have now called an emergency meeting for Wednesday morning to discuss appropriate use of social media. One of the lines penned by Mr Lyons suggested if Africans living in poverty 'have to walk 5 miles everyday for water ... why not build the f***ing huts closer to the f***ing water'. Another is said to have referenced prolific viewing of pornography, and stated: 'You know you have a problem when every letter of the alphabet triggers a porn bonanza in your address bar...'

"By . Daniel Mills . Scott Turnbull said busy lifestyles mean people are forgetting to collect ashes . The remains of dead Australians dating back more than half a century are lying unclaimed on the shelves of funeral homes and crematoriums because people are 'too busy' to collect them. In one case, a family-owned funeral home in Tasmania has more than 200 boxed remains collecting dust on its shelves, and its company director is squaring the blame on people's modern lifestyles. Scott Turnbull from Turnbull Family Funerals said people's 'fast-paced lifestyles' are making them forget to claim their loved one's ashes. 'I think from our perspective most of the reasoning (people forget) is that we live in a fast-paced world and people don't take five minutes for anything,' he said. 'Everyone is too busy and they put things in front of them, and forget others.' The oldest ashes of a person he has date back to the 1950s, and because he was never instructed how to dispose of the remains with dignity, he feels obliged to keep them. Unclaimed funeral ashes are sitting on the shelves of funeral homes across Australia . It's creating a moral dilemma for directors of funeral homes more generally who are hoarding unclaimed urns and are unsure of what to do with them. Mr Turnbull said laws in Tasmania require funeral homes to hold on to ashes for two years, at which time they can choose how to dispose of them. He said family members can collect ashes 'days within the cremation' and if they are not collected straight away the funeral home usually gives people up to a year before making contact. 'We give next of kins and families the time they need to collect them,' he said, which could be anywhere from six to 12 months. 'We must show that we have made reasonable attempts to contact the family and it is then up to the individual funeral home, crematorium or cemetery how they want to dispose of them.' More than 200 ashes are waiting to be collected at Turnbull Family Funerals . But Mr Turnbull said out of dignity for the deceased, he usually holds onto them and in some cases people do eventually remember. 'Last year there was a lady ... who came back for her son's ashes and he died in 1969,' Mr Turnbull said. 'The lady who had made the inquiry was making a general inquiry and she didn't think for one moment he might still be here.' He said people should not allow busy schedules and lifestyles to cloud their memories and family members need to talk about wishes after they die. Mr Turnbull said some of the the most elaborate send offs are often the best. 'We have had some amazing things done,' he said. 'One person asked to be frozen into a block of ice and dropped into the water so that  as it melt the ashes drifted in to the sea.'","Tasmanian funeral director Scott Turnbull has 200 unclaimed remains .

"By . Angela Wintle . Like magic: Paul Daniels, 76, pictured with wife Debbie, has been helped with his 'trigger finger' Paul Daniels is renowned for his sleight of hand, whether dealing a pack of cards or (appearing to) saw his wife and assistant, ‘the lovely Debbie McGee’, in half. But a year ago, while the veteran magician was performing a card move for a packed audience, he realised things weren’t going according to plan. The old dexterity was missing. ‘The ring finger of my right hand had locked into a bent position,’ he says. ‘I improvised my way out of it by pressing the finger against my body and clicking it back into shape, before continuing the trick. ‘One of the reasons my magic tricks don’t go wrong is because I never tell the audience what I’m going to do, so I can swing round and change direction. But it was a close-run thing!’ After consulting his GP, Paul, 76, was referred to Donald Sammut, a specialist hand surgeon, who treated him two years earlier when he severed his left index finger with a saw while making props for his act. Mr Sammut diagnosed the problem as trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, which causes the fingers or thumb to catch or lock when bent or straightened. About three in every 100 people are affected. ‘Usually, the tendon [a band of tissue that connects the muscles and bones] fits perfectly in a tunnel [sheath] and glides easily,’ he says. ‘But if it wears in a particular area, the fibres break and form a lump where they heal. ‘When you flex your fingers and try to open them again, the tendon snags in the narrowest part of the tunnel and sticks, leaving your finger in a bent position. As the lump repeatedly rubs against the narrowest part of the tunnel, the tendon becomes inflamed and soon begins to hurt.’ The condition arises among people from all walks of life and ages – even young children. ‘You rarely find a cause, although trigger finger is more common in people with diabetes and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis,’ says Mr Sammut. ‘Paul’s condition was probably longstanding and, I suspect, aggravated by the fact that he makes his own magic props.’ Mild trigger finger may improve without treatment or after taking anti-inflammatory drugs, but if the problem doesn’t disappear after a few days it is advisable to visit your GP, who may be able to treat it by a cortisone (steroids, an anti-inflammatory) injection. Quick fix: How the six-minute operation to treat stenosing tenosynovitis is carried out . This cures about 50 per cent of patients. For more severe cases, the injection may buy time, but the condition is likely to resurface. Paul says: ‘It is painful – a shooting pain up my finger. Last year I had an injection which flattened the tendon and released the finger, but when the problem returned, the specialist suggested a minor operation, which would probably mean it never came back.’ Paul underwent the six-minute procedure under local anaesthetic at Circle Reading Hospital in Berkshire earlier this year. ‘The preparation and injections took longer than the op itself and I didn’t feel a thing,’ he says. The surgeon makes a 1cm cut across the base of the finger at about the level of the palm crease. A small incision is made into the place where the tendon is stuck, which is usually enough to release it, or a piece of the sheath can be removed. The wound is then stitched and dressed. Mr Sammut says: ‘I always stress to patients that it’s vital to keep the hand above the level of the heart afterwards, otherwise the finger swells and you may experience bleeding around the tendon, which might cause it to stick again. In Paul’s case, I put his hand in a sling to keep it elevated. You must also keep flexing the finger through the full range.’ Mr Sammut is confident that Paul will regain full use of his finger. Paul’s stitches were removed after two weeks and his finger is much improved. ‘I have enough movement to get back to work. There is such a range of magic that if the sleights of hand have to be changed, so be it. And if they become impossible, there are thousands of tricks that can be done without digital dexterity.’ Paul and Debbie tour in their new magic show, Back...

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Women taking contraceptive pills have a 50 per cent higher overall risk of developing breast cancer, a study has found. Some pills with high levels of oestrogen can raise the risk threefold, compared with that of women who have never taken the Pill or who have stopped using it, US scientists found. Pills containing low-dose hormones carried no extra risk. Women taking contraceptive pills have a 50 per cent higher overall risk of developing breast cancer, a study has found . Dr Elisabeth Beaber of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which carried out the study, said the results suggested use of contemporary oral contraceptives in the past year was associated with an increased breast cancer risk ‘relative to never or former oral contraceptive use. This risk may vary by oral contraceptive formulation’. She added: ‘Our results require confirmation and should be interpreted cautiously.’ Previous studies have suggested the increased risk declined after users stopped taking the pills, she added. Around three million women in the UK take contraceptive pills. The study – published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research – involved 23,000 women and claims to be the first to look at up-to-date formulations of oral contraceptives used in the 1990s and 2000s. Some pills with high levels of oestrogen can raise the risk of developing breast cancer threefold, compared with that of women who have never taken the Pill or who have stopped using it, US scientists found. It compared 1,102 in whom breast cancer had been diagnosed and 21,952 without the disease. Those with breast cancer were aged 20 to 49 years, with cancer having been diagnosed between 1990 and 2009. Pills containing high-dose oestrogen increased breast cancer risk 2.7-fold, or 170 per cent, while those with moderate-dose oestrogen increased the risk 1.6-fold. Pills containing low-dose oestrogen did not increase breast cancer risk. Across recent use of all pills, breast cancer risk increased by 50 per cent, compared with never or former use. Dr Caroline Dalton, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Data from this study is welcome, in that it tells us more about the differences between high and low-dose options. ‘Levels of oestrogen in the combined pill have decreased over the past 30 years.’ Sarah Williams at Cancer Research UK said women should not stop taking the Pill on the basis of this study and discuss any concern with their GP or family planning service.","Women taking Pill have 50 per cent higher overall risk of  breast cancer .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It might be based on Native American culture... but not as we know it: A motel owner in California is offering accommodation in wigwams that will never blow over... as they're made from concrete. Frank Redford, originally from Kentucky, created his chain of Native American inspired motels in 1935, and they continue attract masses of people every year. The motel sits in San Bernadino, California, along the famous Route 66, and is one of only three out of the seven originals that still remain. Teepee or not teepee? The concrete wigwams are based on Native American culture... but with all mod cons . The winter of our discount tent: Motel owner Frank Redford first created his chain of native Indian inspired motels in 1935 . His innovative idea began when he built a teepee shaped building to display a collection of Native American historical items. He went on to create several more teepees, dubbed 'Wigwam village', especially for travellers to stay in. The motel proved to be a huge success and another six wigwam villages were built in the south and south western areas of America by the early 1950s. But only three of the 25ft tall wigwam motels remain, with other versions still going strong in Arizona and Kentucky. Too intense? The Californa site off Route 66 boasts a pool and BBQ area too . Frank said: 'The motel attracts all kinds of guests. We have all types of people from folks from southern California to out of state, and tourists from other countries.' The wigwams are painted in white with a classic red zig-zag border and surround the motel's main office and gift shop. Each wigwam boasts a private bathroom, wifi, TV, telephone and fridge while the main site includes a swimming pool and BBQ area. Prices at the quirky motel range from £40 to £58 a night.","The motel chain is 'Native American inspired' with huge decorated wigwams .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Scientists at Cardiff University have made a breakthrough in a study of the heart defect which almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba . Scientists have discovered the cause of a heart defect which almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba. The breakthrough in understanding Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could now pave the way for new drugs and a cure. The heart condition kills dozens of young people every year, because until now experts have been unable to pinpoint the cure. But heart specialists at Cardiff University found two vital proteins in heart cells are to blame for the previously inexplicable cause of death. A rare genetic mutation in some people causes the two proteins to 'not communicate' with each other. Professor Tony Lai, from Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: 'A healthy and regular heartbeat is maintained by precise control of the calcium level in heart muscle cells. 'But our experiments have identified a genetic flaw that invites chaos to this process.' His colleague Dr Michail Nomikos explained why the heart’s biological equilibrium becomes unstable. He said: 'When calcium levels rise the heart contracts - and when the calcium levels drop the heart muscle relaxes, similar to the upstroke and downstroke of a motor engine. 'The precise control of this movement relies on the direct physical interaction between a calcium channel protein ryanodine receptor and a calcium-sensing protein called calmodulin. 'We discovered that a genetic mutation in calmodulin causes a loss of regular heart rhythm and produces ineffective communication between the two proteins. He added: 'Abnormal changes in calcium levels disrupt the smooth cycling between cardiac contraction and relaxation that leads to irregular heartbeat and sudden death.' The Cardiff scientists say drugs could be developed to give doctors a new weapon in the fight against sudden cardiac death. Gabby Logan’s brother, Daniel Yorath, was 15 when he suddenly collapsed and died during a kick around with his father, former Wales and Bradford City manager Terry Yorath, at the family home in Leeds in 1992. Match of the Day presenter Gabby later launched the Daniel Yorath appeal in his memory. Fabrice . Muamba was playing for Bolton Wanderers in an FA Cup tie against . Tottenham in March 2012 when his heart stopped for 78 minutes. After his recovery he supported campaigns to prevent deaths from sudden cardiac arrests. Professor Jeremy Pearson, Associate . Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Keeping the . heart’s calcium levels under control is critical to maintaining a . healthy rhythm. The former Bolton Wanderer's star's heart stopped beating for 78 minutes after he collapsed suffering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the FA Cup quarter final against Tottenham in March 2012 . Presenter Gabby Logan, left, lost her brother Daniel Yorath to the condition when he was just 15 years old, in 1992. He was playing football with his father ex-footballer and Wales international Terry Yorath when he collapsed . 'By showing how calmodulin mutation could disrupt this and lead to sudden cardiac death, the Cardiff team have provided new clues for how to treat the condition in the future. 'Uncovering genetic links like this is vital to help combat the devastating effects of inherited heart conditions. 'We are urgently campaigning for more research to help find the undiscovered faulty genes putting people at greater risk of heart disease.' Dr Steve Cox, Deputy Chief Executive of Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY), said: 'Young sudden cardiac death is caused by many different conditions, not all of which are genetic. 'However, significant progress is being made in genetics and we hope this research will result in practices that can reduce the incidence of young sudden cardiac death. 'In 80 per cent of young sudden deaths there are no prior symptoms, which is why CRY campaigns for all young people to have the opportunity to be tested. 'Our screening programme currently tests around 15,000 young people every year - and one in every 300 people we test has a potentially life threatening condition identified. 'We will continue to lobby for greater access to free screening, especially for young people regularly involved in sport, even at a grass roots level.'","Specialists at Cardiff University find cause of hypertophic cardiomyopathy .

When our luggage disappears on the conveyor belt at check-in we don't expect it to be given the full VIP treatment, though we would likely expect that it not be tossed brazenly about on the tarmac. The latter is precisely what happened on at least one Ryanair flight this week, as captured on amateur video, with one suitcase even bouncing on the ground. The flight was leaving Italy's Bergamo Airport, outside Milan, when baggage handlers were recorded at work by a passenger on another plane, with the video posted on YouTube by user Nerijus Laurinaitis. Scroll down for video . Bagged: Baggage handlers for a Ryanair flight were captured on amateur video at Bergamo Airport . Bouncy bag: One suitcase is thrown so brazenly it bounces up and down on the Tarmac near Milan . One handler is throwing suitcases under the front of the plane, from one side to the other, with little regard it seems for the well-being of the bag.

"By . Beci Wood . The governor of Cuzco wants to open Machu Picchu for longer hours in a bid to attract an extra 5,000 tourists a day to the Inca site. Rene Concha Lezama has suggested keeping the ruins open until 8pm daily in a bid to double the number of people who can visit the hilltop site. The current opening hours are from 6am to 5pm and conservationists have already warned that the ruins are put under undue strain by the quantity of visitors, but Mr Lezama feels the extra three hours will help meet the huge demand from tourists. Spectacular: The Inca ruins are a popular destination for travellers wanting to tick the site off their bucket list . The ruins, which were named one of the New Seven Wonders Of The World in 2007, currently undergo maintenance every day in a bid to prevent long-term damage by visitors. But there are fears extra visitors could further damage the terraces, although it would also be a money-spinner for the nation. Currently there is a limit of 2,500 people allowed at the site daily, but the extra three hours could see that number soar to as many as 5,000. Regional director of tourism Luis Angel Aragón Carreño has led the call against extended opening hours. He said: 'We must protect Machu Picchu and not just see the site as a goldmine.' A total of 1.17 million tourists visited Machu Picchu in 2013, of which 804,000 were foreign visitors, and some have campaigned against the increasing number of tourists visiting the hilltop citadel. In 2012 the World Heritage Committee was advised to consider adding Machu Picchu to the list of world heritage sites in danger. The stone terraces: Maintenance is carried out to protect the site but there is concern extra visitors will cause more damage . A . report at the time said that the 2,500 visitor limit had been exceeded . on ‘numerous occasions’ and added that ‘the intention to increase the . number of visitors to the property would further exacerbate existing . problems.’ On the UNESCO World Heritage . website, a statement reads: 'Tourism itself represents a double-edged . sword by providing economic benefits but also by resulting in major . cultural and ecological impacts. 'The . strongly increasing number of visitors to the Historic Sanctuary of . Machu Picchu must be matched by an adequate management regulating . access, diversifying the offer and efforts to fully understand and . minimize impacts.' There are similar concerns over a new international airport close to the site in Cuzco which got the go ahead earlier this year.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The pretty hamlet of Bantham, which helped inspire Agatha Christie and is a favourite holiday spot for Sir Richard Branson, has just been sold for a bargain £11million. It comes with 728 acres of land, 21 homes, cobbled streets, a golf course, a boathouse and a shop which only opens on weekends. The entire lot has now been bought for £11.5million - the same price as a swish apartment in London's Mayfair, where modestly-sized flats can cost up to £20million. Scroll down for video . Snapped up for £11m: Bantham Beach in South Devon is part of a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and has won awards from the Marine Conservation Society as well has having the coveted Blue Flag . So pretty: The tiny village of Bantham has been snapped up by a mystery buyer despite the National Trust's efforts to raise enough money to buy it . The Boathouse: Bantham is picture-postcard pretty, with 21 homes, cobbled streets, a thatched boathouse and village shop . Aerial view:  The village which is a favourite holiday spot for Richard Branson sits by the mouth of the River Avon . Lieutenant Commander Charles Evans purchased Bantham in 1922 and since then it has remained one of the largest family-owned estates in Britain. But the Evans family decided to sell up earlier this year, prompting fears the seaside community could be snapped up by a foreign billionaire and turned into a resort. The National Trust was so worried about the pretty holiday spot being lost it launched a £7million fundraising campaign to buy just the beach and surrounding coastline. But it was outbid and an unidentified buyer has agreed a deal with estate agents Strutt and Parker to buy the whole of Bantham, although the exact price has not be revealed. Strutt and Parker partner James Baker said it is a family with plans to maintain and preserve the landscape the same way as the Evans have done for nearly 100 years. Idyllic: The pretty hamlet which helped inspire writer Agatha Christie has been snapped up by an unknown buyer . It may look windswept here but Bantham beach is described as one of the best beaches in South Devon . Bantham comes with its own village pub, the Sloop Inn, left and 'coffee shop'... with its own handy phone box . Questionmark: The sale of Bantham was controversial, with local tenants worried that the character of the village could change . An area of outstanding beauty: A view of the Avon estuary, on which Bantham sits . 'What we were very particular about was hand picking the right buyer and we believe we have found them,' said estate agent partner James Baker. 'There shouldn't be any concerns from anyone in the village. They will continue exactly the same as the Evans family have done.' Prompted by a death in the Evans family, the sale of Bantham was hugely controversial, with many local tenants worried that the character of the village would change forever. Strutt and Parker fielded calls from across the globe, fuelling rumours that a Saudi prince or a Russian oligarch would join the bidding. Sir Richard was rumoured to have interest, having holidayed there as a child. The National Trust emerged as a possible buyer after deciding to bid for just the beach and coastline for £7million. However it was not prepared to take on the rest of the hamlet because it didn't want to become a 'social landlord'. The National Trust currently owns, manages and cares for over 40 miles and 3,000 hectares of the South Devon coast and Bantham would have been its biggest outlay since it bought a chunk of the White Cliffs of Dover in 2012. The pretty thatched cottages in Bantham, left, are now owned by a mystery buyer, who may enjoy some of the local walks on offer, right. The National Trust, who lost their bid to buy the village say it hopes to work with the buyer to ensure none of the village's original character is lost . Stunning sunset: The Devon tourist board says Bantham beach is one of the best in the area which 'ticks all  the right the boxes for a typical English seaside holiday' But announcing that their bid had failed, Mark Harold, South West regional director, said: ""We have been informed by the agents acting on behalf of Evan's Estates that we have been unsuccessful in our bid to purchase Bantham Beach and Avon Estuary in South Devon. 'We are extremely disappointed at this decision. We, along with many thousands of people who have contacted us over the past few weeks encouraging our involvement in its future, care very passionately about Bantham. 'We believe this is a very special place, held dear in the hearts of many, not only locally, but also those who have fond memories of childhoods and family times spent there. 'We want, if possible, to work with any future owners of Bantham Beach and Estuary and ensure that this beautiful location is continued to be enjoyed by the many thousands of people who have told us how much it means to them. 'As a charity the Trust relies on the generous support of its supporters who help us care for some of the most beautiful and vulnerable stretches of coastal land in the country.'","Village of Bantham in South Devon has 21 homes, beach and golf course .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Technology to help aircraft detect volcanic ash is set to go into commercial production, with easyJet planning to be the first airline to use it. Effectively a weather radar for ash, the AVOID system has been supported by easyJet and should reduce the chances of a repeat of the Icelandic volcanic ash-cloud crisis of spring 2010. The crisis came following the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull and led to days of grounded flights across Europe in April and May 2010. Ahead of the pack: easyJet will be the first carrier to use new ash detecting technology . Created by Dr Fred Prata of Nicarnica Aviation, the system utilises infra-red technology fitted to aircraft to supply images to pilots and an airline's operations control centre. The images will enable pilots to see an ash cloud up to 60 miles ahead of the aircraft and at altitudes between 5,000ft and 50,000ft, thus allowing them to make small adjustments to the plane's flight path to avoid any ash cloud. The concept is very similar to weather radars which are standard on commercial airliners today. On the ground, information from aircraft with AVOID technology would be used to build an accurate image of the volcanic ash cloud using real-time data. This could open up large areas of airspace that would otherwise be closed during a volcanic eruption, which would benefit passengers by minimising disruption. Icelandic ash cloud: The eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volanco caused havoc for days across Europe . The technology was tested by European planemaker Airbus last November through a unique experiment which involved the creation of an artificial ash cloud. EasyJet's engineering director Ian Davies said the AVOID production deal, between Nicarnia and avionics supplier Elbit Systems, was 'a tangible and significant step forward in bringing this technology from conception into reality'. He went on: 'EasyJet has supported the development of this innovative technology since the 2010 volcanic eruption which brought aviation to a halt in Europe. We look forward to being the first airline to fit this technology on our aircraft.'","Luton-based airline is set to become the first to use new system .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A Scottish family were forced to evacuate their hotel on Spain's Costa del Sol just an hour after they had arrived, as a raging bush fire started tearing through the area. Paul and Valerie Clark, who were travelling with their three children, were just unpacking in their room when they were forced to flee the hotel as the blaze suddenly changed direction and approached their accommodation. When the family, from Dalgety Bay, Fife, arrived at the Club La Costa apartments, the mountains in the distance were ablaze. Holiday hell: Paul and Valerie Clark were with their three children, Caitlin, 16, Logan, 11, and eight-year-old Isla when they were forced to flee the Spanish holiday resort . But a sudden change in wind sent the fire surging towards their holiday complex they were staying in with their children Caitlin, 16, Logan, 11 and Isla, eight. The couple, who both work for HM Revenue and Customs in the capital, had to grab their belongings and flee. Paul, 46, a tax officer, said: 'By this time thick smoke had blacked out the sun and hot ash was raining down on everyone. 'It looked bad when one of the Spanish porters ran up to our balcony swore in English then ran off back to reception. Warning: The blaze started in the hills above the Andalucian coastline, but was blown down onto the resort by changing winds . 'He came back minutes later and told us it was time to go. 'Our youngest daughter Isla was crying at this stage, shouting, 'We're going to die' and started stuffing her clothes into carrier bags. 'I grabbed our passports and cash and changed out of my flip-flops into my trainers so I could run faster. 'Our eyes were streaming with tears and no-one knew what to do. 'It was scary stuff and all sorts of things are going through your head, but I just wanted to get everyone to safety.' He added: 'It was like Mount Vesuvius had erupted and we were in Pompeii.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Virgin Galactic has added a crucial step as it bids to launch tourists into space with the announcement of its hotel partner for prospective travellers. The company has selected Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces for its elite roster of passengers who will pay £120,000 per person to make the flights from Spaceport America. Virgin Galactic also announced a contract with World Class Gourmet of Las Cruces to provide catering for travelers during their training at Spaceport and said it is relocating more of its staff to New Mexico and will be hiring locally in the next few months. Impressive: The hotel will certainly put prospective space travellers into a relaxed state of mind . Chilled: The Azul Ultralounge outdoor patio where guests can sample a cocktail or two . The company is the anchor tenant in the $209 million futuristic Spaceport America that the state built for Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson to launch his flights from. But the project and Virgin have been plagued by delays. Originally, Branson had said he hoped to launch the flights by the end of 2010. The company is now hoping to begin operations by the end of this year, although its public relations agency said in a statement that the schedule 'will ultimately be dictated by safety and readiness — as has always been the case.' In the southern part of New Mexico, the grand Spanish Colonial style of the full-service Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces, overlooking the beautiful historic Mesilla Valley, creates an ambiance reflective of the area’s rich Spanish and Mexican Colonial history and tradition. Vibrant colors, rich fabrics and textures, and one-of-a-kind pieces from old Mexico give this hotel a sense of grandeur not found in contemporary brand hotels. The hotel features free WiFi internet, Gardunos of Mexico casual dining restaurant serving New Mexican cuisine and world-famous margaritas, Azul Lounge, an upscale club featuring musical entertainment and specialty cocktails, an updated state of the art fitness room, and brand new outdoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi, lush new outdoor gardens, gift shop, and business centre. The partnership with the hotel, however, addresses concerns about where celebrities and others who can afford the pricey flights will stay while they go through pre-space flight training. Early on in spaceport's development, there was talk of building an ultra-luxury hotel in the area. And about four years ago, when Branson announced he was creating a Virgin hotel brand, he told a hotel conference one of the first ones might be built near spaceport. But that never came to fruition. Spaceport America is about 60 miles from Las Cruces, near the town of Truth or Consequences, and about 182 miles from Albuquerque. But even the state's largest city lacks a five-star hotel. As part of its partnership with Spaceport, Hotel de Encanto will spend several million dollars on upgrades, which will include the creation of 'Executive Suite VIP Wings' with concierge service, private VIP areas, customized room service menus, and upgraded rooms and suites. The hotel is also working on other upgrades that should boost its AAA rating from three to four diamonds. New Mexico has no Five Diamond hotels, the top ranking. 'By partnering with Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces and World Class Gourmet, we further our vision of investing in the local New Mexico community while we define the Virgin Galactic astronaut experience,' said Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides. 'Future astronauts will come from around the world to New Mexico, so it's important that they experience the outstanding local offerings and character as part of their experience.'

"By . James Nye In Milford, Connecticut . The boyfriend of a 16-year-old girl who was stabbed to death at school by a fellow student is still reeling from her death, says the boy's father. Jarrod Butts, 16, was due to take Maren Sanchez to prom Friday night, but instead he attended a memorial for his girlfriend, holding her prom dress. Butts's father told MailOnline that his son has been 'hit hard' by Sanchez's death. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Victim: Maren Sanchez, pictured with her boyfriend Jarrod Butts, was stabbed to death on Friday morning . Speaking briefly on his doorstep Sunday, Mr Butts said his son was spending time with friends as they try to cope with the devastating loss together. Chris Plaskon, 16, is accused of stabbing to death Maren Sanchez in the hallway of Jonathan Law High School in Milford. Sanchez died of stab wounds to her torso and neck, according to an autopsy report released Sunday. The attack occurred Friday morning, hours before the school's junior prom, and authorities are investigating whether Sanchez was stabbed after turning down his invitation to the dance. On Saturday Jarrod Butts posted a touching photograph of Sanchez laughing on Twitter. He posted just three words, 'I miss you.' Police reportedly have Chris Plaskon, 16, in custody and friends have said that he knew Maren Sanchez since middle school . An emotional video uploaded to YouTube shows a sequence of photographs of Maren Sanchez set to music. 'My girlfriend,' reads the accompanying text. 'I will forever love and cherish her. R.I.P. 4/25/14.' Plaskon is a ‘cutter’ who had previously attempted suicide and has a history of depression, his classmates have told MailOnline. Chris Plaskon was been identified by parents and students as the teen arrested after Friday’s brutal attack on Maren Sanchez, the beloved junior prom queen. Friends say he battled ADHD and other mental issues that led to sometimes bizarre behavior in the classroom. 'He just wasn't right. I know his cousin. He didn't act right,' 16-year-old Seamus O’Reilly said Friday. 'He had depression.’ Plaskon allegedly attacked Sanchez, whom he dated a few years earlier in middle school, in the stairwell at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut, Friday morning – stabbing her in the throat and hacking her to death with a kitchen knife as she fought for her life. He is currently being held in a mental health ward, charged with murder as a juvenile but prosecutors have said they are considering filing adult charges against him. Tyler Curtin, 16, said he was very close to Plaskon when they played on the football team together as freshmen – though Plaskon’s behavior had changed recently and the two grew apart. Curtin said he believed Plaskon struggled with mental illness – including cutting himself. He always wore long sleeves to class. ‘He had ADHD and took strong medicine for it and had other things, too,’ Curtin said. Plans: Maren Sanchez, pictured in the dress she had planned to wear to prom, was excited about the dance which was due to attend with her new boyfriend . Detained: Chris Plaskon is being charged with murder as an adult over the stabbing of a girl at his school . Apartment: The alleged attacker lives in an apartment in this complex in Milford, Connecticut with his parents and three brothers . Last year, Plaskon tried to kill himself, but called a friend at the last moment. ‘He was dealing with a lot of things.’ He also began acting out – seeking attention from his classmates. For Halloween last year he wore a full bodysuit under his clothes and ripped his pants off in the middle of class, Curtin said. ‘He was always acting up and always looking for attention,’ he said. ‘Everybody thought it was funny at the time.’ Friends say that by all indications, Plaskon had a good home life. He lives in an apartment on Long Island Sound with his father – a contractor – his mother and three brothers. On Saturday, most of Sanchez’s classmates gathered in the gym at the high school – which administrators have turned into a makeshift crisis center. Grief counselors were on hand to speak with students and teachers – many of whom witnessed the attack or its aftermath first-hand. A steady stream of classmates and parents dropped off flowers and stuffed animals at a makeshift memorial in front of the school. Sanchez’s classmates painted a rock in the front lawn purple.

Connected: Tyler Curtin (left, in the white shirt), Jarrod Butts (crouching in a green shirt) and Chris Plaskon (right, showing a thumbs up sign) were all on the same football team freshman year but have since grown apart . Curtin said he saw Sanchez – a friend he had known since sixth grade – being wheeled out of the school on a stretcher and into a waiting ambulance. She was taken to a nearby hospital, but could not be revived. ‘Her neck was just covered in blood. It was everywhere,’ Curtin said. ‘It was really terrible. I can’t believe it. I still can’t believe what happened.’ Curtin said Plaskon and Sanchez's new boyfriend were acquaintances , but were not close. All three played together on the freshman football team – and were friends then. However, when Plaskon quit the team sophomore year, they stopped seeing each other. The portrait that is emerging of Plaskon’s alleged attack on Sanchez shows the violent intersection of high school romance and social pressure – combined with a teen who, classmates say, was becoming increasingly isolated at school. Plaskon dated Sanchez in middle school, but the pair broke it – nobody remembers why. They remained friends and Sanchez moved on. But Plaskon didn’t. Dealing with tragedy: Tyler Curtin said he was very close to Plaskon when they played on the football team together at freshmen, though Plaskon's behavior had changed recently and the two grew apart . History: Seamus O'Reilly, who is seen in front of the rock that was painted in honor of Maren, said that Plaskon was depressed and was trying to stand out and attract attention in school . Curtin said that he confessed he privately to his close friends that he still carried a flame for Sanchez. Sanchez was working hard to make something of herself. She was heavily involved in after-school activities. She was junior class president, she was in drama club, choir, a student manager of the swim team and the softball team. And she had a new boyfriend, a lacrosse and hockey star whom she had been dating for about a month and a half. When Plaskon asked her to junior prom, Sanchez politely declined, classmates say. The attack on Sanchez happened Friday morning as students prepared to go to class – and excitedly awaited junior prom. Sanchez herself had organized and planned the big dance and was chosen as prom queen. Heartbreaking: Maren's boyfriend Jarrod Butts holds up the dress that the teenager planned to wear to their junior prom as friends gathered in her honor on Friday at the beach . Different duty: Maren's junior prom date Jarrod Butts was seen bringing the dress she was so eager to wear to the beachside memorial service held Friday night (left) and he was wearing a matching vest (right) Emotional: Butts posted this message to his Twitter account on Friday . Classmates, even the ones who said . they once knew Plaskon well, said nothing in his behavior had ever . indicated he was capable of violence. ‘He was such a nice, sweet kid,’ Curtin said. O’Reilly . said he saw Plaskon Tuesday at the high school gym, doing squats. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary and he didn't mention Maren or prom. Prom, though, is a big deal at Law High. And it's a big deal if you don't have a date. 'It's just embarrassing if you don't have (a date),' O'Reilly said. Heartbreaking: Maren was fatally stabbed on Friday morning by a boy who reportedly asked her to prom . Too soon: Maren had been looking forward to . going to the junior prom with her hockey star boyfriend, and another . boy- who she reportedly knew since middle school- asked her and she said . no . Excited: Maren's drama teacher said that she had left rehearsals early on Thursday in order to get a manicure ahead of the big prom on Friday night . Plaskon's judicial fate is not yet decided, as his lawyer said that 'Connecticut law allows the authorities to try minors as adults for murder and other serious crimes'. 'They're devastated not only for him but they're devastated for Maren Sanchez's family as well. This is every parent's worst nightmare,' attorney Richard Meehan told The New York Times. The . small seaside community has be left reeling and hundreds of friends and . fellow students went to a memorial held in her honor Friday night. The students wore their dresses and tuxes to the beachside memorial for Maren instead, releasing purple balloons in tribute.","Maren Sanchez, 16, was stabbed in the neck at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut Friday morning after refusing a prom invitation .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is a part of a holiday that many people dread – the moment when they have to extricate themselves from the car-hire kiosk without signing away their lives (and their credit card details) to a raft of extra charges and financial add-ons. That, at least, is the picture that has emerged of British travellers’ attitudes to renting a vehicle while away on an exotic escape. According to a new survey, almost a third of tourists (31 per cent) feel pressurised during their transactions with car-hire companies, and feel that they are being deliberately scared into buying excess waiver insurance by unscrupulous representatives. Rip-off: Almost one-in-two holidaymakers think car-hire excess insurance polices are too high . And almost one in four people – 24 per cent – feel that they have been rail-roaded into purchasing costly additional policies at the car-hire desk. The research was conducted by YouGov on behalf of iCarhireinsurance.com. It uncovered widespread nervousness about excess insurance – the add-on policies that protect consumers against high charges if a car is lost, damaged or stolen. Far from reality: Many holidaymakers feel the car-hire experience does not match this dream image . The amount in question varies from transaction to transaction, but can easily be up to £1,500, depending on the make of vehicle. Excess sums can be stored on customers’ credit cards if they decide against taking out excess waiver policies – another cause of concern for holidaymakers. Figures . show that excess deposits in Europe have gone up by 22 per cent in the . last year – while the price of excess waivers has increased by some 26 . per cent. Almost half of those surveyed – 45 per cent – said that they think the cost of excess policies is ‘a rip-off’. Under pressure: Almost a third of British tourists feel they have been pressurised into buying car-hire extras . And almost two thirds – 62 per cent – said they were unaware that they could buy excess waiver policies from providers other than the hire company they are dealing with. ‘It’s a scandal that sky-high deposits are being used as a stick to beat with when people are trying to budget for a break,’ says Ernesto Suarez of iCarhireinsurance.com.","British holidaymakers feel 'scared' into taking out extra insurance policies .

"By . Helen Nicholson . Virgin . Atlantic has been forced to pay €60,000 (£47,600) compensation to a group of 101 air passengers who were delayed for over 26 hours on a flight from America to the UK. Sir Richard Branson's airline made the payout following last month’s Huzar ruling at the Court of Appeal, which stated that airlines cannot reject claims for . delays caused by technical defects. The holidaymakers were delayed when flight VS16 - travelling from Orlando, Florida to London Gatwick in . October 2012 - developed a fault. Grounded: Holidaymakers were delayed on a flight from Florida to London in 2012 after the aircraft's fire detector circuit developed a fault (stock image) Lengthy delay: The passengers said they were due to board their flight at 7.35pm on 27 October but had to wait until the next day to depart . The disgruntled passengers set up a Facebook page to publicise their ordeal, which was caused by a fault with the aircraft's fire detector circuit. They were due to board the aircraft at 6.40pm but had to wait until 9.20pm to take their seats. At 10.15pm the captain informed the passengers that the problem had still not been fixed and that they would have to disembark the aircraft. The holidaymakers were given a hotel room near the terminal for the night but claimed that they had to join a lengthy queue to check in and did not get their room keys until around 2am. They also said that they could not use the food vouchers they had been issued as there wasn’t enough food available at the hotel, or enough staff to serve them. Urgent repair work: Flight VS16 developed a fault with its fire detector circuit . The passengers were give a hotel room for the night but said they had to join a lengthy queue to check in . The group was picked up from the hotel the following day at 1.30pm and taken to the airport where they checked in at 2.30pm. They were eventually allowed to board the aircraft at 8.15pm and departed at 9.35pm, landing at Gatwick airport at 9.49am the next day, more than 26 hours later than scheduled. After contacting the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) the . group was told that they had a valid claim for compensation under EU . Regulation 261 but was later told that their flight did not in fact qualify for . this compensation. Long queues at the hotel meant that many holidaymakers didn't get their room key until 2am . The passengers then contacted specialist flight delay law firm Bott & Co in November 2013, who issued group proceedings. The case was initially delayed pending the outcome of the Huzar v Jet2.com case in which air passenger Ron Huzar, 58, took airline Jet2 to court to claim compensation for a delayed flight from Manchester to Malaga in 2011. Mr Huzar's flight was delayed by 27 hours because . of a wiring defect. Jet2 . had claimed that, under EU laws, this defect constituted 'extraordinary circumstances' that allows them . to deny claims. However, Court of Appeal judges ruled that such technical faults are 'inherent in the running of an . airline' and as such cannot be considered extraordinary. Virgin Atlantic paid €600 (£476) compensation to each passenger on the delayed VS16 flight following the ruling. Kevin Clarke, Aviation Lawyer at Bott & Co, said: ‘We are delighted to have been able to reach a settlement for these passengers. ‘Since winning the case for our client Mr Huzar, we have seen a general trend towards airlines settling claims that have been on hold for months. 'This is great news for consumers and we hope this signals the dawn of a new era of a much easier and smoother process for claiming flight delay compensation.’ A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic told MailOnline Travel: 'As a gesture of goodwill Virgin Atlantic has settled some existing court cases that were previously stayed pending the Court of Appeal decision in Huzar. 'Going forward, the lasting impact of the Huzar decision on new cases remains uncertain and we are continuing to monitor developments in this area closely.' Standing room only: The queue to check in to the hotel snaked out onto the driveway . Campaign: The disgruntled passengers set up a Facebook group to publicise their ordeal . The CAA said that passengers can ask airlines to review their compensation claims in the wake of the Court of Appeal ruling. Rules state that passengers who reach their destination more than three hours late can claim up to €600 (£476) plus expenses, per person, if the delay is within the airline's control. The case could open the door to hundreds of thousands of claims that had previously been turned down by airlines. However, Jet2 has already announced its intention to appeal again against the decision, this time by taking it to the Supreme Court, and the CAA has warned that airlines might delay processing claims until the outcome of that case. The CAA initially caused consternation among passenger representatives on Friday when they said that rejected claims could not be retrospectively reviewed in the wake of the Huzar case. However, after checking the law again, it changed its stance. A spokesman said: 'The CAA apologises that our earlier advice was not clear. We will contact passengers who have previously sought our help to provide advice on the matter. The CAA will also provide guidance on the judgment to airlines.'","Holidaymakers were delayed on flight VS16 in October 2012 .

"By . Travelmail Writer . There’s no need to worry about being caught short on this particular walking tour of London. The ‘London Loo Tour’ sees walkers shepherded round a selection of toilets in the capital being given the lowdown on the best places to go. Conceived by American guide Rachel Erickson, who was so frustrated by not being able to 'pee for free', the not so bog standard tour takes curious loo finders from all over the world and guides them around a variety of toilets and areas relating to sewerage history in the capital. The most patriotic loos ever? The Jubiloos not only have Union Jack toilet seats but attendants with Union Jack waistcoats too . Close your eyes and think of the Queen: The 'Jubaloos' success is probably down to the fact that they are so well-cared for . The tour starts at the toilets by platform 19 at WaterLOO Station (geddit?) and can accommodate up to 20 guests while Rachel also offers 'singles' and private tours. Each tour is packed with unusual and little-known facts like brief histories on how the Romans managed their toilet, and the plumber who founded one of London’s early sanitary engineering companies, Thomas Crapper and Co. Weaving through the streets, walkers visit such locations as the patriotic 'Juba-loos' on the South Bank. Built for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and designed by architect Mark Power, the toilet costs 50p to use and has full-time attendants who are hard to miss in their Union Jack waistcoats. It also makes use of rainwater to flush toilets and wash floors. Next the whislte-stop tour takes people to the day urinals for men in Charing Cross and pop-up urinals in Charing Cross. The magic circle: The 'Urilift' rises from the ground in the evenings to encourage men out on the town not to relieve themselves on the streets . You're in trouble now: The men only, pop-up 'Butterfly' urinals in Charing Cross are a stainless steel design - but not so private . Just around the corner outside Embankment Garden is the mysterious 'Urilift' – one of three urinals provided by Westminster that rise up from the ground in the evenings to offer an alternative option for late-night male revellers. The Urilift contributes to keeping 10,000 gallons of wee off the streets of Westminster, explains Erickson. Another, more permanent example of a street urinal is the Butterfly outside Charing Cross Station. Its slick stainless steel design aims to please, with a view to prevent men weeing on the street - albeit with minimal privacy. The guide has a wealth of stories about the history of public conveniences, for example the difficulties of providing public conveniences for women in the Victorian Era. Toilet humour required? Rachel Erickson gives tourists the lowdown on loos in her deadpan style . Pee on earth:  Waterloo is well-catered for when it comes to the smallest room: Platform 19 ladies toilets, left, are a favourite, while The Hole in the Wall community toilets at Waterloo, right. are for those in the know . Get to the bottom of it: The enthusiastic tour guide takes interested parties through the back streets of London, dispensing historical information about the loos of London . Loo within a loo: The Cellardoor cocktail bar in Aldwych used to be a mens toilet frequented by Oscar Wilde . Female toilets were highly controversial, indeed many people thought they were an ‘abomination’ and would be used by flower girls cleaning their watercress apparently. The most successful were the ones that were discreetly located underground. Toilets for gentlemen were far more common and the underground toilets at St. Paul’s, Covent Garden are included in the tour, as are the gentleman’s loos at the Royal Exchange - which even had a sonnet dedicated to them. Pull up a stool: London's only Sewer Gas Destructor Lamp was a gas lamp powered solely by sewerage gas . Toilet hero: The monument to Joseph Bazelgette, who designed the first sewerage system for London on Embankment . Also on the agenda is a stop at a lamp near to the Savoy hotel which was powered by gas from the sewerage system in Central London almost a century ago. The walk concludes at the end of the Strand at underground toilets regularly frequented by Oscar Wilde that have now been converted into a cocktail bar. Other pub stops include a Community Loo Scheme participant; Ye Olde London is one of 75 establishments paid £600 each year by the City of London to cater for people's basic needs. When you consider that the average person spends about an average of a year and a half on the toilet, perhaps you won't be so quick to pooh pooh the tour.","Tour shows people curious about loos around the toilets of London .

"By . Ruth Styles . From flying transport planes to preparing torpedoes, life for women on the Home Front during World War Two wasn't all about cooking with coupons and dealing with the effects of relentless German bombing raids. While many did join the ARP [Air Raid Precautions] and work on the land, others became an integral part of the armed forces as these incredible snapshots from the 1940's demonstrate. Others joined Britain's secret services, including those who worked on the world's first electronic programmable computer, Colossus, at Bletchley Park, where they also contributed to cracking the German Lorenz and enigma codes - one of British intelligence's greatest wartime triumphs. Brave: Women in the WRNS (Royal Navy) including this radio mechanic, flew test missions in planes such as the Fairley Barracuda dive bomber (behind) Essential: Trainee pilot Nancy Nesbit, pictured in her Army training plane at Avenger Field, later joined the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron . Jobs for the girls: Other naval roles available to women included working as transport drivers, although as this image shows, that included doing repairs . Deadly: WRNS based at the enormous British naval base at Portsmouth move a torpedo towards a loading bay used by one of the Navy's U-class submarines . Hard at work: Pauline Gower, an officer of the Air Transport Auxiliary's No 5 Ferry Pilots Pool, was based at Hatfield in Berkshire during the war years . Camaraderie: Pauline Gower (centre), pictured with fellow pilots of the Air Transport Auxiliary's No 5 Ferry Pilots Pool Women's Section in 1940 . But while the role of Britain's female code-breakers was shrouded in secrecy at the time, those who joined the Women's Royal Naval Service, or WRNS, were celebrated for their bravery. Among the jobs performed by women were ferrying munitions and men to Royal Navy ships at Portsmouth and Devonport [Plymouth], providing mechanical back-up and even testing planes and equipment, including the Fairey Barracuda - an early carrier-borne dive bomber used by British forces. Others took roles as armourers, loading torpedos and other munitions into Royal Navy submarines, as engineers and as ferry pilots in the RAF's Air Transport Auxiliary. Away from the armed forces, women became ATS [Auxiliary Territorial Service] spotters - an incredibly dangerous job that involved scanning the sky for hours on end in search of enemy planes - and even manned anti-aircraft guns such as the Bofors 40mm or Bofors Gun. But British women weren't the only ones to play their part in the Allied victory of 1945. The USA too had women's army and navy units, most notably the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service or WAVES programme. Leading the line: A WRNS officer examines her rifle while training to become an armourer at a Scottish Royal Airforce Base in 1940 . Trainee pilot: Phyliss Jarman, a recent recruit to the Women's Auxilary Ferrying Squadron, writes up a report during training at Avenger Field . Dangerous work: Auxiliary Territorial Service spotters scan the skies for any sign of hostile aircraft at a London anti-aircraft battery, equipped with a range finder . A pair of spotters using a Kine-Theodolite - an instrument which records the bursts of anti-aircraft shells - to check the accuracy of firing at an AA Battery at Manorbier . Duty: An ATS spotter scans the skies with binoculars at an anti-aircraft command post in December 1942 with a 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun in the background . Mum's army: A sergeant drilling civilian members of the Women's Home Defence Corps, in the use of rifles during the Battle of Britain in 1940 . Action stations: Members of the Army Catering Corps are put through their paces during a training course in the early years of the war .

Wood cutter: Cicely Clark of The Women's Timber Corps at work in a timber camp in Suffolk as part of the war effort in 1942 . Backbreaking: A group of Land Girls shovel sugarbeet in the Lincolnshire beet fields in October 1940 . Top secret: Women work on the Colossus computer at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, which was used to help crack the German Lazlo and enigma codes . Women in the WAVES really did face the same dangers as male colleagues as the haunting photo of five American WAC officers, including Colonel . Ruth Briggs, sitting with fellow survivors onboard a rescue destroyer after their transport ship was torpedoed off the North African coast in February 1943. Others joined the Women's Air Corps or WAC, and spent the war years working as Women Airforce Service pilots ferrying new planes and other supplies to American airforce bases all over the United States. Back in Europe, stars of the era such as German-born Marlene Dietrich did their bit by touring armed forces bases to help boost the morale of troops, while more prosaically, Land Girls spent the war years providing food for the British population as well as timber, coal and other essential supplies. Among them was Cicely Clark, who spent the war years working with the Women's Timber Corps in Suffolk. Others, such as the pair of Land Girls photographed carrying straw hats through the fields, did their duty by helping to grow beetroot in Lincolnshire. But whether pilot, Land Girl, timber cutter or munitions worker, what these photos make clear is that without the efforts of these brave British and American women, defeating Hitler could have taken far longer than it did.

"By . Associated Press . A California man who was charged after refusing treatment for his tuberculosis was found and arrested, a prosecutor said Tuesday. Eduardo Rosas Cruz, 25, was arrested late Monday in Kern County, San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Stephen Taylor said. Before Rosas Cruz can be sent back to San Joaquin County, he has to be medically cleared, which could take weeks, Taylor said. Authorities last week obtained an arrest warrant for Rosas Cruz, saying he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in March after going to San Joaquin General Hospital's emergency room with a severe cough. Rosas Cruz is a transient and comes from an area of Mexico known for a drug-resistant strain of TB, authorities said . Medical staff at the hospital told him to stay in a Stockton motel room, where a health worker would deliver his medication and watch him take it. But officials say he left. Rosas Cruz is a transient and comes from an area of Mexico known for a drug-resistant strain of TB, authorities said. He was arrested on the San Joaquin County warrant during a traffic stop in Lamont, a community about 15 miles southeast of Bakersfield, said Ray Pruitt, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Office. Officers took him to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. TB can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The disease can be deadly. Authorities said Rosas Cruz was diagnosed with tuberculosis in March after going to San Joaquin General Hospital's emergency room with a severe cough . Taylor said the goal of prosecuting a tuberculosis patient through the criminal courts is not to punish him, but to protect the public. He said Rosas Cruz refused to cooperate with officials. 'When somebody has behaved like this, it's time to go in-patient,' Taylor said. In court papers filed in support of the warrant, public health officials said Rosas Cruz resisted treatment from the start. He also used crack cocaine and methamphetamine, officials said, adding that he could develop the drug-resistant strain if he hasn't already. By law, health officials can't force a patient to be treated for tuberculosis, but officials can use the courts to isolate him from the public. That is when officials offer treatment.","Eduardo Rosas Cruz, 25, was arrested late Monday in California .

"By . Sarah Dean . An Australian jihadist who posed with decapitated heads on Twitter appears to now be giving advice on how to access deadly explosives in Sydney. Mohamed Elomar, who is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for his activities in the Middle East, has renewed his social media attack on his former home country on a new Twitter account after his previous one was shut down last week. The 30-year-old invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney - the city where he was born - to contact him if they want to get their hands on dynamite and grenades. 'Anyone in Sydney who is after explosives (dynamite sticks, C4 sticks, orica mine sticks, grenades ) lots more. If interested DM me,' he wrote. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . Elomar invited wannabe jihadists in Sydney to contact him if they want to get their hands on explosives. He also gave tips on the best way to avoid the security services. 'Buy a phone cover ur idenity if you have to wear a Niqab, activate simcard with false details, when u use phone make sure in different area,' he wrote. 'That way it's hard for ASIO to track u down, remember ""The hearts of freemen are tombs of secrets"" and moslem secreacy is faithfulness.' Elomar and his friend Khaled Sharrouf, also from Sydney, are thought to be fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia. Mohamed Elomar gave tips on the best way to avoid the security services . He reportedly set up the Twitter account after his previous one was shut down . The 30-year-old advised 'brothers who are confused about jihad' to get in touch . Before Elomar's previous Twitter account was shut down last week, he wrote that Australia should be worried about what is coming to it. He also sent tweets aimed directly at ASIO last Tuesday, claiming he had been injured but would soon be fighting again. Offering up his advice to 'brothers who are confused about Jihad in the West' he said 'please DM I would love to have a chat'. The account that is purporting to belong to Elomar also claimed he had 'just divorced his wife'. Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 after she was arrested by joint counter-terrorism detectives at Sydney Airport on May 3 while trying to board a flight to Malaysia. She was alleged to be carrying cash and camouflage gear on behalf of Elomar. Mohamed Elomar (pictured) is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria . The tweets claim he has divorced his wife Fatima, 29, because she kept 'insisting' on it . Fatima Elomar appeared in court with their four children after appearing on terrorism related charges . Elomar said he will see his children on the 'day of judgement' She was later charged with supporting terrorism, specifically 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'. The pair have four children together. 'To my 4 beautiful kids inshallah I will see them on day of judgment, this is islam allah swt will test us and test us,' Elomar wrote on Sunday. Despite jihadists Elomar and Sharrouf using Twitter to threaten ASIO and Australia, transparency reports from Twitter show the Australian government only requested for information to be removed or withheld on Twitter two times in the first part of this year. The government have also not requested anything to be taken down from Twitter this year. Twitter said specific requests for the contents of communications, for example what has been sent in direct messages, require a valid search warrant from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Twitter. Elomar's jihadist friend Sharrouf previously spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne. He is thought to have flown to Syria with Elomar late last year on his brother Mustafa's passport. Sharrouf has also taunted Australian police via his social media account recently, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. Mohomed Elomar (right) used to be a champion boxer. Here he is seen fighting Pises Buachai at the Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Wednesday, March 7, 2007. Elomar won the fight. Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account . Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle . Elomar is also the brother of Ahmed Elomar, who was arrested in Lebanon for alleged terrorist links in 2007 and then sentenced to jail in Sydney in June for brutally bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park riots. The two brothers, Ahmed and Mohamed, used to be champion boxers, Ahmed has competed in more than 20 professional bouts. In 2007, their father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney. Mr Elomar told The Sun-Herald that he urged his children to stay away from Sheik Mohammed at the Global Islamic Youth Centre. 'Sheiks like Feiz ruin people,' Mr Elomar said. 'He is not a sheik; he is brainwashing all these children. I know my religion, so I can tell him when he is wrong, but these kids believe everything he says and think it's their religion. Someone needs to stop him. 'Today our kids are either at one extreme, partying or using drugs, or at another extreme with their religion. I don't teach my children to hate non-Muslims. I have taught them to love everyone.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mohamed Elomar appears to have set up a new Twitter account .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Bernie Ecclestone has said the Russian Grand Prix will go ahead despite gathering opposition to the race after the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. Ecclestone is a personal friend of Vladimir Putin and said he will ‘100 per cent’ honour his contract to stage a race in Sochi on October 12 in the face of disquiet among teams, sponsors and politicians. The situation within the sport is particularly delicate because Malaysian energy company Petronas, title sponsors of Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team, have established a £1.8million fund for the families of the 298 victims of the disaster. Firm stance: Bernie Ecclestone, pictured alongside Vladimir Putin, has had his say on the Russia Grand Prix . Senior team figures privately told Sportsmail that they are uneasy about going to a race linked so closely with Putin, who is suspected of supplying pro-Russian militants with the surface-to-air missiles that shot down the plane. Conservative MP David Davis, a former foreign minister, said: ‘Whilst I’m not particularly in favour of cancelling sports events at the drop of a hat, here you’ve had the murder of 298 citizens. It can’t conceivably be defended as a reasonable act of war, and therefore I think that Formula One should reflect that.’ Menzies Campbell, the Lib Dems’ former foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘There will have to be an assessment of the suitability of this race nearer the time to decide whether it should be held. 'Public opinion all over the world will find it difficult to accept Mr Putin taking all the plaudits for this grand prix in Russia.’ Ecclestone, however, is insistent that the race should go ahead, having signed up the Russians on a five-year deal worth an estimated £120million. Putin personally invited Ecclestone, a friend since the idea of a race in St Petersburg was mooted a decade ago, to the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics in February. Ecclestone said: ‘I don’t see any problem with going. We are not involved in politics. We have a contract with them. We’ll respect it 100 per cent and so will Mr Putin, I’m sure. He’s been very supportive.’ The FIA, the sport’s governing body, are keen not to get dragged into the dispute, citing their charter to be non-political. A spokesman said that while they were ‘awake to the situation’ they did not ‘want to mix politics and sport’.

"By . Stuart Broad . What a difference a week makes. After the defeat at Lord’s it felt like the entire country was against us but the reception we — and Alastair Cook in particular — got at Southampton last week made us realise just how much goodwill there is for us. I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard a reception like the one Cooky got just for scoring 48 not out at lunch. He’s had some personal stick from a couple of people recently but to get that kind of support from the crowd was such a great boost for him and the entire team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook praises England . Delighted: England bowler Broad celebrates after having India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara caught out . All smiles: Broad, right, celebrates with his England team-mates after running out Murali Vijay during the Test . Aggressive: Broad told himself before the match that he would take the game to India with his bowling . VIDEO Cook praises England . I was far happier with my own performance in a team display that reminded me of when we were at our dominant best against India three years ago. To win every session of the match is unusual and it was satisfying to respond to the loss at Lord’s in such a positive fashion. I was determined to be aggressive and express myself and put all my knee issues to one side. It’s like when you tell a kid not to spill a drink when they walk into a room — all they will think about is spilling the drink! At Lord’s I fell into the trap of thinking ‘my knee is sore’. I think it worked because the knee felt as good as it has all year. See you later! Bhuvneshwar Kumar is dismissed by Broad during day three at Ageas Bowl in Southampton . Teamwork: Moeen Ali holds up the match ball as he celebrates taking his fifth wicket during the third Test . At Lord’s I was having hot baths in the middle of the night just to get some warmth through it but I can honestly say that I’m more confident about getting through all five Tests than I have been at any point this summer. Having Cooky back in form is a massive boost. None of us had any doubt he would come through because he’s a world-class player and that’s what they do. Let’s hope he can score a couple of hundreds to set up a series win. Moeen Ali gets better with every match and is now a really strong option with the ball. I’ve known him for a number of years and he’s great to have in the dressing room. In Test cricket you’ve got to learn on the job because it is so much more intense than county cricket. Moeen’s really doing that and that is a great testament to him. A word on Jos Buttler, too. What a terrific debut! Early days but very promising.","Bowler said reception in Southampton showed people still support England .

"By . David Kent . Formula One may be a step closer to staging a Grand Prix on the streets of London after Prime Minister David Cameron announced new plans to hold motor races on public roads. A race on the streets of the capital has been mooted for a number of years with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone keen to bring a Monaco-style race to the capital. And today's new regulation, which gives local authorities the power to sign off on major motor races on public roads for the first time, rather than needing specific approval from Parliament., has once more raised the possibility of a London Grand Prix. Centre of attention: Prime Minister David Cameron addresses the crowd at Williams' Grove base on Friday . 'I can announce today that we are going to enable more road races for GB motor sport,' Prime Minister David Cameron said as he official opened Williams' new £8million advanced engineering facility at the team's Formula One headquarters in Grove. 'We think this will be really useful to British motor sport: more races, more events, more money coming into the country and more success for this extraordinary industry.' Next year will see the new FIA Formula E championship race through Battersea Park and London Mayor Boris Johnson is hopeful of bringing F1 to the city, too. Back to the future: Santander proposed a night race on the streets of London back in 2012 . A spokeswoman for Mr Johnson said: 'The Mayor is already backing the FIA Formula E championship race in Battersea Park next year and thinks Formula One itself is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host - he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth. 'He is positive that London would do a spectacular job of hosting an F1 Grand Prix; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully.' But Ecclestone, 83, has warned that a London Grand Prix remains a long shot. For Ecclestone, whose dream has long been to see F1 careering around London's landmarks, it means one strip of red tape has been removed, with the likelihood legislation will be in force next year. How it could look: Nigel Mansell takes a Jordan for a spin through the streets of London back in 2004 . On track: A Ferrari sails through Regent Street on a demonstration run 10 years ago . But the 83-year-old, however, appreciates finding the money for such an event remains one of the many other hurdles that would need to be overcome as the costs would be significant. 'In the past we spoke to the old mayor and all sorts of people,' said Ecclestone. 'It just depends on what we can come up with commercially because how are we going to fund it? 'The news is good, but I don't know whether you'd have street racing because it's not cheap to put on something that's safe. Street racing is expensive. 'But if they ever get it together then we'll see what happens. At least it's a good sign, a step in the right direction.'","Local authorities will be given power to sign off on major motor races .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Nazi soldiers formed a secret army and plotted to attack the Allies who occupied Germany after the end of the Second World War, according to recently unearthed documents. A group of 2,000 soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht, including senior SS officers, formed the covert group with the aim of restoring 'honour' to their homeland, which had been split into two states and ravaged by fighting. The group spied on left-wing politicians, stockpiled weapons and planned to recruit 40,000 of its own soldiers to attack opposing forces, including the Soviets occupying East Germany, and the newly-formed republic in West Germany. Secret: Albert Schnez, (left) who later commanded the official German army, led the secret force. Otto Skorzeny, (right), a decorated SS officer, was also involved . Details of the organisation were revealed in files from Germany's intelligence agency, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). According to the documents, former Nazi officers Albert Schnez led the organisation. He went on to command the Bundeswehr, the modern-day German army. Otto Skorzeny, the decorated Waffen SS officer who Mussolini the Italian dictator in a daring glider raid on the mountaintop where he was held prisoner by anti-fascists, was also involved in the plans . Plans made by Schnez spelled out how his 40,000 troops would first fight the Russians in East Germany before turning to attack the west of the country. Shattered: The secret force was formed to restore 'honour' to Germany after the devastation of the Second World War. Pictured is Dresden in 1946 . Attacks: The covert army planned first to attack to Russians occupying badly-damaged East Germany . Defeated soldiers: The secret force was made up of former Wehrmacht and SS fighters. German soldiers are pictured here surrendering at Aachen . Informed: Germany Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was told about the secret group, and ordered intelligence services to monitor them . Plans were drawn up to seize weapons from riot police armories. The group also seemed to have a fixation on tracking down what it termed 'Vaterlandsverrärter' - traitors to the Fatherland. The ex-Nazi officers believed that a civil war could break out at any time in Germany. According to the newly-discovered file, Germany's then-leader, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, was told about the secret army in 1951. He told his spies to carry out 'assistance and monitoring' of the group, but did not move to shut it down.","Around 2,000 soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht formed the covert group .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Four Chinese fishermen who were searching for crabs in a river have accidentally discovered what is believed to be a WWII bomber. The men were trauling through the Yangtze River in Zhanghu County, Anqing, eastern China's Anhui Province, when they came across the wreckage. It took two days to salvage the plane which is thought to be a B-25 bomber from the 'Flying Tigers' squadron, a special unit of US pilots tasked with training Chinese forces in air combat. Fisherman discovered the wreckage which in a river in Anhui Province, China while looking for crab . A US scholar has suggested the bomber could belong to the 'Flying Tigers' squadron which protected China from Japanese forces during the war . The plane's undercarriage, engine and fuselage were recovered from the river, still bearing a North American Aviation engraving. The aircraft's plate is inscribed with a serial number and date of manufacture, indicating it was built in February 1943. However, this would suggest the bomber was in fact not part of the squadron which ceased operations in China in 1942, a year earlier. It is possible the plane belonged to the Chinese American Composite Wing which flew operations throughout the country until the end of the war. Also known as the first American Volunteer Group of Chinese Forces, the 'Flying Tigers' were made up by members of the United States Army, Navy and Marine Corps. The aircraft still bears a 'North American Aviation' inscription as well as a date of manufacture of 1943 . The B-25 bomber is one of the most distinctive among all individual fighter aircraft . The group consisted of three fighter squadron which each contained around 20 aircraft. Having trained in Burma before American entry into the Second World War, it was the squadrons' duty to protect Chinese forces from Japanese attack. Their bombers are among some of the most recognisable of any individual combat aircraft, with distinctive shark-faced noses.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Archaeologists have found a meteorite fragment in a shaman's hut dating back 9,000 years that seems to have been worshipped as a magical object. The talisman was found alongside other objects that were considered sacred at the time including an amulet and a stick made of antler. It's thought it gained this status because the prehistoric stone age humans saw it fall from space, suggesting they may have known it came from another world. A meteorite fragment from 9,000 years ago has been found by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology (IAE) in Szczecin, Poland. It's believed humans at the time were aware that it was from out of this world and worshipped it as a magical object . Stonehenge attracts around one million visitors each year, but now archaeologists at the University of Buckingham have revealed that it was ‘the London of the Mesolithic’ - and even had an ancient ‘visitor’s centre’. Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area’s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an ‘A-Road’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at Blick Mead where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built, one archaeologist has claimed. It is now thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats. Carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at Vespsian’s Camp, Blick Mead - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that Amesbury is the oldest settlement in Britain and has been continually occupied since 8,820BC. Archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that Stonehenge was built as part of an established settlement, rather than a monument in an empty landscape. Archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology in Szczecin, in north west Poland, found the meteorite fragment inside the caveman house by lake Swidwe in Western Pomerania during excavations. The object was a natural pyrite meteorite fragment, pyrite being an iron sulfide mineral often referred to as fool's gold owing to its yellowish appearance. This meteorite, which measured eight by 5.3 by 3.5 centimetres (3.1 x 2.1 x 1.4 inches) has a cylindrical shape and was porous, with a corrugated surface on its side. Of most interest, though, was that the rock appears to have been worshipped by humans at the time, and they were perhaps even aware that it did not originate on Earth. 'The meteorite was brought to the shelter as a special object, they seem to have recognised it was not of this world,' said head of research for the Institute, Tadeusz Galinski. 'The thing became an object of belief, and maybe even shamanic magic. 'They may have realised it was different if it was spotted as it fell to earth, and would have been identified by the crater it made, and the heat it would have had from entering the earth's atmosphere. 'In addition, the side profile shape suggests various associations; the original finder millennia ago probably saw in it shapes of a mysterious world of spirits.' The find was made inside a caveman house by lake Swidwe in Bolków, Western Pomerania during excavations. The object was a natural pyrite meteorite fragment, pyrite being a yellowish iron sulfide mineral often referred to as fool's gold owing to its yellowish appearance . He added that the fragment is 'surprisingly heavy' and that the discovery was the first of its kind in archaeology where a primitive people was known to have worshipped a heavenly object. Along with the meteorite, the researchers also found other objects associated with magic, including an amulet, bone spear tip with engraved ornament and a magic stick made of antler, decorated with geometric motifs. The meteorite was discovered last year but it is only now that the researchers have been able to determine what it was used for. Along with the meteorite the researchers also found other objects associated with magic including an amulet, bone spear tip with engraved ornament and a magic stick made of antler, decorated with geometric motifs.

Mike, a personal trainer from Michigan, was self-conscious about his receding hairline at the age of 23 and visited a Beverly Hills surgeon, but the procedure left an 11-inch scar, he revealed on Sunday's episode of E!'s Botched. To correct the scar, Mike visited Dr Paul Nassif and Dr Terry Dubrow for a consultation. Scroll down for video . Botched: Mike was left with an 11-inch scar on the back of his head after a hair transplant gone wrong . The doctors said that the skin was tight around the scar area, but they could put a breast implant in the back of his head and fill it with saline over the course of a week to help stretch the skin, giving them more tissue to work with. Fortunately, Mike was able to see the humor in the situation. 'There’s always a small chance that something could go wrong and you could die. That’s part of any surgery,' he said.

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . No wonder Sally Bercow looks so pleased with herself. She and her pal Farah Sassoon are enjoying the best seats in the house for the State Opening of Parliament. Tickets for the glittering ceremony are highly sought after but the Speaker’s wife and wealthy businesswoman Mrs Sassoon were sitting in a prime spot in the House of Lords gallery. Best view: Sally Bercow (left) and Farah Sassoon watch the State Opening of Parliament from the Lords gallery . Last night John Bercow was accused of bringing his office of Commons Speaker into disrepute after it emerged Mrs Sassoon was given the ticket just days before she donated thousands of pounds to his re-election campaign. The Queen set out the Government’s agenda at the occasion on June 4. Three days later, Mrs Sassoon’s conference and booking firm handed £5,000 to Mr Bercow. The Speaker already faces questions on why Mrs Sassoon was granted a pass giving her access to the parliamentary estate. Yesterday Mr Bercow was warned that the donation would be seen as a reminder of previous ‘cash for access’ and sleaze scandals. Accused: Last night, Speaker John Bercow was accused of bringing his office into disrepute after it emerged Mrs Sassoon was given a ticket to the ceremony just days before she donated £5,000 to his campaign . Drinking pals: Mrs Sassoon came to public attention last year when she was pictured draping her leg across Mrs Bercow's lap in a cab (above) while on a night out. She is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns . Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This raises further questions about the Speaker, but in particular his wife’s relationship with Farah Sassoon. ‘For her to be given such a lofty place at the State Opening of Parliament, mere days before she donates thousands to the Speaker’s re-election campaign, raises the spectre of past Parliamentary scandals.’ During the State Opening, Mrs Sassoon and Mrs Bercow watched as Mr Bercow paraded into the chamber with MPs before the Queen spoke. An onlooker said: ‘Sally and Farah appeared to be enjoying themselves. They were chatting away and having a joke before the ceremony started.’ Earlier this week, it emerged that Mrs Sassoon had been granted a pass giving her access to the parliamentary estate two years before she made the donation, which Mr Bercow has declared in the Register of Members’ Interests. The pass allows her to bypass airport-style security checks at the Houses of Parliament. Mr Wilson wrote to Mr Bercow to ask him why it had been granted and raised the prospect of writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the issue. Mr Bercow said that the pass allowed Mrs Sassoon access to his grace-and-favour apartment overlooking the Thames. He stated: ‘My family is entitled to apply for security clearance for those who visit us regularly. A close personal friend of my wife holds such a pass. ‘The security pass in question does not permit that person to access the wider Parliamentary Estate unless escorted by a full pass holder.’ Mrs Sassoon came to public attention last year when she was pictured draping her leg across Mrs Bercow’s lap in a cab while on a night out after an awards ceremony. She is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns. She has given more than £40,000 to Labour. She is listed as director of Trust Reservations, a conference and hotel booking agency, which made the donation to Mr Bercow. Couple: Mr Bercow and his wife Sally attend the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in April 2011 . One of its contracts is said to be arranging hotels for Labour delegates at party conferences. Last night a spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Farah Sassoon is a good friend of Sally Bercow. Ms Sassoon has accompanied Mrs Bercow to hear the Queen’s Speech from the West Gallery, in the House of Lords, on the previous two occasions.’ Mrs Sassoon has made clear that she does not wish to speak to the Press.","Sally Bercow and Farah Sassoon pictured at State Opening of Parliament .

"By . Sam Peters . Kevin Pietersen hit 29 from 27 balls, but was upstaged by big-hitting Jason Roy as Surrey beat Worcestershire by three-wicket in the NatWest t20 Blast quarter-final at the Kia Oval. Roy’s stunning 52 from 23 balls, including three sixes and eight fours, took his run tally to 619 from 14 innings in this summer’s Twenty20 competition at an average of 47.61 and helped Surrey overhaul Worcestershire’s modest 141 for nine with 3.3 overs to spare. There was a little bit of a wobble after Roy’s exit, with Worcestershire fighting hard in the field to take seven Surrey wickets on a slowish pitch, but Robin Peterson finished matters in the 17th over by swinging Shaaiq Choudhry’s left-arm spin for six and then driving the next ball through mid-off for four. Star performer: Jason Roy hit 52 from just 23 balls during Surrey's convincing t20 Blast win . Mitch McClenaghan’s first two overs went for 33 runs as he bore the brunt of Roy’s strokemaking. When Roy was out, mis-hitting Shantry to mid-on from the fourth ball of the sixth over, it was left to Pietersen and the rest of Surrey’s international-packed middle order to complete the job. Pietersen hit five fours, but he then pulled Joe Leach to mid-on at the start of the 12th over and Surrey made rather heavy weather of the remaining chase. Next best: Kevin Pietersen was also in good form for the winning side, scoring 29 off 27 balls . Watch the ball run: Pietersen keeps an eye on the ball after flicking a shot towards the boundary . In the end, Peterson — who finished on 24 not out from 12 balls, with a six and three fours — saw them home in the company of Gareth Batty. Having been put into bat, Worcestershire suffered from losing wickets at regular intervals, with Jade Dernbach, Matthew Dunn and Peterson claiming two wickets apiece. The visitors were reduced to 97 for six when opener Richard Oliver was dismissed by Peterson for a 36-ball 34 — Worcestershire’s top score — and never recovered.","Former England international hit 29 from 27 balls but Roy struck three sixes and eight fours to steal the limelight from his Surrey team-mate .

Massa has made no secret of the fact he felt Magnussen was totally in the wrong for their first-corner shunt in last Sunday's German Grand Prix that resulted in him being flipped upside down in his Williams. The Brazilian accused the McLaren rookie of being 'too aggressive' and taking the wrong line, whilst chastising young drivers in general for causing too many accidents. Snubbed: Felipe Massa was hoping to hold clear the air talks with Kevin Magnussen . Snubber: But Magnussen felt thaat there was no need to do so . That is despite the fact it was Massa who had to answer to the stewards for 'causing a collision', with the 33-year-old cleared. Not even a few days of reflection, though, altered Massa's view as he reiterated his remarks of a few days ago on Thursday ahead of this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix. Massa did at least state he would be more than happy to chat over the situation with Magnussen, although the 21-year-old Dane is far from keen. Asked whether it was worth talking to Massa, Magnussen replied: 'No, it's done. We are here in Hungary and not in Germany any more. 'It happened and it's good no-one got hurt, especially him because he was on his roof and it looked bad. The most important thing is he's all right.

'What I did was get a great launch, got on the inside of Valtteri Bottas (Massa's team-mate), but not quite enough to have him in the corner,' added Magnussen. 'Obviously I had to back out of that and then it (the accident) happened. I'm not sure I would have done anything different.

Valcke, whose son performed the same role in Cape Town in 2010 said: ‘He accepted the position without consulting me and I did not intervene in his choice.’ Yet another obstacle for David Beckham in his problematic ambition to build a stadium for his MLS franchise on the Miami waterfront is the contract that the neighbouring Miami Heat basketball team have for their county-owned arena  — with a new five-year extension lease until 2035  agreed this week.

"By . Michael Wade . Follow @@MichaelWade_ . Arsene Wenger joked on Thursday that he hoped Thierry Henry would play a half for Arsenal against New York Red Bulls after travelling to America with just one recognised striker in his squad. Arsenal went down 1-0 to the MLS side in the early hours of Sunday morning with Wenger opting to start with Tomas Rosicky in an advanced attacking role, while Chuba Akpom, the only out and out forward in the party, came on at the break. Although it is still early days in terms of Arsenal's pre-season, with many senior stars still absent due to their participation in the later stages of the World Cup, Wenger has still not resolved the issue that dogged his side for much of last season: their lack of reliable experienced cover for Olivier Giroud. Step up: Mesut Ozil could be among the players to benefit from a false nine role at Arsenal next season . Know how: Alexis Sanchez will have experienced playing without an attacker at Barcelona . Experience: Theo Walcott has played as a central attacker for Arsenal before and performed well . Embarrassment of riches: Arsene Wenger must find a way to solve Arsenal's lack of strikers . The Gunners will contest the Emirates Cup on August 2 and 3 before the real business begins in the Community Shield against Manchester City on August 10 and then in the Premier League a week later meaning Wenger must already be giving serious consideration to formations which will allow him to get the maximum out of his exciting squad next season. In stark contrast to his striking options Wenger boasts an embarrassment of riches in attacking midfield, where he can call upon Rosicky, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott among others. Ozil will return buoyed by Germany's success at the World Cup and eager to silence critics who have claimed he failed to fully justify his price tag during his first season in England. Sanchez, another big-money signing, will arrive keen to make an instant impact after being deemed surplus to requirements at Barcelona, while Walcott's return from injury, expected early-to-mid-September, will see the England international faced with real competition for his place in the team. A good fit: Incorporating a false nine would suit the games of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski . Unfamiliar: Midfielder Tomas Rosicky led the Arsenal attack against New York Red Bulls . In a squad which also includes Santi Cazorla, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Serge Gnabry and Lukas Podolski, Wenger could have to think hard about how to get the best of the talent at his disposal while keeping everyone happy. The need for more depth up front is crucial if Arsenal are to mount a proper challenge for the Premier League title. Giroud shouldered the responsibility well last season, scoring 16 league goals, but that burden must be shared if Wenger's side's challenge are not going to fall away at a crucial stage of the season again. A serious option for Arsenal is to employ a false nine, an interchangeable forward threat that would allow Wenger to really maximise the players in his team. Winner: Germany's lack of traditional strikers didn't stop Joachim Low leading them to win the World Cup . Strikerless system: Ozil was part of Germany's free-scoring side which thrashed Brazil 7-1 and Portugal 4-0 . VIDEO German trio to miss start of season - Wenger . Employed with great success by Spain and Barcelona in recent years, and given a revamp by Germany at the World Cup, the role requires its candidate to be comfortable in the attacking third, dragging defenders out of position and bringing team-mates into play - a system Arsenal players are already well versed in. Joachim Low, like Wenger, is a manager blessed with countless attacking options but not many out and out strikers in the traditional sense. The Germany coach used this to great effect in Brazil as his side won the World Cup with Ozil in the team, thrashing Portugal 4-0 and Brazil 7-1 along the way, showing that a shortage of strikers doesn't have to be a shortcoming. Given the players currently available to Wenger this system could bring the best out of Ozil, Sanchez and Walcott and really give them the platform to thrive like it did for Germany's new generation of stars. And unlike in the striking department, Wenger would be able to factor in injuries and squad rotation without the standard dropping off. Although it is not clear if Wenger intends to continue his experimentation with this system when he integrates Ozil and Sanchez back into his squad in the next fortnight, it is obvious that he needs to find a proper Plan B to ensure the raw talent of Yaya Sanogo isn't the only back-up to Giroud. The answer will come when Ozil, Sanchez and Walcott are fully fit and vying for a spot in the team. Then he will have another attacking headache on his hands, although this time a considerably more comfortable one. Solo: Olivier Giroud shouldered the responsibility for much of Arsenal's goalscoring threat last season .","Olivier Giroud is currently the only senior striker in the Arsenal squad .

"By . Ashley Clements . Follow @@Ashley_Clements . When Didier Drogba swept his penalty kick past Manuel Neuer to win the Champions League for Chelsea in 2012, Blues fans were sure it would be his last kick of a ball for the west London club. Now, just two years later, the Ivorian striker looks set for a return to Stamford Bridge and the place he called home for eight years. As a free agent, club legend and inspiring figure, signing Drogba for a final fling seems to tick all the right boxes for Jose Mourinho, but will the veteran actually get a look in this season? And has he still got what it takes to rip through Premier League defences? VIDEO Scroll down for Drogba weighs up Chelsea return . Back for good? Didier Drogba looks set for a return to Stamford Bridge . History: The Chelsea legend won the Champions League with the club in 2012 . The 36-year-old is far from a spent force, but there's no doubt that he won't be able to bully defenders and grab headlines in quite the same way as during Mourinho's previous spell in charge. Drogba may have looked like his younger self during games against weaker opposition while playing for Galatasaray last season, but his poor performances against Chelsea in the Champions League prove that he may no longer be able to affect the big games. By coming back to west London, Drogba does run the risk of tarnishing one of football's greatest fairy-tales in almost single-handedly inspiring a team to their first ever Champions League, but even at 36, surely Chelsea fans would look to Drogba rather than their forlorn striker Fernando Torres should the pair warm the bench together. Last season's star of La Liga, Diego Costa, will be the man trying to fill the void left by Drogba in 2012 and the former Atletico Madrid man will be Chelsea's main striker with a £32million price-tag and string of failed Chelsea strikers looming in his subconscious. Hero: Chelsea fans displayed this banner upon Drogba's first return to Stamford Bridge . Blue: The Ivorian seemed to be overwhelmed with emotion as Galatasaray lost to Chelsea . If there's one team that will be hoping Didier Drogba doesn't return to Chelsea, it will be Arsenal. The Ivorian powerhouse scored 13 goals in 14 games against the Gunners during his eight year spell in the Premier League. Drogba's role for the new Premier League season, should he finalise the move to Chelsea, would be one of support, personality and power. You can see it now, Costa bullies opponent's into submission for 70 minutes before being replaced by the man mountian that is Drogba just when they thought it was safe. And that kind of impact, putting that fear into rivals may be all Mourinho wants from his trusted lieutenant. The likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry speak glowlingly about the Chelsea legend and recall his influence in the dressing room as one of the driving forces behind their team's success since 2004. Friends: Chelsea captain John Terry will be pleased with the idea of a Drogba reunion . Silverware: Drogba won 10 trophies during his time with the west London club . VIDEO Drogba weighs up Chelsea return . In eight years at Chelsea, Drogba helped the Blues to 10 trophies, including three Premier League titles and his experience in a young Chelsea squad will be huge. Chelsea have lost Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard in recent weeks, two Chelsea stalwarts that will leave a hole in the club's dressing room. Mourinho is clearly keen to regain some of the winning mentality and experience that the club have lost this summer.

In his pomp, Drogba was the epitome of a 'big game' player, scoring a total of nine goals in nine cup final appearances for the Blues. There's no doubt that the forward will add to his 157 goal tally for Chelsea, but just how much chance he will get to relive his glory days is yet to be seen. He may not be the star of Stamford Bridge next season, but Drogba still has a part to play.

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Witnesses from India and England in the Jimmy Anderson-Ravindra Jadeja bust-up were branded ‘hopelessly biased’ by the investigating official. This contributed to Gordon Lewis, the Australian judicial commissioner who presided over the tribunal, dropping all charges against the players. Lewis, who reached his conclusion in 10 minutes after a six-hour hearing, reportedly outlined in his written verdict that he could not be ‘comfortably satisfied’ about the precise nature of the contretemps in the Trent Bridge pavilion last month. This was because there was no video evidence and the only neutral testimony, from one of the Nottinghamshire stewards, was inconclusive. Common sense prevails: James Anderson has been cleared lf physically assaulting Ravindra Jedeja (R) Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch . Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl . VIDEO Jadeja and Anderson cleared of wrong-doing . Lewis also suggested Jadeja’s claim that Anderson had pushed him ‘hard and caused him to break stride’ was a ‘recent embellishment’. The commissioner was also critical of Adam Lewis, counsel for the Board of Control for Cricket in India, whose suggestion that Anderson had pushed Jadeja twice did not have ‘an iota of supporting evidence’. India claimed Anderson shoved Jadeja without provocation as the players entered the pavilion for lunch on the second day of the first Test and told him to ‘f****** go back to the dressing-room’. While Anderson is said to have agreed he used those words, he insisted that Jadeja had been the aggressor. Gordon Lewis said: ‘Obviously one version of the facts must be untrue but the existing CCTV image is unhelpful and the witnesses hopelessly biased in favour of one party or the other.’ Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl .

He added that a tribunal should not ‘guess to achieve an outcome,’ as quoted in his report on the ESPN Cricinfo website. ‘In short I do not know on the evidence, and to the relevant standard of proof, what happened in the corridor leading to the stairway in those few seconds after the batsmen and fielding side came in for lunch. ‘I cannot be comfortably satisfied as to the truth of either version of the evidence.’ Ulterior motives?

"By . Sam Peters . James Anderson could still face punishment for his altercation with Ravi Jadeja if Indian cricket call on the ICC to appeal the decision due to a lack of video evidence. The England bowler was cleared on Friday of a level three breach of the ICC’s code of conduct, after Australian commissioner Gordon Lewis found he had no case to answer following a six-hour hearing into the incident at Trent Bridge. The decision to throw out the charges confirmed a long-held belief within the England dressing room that the disciplinary charges, instigated by India following the first Investec Test at Nottingham, were a pre-meditated attempt to destabilise their most experienced bowler and his team-mates. Spat: Anderson could still face punishment for his altercation with Jadeja as they left the Trent Bridge pitch . Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl . Lewis’s decision to dismiss the charges has angered India — whose captain MS Dhoni is understood to have accused Anderson of calling him a ‘fat ****’ when he was batting at Trent Bridge — even though charges against Jadeja were also dropped on appeal. On Sunday night Indian officials, including Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) chairman N Srinivasan, who also serves as the ICC chairman, was understood to be on the brink of requesting that ICC chief executive Dave Richardson appeals Lewis’s decision. The Indians' main grievance is over the absence of video footage from the spot inside the Trent Bridge pavilion where Anderson was alleged to have shoved Jadeja following a heated exchange as the pair left the field at lunch on the second day. Leader of the attack: Indian officials could call on the ICC to review their decision because of lack of evidence . ICC Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) cameras installed around the dressing rooms were recording but failed to pick up the incident, while a CCTV camera only in operation during county matches — where ASCU cameras are not installed and security is generally less strict — was apparently not switched on. Nottinghamshire insist that cameras installed at the far end of the narrow corridor at the foot of the stairs leading up to the dressing rooms where Anderson and Jadeja clashed, has no footage available but India’s management, including former England coach Duncan Fletcher, are not satisfied. The Mail on Sunday understands that BCCI lawyers, estimated to have already run up fees in excess of £200,000, will consider pressing Richardson — the only man capable of appealing Lewis’s decision — once they have read a detailed report of the findings of Friday’s teleconference hearing. ‘We are expected to receive a detailed copy of the order that was passed by the Judicial Commissioner either by today or tomorrow,’ said BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel. Ulterior motives? England believe that Ravindra Jadeja's accusations were a purely tactical move by India . ‘We will only be able to take a call in this regard after receiving the order copy. A detailed legal analysis is required before deciding on future course. ‘Our legal team will study the report and will give us feedback. In such cases, every point needs to be studied minutely and it will take some time. So it is premature to conclude whether we will appeal.’ For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7 .

Pushing on: Max Chilton is hoping for a good end to the season with Marussia . On track: The British driver racing during qualifying ahead of last Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix . In a chaotic race Bianchi captured ninth place to spark jubilant scenes within Marussia, and set them up for another slice of history. After finishing in the top 10 for the first time in their four years in F1 last season, Marussia could go one further this year. Under F1's complicated prize-money structure, the financial rewards would also be considerable if Marussia could follow up with ninth on the back of their 10th spot in 2013. The team head into F1's summer break knowing they have eight races to keep Caterham at bay, and especially Sauber, currently on their worst streak in the team's history in 11 races without a point. 'We'd love to hold them off,' said the 23-year-old Briton. 'But to do that we need to be finishing in front of them, and at the moment we're not doing that, so we're hoping in a race when points do become available, they're not in front of us. 'We're giving it our best shot, but without constant updates on the car it's hard to keep knocking on their door. 'Some races we're close, some we're not as close. 'Thankfully for us they're not closing the door on the teams in front of them. 'It's not like they're looking at points every race and they're just missing out. They're not there at the moment. 'Because they're not in a position where they can feel comfortable scoring points, it means we're not right on the edge of our seats. 'They need a bit of luck like we had.' Competition: Adrian Sutil's Sauber team provide the biggest threat to Marussia in the constructor's championship . Jubilation: Jules Bianchi of France got Marussia's first two points of the season to put them ahead of Sauber . Adrian Sutil did come close to breaking Sauber's points duck in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday, matching his best result of the year with 11th. Sauber would certainly appear to be Marussia's main threat with Caterham struggling on and off the track. Chilton feels a recent takeover of the team by a consortium of Swiss and Middle-Eastern businessmen will likely take time to bear fruit. 'They've gone through a lot of changes. I've heard stuff about people going and different people changing roles,' added Chilton. 'Like any sport, if you change people around it takes time for them to learn their new positions and communicate properly. 'It takes a bit of time for a team to settle down, so for us that's helping.' Chilton, who remains hopeful of retaining his seat for next season, is still convinced he can score points of his own this year if given the right circumstances. 'I know I can do it, I just need to have the right opportunity to get it done,' said Chilton. 'I believe in my ability to score points. There are people who have scored points, and I know I can do it as well.'","Max Chilton wary of Sauber threat to Marussia's hopes in the standings .

"By . Erin Clements . A-list celebrities are regularly pictured with flawless make-up-free skin day after day. So for us lesser mortals, it comes as some relief to learn that it's not just good genes causing their healthy glow. New York dermatologist Patricia Wexler, who counts Iman among her clients, has revealed that there is a whole host of cosmetic treatments that allow stars to embrace the no-make-up look with such confidence. Dr Wexler tells MailOnline that increased volume (or plumpness), muscle tightness and removal of imperfections are the three key principles to follow in order to give the face a more youthful appearance. Flawless: Many stars use cosmetic procedures such as Botox to restore their skin without having to go under the knife . And with a combination of dermal fillers, toxins, ultrasound therapy and topical treatments, she can restore tired, lined and blotchy skin without the client having to go under the knife. DERMAL FILLERS$558 (average) Dr Wexler says dermal fillers, such as Restylane, are used to restore fullness to the face. 'If you've lost volume, you want to give the volume back where you lost it,' she explains. Typically this occurs in the upper part of the cheek, around the temples and in the hollow in front of the ear. ‘You fill that hollow, you lift the jowl that occurs at the lower part of the jawline. You’re filling to lift the line, to lift the fold,' she says. TOXINS$328 (average) If the patient’s problem is in the facial muscles, typical of very expressive people, who are prone to squinting or raising their eyebrows, Dr Wexler says Botox and Dysport are ideal for lifting and tightening – though, she adds, she will never administer a toxin to someone too young. 'When we get someone who’s in their twenties who comes in and says they want toxins to prevent lines, it’s too early,' she says. 'When people start doing procedures before they even see problems sometimes that can lead to negative results because you are weakening the muscle with the toxin. And if you’re going to start in your twenties and live to your nineties you’re going to end up with a very thin, tissue paper-like skin. And I think we all know examples of certain celebrities who’ve done that,' she adds. I woke up like this: Iman (left), Dr Wexler's client, and Jennifer Love Hewitt (right), Jamie Sherrill's client, appear effortlessly glowing . ULTHERAPY . $1,000 and up . For patients seeking results similar to a facelift without having to go under the knife, Dr Wexler recommends Ultherapy, a non-invasive procedure that delivers ultrasound energy at two different layers of the face. 'The first is the layer of the muscle that would be cut if you were having a facelift,’ Dr Wexler says. ‘You’re actually stimulating the production of new collagen, and over several months the face is lifting and that muscle is tightening. It’s like shrink-wrap.' The second part of the energy, Dr Wexler explains, is delivered to the deep part of the skin, the dermis. ‘If you’re tightening the muscle, you want to make sure the skin is tightening over it,’ she says. ‘In tightening the skin, you see a new tone, a new texture and even improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles.' About face: Dr Patricia Wexler (left) and nurse Jamie Sherrill (right) help high-profile patients get beautiful skin . PIXEL PERFECT LASER . $675 - $2,000 . Jamie Sherrill, a registered nurse and skincare expert who owns the Beauty Park Medical Spa in Los Angeles and Abu Dhabi, uses the Pixel Perfect Laser on her celebrity clients, which she says can shrink the size of pores, clear up acne scars and transform blotchy, spotted skin. Laser treatment is favored by Dr Wexler too, who says: 'Fractionated resurfacing has almost zero downtime. It just makes microscopic tunnels in the skin that grow new collagen that's not sun-damaged.' ACELLERATOR ULTRA TONING$220 . For home use, Ms Sherrill, who works with Jennifer Love Hewitt and Maria Menounos, recommends a product she sells on her website, called the ACELLerator Ultra Toning Device. It uses ultrasonic 1 MHz technology for the face and body to help stimulate new collagen, elastin and cell renewal, resulting in a more contoured appearance. TOPICAL TREATMENTS$15 and up . For removing spots and imperfections, Dr Wexler suggests products with glycolic acids, skin lightening products like hydroquinone and even botanicals such as bayberry. 'Hydroquinone with retinol is the gold standard,' she says. She adds that vitamin C is good for pigmentation, especially when combined with retinol.","Dermal fillers, Botox, Ultherapy and laser resurfacing are some of the methods Dr Patricia Wexler uses on her high-profile clients ."
"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Criticised: Leading doctors say shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (pictured) was 'misguided' when he demanded a moratorium on new NHS contracts being signed with private companies . Leading doctors say Labour would put patients ‘at great risk’ through its plans to restrict the number of private firms running NHS services. In a letter to the Daily Mail, the senior medics say services could worsen if the Health Service is not able to make use of the best providers. They say shadow health secretary Andy Burnham was ‘misguided’ this week when he demanded a moratorium on new contracts being signed with charities and private companies. Mr Burnham said the Government’s ‘privatisation’ agenda was ‘indefensible’. He called for all pending NHS contracts with the private sector to be put on hold until the next election – except where there would otherwise be a threat to the provision of services. But critics accused him of hypocrisy, pointing out that Mr Burnham’s term as Health Secretary saw a big increase in the use of private firms to provide services, run treatment centres and build hospitals. Now he has come under attack from senior doctors, including Dr Michael Dixon, president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, the body which represents GPs in charge of NHS budgets. Several GPs who chair local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have added their names to the letter, which is published on Mail Online. They wrote: ‘As doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our patients, we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this week by Andy Burnham. They would put patients and services at great risk.’ The doctors said it was ‘absolutely untrue’ to suggest there was any kind of privatisation agenda within CCGs – or that they are forced to contract out for every service. They say the amount of NHS care commissioned from the private sector is in fact less than 6 per cent. Risk: In a letter to the Daily Mail, the senior medics said services could worsen if the Health Service is not able to make use of the best providers. They claimed Labour's plans would put patients 'at great risk' (file picture) ‘Local GPs groups must retain the freedom to make use of innovation, experience and investment from all sectors to improve patient care,’ they said. Last night a Labour spokesman said: ‘NHS spending on private firms broke the £10billion barrier last year – much higher than 6 per cent.’ 'As doctors seeking to ensure the best possible health services for our . patients, we are extremely concerned about the proposals announced this . week by the Shadow Health Secretary, Andy Burnham.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Researchers found that those with a history of problem drinking in middle-age more than doubled their risk of memory loss in later life . Drinking too much in middle age can lead to memory loss in later life, a study has found. Scientists questioned 6,542 American middle-adults about their past alcohol consumption and assessed their mental abilities over a period of eight years. They found that a history of problem drinking  more than doubled the risk of developing severe memory impairment. Lead researcher Dr Iain Lang, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: 'We already know there is an association between dementia risk and levels of current alcohol consumption - that understanding is based on asking older people how much they drink and then observing whether they develop problems. 'But this is only one part of the puzzle and we know little about the consequences of alcohol consumption earlier in life. 'What we did here is investigate the relatively unknown association between having a drinking problem at any point in life and experiencing problems with memory later in life.' He added: 'This finding - that middle-aged people with a history of problem drinking more than double their chances of memory impairment when they are older - suggests... that this is a public health issue that needs to be addressed.' Participants were asked four specific questions: had they ever felt they should cut down on their drinking, had people annoyed them by criticising their drinking, had they ever felt bad or guilty about their drinking, and had they ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady nerves or get rid of a hangover. The findings appear in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society charity, said: 'When we talk about drinking too much, the media often focuses on young people ending up in A&E after a night out. 'However, there’s also a hidden cost of alcohol abuse given the mounting evidence that alcohol abuse can also impact on cognition later in life. Researchers said concerns over alcohol abuse often focused on the short-term effects of people ending up in A&E after a night out, while the long-term effects were ignored (file image) 'This small study shows that people who admitted to alcohol abuse at some point in their lives were twice as likely to have severe memory problems, and as the research relied on self-reporting that number may be even higher. 'This isn’t to say that people need to abstain from alcohol altogether. As well as eating a healthy diet, not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight, the odd glass of red wine could even help reduce your risk of developing dementia.' Dr Eric Karran, science director at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: 'One strength of this study is its long time period: as dementia develops slowly over a number of years it’s crucial to understand what factors could affect our risk of the condition earlier in life. 'Although studies such as this one can be very useful for observing health trends, it’s important to note that they are not able to show cause and effect, and it’s not clear whether other factors may also have influenced these results.'","Researchers asked middle-aged Americans about drinking habits .

"By . Anna Pursglove . Pictures of Prince William in his new role as President of the British Sub-Aqua Club demonstrated two things very clearly. First, that His Royal Highness knows one end of a snorkel from the other, and second, that he hasn’t done anything about his rapid hair loss. In common with around three in ten men of his age, 32-year-old William suffers from male pattern baldness (MPB) and those pictures of him emerging from a swimming pool with the little hair he has left plastered to his head served to highlight the problem. Scroll down for video . Bald truth: William went scuba diving last week and emerged revealing the full scale of his increasing baldness . Male pattern baldness affects most men at some stage in their lives. It happens when dihydrotestosterone (DHT) — a hormone formed when the body metabolises testerosterone — causes hair follicles at the front and top of the head to shrink, producing finer hairs and, eventually, no hair at all. Hair follicles at the back and sides of the head, however, do not have DHT receptors, meaning MPB tends to leave sufferers with the classic horseshoe of hair. It is also a hereditary condition and with his father, grandfathers and uncles all balding, it was always likely that William would follow suit. Hopefully, he won’t be tempted to use Prince Charles’s solution — the comb-over. Not only does it fail to disguise the royal bald spot, it has a habit of blowing around in high winds to create an alarming spiky halo. If William wants to tackle his baldness there are many remedies on offer, from homespun to high-tech. Here, the country’s leading hair loss experts explain which might work for William... Onion, garlic, coconut, henna, egg,  tomato ketchup, fabric softener, banana, artificial sweetener . . . you name it, someone has suggested it as a cure for hair loss. Michael Winner once let it be known that he maintained those famous white locks by washing his hair in beer. Home grown remedy: Could a clove of garlic, a fried egg, or a slice of coconut be Wills' answer? The verdict: Dr Raghu Reddy of London’s The Private Clinic is a leading hair transplant surgeon who has worked with high-profile clients including Premier League footballers. He says: ‘There is some evidence to suggest that henna helps to moisturise hair and will therefore improve its appearance, but it will have no effect on baldness and, I’m afraid, neither will any of these other home remedies. ‘They may make the hair you have look slightly fuller for a day or two — as is the case with beer which leaves a residue of hops and barley as it evaporates — but they will have absolutely no impact on actual hair loss.’ The theory behind this one is that it increases blood supply to the scalp, which prevents the shrinkage of the hair follicles associated with balding. All of our experts say they have come across patients using this technique and an even more extreme form of the same idea — the headstand. Back in the Eighties, Liverpool FC’s receding goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar also promoted an inversion machine that he believed would help. Natural approach: Massaging the scalp opens the hair follicles and increases the blood flow, inducing hair growth . The verdict: Jonny Harris, one of the directors of hair loss clinic The Belgravia Centre, says: ‘You can see why men think scalp massages, headstands, handstands and the like will work because minoxidil, one of the medications that does work for hair loss, also increases blood flow to the scalp. It is what we call a vasodilator — or something that widens blood vessels.’ In fact, minoxidil was first developed as a medication for high blood pressure, until researchers noticed it also thickened the hair. ‘However,’ continues Jonny Harris, ‘just because one vasodilator works with male pattern baldness doesn’t mean they all do. So no, these techniques won’t work.’ There are two options here with countless studies supporting each. All hair loss experts agree that both medications work, although results vary depending on the individual. The first is finasteride, an oral medication with the trade name Propecia. The second is minoxidil, a topical medication with the trade name Regaine. Neither is available on the NHS. Some clinics prescribe their own preparations and also use the two medications in combination. Both will stop working if you stop taking them so it would have to be a lifelong commitment if you plan to keep your hair. Effective: Experts claim drug programmes are highly effective, but it is a life-long commitment . The verdict: Dr Reddy explains that while Propecia (in use since the late Nineties) is roughly twice as effective at halting male pattern baldness, it can also (in around two per cent of men) cause side-effects, which include loss of libido, anxiety and depression. Propecia is a prescription-only medication, which acts as a DHT inhibitor, thereby halting the detrimental effect of the hormone on hair follicles. Minoxidil — on the market as an anti-hair loss product since the Eighties — is less effective, but has milder side-effects. The exact mechanism by which it works isn’t fully understood, but it does help retain hair and slow the thinning process. It cannot be used on areas that are completely bald. As with Propecia, the medication works only when used continuously. Jonny Harris estimates that the average man coming to The Belgravia  Centre for medication can expect to spend between £150 and £350 every three months on treatment. Whether you opt for the space-age iGrow helmet (£665) or a slightly less futuristic ‘laser comb’ (around £300), the principle is the same. Manufacturers claim these low- level laser therapies (LLLT) will re-energise and strengthen cells in the hair follicles, combating hair loss. Both are suitable for use at home. Hitting the market in 2013, the iGrow is a helmet (which even plays music while you use it) filled with red laser and LED light diodes. According to a study published by the American Society For Laser Medicine And Surgery, when used every other day for about four months, the treatment will increase hair growth by up to 40 per cent. Laser combs have been around longer, but work on the same principle. Manufacturers claim high success rates with them, but experts say study groups are too small to be useful and focus on how men ‘feel’ about their hair, not on scientific measurements. Laser treatment: Could this iGrow laser helmet be the key to sorting out Wills' hereditary male pattern baldness . The verdict: Dr Reddy (along with most leading experts) is very sceptical that this approach will work without one of the proven anti-hair loss medications being used at the same time. ‘There are no convincing studies on this,’ he says, ‘even though it has been being explored for some time. LLLT is a safe form of light treatment, but have I seen evidence that it combats male pattern balding? No.’ A hair transplant is the only way to permanently fix a completely bald spot. Medication is prescribed to maximise hair coverage before a transplant is performed. Celebrity move: Many have suggested Wills should follow Wayne Rooney's lead by getting a transplant . The verdict: Leading hair transplant surgeon Dr Bessam Farjo explains: ‘One method is to take a thin block of skin from the back of the head (which contains many hair roots) and then have a team of technicians present in the theatre to isolate individual hair roots (surrounded by a small bit of skin — referred to as a graft) which the surgeon implants into the bald area one at a time. This is Follicular Unit Transplantation, or FUT. ‘Alternatively hair is shaved and a very fine boring tool used to extract roots individually from the back of the head. This is referred to as Follicular Unit Extraction, or FUE.’ The most suitable method, says Dr Farjo, depends on habits of the man having the transplant. FUT can be performed in a day, but will leave a scar at the back of the head (which may prevent the patient shaving his head in the future)  while FUE leaves no scars, but takes longer (around two days) and involves shaving the back of the head initially (in other words it won’t work for a high-flying executive who  has to be back in the office the  next day). Both procedures are performed using a sedative and local anesthetic. Men who have had the surgery describe it as uncomfortable rather than painful. Guideline prices are £2 to £2.50 per graft. This can give a starting price of around £5,000, stretching up to £20,000 for more extensive work. Dr Farjo and Dr Reddy agree that not everyone is a suitable candidate for transplant. Neither surgeon will accept men below 30 because hair loss patterns are unpredictable and expectations often unrealistic. They are also reluctant to work on the very elderly as hair thins naturally, regardless of MPB, and if there isn’t enough hair at the back of the head to get good quality grafts. Clinical trials are already underway. The dream is that scientists could use stem cells to generate new hair follicles in the laboratory. They’d still have to be implanted, but they wouldn’t have to be removed from another part of the scalp. However, there are still multiple problems to be overcome. Follicles are complicated to generate (hence expensive) and the body is prone to reject large numbers of them. The verdict: Dr Reddy says that, at the moment, rejection of cloned hair grafts is a major problem, which can be solved only with anti-rejection drugs (of the type used in organ transplants). The risks associated with taking these drugs would not be worth it for a cosmetic procedure. He believes that any kind of meaningful new development for treating baldness is at least a decade away.","William, 32, suffers from male pattern baldness like Charles and Phillip .

Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt . However once he had paid for the belt and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was grabbed by undercover officers on the street. According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'. Harlem rapper Juelz Santana (pictured right) wearing the belt coveted by his teenage fan . Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He’s never been arrested. 'His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.' A Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his state ID. The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit. Officers took the teenager, who is an engineering freshman at the NYC College of Technology, to a local precinct. Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager. 'In spite of producing such documentation Christian was told that his identification was false and that he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase,' the suit states. Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims. The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes. The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident. The teenager, who now works at Target, told the News: 'I brought the belt back to Barneys a few days later and returned it. I got my money back, I’m not shopping there again. It’s cruel. It’s racist.' A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation. 'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. 'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'","Trayon Christian, 19, taken to NYPD precinct despite using his own debit card and ID at the upscale Manhattan store .

"By . Beci Wood . A warning to those preparing to jet off abroad this summer: taking a mobile phone with you can be a very costly business. While we all know to be careful when using our smartphones abroad, the true cost of using the internet on holiday has been revealed in a set of shocking new statistics. The research comes as the European Union slashes data roaming charges by more than 50 per cent from today in a bid to encourage people to use their mobile phones more abroad. Risky business: Travellers should be careful not to overspend on data when overseas . The new law comes too late for Carissa . Grice, 18, from Greater Manchester, who managed to rack up a £3000 bill . while using Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp to chat to friends in Turkey, . downloading 630MB of data. Thankfully Orange since slashed the £2,907 bill to £250 for the 'devastated' trainee nail technician. A second recent incident saw a teacher faced with a £2,600 bill after downloading a Neil Diamond album while on holiday in South Africa. The new rules about mobile phone costs state that the maximum charge for outgoing calls is 19 cents (Around 15p) excluding VAT, six cents (around 4p) for outgoing text messages and 20 cents (15p) for a MB download of data. However, the new caps only apply when you use a mobile within the EU, the rest of Europe is exempt. But statistics show, just half of travellers realise the new rules are limited to European Union countries. Endsleigh Insurance has researched the exact cost of using the most popular mobile apps outside the EU and in the rest of the world. Based on O2 data roaming charges, the results make for some scary reading. It costs 3p per megabyte of data roaming in Europe, but a whopping £6 in the rest of the world. Based on a photo taken from an iPhone 5 camera (which has an average size of 2MB) it would cost 76p to upload a photo onto Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. Holiday: Carissa amassed a huge bill on her mum's phone while on holiday in Turkey . Vulnerable: Kids should be careful if they want to remain in contact with their friends while on holiday . 1. Turn off push notifications in apps2. Use data Bolt Ons or data cap usage3. Switch off video auto-play4. Disable weather apps5. Preload Google Maps with Wi-Fi6. Switch on aeroplane mode7. Use a pay and go SIM8. Switch off your voicemail9. Switch off high volume email accounts10. Connect to WiFi . This estimate also does not include being on Facebook itself which would use data too. Especially if the users scrolls through friends status’, which can be text, images or videos which all require data to load. Facebook also now auto plays videos which can push the cost of browsing up further if this feature isn’t turned off. Streaming a 30 minute episode of a show abroad could cost up to £540, the equivalent of a flight to Mauritius with Thomas Cook. Chatting to friends of Whatsapp will set you back up to £12 while browsing the Internet for 30 minutes could cost up to £60. Sara Newell, Gadget Sector Manager at Endsleigh Insurance said: ‘We are so accustomed to using our phones every day for entertainment, keeping up to date with news, and staying connected with friends: everyday apps we take for granted in the UK, if used in the same way abroad, can rack up unexpected bills that can exceed the actual cost of a holiday. 'We’ve seen bills rack up into the thousands, so would advise on planning ahead to avoid a nasty surprise when you get back. 'Check data roaming charges with your provider, get prepared with a data bolt on or usage cap, or switch off data roaming on your phone altogether!’ Cost per megabyte for data roaming. Europe (outside EU) = £0.38, Rest of the world = £6 Uploading a photo to Instagram/Facebook/Twitter. (Based on a photo taken from an iPhone 5 camera) Europe = £0.76, Rest of the world = £12  Downloading a 2MB email attachment. Europe (outside EU) = £0.76, Rest of the world = £12 Having Google Maps open for 10 minutes. Europe (outside EU) = £2.28, Rest of the world = £36 Having a 5 minute Whatsapp conversation. Europe (outside EU) = £0.76, Rest of the world = £12 Browsing the internet for 20 minutes. Europe (outside EU) = £3.80, Rest of the world = £60 Streaming TV for 30 minutes.

Europe (outside EU) = £1.90, Rest of the world = £30 . Luckily, roaming charges are set to drop by more than 50 per cent from today thanks to new European Union rules. It comes after research in February revealed that less than 10 per cent of travellers use their mobile phones abroad in the same way they do at home due to excessive charges.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Half of British holidaymakers drink alcohol every day on summer breaks - and one in three of us admit to boozing in the departure lounge. A survey revealed yesterday how Brits hit the bottle as soon as we set off on holidays abroad. Alcohol abuse campaigners warned that 'any ideas about sensible drinking get left at home when we go on holiday.' Down the hatch! Brits hit the bottle as soon as they set off on holidays abroad, research shows . The research showed that more than 30 per cent down at least four alcoholic drinks each day. But it also revealed how 19 per cent of holidaymakers admitted having a 'regrettable experience' as a result of being under the influence of alcohol. A spokeman for Alcohol Concern said, 'Most typically this is an argument with a loved one or a stranger. 'Nearly a quarter said their holiday abroad had been spoiled by someone else's drinking leading to loud or aggressive behaviour.' The survey of more than 500 adults was carried out by the Alcohol Concern in Wales - with over a third said that they started drinking before they had even arrived at their accommodation. The healthy option: Excess alcohol can often cause disruption and misery on holiday as well as wasting valuable leisure time, alcohol campaigners say . It found that half said they drank alcohol 'every day' during their last holiday - with a further 29 per cent drinking on 'most days'. 'These findings show that, when it comes to holidaying abroad, most of us drink more alcohol than we normally do back home,' said the spokesman. 'Free from the constraints of our work and other responsibilities, it seems we are so keen to start drinking that, in some cases, we begin before we've left the departure lounge. 'Yet, far from improving the holiday experience, excess alcohol can often cause disruption and misery, resulting in arguments and ill health, as well as valuable leisure time wasted nursing a hangover. 'Drinking too much alcohol will do us no favours, and that holds true whether we are at home or away on our holidays.' The survey showed 92 per cent drank alcohol on their last holiday abroad, 75 per cent said they drank more on holiday abroad than they would normally at home. The main reasons to drink on holiday were to relax and have fun - yet only 26 per centagreed that holidays would be less enjoyable without alcohol. Fifteen per cent drank more because the drinks were part of an all-inclusive deal. And 34 per cent said that their drinking started before they arrived at their holiday accommodation - with 16 per cent began drinking at the departure terminal. 'We need to change our relationship with alcohol, and whilst, as individuals, we can take steps to moderate our drinking by keeping within recommended guidelines, the lead needs to come from Government. 'We often knock back even more when we holiday abroad, where it seems we have decided that the ""normal rules"" around drinking don't apply.'","Brits hit the bottle as soon as they are on holiday .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . For a good ten years now, coffee has been Britain’s new obsession – with high street chains popping up everywhere to challenge our image as a nation of tea drinkers. But the new brand of caffeine launched by a major tourist attraction may be a step too far for even the most latté-obsessed fans of hot beverages. Not necessarily everyone's cup of coffee: You may need a strong stomach to try the Rat Cafe . London Dungeon – an enclave of spooky corridors and shock-tactic exhibits which looks at the darker side of the history of the capital city – is celebrating the opening of its Rat Café, and with it, the chance for guests to enjoy a nice mug of ‘Ratuccino’. The concept has been dreamed up in response to the current Japanese craze for ‘Cat Cafes’ – where customers sip lunchtime drinks in the company of resident felines. Mixed reception: Some guests at the cafe seemed pleased to meet the 'locals' - others seemed less sure . This London version, as you might have guessed, involves not purring moggies but scampering, twitching – and very real – rodents. Brave souls can also opt to eat at the café – where, if they can stomach the bad pun as much as the very idea of it – they can try Black Forest Rateux. Health and safety officials will be relieved to hear that neither food nor drink at the Rat Café includes rats as genuine ingredients – but willing guests can, if they so choose, enjoy both while the little creatures dash about the room, or even sit on their shoulders. Pleased to meet you: Cafe customers cosy up to the London Dungeon rats, and even find time for a selfie . Although this unusual form of catering is largely for fun, there is also a mildly serious point to it – an attempt to rehabilitate the image of a much-maligned creature. ‘Rats have been tarnished with an undeserved reputation throughout history – from the Black Death of the Middle Ages to the great stink of Victorian times,’ says Hywel Mathias of London Dungeon. Up close and personal: Customers were able to handle the much-maligned rodents as they sipped 'Ratuccinos' ‘We wanted to challenge those perceptions and show they are actually characterful and full of fun.’ Eighteen rats were unleashed on café guests – all of whom have rodent day jobs at the London Dungeon, and have been vetted to mingle with the public. ‘We have 18 rodents living here, and they are a huge hit with our guests, who get to see them close up in their special display, with giant viewing windows,’ Mr Mathias adds. A surprise success: Although the Rat Cafe was a one-off special, London Dungeon may make it a regular event . ‘Our café takes that a step further, and lets people get even closer, handle them, stroke them and really get to know them.’ Although the Rat Café was a one-off for a group of rat-loving guests, London Dungeon is considering making the idea a regular event. ‘Judging by first reactions, this pop-up rat café could become a regular date on the eccentric things to do calendar,’ Mr Hywel says.","London Dungeon creates quirky cafe where customers can drink with rats .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Floating away on a boat and leaving the world behind is at the top of many holidaymakers' wish list. Well now visitors to England can do just that. A hotel is Surrey is the first outlet in the UK to offer the HotTug; a wood-fired hot tub which allows users to sail on a tug boat while simultaneously relaxing in a warm bubble bath. Romantic escape: The HotTug is being advertised as the ideal retreat for couples who want to enjoy some alone with nothing but the lapping water for company . Going solo: Sailors can sit back and enjoy the peace and quiet while relaxing in the HotTug as it makes its way down the Thames . The brain child of Dutch designer Frank De Bruijn, the HotTug uses a specially developed wood-burning stove to keep the water a balmy 38C, and a silent electric engine to send a group of soakers merrily downstream. De Bruijn says he has a soft spot for places where the natural and cultivated go hand in hand. He says: ‘The feel of the outdoors is very important to me. Now the HotTug is expanding my work horizon to the water as well.’. The 'tub' - which is available to rent from the Runnymede-on-Thames Hotel in Egham nestled on the banks of the River Thames - is ideal for care-free fun or simply relaxing in the summer sun. Take a dip: The sturdy rim of the HotTug allows users to jump into the water during their ride - although that might not be advisable on London's River Thames . Full steam ahead: Group of friends can also enjoy drinks while sailing along in the hot tub boat . De Bruijn, continued: ‘It's much more than a boat, it's a vessel with different options. 'When the tug is filled, there is only a narrow rim between you and the water, making you feel at one with your surroundings.’ He gained experience of wood stoves while living and working on his own barge helped him to develop a wood-burning underwater stove. This underwater stove is what heats the 2,000 litres of water in the HotTug to a pleasant 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) in a few hours. We are sailing: Sailors might get some strange looks from people on board other vessels as they put down waterways . The HotTug proved a great success when it was introduced at the Hiswa boat show in Amsterdam in September. Now the company is exploring the possibilities of branching out as Bruijn aims big. When asked what his idea of success is, he responded: ‘When the HotTug is a common sight at holiday homes, campsites and saunas around world.’ Prices start from £14,000 to buy or £90 per hour to rent.","Service is on offer at a hotel in Egham, Surrey so you can sail on Thames .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The number of Britons arrested abroad for drug offences has increased, with a massive 68 per cent rise in drug arrests in Spain. There were 708 cases of Britons arrested for drug offences overseas in the 2013/14 holiday season - an increase on the figure of 669 in 2012/13. Of . the cases, 173 were in Spain - a 68 per cent rise on the 2012/13 figure, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Booked: Spain and the US are the countries where the most number of Britons have been arrested for drug offences . The shock figures come after warnings about the party drug known as Cannibal, which increases aggressiveness in the extreme and has become popular in the Balearic islands this summer. A British man has been arrested for biting bathers on a beach in Magaluf following his alleged use fo the drug, with multiple other holidaymakers hospitalised in recent weeks after using the substance, which is often sold online as bath salts. Spanish police believe Cannibal is being sold in nightclubs after a large shipment arrived on the islands. And detectives in Ibiza's party resort of San Antonio claim dealers have been peddling the mind-bending narcotic to young revellers. Reporting on the arrest figures in Spain for drug use over the past year, the FCO said it believed the rise was due to a crackdown by police. On patrol: It is thought the surge in drug arrests in Spain is due to a crackdown by police . The second-largest number of drug arrests involving Britons last year was in America, with 102 cases. But this was a 29 per cent fall on the 2012/13 American total. Overall, the FCO said drug arrests were low last year compared with previous years. There were 816 cases in 2011/12, 799 in 2010/11 and as many as 994 in 2009/10. Despite the rise in drug arrests, the number of arrests for all offences involving British nationals abroad fell fractionally from 5,435 in 2012/13 to 5,418 in 2013/14. The FCO figures for 2013/14 involving Britons abroad also showed that the number of Britons needing hospital treatment fell from 3,599 in 2012/13 to 3,157 in 2013/14. Falling figures: The number of Britons needing emergency medical treatment abroad dropped in the past year . There were also 106 cases of rape compared with 138 in 2012/13, with last year's figure being the lowest recorded for 10 years. And the number of reported sexual assaults also dropped from 172 to 152. But there were 31,134 cases of lost or stolen passports and the need for emergency travel documents last year - a rise on the figure of 28,783 in 2012/13. The most cases where Britons needed consular assistance in 2013/14 were in Spain, followed by the USA, Thailand, France and Greece. Comparing the number of visits made to a country with the number of assistance cases required, the Philippines was the country where British nationals were most likely to need assistance, followed by Thailand, Jamaica, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. The FCO said as a proportion, British nationals remained significantly more likely to die in the Philippines than in any other country. It added: 'This is due to the large number of elderly British expats who live there, a group which continues to account for most of the hospitalisation or death cases. Beach brigade: Despite the US being the second destination with the highest number of Britons arrested for drug offences, the figure has dropped overall in the country . 'Relatively few tourists die or are hospitalised.' Although total arrests were down last year, there were rises in cases involving Britons in the Philippines, Egypt and France. Consular Affairs Minister Mark Simmonds said: 'With the summer holidays just around the corner, millions of people across the UK will be looking forward to taking a trip abroad. The vast majority will enjoy a trouble-free holiday, but for those who do encounter difficulties our consular staff are there to offer support. 'This year's report has highlighted some encouraging downwards trends, and this allows our staff to concentrate more on supporting our most vulnerable customers. However, the FCO continues to help thousands of British nationals who get into trouble overseas every year.' He went on: 'Not all consular cases are preventable, but for many travellers taking a few simple steps of preparation can reduce the risk of getting into trouble. 'Taking out comprehensive travel insurance, researching the country and health risks before you go and behaving responsibly when you arrive can all help to ensure that you remember your holiday for the right reasons.'","173 people were arrested in Spain over the past year for drugs offences .

"By . Mark Duell . Two young sisters subjected a 22-year-old man with learning difficulties to a degrading 90-minute gunpoint sex assault and then sent photos of the abuse to their friends on BlackBerry Messenger. Yasmine, 19, and Whitney Notice, 20, lured him back to their flat in the Nechells area of Birmingham, threatened him with a replica handgun, forced him to strip and demanded he performed sex acts. The pair - who were jailed for more than seven years and five years respectively - sexually humiliated the man for their own amusement after plying him with cider, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Jailed: Yasmine (left), 19, and Whitney (right) Notice, 20, lured the 22-year-old man back to their flat in Nechells, Birmingham, threatened him with a replica handgun, forced him to strip and demanded he perform sex acts . The girls – who were jailed last Friday - were only caught out when specialist West Midlands Police officers used advanced telecoms analysis to track the shocking images to Yasmine’s phone. The man was plied with cider after being lured to a flat by Yasmine, Rob Cowley, prosecuting, said. He was kicked and punched, had a toy gun pointed at his head and tied to a radiator with handcuffs. He was forced to perform a humiliating sex act before they let him go, Mr Cowley said. Police even believe the duo may have had more victims as other distressing images were found on their phones. ‘It was a horrible event in which a vulnerable person was abused in the most unpleasant way for a long time,’ Judge Roderick Henderson said, adding that at one stage the victim was seen ‘cowering’. Their accomplice Anthony Jones, 18, from the Bartley Green area of Birmingham, also admitted assault, false imprisonment, and causing a person to engage in sexual activity. Jones was given a three-year rehabilitation order. Both sisters were ordered to register as sex offenders for life and Jones for five years. Sick crime: The two sisters sent photos of the abuse to their friends on BlackBerry Messenger (file picture) Joe Louis, defending Yasmine, said: ‘It was obvious he was going to be bullied but there came a point when that bullying went way too far and Yasmine tried to stop it.’ The judge said he accepted that Jones, who unlike the sisters had no previous record, had been ‘significantly influenced by two older young women.’ 'It was a horrible event in which a vulnerable person was abused in the most unpleasant way for a long time' Judge Roderick Henderson . Investigating officer Detective Constable Emma Fennon of West Midlands Police said: ‘They targeted the man with the express intention of humiliating him for their own pleasure. They even recorded the abuse and boasted about their actions to friends. 'In the video the man - who is a vulnerable adult - can be seen cowering, fearing for his life, whilst the girls are heard laughing in the background. ‘We believe this may not have been the first time they have carried out such abuse as other images discovered on their phones suggest there could be more victims. ‘If anyone has suffered such abuse they should report it to police. The matter will be dealt with sensitively by officers specially trained to support victims.’ Old home: The sisters used to live on this road in Nechells, Birmingham, but they have both now been jailed . The sisters met their victim over social media and arranged to meet him for drinks on the night of February 3 this year. But after luring him back to their flat they carried out their sexual ‘torture’ plan. Police were alerted to an image of the abuse sent via BlackBerry the following day which showed the man being sexually assaulted and tormented him with a gun. 'We believe this may not have been the first time they have carried out such abuse as other images discovered on their phones suggest there could be more victims' Detective Constable Emma Fennon, West Midlands Police . Public Protection Unit Detective Inspector Darren Lee said: ‘The sentences reflect the cruelty of the offence. This was a complex inquiry, with phone analysis work needed on seven mobile phones and numerous computer items found in their flat.’ Both sisters admitted assault, false imprisonment, and causing a person to engage in sexual activity, whilst Whitney also pleaded guilty to possessing an imitation firearm. Yasmine was jailed for seven years and two months, and Whitney for five years and four months.","Yasmine, 19, and Whitney Notice, 20, lured man back to Birmingham flat .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Plan of action: Field Marshal Montgomery drew up a template for rehabilitating post-Nazi Germany . A fascinating plan drawn up by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery to rehabilitate the German people from Nazism has emerged nearly 70 years later. The British army supremo highlighted the importance of a free press and the role of the church in helping to rid the defeated nation of Adolf Hitler's warped fascist idyll. Montgomery came up with a strategy to win the hearts and minds of the German people after the Allies took control of Germany following the end of World War Two. He believed British soldiers should . connect with the locals by having conversations with adults in the . street and playing games with children in public. He encouraged the people to meet up and socialise or join clubs and associations to create a 'strong bulwark against Nazism'. Montgomery . cited the church as vital in reintegrating the Germans back into a . civilised world after it was one of the first institutions to be . suppressed by Hitler. His . objective was to gradually replace a sense of fear of the future that . had been drummed into them by Nazi propaganda to one of hope and return . the country to a peaceful democracy. The document, marked 'Top Secret', was written on July 14, 1945, two months after Germany surrendered the war and Hitler committed suicide. It appears to be a template that was issued to the chiefs in charge of the other three sectors of Germany; the Americans, the French and the Russians. This copy that is now coming up for auction was retained by a senior U.S. intelligence officer. For sale: This fascinating plan drawn up by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery,  bearing the military leader's handwriting, could fetch more than $8,000 at auction tomorrow . Outline: Field Marshal Montgomery set out his plan to 'allow the people to get down to their own life'. The document, titled 'Notes on the Present Situation', has a pre-sale estimate of $8,000. After the war Montgomery was in charge of the British zone which was north west Germany and included Hamburg and a population of 20 million citizens and two million German PoWs. To begin with the Allied forces were not allowed to talk or even smile at the locals in order to show the Germans how much damage the Nazis had caused the world. But by July 1945 Montgomery warned of the need to start engaging with the Germans. Field Marshal Montgomery drew up a 28-point plan to try to heal the wounds which ran deep in conflict-torn German society. It covered Propaganda and Information, Meetings, Trades Unions, The German Youth, Fraternisation, Notification to the Germans, and Executive Action. Far from attempting to control the population with an iron fist, the document stresses how winning hearts and minds is the key. One handwritten addition to the typed draft reads: 'Our present attitude towards the German people is negative, it must be replaced by one that is positive and holds out hope for the future.' Point 4 continues: 'In seeking for a solution to the problem we must not forget the human factor; we cannot solve the problem without the aid of the German people themselves...' Bernard Montgomery pictured in a turret of a tank during the advance on El Alamein during the Middle East fighting c. 1942 . At point 7, Montgomery stresses: 'We must eradicate the best allies of Nazism, past and future; these are idleness, boredom, and fear of the future.' Montgomery wrote that years of Nazi propaganda had left the minds of the German people 'blank', meaning that they needed to be 'told what to do'. He prescribed a plan of propaganda to inform them of the Allied plan for their country. Ironically, in point 12, he also emphasised the need to 'encourage freedom of speech and freedom of the press... adding: 'We obviously cannot allow communist propaganda'. The church was also a key plank in the rehabilitation of Germany. Montgomery says in point 19: 'The church is possibly one of the few bridges of confidence between the two countries [England and Germany] that is not down.' Liberation: Here, Field Marshal Montgomery highlights how crucial freedom of speech and freedom of the press is to liberating German . He said: 'There is much fertile soil for the seeds of trouble. We cannot solve the problem without the aid of the German people. These notes deal with the methods we will adopt. 'We must have real contact with the people. At present we allow all members of the British forces in Germany to speak to and play with little children. 'We should now extend this to allow conversation with adult Germans in the streets.' Rules and regulations: Montgomery here sets out the rules for 'Fraternisation' - writing in his own hand corrections to the original draft . The British army commander said freedom of speech, expression and the press were vital in their transformation back to a peaceful society. He added: 'To allow people to get down to their own life we want them to talk things over among themselves, to discuss their problems and generally help themselves. 'The people will be allowed to hold public meetings and discussions and to talk over their affairs. 'We want to encourage freedom of speech. We obviously cannot allow communist propaganda or Nazi tendencies but I am anxious to restore freedom of the press.' And Montgomery said the church was vital in helping the German youth expand their minds from Nazism. Signed and sealed: Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery signed and dated the action plan just a few weeks after the fall of the Third Reich . He said: 'The church is possibly one of the few bridges of confidence between the two countries that is not down. 'Among the first things to be suppressed by Hitler were the church's youth work and the Boy Scouts. 'Every encouragement will be given to chaplains to start Boy Scout Troops, clubs and classes. 'We want to encourage juvenile organisations for the purpose of religious, cultural, health or recreational activities.' Central figure: Field Marshal Montgomery, centre, with Colonel I.P.

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has warned that the growing parachute payments for clubs relegated from the Barclays Premier League are in danger of decreasing the competitiveness of the Championship. Norwich, Fulham and Cardiff will receive around £60million over the next four years after dropping out of the top-flight last season. That figure has increased from the previous £48m parachute payments. But Barber (right), whose Brighton side are fighting to gain promotion from the Championship having reached the play-offs in the past two seasons, is concerned that it could prevent the competition being a level playing field. Firing shot: Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has warned about the impact of parachute payments . ‘Despite the highest average crowd in the League over the past two season, some of the best long-term sponsorship deals and sold-out hospitality, that doesn’t add up to one season’s parachute payments,’ said Barber. ‘For me the disparity is too large and it will have an impact — if we’re not careful — on the competitiveness of the division. ‘People could argue that those with parachutes are not always promoted so it can’t be having an effect. That’s true, but payments haven’t been this large before and the disparity not this great. ‘We have to be careful fans don’t lose heart and feel they’ve got a mountain to climb before a ball is kicked. Everyone should worry.’ Doing it right: Albion want to win promotion to the Premier League under Sami Hyypia's management .","Sami Hyypia is in charge at the Amex Stadium .

"By . Wills Robinson . A park ranger known for his dancing has been fired after a video emerged of him performing an 'R-rated' version of the Macarena. Deryl Nelson from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was captured holding his crouch during the routine, causing parents to cover their childrens' eyes. The 51-year-old had worked at Coolidge Park in North Shore for seven years and was known for being the 'dancing ranger', but city officials accused him of neglecting his duties and 'unbecoming conduct' after they noticed the video online. Scroll down for video . Routine: Deryl Nelson, 51, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, has been fired from his job as a park ranger after the 'R-rated' dance was caught on camera . Career: He has been working at Coolidge Park for seven years, but officials removed him from his post after accusing him of neglecting his duties and 'unbecoming conduct' A visitor to the park did not see the funny side of his antics, complained, and posted the video online . The mother who recorded the footage, Melissa Parsons, told WTVC: 'As a parent and seeing all the parents that were covering their kids’ eyes and turning their heads away, it wasn't something that you would expect to see in Coolidge Park or anywhere from a grown man, especially a man in uniform.' His records show that he was disciplined for making an 'unwelcome comment' to an employee and hitting a car, but has never been flagged up for dancing. 'It's all about enjoying what you do and that's the way I feel,' he said. 'Clean fun. It's nothing like doing any bumping and grinding. People just have nothing else to do but bash people. No twerks, no jerking, no nothing.' He added that he dances in front of people to bring a smile to their face. Deeanna Demian, a park patron, said: 'Sad. I mean somebody's trying to have fun and entertain people and they get fired for doing that. I don't understand.' An online petition set up in a bid to reinstate the park ranger has already reached 1,000 signatures.

"He is only 32 years old but, like many men, Prince William is already suffering significant hair loss. Now a leading hair transplant surgeon has claimed Prince William will be almost completely bald by his 50th birthday. Asim Shahmalak, 53, has drawn up new graphics which show how the future King will look in just 28 years - without his crown. Scroll down for video . Surgeon Asim Shahmalak thinks William (left, now, aged 32) will look like the image on the right when he's 50 . The imagined difference between Harry now (left) and aged 50 (right) is startling . The odds are very much stacked against . the 32-year-old royal and his brother, Prince Harry, 29, as the Windsor . family has a history of baldness. Their grandfather, Prince Phillip, 93, father, Prince Charles, 65 and uncle, Prince Edward, 50 are all bald. They also have baldness on their mother’s side, Princess Diana’s father, the late Earl Spencer, had very thin hair. New superimposed images of the two Prince’s show how they could look in the next two decades, with shocking results. Like his father Prince Charles (right) William (left) is experiencing significant hair loss . William and Harry's grandfather, Prince Phillip, 93  and uncle, Prince Edward, 50 are all bald . But there is a solution according to Dr Shahmalak, who is a hair loss expert on the popular Channel 4 TV show, Embarrassing Bodies. The doctor, from Crown Clinic in Manchester said: 'There is a strong baldness gene in the royal family which has very obviously been passed down to Prince William. It is already affecting Prince Harry who is starting to show the first signs of thinning hair around his crown. 'The only long-term cure for baldness is a hair transplant. 'I fear that it is too late for Prince William, who has too large an area of baldness to cover. The two princes also have baldness on their mother's side, Princess Diana's father, the late Earl Spencer (right, with his daughter on her wedding day to Prince Charles), had very thin hair . 'But if his hair loss accelerates, Prince Harry would really benefit from a hair transplant. 'He could look 10 years younger with the right procedure.' Dr Shahmalak is famous for his work with celebrities and has carried out two hair transplants on Doctor Christian Jessen, star of Embarrassing Bodies, who said he was delighted with the work. Dr Jessen said: 'The new hair has really boosted my confidence. I find doing photo shoots much more bearable.' Celebrities like Wayne Rooney (left) and Robbie Williams have had hair transplants . Statistics show that 50 per cent of men have started shedding their locks by the time they reach 50 - and an even greater number have some strands of grey in their hair. Increasing numbers of men are turning to hair transplants to prevent baldness.

"By . James Slack . and Martin Robinson . David Cameron put the UK on a collision course with Europe today as he promised to fight a ruling forcing Britain to give prisoners the vote. The Prime Minister insisted the decision was one for MPs, not a 'foreign court', after human rights judges issued an ultimatum giving the Government six months to change the law. European judges rode roughshod over British sovereignty yesterday by ruling that prisoners must be allowed to vote. In a devastating blow, they rejected last year's overwhelming vote by MPs for maintaining our historic blanket ban on voting by convicts. The unelected judges instead gave David Cameron until the end of the year to obey their diktat or risk having to pay £150million in compensation to killers, rapists and other prisoners. The EU ruling will mean thousands of prisoners held in UK jails will get voting rights . But Mr Cameron told MPs this afternoon he backed their overwhelming democratic vote last year that opposed the European Court of Human Rights' ruling. At Prime Minister’s Questions, he said: 'I have always believed when you are sent to prison you lose certain rights and one of those rights is the right to vote. 'Crucially, I believe this should be a matter for Parliament to decide, not a foreign court. 'Parliament has made its decision and I completely agree with it.' Tory MPs said today it created an unprecedented clash between the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Westminster Parliament. They demanded that Mr Cameron – who once said the thought of prisoners voting made him feel 'physically ill' – should now 'take a stand for Britain's interests'. The battle risks sparking further demands for Britain to withdraw from the court, which has caused outrage with a string of controversial rulings on deporting foreign criminals and terror suspects. A leading constitutional expert said the issue at stake was whether the UK remained in control of its own destiny or took orders from a remote foreign court. Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, an ex-member of the Coalition's own human rights commission, said: 'The principal issue is not whether prisoners are allowed to vote but whether the rules are set by a directly elected parliament or a group of European judges.' The ECHR – whose judges do not even need to have any judicial experience in their homeland – first ruled in favour of John Hirst, a convicted axe killer demanding the right to vote, in 2004. The Coalition may be forced to give the vote to prisoners, despite David Cameron saying the prospect of doing so made him 'physically ill' Rubbing it in: Mr Hirst, pictured in a YouTube video in 2010, toasted his apparent victory in his human rights case 'with champagne and a joint' A string of appeals and legal cases followed before MPs voted by an overwhelming majority of 234 to 22 last February to defy the court and maintain the ban, which has existed for more than 100 years. Ministers hoped the strength of feeling would force Strasbourg to think again, and lodged a fresh appeal to the Euro court's Grand Chamber. Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, told the court that its judges should not be able to tell countries what to do on social questions. But yesterday the Grand Chamber upheld the original Hirst verdict. Officials are unaware of any further grounds for appeal. Ruling: The decision will be seen as a victory for the likes of John Hirst, the convicted axe killer who was released from jail in 2004 and has been campaigning for prisoners to get the vote . They now have six months to introduce legislation to give at least some prisoners the vote. The only consolation was that the Euro judges said it was up to the Government to decide how best to obey its orders. One option previously considered by officials, to give the vote to convicts serving less than four years, would allow almost 30,000 to take part in elections. Yesterday's judgment suggested that a time limit of three years may be acceptable. This would still mean granting the vote to tens of thousands of inmates, in clear defiance  of the express wishes of Parliament. Backbench Tory MPs, who led the Parliamentary revolt last year, attacked the ECHR's latest ruling and made it plain they will not give up the fight. Ex-shadow home secretary David Davis said: 'This regrettable decision is an infringement of the UK Parliament's right to decide on matters which are fundamental to the British way of life, and which are not appropriate to judicial intervention.' Dominic Raab, an MP and legal expert, said: 'Strasbourg is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land.' Tory MP Priti Patel said: 'The public will be demanding that the Prime Minister now stands up for British interests and refuses to give convicted prisoners the right to vote. 'Europe's out-of-touch judges have also blocked the Home Secretary from deporting Abu Qatada and allowed dangerous foreign criminals to remain in the UK. 'It is about time real changes are made to prevent them meddling in our laws again.' The ruling emerged a month after Justice Secretary Ken Clarke failed in his effort to secure major reform of Strasbourg and give Britain more control over its affairs . Trampled on: The sovereign power of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster has been called into question after the EU ruling . Dr Pinto-Duschinsky, now a legal expert at the Policy Exchange think tank, said: 'The judgment, while allowing some room for manoeuvre to the UK over the issue, still puts the Strasbourg court in direct conflict with the House of Commons which overwhelmingly voted earlier this year that prisoners should not be permitted to vote while they are incarcerated.' Labour will back David Cameron if he chooses to fight Europe on prisoners’ voting rights, shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said today. Mr Balls said there was cross-party agreement about not giving the vote to prisoners and the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) was the 'wrong thing.' 'I am all in favour of prisoners having the right kind of support and being rehabilitated but voting is one of the things I think you give up if you go to prison,' he told ITV Daybreak. He added: 'If David Cameron is going to go out there and fight this one, we will be supporting him on that.' Labour repeatedly stalled over the implementation of the 2004 ruling, knowing it would be deeply unpopular with voters. Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, said: 'The original decision back in 2004 was wrong, and that's why the Labour government didn't implement it, and we appealed again and again.' He added: 'On these kinds of issues, the European Court should give far more discretion to individual countries. This is an important reform that needs to be implemented.' 'Strasbourg is setting the scene for a major constitutional clash over who writes the laws of the land.' Dominic Raab MP . In 2010, David Cameron told MPs: 'It makes me physically ill to contemplate giving the vote to prisoners.' But he said the Government reluctantly accepted there was a legal obligation to offer voting rights at least to some prisoners, or face possible compensation claims running into millions of pounds. At least 2,500 inmates have already lodged claims. Yesterday's European court judgment related to a test case involving Italian Franco Scoppola, a convicted murderer who was demanding the right to vote. The UK was made a party to the case as it has Europe-wide implications. The killer lost on the grounds that, unlike Britain, Italy does not have a blanket ban. Last night a Downing Street spokesman said: 'This is a judgment affecting Italy, but clearly we need to consider the implications on the issue of prisoner voting for the UK. 'The position for the UK is that the Attorney General has argued that the issue of social policy, including prisoner voting, is a matter for Parliament and it is for Parliament to judge whether and which prisoners should have the vote.' In an earlier version of this article we described Mr John Hirst as an 'axe murderer'. He was convicted of manslaughter after killing a woman with an axe.","MP's brand Strasbourg ruling an 'infringement of Parliament's rights'

"By . Louise Boyle . Gurbaksh Chahal, the multimillionaire tech CEO accused of kicking and punching his girlfriend 117 times in a frenzied 30-minute attack, has contacted police to claim he is being harassed by an 'obsessed female fan'. The 31-year-old, who was recently fired as CEO from online ad network RadiumOne following a major public backlash to his domestic violence charges, filed a police report this month against South Carolina accountant Parveen Bining. On June 13, Chahal reported that he was still being harassed by Ms Bining to Spartanburg Police Department in South Carolina. In a brief report, he is described as a ‘public figure who lives in San Francisco, California and the suspect is a female fan who is obsessed with him’. Ms Bining, 28, has allegedly been contacting Chahal again after two years by sending unwanted emails to his sister, Kamal Chahal, and his close friend Laura Bae ‘in an attempt to interfere with his personal  and professional life’. Multi-millionaire tech entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal, pictured in 2012, was allegedly filmed hitting and kicking his then-partner 117 times over half an hour last year. He has now filed a police report against another woman claiming she is obsessed and harassing him . Parveen Bining, a 28-year-old accountant from Spartanburg, South Carolina, has been accused by Gurbaksh Chahal of stalking him online . Chahal, who previously sold an ad tech company to Yahoo! for $300 million, previously had his personal assistant call Spartanburg police in 2012 to report unwanted texts, emails and posts from Ms Bining. The 28-year-old accountant denied the harassment in an interview with The Smoking Gun and said she had exchanged messages with the tech tycoon when she contacted him via Facebook. She has not met him and no charges have been filed against her by police. Calls to Ms Bining by MailOnline went unanswered on Wednesday. Spartanburg police told MailOnline today that they were still investigating. Chahal's sacking in April came after news website TechCrunch dumped RadiumOne as a sponsor of the 'Disrupt NY' technology conference, calling Chahal a 'violent, angry man' who had not been held accountable for his actions. Chahal was charged with 45 felony counts for the brutal attack on his girlfriend in his San Francisco penthouse in 2013. He was freed on $1million bail. The beating was caught on surveillance cameras in his bedroom, however the evidence was ruled inadmissible in court because police obtained it without a warrant. The victim also stopped cooperating with prosecutors. Chahal then pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course. The RadiumOne board of directors terminated Chahal in April, saying in a statement that Chief Operating Officer Bill Lonergan will be taking over as CEO, according to Re/code. The decision followed an open letter that was posted online by Leena Rao, a senior editor at TechCrunch, who said Chahal's actions were unacceptable. 'You see, I am afraid that this world is at risk of being a place where people are known to sacrifice ethics, and values, and sometimes genuine human decency in exchange for making money,' Rao said in the letter, according to The Huffington Post. 'This scares me, as does the fact that a violent, angry man is being left to prosper without full responsibility and retribution for his crimes.' Chahal - pictured with President Obama - pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course after beating his girlfriend in 2013 . Under Chahal's command, RadiumOne is one of the most powerful online advertising platforms in the world and is expected to generate $100 million in revenue this year. It was set to sponsor the 'Hackathon' portion of the three-day Disrupt technology and startup conference taking place in New York City next week. But after social media erupted with outrage over Chahal's sentencing, it seems RadiumOne has been severely tarnished. But Chahal defended himself on his blog and did not deny beating his former girlfriend. He claimed that although his temper 'got the better' of him, 'there is a difference between temper and domestic violence'. He also said his temper was sparked by discovering his girlfriend 'was having unprotected sex for money with other people'. Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013. Chahal, is alleged to have horrifically assaulted his girlfriend - who cannot be identified - over a period of half an hour, while also repeatedly threatening to kill her. San Francisco police pulled security footage from Chahal's bedroom and used it to charge him with 45 felony crimes and two misdemeanors. Among the 45 counts were Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a firearm), which in this case is cited as a pillow. However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant. Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate. Eligible bachelor? Police were called to Chahal's penthouse after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013, which later saw him face 45 felony charges based on the CCTV footage taken by cameras in his bedroom . In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course. Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remained in his position at RadiumOne, as well as working as a motivational speaker and lecturer. He also continued to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels. These recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'. He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds. ‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports. 'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’ Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school. Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million. Four years later, he formed BlueLithium, which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet. He sold it to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash. Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago.

"By . Louise Boyle . Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson launched another tirade against the gay community this weekend but saved a few potshots for Democrats. The reality TV star and evangelical preacher got cheers from a crowd at Alabama's Rock the South music festival on Saturday during a Q&A session with his son Alan. Dressed his typical camouflage gear, he told fans that his homophobic remarks were really just part of his Christian duty. Scroll down for video . Phil Robertson (left) and his son Alan answer questions during a Q&A at Rock the South in Cullman, Alabama on Saturday. The Duck Dynasty patriarch told the crowd his anti-gay remarks were because he was 'trying to help those poor souls find Jesus' According to al.com, Robertson, 68, said: 'I'm actually a nice man. … I'm trying to help those poor souls and turn them to Jesus.' He also saved some scathing remarks for Democrats. 'Get your tail down and vote and lets vote this ungodly bunch out of Washington,' he said at the end of his speech, as the crowd went wild, the Cullman Times reported. Robertson's remarks were relatively tame compared to previous public outbursts. In his now infamous interview with GQ in December, Robertson said: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina — as a man — would be more desirable than a man's anus; that's just me. I mean, come on, dudes! ... It's just not logical.' He also likened homosexuality to bestiality. 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.' In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview . Despite A&E briefly dropping Phil Robertson from the show after the scandal in December, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views. Robertson appeared at the Alabama festival alongside music acts Sarah Evans and Lynard Skynard. Even as the show has slumped in ratings nationally after Phil Robertson's anti-gay comments, the wealthy family behind the Duck Commander brand of game calls has remained influential.","The reality TV star and evangelical preacher got cheers from a crowd at Alabama's Rock the South music festival on Saturday .

"By . Corey Charlton . The prestigious bravery medals won by a Second Word War airman responsible for conducting the first daylight bombing raid - during Luftwaffe commander Hermann Goering's Nazi Party speech - are to be sold for £50,000. Air Commodore Ted ‘Daisy’ Sismore was the RAF’s greatest low-level navigator and his precise sense of direction made him invaluable during some of the most daring raids of the Second World War. He became a RAF hero for a 1943 mission in which he conducted the first ever daylight raid on Berlin. The mission was timed to disrupt the January 31 speech Luftwaffe commander in chief Hermann Goering was giving in celebration of the 10 year anniversary of Hitler's regime. Air Commodore Ted 'Daisy' Sismore was awarded a host of medals for his Second World War bombing raids . Ted 'Daisy' Sismore (left) and Squadron Leader Reggie Reynolds (right) pictured before a May 1943 raid. The two formed one of the most devastating partnerships of the war using newly developed 'Mosquito planes' Politician and Luftwaffe commander in chief Hermann Goering's speech was disrupted and forced off the airwaves in a daring RAF raid by Air Cdre Sismore, in what was considered a decisive blow to Nazi propaganda . Air Cdre Sismore's collection of medals includes the Distinguished Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Force Cross, Africa Star, Defence Star, and the Danish Order of the Dannebrog breast badge . The mission was deemed a success when the squadron unleashed their payload across Berlin at exactly 11am, disrupting Goering's speech and silencing the Nazi propaganda machine. On their return from the famous raid on the Berlin rally, the squadron was played a recording of the beginning of the German broadcast before the raid forced Goering off air. For this feat, Air Cdre Sismore became known as the man who left Goering speechless. Air Cdre Sismore started his RAF career in 1941 as a reservist airman but the following year was given an emergency commission and joined 105 Squadron as a navigator on the new Mosquito planes. With his talent immediately recognised he was paired with Squadron Leader Reggie Reynolds, beginning one of the most devastating partnerships of the war. Hermann Goering was a leading member of Hitler's Nazi party and the commander in chief of the German Luftwaffe airforce. A respected First World War fighter pilot himself, he became the second-in-command to Hitler during the early stages of the war. While his German airforce was extremely . successful in the early stages of the war, the Battle of Britain turned . the tide and Goering fell out of favour with Hitler. He was also one of the highest ranked Nazi official to be tried and convicted of crimes against humanity at the post-war Nuremberg Trials held in Germany from 1945 - 46. He was found guilty of four charges relating to war crimes and sentenced to be hanged. His requests to be shot like a soldier were denied, and he ultimately evaded his punishment by swallowing a cyanide capsule the night before he was due to be hanged. Air Cdre Sismore was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry, the first of a host of medals he would collect during active service. A few months after silencing Goering, Air Cdre Sismore and Sqn Ldr Reynolds led eight Mosquitoes in the deepest ever low-level daylight attack on Germany. The targets were the Carl Zeiss optical factory and Schott glassworks near Leipzig but before they could get close they were hit by heavy flak. The daring pair were hit but pressed on with the mission, later safely returning to Britain where Air Cdre Sismore was awarded the Distinguished Flying Order. In 1944 he was awarded his second DFC in recognition of a raid on the Gestapo headquarters at Aarhus, and a third on Gestapo HQs in Copenhagen and Odense, Denmark. His medal set also includes the Air Force Cross, the 1939-1945 Star, the Air Crew Europe Star, the Africa Star, the Defence and War medals, the General Service clasp,  the Air Efficiency Award and Danish Order of Dannebrog, Degree of Knight. The set is expected to fetch £50,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Spink. Following the war Air Cdre Sismore remained with the RAF, qualifying as a fighter pilot. In 1947 Air Cdre Sismore and former Dambuster pilot Mick Martin broke the London to Cape Town flying record, covering the 6,717 miles in 21 hours and 31 minutes. On 4 January 1971 on promotion to Air Commodore, Sismore was appointed as Commandant of the Royal Observer Corps. His final post was as the Director of the Air Defence Team, planning a new UK air defence environment system. Air Cdre Sismore pictured in his later years meeting the Queen. After a long and successful career in the RAF, he died in 2012 at the age of 90, in Chelmsford, Essex, and is survived by his son and daughter . Air Cdre Sismore pictured top right with Group Captain Robert Bateson (left foreground) and Air Vice Marshall Basil Embrey (bottom right) in Copenhagen, Denmark, following a successful bombing of a Gestapo HQ . Air Cdre Sismore retired from the Royal Air Force on 23 June 1976 and became an advisor to telecommunications firm the Marconi Company. He died on March 22, 2012, aged 90, in Chelmsford, Essex. Mark Quayle, an expert in medals at Spink, said: “Daisy Sismore was awarded 11 medals and four of these were gallantry awards. 'Visually it is a spectacular group to look at but also the story behind the medals is fairly extraordinary. 'Sismore is recognised as the RAF’s best war time low level navigator. He was flying in Mosquitoes and making attacks on specific targets as low as 50ft. 'The raids executed by Air Commodore Sismore speak for themselves. They were some of the most famous raids of World War Two and are illustrative of the precision required to plan and execute them. 'Sismore was responsible not for blanket bombing but for precise targeting with pinpoint accuracy at low levels. They weren’t called ""Mosquito daylight spectaculars"" for nothing. 'His disruption of Goering’s national speech was a real score for the allies.' The auction will take place on July 24.","Revered Air Commodore Ted 'Daisy' Sismore's war medals up for sale .

"By . Corey Charlton . Campaign groups are furious about a 'sexist' cartoon posted on a police Twitter account which shows a man gagging his wife with a seatbelt. The tweet, which shows a female car passenger gagged and bound to her chair as a male driver looks on smugly, was yesterday uploaded by a police officer. Above the cartoon a banner read: 'New Seatbelt design: 45% less car accidents!!' It was also captioned by the officer: 'A car designer has won an award for designing a seatbelt which helps to cut down on vehicle noise pollution #IWantOne.' The officer who tweeted the 'sexist' cartoon is now being investigated by the force's Professional Standards Department after it was found to have been in breach of the organisation's social media policy . West Midlands Police has now released a full statement apologising for 'any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts'. The officer in question is also being investigated by the force’s Professional Standards Department. The incident provoked a barrage of complaints on the social networking site, with criticism from people based all over the UK and as far as Johannesburg in South Africa. Chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, Sandra Horley CBE, criticised the force’s 'derogatory attitudes to women'. 'I am disappointed that West Midlands Police tweeted this sexist image - and then tried to pass it off as a bit of ""humour"". 'Did the police officer who tweeted this image really think that women would laugh at this offensive sexist stereotype? Female members of the public deserve respect, not ridicule. 'It is deeply disturbing that some police officers in West Midlands seem to possess such derogatory attitudes towards women.' Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham’s Ladywood constituency, added: 'The police are responsible for helping to hold to account those who perpetrate domestic violence. 'The fact that they have posted online a so-called joke which minimises the seriousness of this crime is both insulting and worrying. 'If individuals within the police force don’t understand that it is not a laughing matter and ensure that they take domestic violence seriously then who will?' Online campaign group End Misogyny confirmed the post will be appearing on its weekly updates of online sexist abuse. A spokesperson said: 'We see high volumes of misogyny and abuse here at End Online Misogyny and very often such comments, many of which promote domestic and sexual violence, are made under the guise of so-called humour. Bordesley Green police received a furious backlash on Twitter after the officer posted the cartoon - which was in clear breach of the force's social media policy . Inspector Karen Winfield, based at the nearby Stechford police station (pictured), said the cartoon which depicted the passenger in the car being gagged, was 'sexist and offensive' and in breach of police policy . 'It is however, extremely worrying to see a police account with nearly 1,000 followers... tweet out such an endorsement of violence against women.' Inspector Karen Winfield, from Birmingham Police, said: 'An officer working on one of our neighbourhood accounts has tweeted a sexist and offensive picture which clearly breaches the force’s social media policy. 'This was an inappropriate tweet, made by one member of staff, and it in no way reflects the views of the force. 'Social media can be an excellent way of communicating with local people and we trust our staff to tweet appropriately and sensibly, actively encouraging them to be engaging and friendly in their posts. 'However, occasionally mistakes are made and we apologise for any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts.'","Police officer tweets cartoon showing woman being gagged with seatbelt .

"By . Corey Charlton . A man with one eye is locked in a battle with Specsavers over its 'discriminatory' insistence on charging him the same fee as people who need two eyes checked. Mr Rainsford, who now has a glass eye, lost his right eye when he was 14 after being shot by a fellow pupil with an airgun at Newcastle’s Heaton Manor Comprehensive. David Rainsford now believes his fees should be slashed as it is unfair he is being charged the same rate as customers with two eyes. Sight problems: One eyed David Rainsford disputes Specsaver's decision to charge him the same optician fees as people who require two eyes to be checked, saying the same rate is 'discriminatory' The 44-year-old from Cramlington is locked in a battle with his optician to get the price reduced. 'It is discriminatory really how they charge the same for one eye as two,' said the father-of-two. Mr Rainsford, who is an operations manager for Scott Sports, decided when he was due a test he would broach the subject of paying half. The Cramlington Specsavers customer said: 'I have to look after the eye I have left, it is a very personal thing to me and important for the health of my eye that I have it checked properly.' After approaching head office to see if they would consider a policy change. He said: 'You cannot get a disease in a . glass eye, there is nothing they are willing to consider. Back in the . 90s when I lived in Manchester I got consent from Vision Express for . this discount. He was told to contact his store, but Mr Rainsford, who lives with wife Helen, was told it was the same price to test one eye as it is for two. 'It is a simple request and it is a very successful business.' Dr Nigel .

Specsavers claims eye tests can take anywhere between 15 minutes to one hour to complete . Dr Best added: 'A typical sight test . will include an examination of the surrounding area as well as the eye . itself. Without proper care, prostheses can result in eyelid irritation . which would require a referral to an appropriate specialist. 'In . patients who have been fitted with a prosthetic eye following a . condition that caused a removal, there is a risk that the condition can . often pose a continuing risk to the remaining eye, making regular, . thorough examinations important.

"By . Corey Charlton . It is a beach litter cleanup even the kids could enjoy. Lego is continuing to wash up on the shores of Cornwall beaches 17 years after a container ship was struck by a freak wave and close to five million pieces were lost overboard. The Tokio Express was en-route from Rotterdam to New York on February 13, 1997, when a wild wave struck it 20 miles west of Land's End, tilting it back and forth at such a sharp degree it lost 62 containers. A collection of the tiny bits and pieces found scattered along the coast. There were almost five million pieces of Lego inside the container when it was lost overboard in the 1997 accident . Many of the Lego items that were lost overboard in the freak storm were sea-themed and some of the pieces most commonly found on local beaches are cutlasses, octopuses, scuba tanks and diving flippers . A Lego cutlass (left) and red poppies (right) which washed up on the beaches. Collectors have questioned just how far items could have travelled in the 17 years since the Tokio Express was caught in the storm . One of those lost containers held about five million pieces of Lego - a small and light enough object to be easily carried by ocean currents. And in an odd coincidence, a large proportion of the Lego pieces were sea-themed, so cutlasses, octopuses, scubas and flippers have been routinely washing up on Cornish beaches ever since. The ship's manifest revealed 4,756,940 pieces fell into the sea including 3,178,807 light enough to float. However, nobody has ever established what happened to the remaining containers. Spear guns (red and yellow) - 13,000 . Black octopus - 4,200 . Yellow life preserver - 26,600 . Diver flippers (in pairs, black, blue, red) - 418,000 . Dragons (black and green) - 33,941 . Brown ship rigging net - 26,400 . Daisy flowers (in fours - white, red, yellow) - 353,264 . Scuba and breathing apparatus (grey) - 97,500 . Tracey Williams, from Newquay, said: 'There's stories of kids in the late 1990s having buckets of dragons on the beach, selling them. 'These days the holy grail is an octopus or a dragon. I only know of three octopuses being found, and one was by me, in a cave in Challaborough. 'It's quite competitive. If you heard that your neighbour had found a green dragon, you'd want to go out and find one yourself.' US oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer has tracked the story of the Lego since it was spilled. He says reports of it reaching as far as Australia are not too far fetched as theoretically it could have reached any beach in the world by now. He said: 'The mystery is where they've ended up. After 17 years they've only been definitely reported off the coast of Cornwall. 'The most profound lesson I've learned from the Lego story is that things that go to the bottom of the sea don't always stay there.' The beach of Perranporth, in Cornwall, where thousands of the pieces of Lego have washed ashore . Dragons have become a rare find on the beaches nowadays, and as a result are highly sought after by locals . Finding an octopus on the beaches of Cornwall is now considered the 'holy grail' for local Lego hunters, who have spent years in the area searching for the tiny bits of plastic lost overboard in 1997 . An environmental campaigners say the legacy of the lost Lego illustrates how marine waste and litter floats around for years, posing a risk to wildlife and polluting our seas. Latest figures show an average of 2,683 containers are lost at sea every year. Martin Dorey, organiser of the 2 Minute Beach Clean group, which encourages people to pick up litter on beaches, said: 'I know it's not their fault, it's the way the ships are stacked. 'But while container spills are all resolved from the insurance point of view, it's not resolved from the marine point of view.'","Ship en-route to New York was hit by freak wave with 62 containers lost .

"By . Corey Charlton . Pippa Middleton and her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson are apparently eyeing up a new £3million home in Parsons Green, west London. It was reported last month the two have been on the hunt to find a new home together and it's believed they have now finally found their dream home. The home features six double bedrooms and a nanny quarters - adding fuel to rumours the couple of two years are planning for a child. Pippa Middleton and Nico Jackson have been together two years and are reportedly keen to start a family . Parson's Green has a lively village feel and is home to many professionals and young families . Parsons Green is an area popular with young families and professionals, with house sales reaching £3million . The area takes its name after its popular village green which is popular with dog walkers . The White Horse is a favourite of locals and is known as the 'Sloaney Pony' due to its posh customers . The Sunday Mirror reported the 1900s Victorian-style property features six double bedrooms and a luxury cinema suite alongside the nanny quarters. A source told the paper: 'The separate living accommodation for childcare is particularly appealing for them which could signal they think starting a family isn't too far off.' 'A little cousin for Prince George might not be out of the question after they set up home.' Parson's Green is an upmarket suburb located within the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. The area features a host of ritzy bars, restaurants and is known to be frequently by the Made in Chelsea stars. The local green after which it takes its name is extremely family friendly and is known for being particularly accommodating to dog walkers. It boasts a number of upmarket bars, restaurants and chain shops including as Little Waitrose, Space NK and Cote Brasserie. Historically it was an aristocratic suburb and features many Georgian and Victorian properties - such as the one Miss Middleton and Mr Jackson have their eye on. It is part of the Fulham area which is very much an up and coming location for young families and professionals, with properties going for anything from £300,000 for a tiny one bedroom flat to £3m for large, historic mansions. Miss Middleton currently lives with her brother James, 27, at a property owned by their parents Carole and Michael. Mr Jackson, who has been dating Miss Middleton for nearly two years, recently quit his job at Deutsche Bank to take on a new role at a multi-billion pound hedge fund in Geneva. The long distance aspect of the relationship doesn't appear to be a barrier to their search for a home together, with the couple's house hunting restricted to west London. The move comes amid growing speculation that he and Miss Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge's 30-year-old sister, are about to tie the knot. In March the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps. And the happy couple recently attended the men's Wimbledon final alongside Miss Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael. The two also live active lives apart - Pippa and her brother James recently completed a cycling race across America with four other men. They were participating in the Race Across America with the aim of crossing 12 states to raise money for charity, and cycled through California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland.","Pippa Middleton and her partner have their hearts set on west London home .

"By . Corey Charlton . A former teen tearaway with more than 50 convictions for violent crime has been crowned the country’s top student after miraculously turning her life around. Natalie Atkinson, 25, did six stints in secure children’s homes and seven terms in prison during a chaotic eight-year spell which saw her locked-up with rapists, murderers and drug-dealers. But in a remarkable tale of redemption she has now gained a degree in Criminology with first class honours and is preparing to start her Masters at the London School of Economics. She first . got into trouble aged 12, quit school in year nine and fell out with her . family, leading her into a life of foster care, self-harm and alcohol . dependency. 'I . was out of control. I was drinking all the time and fighting. I had a . lot of built up anger, a lot of upset. I started falling out with my . family and I ended up in the care system. Natalie Atkinson proudly gained first class honours for her Criminology dissertation, despite teenage years being spent in a life of crime and violence which started at the age of 12 . 'After a few years I got sick of finding myself in the same situation and decided things need to change. 'I had a lot of supportive people around me and class myself as lucky. Not everyone has that support.' Natalie had many run-ins with the police and earned more than 50 criminal convictions, mostly for assault and battery. After landing a job with a housing association aged 21, she then made the most of her troubled past by taking up a degree in Policing, Investigation and Criminology at the University of Cumbria. Amazingly, despite leaving school a decade earlier she gained first-class honours, scoring 95 per cent in her dissertation. The brainy student is now set to take on a Master’s degree in Criminology at the London School of Economics (LSE), one of the world’s best universities. Ms Atkinson, from Lancaster, is now an activist for troubled teens and recently presented BBC3 documentary Banged Up and Left to Fail. Ms Atkinson's academic success has capped off a remarkable turnaround in her life and she now believes 'anything is achievable' The show highlights the plight of youngsters going through the criminal justice system and their lack of prospects. On . July 11, the inspirational graduate was crowned the National Union of . Students (NUS) Endsleigh Student of the Year during a ceremony at . Bolton’s Macron Football Stadium. She said: 'It’s amazing and to be honest I am still in shock. 'I have gone from being a prolific offender living a chaotic lifestyle to living a settled and happy life, so if I can do it then anyone can. 'Looking back, if someone had said to me a few years ago that in 2014 you will be graduating with a first class honours degree, moving to London to commence a Master’s degree and looking forward to a successful career, I would have laughed, but this is my life. 'If you set your mind to it anything is achievable, but it is up to you to make the changes that need to be made. 'All you need to do is take little steps to begin with and you will see things changing. Everyone will have a different path to desistance, you just need to find yours.' The BBC documentary Banged Up and Left To Fail sees Natalie attempt to tackle Britain’s re-offending problem. In the hour-long programme she meets jailed young offenders while also liaising with  MP Jeremy Wright, Minister for Prisons. Natalie added: 'Returning to education was one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome. 'When I first started University I was so nervous that I would not fit in, as I thought everyone would know I am an ex-offender and that I would not be able to do the work.' University of Cumbria Student Union Chief Executive Daryl Ormerod commented: 'Natalie’s story is compelling, and her ongoing commitment to developing herself so that she may in turn help others as she has been helped, is simply inspiring. 'We are proud to have her amongst our membership, and wish her well for what I am sure will be a highly successful future.'","Self-confessed 'prolific offender' Natalie Atkinson, 25, did seven jail terms during chaotic eight years in which she racked up more than 50 convictions .

"By . Corey Charlton . An ancient Japanese shrine dedicated to the curing of haemorrhoids, where people wash their bottoms in holy river water, has seen a resurgence in popularity. The unusual ritual is growing in popularity as more people in Japan are said to be suffering from the condition. According to Japanese tradition, anybody who heads to the shrine in Japan's Tochigi Prefecture simply needs to wash their naked bottom in a local river, point it in the direction of the 'holy egg' and then eat boiled eggs at the nearby temple to find themselves cured. It also welcomes people who do not have haemorrhoids at all, on the premise that if they also carry out the ritual, they will never suffer from the problem later in life. Temple priest Osamu Hayakawa pictured demonstrating the ritual of pointing the bottom at the 'holy egg', which is a part of a sacred process at the temple which he claims will cure visitors of haemorrhoids . A visitor completes the 'holy egg' ritual, which follows a special prayer and a bathing service in a local river . Its recent popularity is thought to be due to an increasing number of people suffering from haemorrhoids . The temple fell into disrepair in the 1980s but more recently after a resurgence in the number of people suffering from haemorrhoids, it has been refurbished and reopened and now has experienced a boom in popularity. Temple priest Osamu Hayakawa said: 'In the modern world in which we live, it is not acceptable for people to be showing off their rear ends whilst public bathing in an open river but we believe that it is fine if the essence of the ritual is still maintained. 'We perform a short service and afterwards individuals come and have to point their rear end at the holy egg and say a special player. 'The devout will find that the trip to the Karube Shrine will have the desired effect.' There is even a special holy day, known as the Kisai Festival, staged annually at the Kunigami Shrine, when visitors turn up in the hope of receiving a cure for the painful condition. It is like many other ceremonies at Japanese temples apart from the fact that there are no benches or even cushions because most of the faithful as haemorrhoid sufferers would prefer to stand.","According to Japanese tradition, anybody who visits the shrine and completes the unusual ritual will be cured of the ailment .

"By . Corey Charlton . Holyoak arrived for her sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court today wearing headphones . A middle-aged reggae lover who blasted her music louder than a nearby motorway has narrowly avoided jail. Chrissie Holyoak, 54, made her neighbours’ lives a living hell by blaring James Brown, Barry White and reggae music through speakers at her home in Buckhurst Hill, Essex. The former bus driver - who describes music as her ‘therapy’ and wore headphones to court - was handed a 10-week suspended prison sentence when she appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court today. She had faced up to five years in prison for the offence. Holyoak was slapped with an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) last July after annoying her neighbours with her loud music. A . jury took just 27 minutes to find her guilty of six breaches of the . ASBO in June this year following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. The . trial had heard Holyoak blasted out a selection of reggae tunes, as . well as Barry White and James Brown, on speakers throughout the day and . night. An . environmental health officer for Epping Council said the music could be . clearly heard over the sound of the neighbouring M11 motorway. Recorder Timothy Ashe QC said there was a 'complete failure' to obey the law. 'Your behaviour has been quite extraordinary. 'The element that makes this very serious is the total flouting of noise abatement notices and anti-social behaviour orders. 'You have narrowly got away with prison. 'I do warn you that you will end up in prison if you continue to do this.' Holyoak came to court today wearing a large pair of red and black iDance headphones and only removed them once in the dock for sentencing. Recorder Ashe QC sentenced her to 10-weeks imprisonment, suspended for one year, and ordered her to pay £180 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Speaking outside of court, she said: 'I can’t believe I’m 54 and I’m looking at going away for playing music. 'Music is my therapy. It’s what I eat, it’s what I breathe. 'I don’t do drugs, I don’t drink - that is why I have music. 'I’ve . stuck to what they told me and used my headphones 24 hours a day.

"By . Corey Charlton . A scientist discovered a new species of wasp less than a millimetre long living in a tree in his son’s school playground. Dr Andrew Polaszek, an insect expert at London’s Natural History Museum, found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree. He said: ‘I noticed some of the whiteflies looked slightly different to the others so I took them to the laboratory. When I saw the wasp inside I knew it looked different to anything I’d seen before.’ Dr Andrew Polaszek, an insect expert at London's Natural History Museum, found this Encarsia harrisoni wasp living in a tree in his son's school playground . The 54-year-old found the wasp inside whiteflies on a maple tree five years ago - but tests to establish the wasp as a new species have only just been completed . Dr Polaszek, 54, made the discovery five years ago at Sevenoaks Primary School in Kent, where his son Timothy was a pupil. But rigorous tests to establish the wasp as a new species – named Encarsia harrisoni – have only just been completed. The wasp, which Dr Polaszek named after fellow Sevenoaks scientist Dr David Harrison, is a parasitoid, meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects. The wasp is a parasitoid, meaning it lays its eggs inside other insects. An official description of the wasp was published last week . He added: 'When I saw the wasp inside I knew it looked different to anything I'd seen before but I thought it might be a species from Northern Europe that had come over to the UK. I was really surprised when I realised it was native to the UK and was previously unknown. 'Finding an undiscovered insect in the rainforests of Borneo is relatively easy but the fauna of England is some of the most studied in the world so to find something new here is a real thrill, and makes it even closer to my heart. 'And you never get over that thrill of peering down a microscope and realising what you're looking at is something new.' Initial DNA testing showed the insect to be unknown anywhere on earth, but rigorous research and testing had to take place. The wasp had to be checked against other similar creatures and a detailed scientific description written before it could be confirmed. The official description of the Encarsia harrisoni, which the species is now called, was officially published last week in the Entomologists' Monthly magazine. Scroll down for video . Sevenoaks Primary School, Kent, where the new species of wasp was discovered by Dr Andrew Polaszek . During five years of regular collecting, no males have ever been found, which suggests it could be a uniparental species. Dr Harrison is chairman of trustees at the Harrison Institute which promotes taxonomic research to support biodiversity studies and conservation. Dr Andrew Polaszek is a leading scientist who works at the London Natural History Museum . But 88-year-old Dr Harrison, who has been studying mammals since he was nine, is no stranger to seeing his name associated with scientific breakthroughs. He said: 'I now have a flea, a bug, a sand cat and a wasp named after me, which is obviously quite an honour. Dr Polaszek's wasp is a particularly interesting one - it was found right here in Sevenoaks just a few hundred yards from my home. 'People have been studying the fauna of Britain for more than two centuries and these things don't tend to happen very often. It shows how remarkable the environment can be you can find something so remarkable in the most ordinary place.' Dr Polaszkek confesses even though he's travelled the world looking for insects he rarely walks past a plant - even in the UK - without studying it for insects. He added: 'It sounds strange but it's what I do. I'm always looking at plants and the insects on them. 'I work with some of the smallest insects on Earth, sometimes as small as a fraction of a millimetre long, so I'm used to looking for miniscule things most people wouldn't even notice.'","Leading scientist discovers a new UK native species of wasp in Kent .

"By . David Mccormack . The World Cup may be over but you haven’t seen the last of goalkeeper Tim Howard, the undisputed breakout star for the United States at the soccer tournament in Brazil. Howard’s heroics as the U.S. made it through to the round of 16 earned him a legion of new fans and he’s currently advertising hot property as big brands fall over themselves in order to sign him up for endorsement deals. The goalkeeper, who plays for English Premier League team Everton, has his tattooed torso and rugged good looks on display on the cover of the latest edition of Adweek. The goalkeeper, who's tattooed torso and rugged good looks are on display on the cover of the latest edition of Adweek, is close to signing big money deals with at least three national advertisers . Howard’s gutsy performances in the tournament, especially against Belgium on July 1 when he made a record 16 saves, earned him ringing endorsements from everyone from Tom Hanks to President Obama. His twitter account @TimHowardGK gained nearly half a million new followers and with his popularity at all all-time high, he is set to cash in on his newfound celebrity and break into the endorsement big league. ‘People’s perception of me may have changed in the past two weeks, but I haven’t changed a bit,’ Howard told Adweek. He already has six-figure deals with Nike and McDonald’s, although those are small fry compared to what someone like LeBron James makes in the world of big-time sponsorship deals. Blocked: The United States goalkeeper set a new record for most saves in a World Cup game . Howard added that he’s seeking the same kinds of deals as always: ‘blue-chip opportunities [with] really good companies with good reputations.’ His agent Dan Segal of Wasserman Media Group, said he has received dozens of offers in the past two weeks, and that they're close to signing deals with at least three national advertisers. ‘We’re looking for things consistent with his image', which is down-to-earth and hardworking, rather than flashy or glitzy Segal says. ‘We don’t feel in any way, shape or form a desperation to try and grab everything that comes along.’ Howard's popularity during the World Cup led to a White House petition being lodged requesting that Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport be renamed after him. His eye-catching display for the United States against Belgium sparked a string of photoshopped images of the goalkeeper saving the day in various iconic images from American history. Howard's popularity during the World Cup led to a White House petition being lodged requesting that Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport be renamed after him . Saves the day: A number of photoshopped images of Howard have emerged including this one of him stopping Luis Suarez from biting Giorgio Chiellini . Howard's Wikipedia page was also edited to show the goalkeeper as the United States' Minister of Defence. But now things have gone one step further thanks to the petition being lodged on the 'We the people' website. The request reads: 'Tim Howard has shown himself to be a national treasure, Minister of Defense, Friend of Joe Biden, and the holder for the record of most saves in a World Cup match; Therefore, we politely request that we rename the airport to recognize his accomplishments, and meritorious service to the United States of America. If a petition receives 100,000 signatures the White House administration will formally respond to the request. However, Howard will have to call upon all of his new supporters if he is going to have an airport named in his honour. Less than 2,000 people have currently signed the petition, meaning he needs another 98,000 by July 31.","Tim Howard was the undisputed breakout star for the United States at the soccer tournament in Brazil .

"By . Corey Charlton . New mother Mulan pictured nuturing her red panda baby twins at their enclosure at Drusillas Park . Two rare red pandas native to the Himalayan mountains have been born at a British zoo. The twins, a boy and a girl, were born at Drusillas Park in Alfriston, East Sussex, and were discovered by head keeper Mark Kenward during his early morning rounds. Female red pandas are only fertile for just one day a year and can delay implantation until conditions are favourable, a zoo spokeswoman said. They give birth to between one and four young at a time and the cubs are born with pale fluffy fur. This darkens to the distinctive red colouration of the adults over the first three months, she said. Mr Kenward said: 'I entered the panda enclosure and was immediately met by Tibao, our male panda. 'Unable to see our female, Mulan, I called to her. She appeared from one of the nest boxes shortly after carrying a baby gently in her mouth. 'She brought the cub over, as if to show me, before returning to the box. I can't explain how happy I was.' The keepers have been keeping a close eye on the new arrivals. At nearly a month old, the pandas are gaining between seven and 20g a day and have just started to open their eyes. They will be looked after in the nest box by their mother for a while yet but will soon be venturing out to explore their surroundings, the spokeswoman said. Red pandas are a relatively new addition to the zoo following their introduction in April 2013. Tibao and Mulan were paired as part of the European breeding programme arriving from Asson Zoo, France, and Paignton Zoo in Devon. The creatures normally inhabit the Himalayan mountains of China, India and Nepal, where they are threatened by habitat destruction and hunting. There are now believed to be as few as 10,000 adults left in the wild, the spokeswoman said. Mr Kenward added: 'I am so proud of Mulan. She is a natural mum and has not put a foot wrong. It is as if she has grown up overnight. 'Tibao has less to do with the babies but he seems to have an extra spring in his step and has definitely grown in confidence.'","Zookeeper surprised to discover red panda nuturing baby twins during his early morning rounds at Drusillas Park in Alfriston, East Sussex .

"By . David Mccormack . Lawyers for two women accused of pummeling and kicking a 23-year-old woman who died after a fight outside a California nightclub have claimed that the dead woman was threw the first punch and their clients were acting in self-defense. Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, have pleaded not guilty in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in the early morning hours of Jan. 18. The case drew enormous attention after Pham’s death, in part because the brawl that was captured by several bystanders on cellphone video that will provide key evidence in the case. Scroll down for video . Candace Brito, left, and Vanesa Zavala, right, have pleaded not guilty in the death of Annie Hung Kim Pham, who was taken off life support after the fight outside the Santa Ana bar-restaurant in January . The women’s trial began on Wednesday and defense attorneys say Pham threw the first punch and their clients were acting in self-defense. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in state prison. During opening arguments, Brito’s attorney, Michael Molfetta, told jurors that it was Pham’s own ‘poor decisions’ that led to her death. ‘She didn’t deserve to die, but the fact is she died because she took umbrage over a bump,’ Molfetta said. Pham, who went by the first name Kim, graduated from Chapman University last year and would have celebrated her first wedding anniversary last month . Zavala’s attorney also said his client had been wrongly charged with murder and that she had a right to defend herself after being attacked by Pham. Video of a brawl outside a Santa Ana nightclub that left a recent college graduate comatose was played repeatedly Wednesday . Kenneth Reed also predicted that jurors will ultimately be unable to determine which blow actually killed Pham during the chaotic scene outside the nightclub. “She can’t tell you if it was one blow at the beginning, one blow that happened at the end or one blow that happened in the middle,” Reed said of the medical examiner’s expected testimony. Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Troy Pino, though, said the two women deserve to be punished for Pham’s death. A video was played at the start of the trial of Candace Brito and Vanesa Zavala on Wednesday morning which showed the jury cellphone footage of the melee . Pham's friends told police the three women in the other group attacked Pham without provocation after they bumped into her . Pino said that at one point Zavala, who was pushed away from the fight, returns to the scrum and deals a final blow to Pham before Pham fell to the pavement unconscious. ‘Let the criminal system do its job and find justice for the victim,’ Pino said. During a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the forensic pathologist who conducted Pham's autopsy ruled the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head. But she testified that it was impossible to tell whether one specific blow caused the fatal brain bleeding and swelling, or if it came from all the blows in combination. Just who started the fight was in dispute during the hearing, with various witnesses describing different scenarios. Pham was an aspiring writer whose work was published online and in an anthology of works by Vietnamese-American writers . Pham and her group of 11 friends were waiting in line to get into the club as Brito, Zavala, a woman identified as ‘Amelia’ and two men were exiting. At some point, the groups bumped into each other.

'Make no mistake today,' Sterling shouted toward the end of his second day of testimony in the trial to determine his wife's right to make a $2 billion deal to sell the Clippers, 'I will never, ever sell this team, and until I die I will be suing the NBA for this terrible violation under antitrust.'

'Get away from me, you pig!' Sterling shouted. The judge then admonished him to make no further comments. Sterling began his testimony by saying he loved his wife, but then denounced her.

'I never thought a wife wouldn't stand for her husband.'

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling accused his wife Shelly of  deceiving him. 'I never thought a wife wouldn't stand for her husband,' he said . Before she made the deal, two doctors examined Donald Sterling and declared him mentally incapacitated and unable to act as an administrator of the Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers. Sterling said he was certain his wife had never read the trust documents because it was too complicated for her to understand. During examination by his own lawyer, Maxwell Blecher, Sterling was asked about his wife's position in the trust if he were to be disqualified as a trustee. 'She has no rights whatsoever. She has no stock. She has no standing whatsoever,' Sterling said. He also lashed out at the NBA, saying: 'My wife was terrified. She's frightened to death. She thinks the NBA will take away everything she worked for. She was scared out of her mind.' After seeing him in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Shelly Sterling said she became frightened at her husband's personality change and thought he might have had a stroke .

"By . James  Nye . With hundreds of proudly displayed taxidermed beasts adorning the walls this may look like the homestead ranch of a Montana hunter - but in fact it is the two bedroom Manhattan home of a New York socialite he has dubbed the 'Animal House'. Regardless of its very urban location and erudite curator, Gregory Speck's collection is quite possibly one of the largest in the world and is valued at upwards of $1 million. Indeed, 61-year-old Speck is willing to listen to offers for his impressive troupe which stands at 500 strong now that he is selling his luxury $3.4 million apartment which overlooks Central Park. However, that has provided his realtor with a slight headache as they try to find a buyer for the apartment willing to take on the fixed taxidermed models. Impressive: Writer Gregory Speck sits in the living room of his luxury Manhattan apartment surrounded by some of the 500 pieces of taxidermy that he owns . In fact the apartment is so dominated by the stuffed animals that the realtor has produced a specially created online listing that shows two sets of photos. One shows the apartment as it currently is with the taxidermy, while the other has edited the animals out, 'so prospective buyers can get a sense of the grandeur of the apartment.' Robert Dowling of Halstead Property said, 'It’s a fantastic opportunity to buy a home at the Beresford, an iconic New York City landmark, one of the most prestigious addresses in the city.' Speck, who describes himself as a Manhattan socialite, celebrity journalist and author has lived at the luxurious Beresford co-op at 211 Central Park for 36-years and began amassing his enormous taxidermy collection in the early 1990s. Beastly: The hall in Gregory Speck's apartment is covered in taxidermy including antelopes, bears, eagles and wild cats . He is not a hunter and never has been, rather he has scoured museums, stuffed road kill and even found pieces in a country-western disco. Splitting his collection equally between his Manhattan apartment and Harrisonburg, Virginia, house, Speck spent roughly $50,000 on his hobby over the course of three years. Hanging from every corner and standing in every available space in his apartment are stuffed turkeys, elk heads mounted on the walls, cougars and standing black and grizzly bears looking fearsome. According to The New York Times, the collection held in Speck's Manhattan apartment could fill an entire hall at the American Museum of Natural History. In one of the bedrooms a swan appears to float off away from its ceiling mount and a bison head that Speck found in a supermarket freezer in Virginia is in the other bedroom. 'He was the wooliest bully I had ever seen, so I called him Buffalo Bill,' said Speck to The New York Times. Sweet dreams: One of only two bedrooms in the $3.4 million apartment reveals Speck's desire to cover his home in his beloved taxidermy . In between his incredible array of stuffed animals, Speck exhibits pictures of himself with Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn and artists like Andy Warhol. Deciding to leave his Manhattan home following the death of his wife in 1999, Speck amassed the collection because he is a lifelong animal lover who grew up wanting to own a zoo. He considers his taxidermy collection 'an educational zoological display' and has decided that the apartment can be bought with or without the collection. Explaining why he spent so little on a collection that is now valuable, Speck recalled that in the 1990s, taxidermy was considered so out of fashion as to be offensive. 'In the ’90s, it was politically incorrect to have taxidermy specimens for various reasons,' he said to The New York Times. 'I found I was able to acquire many museum-quality trophies for very little because people didn’t want them.' Speck's collection includes Kodiak bears, two moose mounts, a black bear, freshwater game fish, bobcats, lynxes, raccoons, turkeys, rattlesnakes and even 40 Asiatic male pheasants in 'full plumage.' He would rather that one person or institution took them on and jokingly described them as 'very well behaved.' 'I would rather find somebody that would be so amazed that I’ve done this collection who would want them kept together as a big family,' he said.","Writer Gregory Speck trying to find buyer for his Manhattan apartment AND his huge taxidermy collection .

Close call: Kane County crews look over a sinkhole in Burlington Township, Ill Tuesday, July 1, 2014, where three people escaped serious injury when two vehicles traveled into the sinkhole on a rural stretch of road . During her 911 call to emergency services, a pick-up truck that didn't see the hole or their car drove straight over them, but amazingly didn't add to their injuries. While on the phone to the 911 dispatcher, Pineda can be heard wailing, 'Oh my God, no! Another car!'. In audio released of the phone call, the pick-up truck driver can be heard running over to the sinkhole to offer help to the stricken mother and son. He can be heard shouting to them, 'Did I just driver on top of you? Oh my God!' Injuries: Benjamin Hernandez was in the back seat of the car and suffered the worst injuries .

Benjamin was in the back seat of the car when the accident happened - trapping him while his mother escaped with no injuries. 'We were very lucky that that person who flew over us, that he flew over, not on top of us,' Pineda said. Benjamin told NBC that he blacked out during the accident. Survivor: Benjamin, 15, suffered serious injuries in the accident while his mother, Juanita, (right) was relatively unscathed .

'All I remember him telling me is, 'Mom, I'm going to hold on for you, mom I'm going to hold on.' I said, 'Benjamin, please don't leave me, I'm here for you, I'm going to be strong for you,' Pineda said. Hernandez is expect to be hospitalized for another week.","Juanita Pineda, 41, and her son Benjamin Hernandez, 15, miraculously survived the accident just outside Chicago on Tuesday ."
"By . Michael Zennie . Every day pot tourists who visited Colorado to partake in the state's new legal marijuana fly out of Denver airport. And ever day, dozens of them leave behind the drugs they did not have time to smoke. Rental cars at Denver International Airport have become a dumping ground for marijuana. Workers say they find stashes in returned cars every day. Some pot tourists are even offering to 'tip' rental car workers in drugs. Pot drop-off? Rental car employees said they find pot in returned rental cars every day at Denver International Airport (stock image) Workers told KCNC-TV that they find the new trend aggravating. And just because the state has made marijuana legal, tourists shouldn't assume everyone smokes it. 'I just throw it away, I'm like, ""I don't need it,""' one rental car worker said. It may be legal to get high in Colorado, but it's not legal to do it while flying high. Marijuana is banned at Denver International Airport, punishable by a $999 fine. Signs at entrances make it clear that the drugs aren't welcome there. The airport bans pot because federal law still classifies it as an illegal substance. Additionally, 48 other states (all except Washington) have laws against the recreational use of marijuana. Airport officials say the rules also help to stop the illegal transportation of marijuana across state lines. Marijuana is legal in Colorado, but is banned at Denver International Airport because it remains illegal under federal law and in 48 states . But many preoccupied pot tourists have plenty of drugs leftover when it's time to leave the Rocky Mountain State. So they leave it in their rental cars. One airport rental car employee told KCNC that she finds drugs four times a day in returned vehicles. Another said the problem seemed to especially spike during the July Fourth holiday - when apparently lots of tourists were celebrating the birth of the nation by getting stoned. All the employees KCNC talked to said they either throw away the marijuana or hand it over to a supervisor. 'We try not to let it get to the car wash bay because those guys will take it,' one employee added.","Marijuana is legal in Colorado but banned at Denver International Airport .

"By . Michael Zennie . Severe weather is leaving large swaths of the country battered and bruised today. The East Coast was walloped with torrential rains and heavy thunderstorms Tuesday night, strong winds buffeted parts of the western United States, while the parched West Coast continues to struggle with extreme drought. The bout of extreme weather saw cars float out of their parking spots in flooded Connecticut, 4,000 lightning strikes in a single hour in one New Jersey town, flash floods in Utah and a monsoon so strong in Arizona that heavy winds flipped over and F-16 fighter jet. But, it also brought an incredible photo op for the Empire State Building - captured by William Anderson lightning striking the skyscraper's spire. Astonishingly, Mr Anderson took the picture iPhone 5. He posted it on his Instragram account, @thewilliamanderson. In California, meanwhile, 80percent of the state is in 'extreme drought.' Wells and reservoirs are running dry and towns across the state - especially in parched southern California - are in danger of running out of water entirely. Scroll down for video . This incredible image, taken by William Anderson on his iPhone, shows the precise moment lightning strikes the Empire State Building . In Rexburg, Idaho, a heavy thunderstorm caused intense flooding with up to waist-deep water - one of several bouts of severe weather to strike the U.S. on Tuesday . In York, Maine, a high winds knocked over a massive oak tree, which came smashing down on a parked car . In Tuscon, Arizona, a 20,000-pound fighter jet was picked up by the wind and tossed on top of another plane at Davis-Monthan Air Force Bace . The severe weather dumped anywhere from three to ten inches of rain along the East Coast from Maryland to Maine. The New York suburbs in Connecticut and New Jerseys, as well as Westchester and Long Island were hit especially hard. Strong winds knocked over trees and power lines. In Belmar, New Jersey, 4,000 lightning strikes were recorded from 8pm to 9pm, WCBS-TV reports. Flash flood warnings were in effect for most of the night in New York and the surrounding area. Motorists found themselves stranded in deep water and had to be rescued from their cars by firefighters. Crisis: On the West Coast, meanwhile, 80percent of the state is in extreme drought. Reservoirs, wells and rivers are in danger of running dry . The California legislature this week enacted a law that allows cities to fine people $500 for water their lawns and washing their cars . In Pennsylvania, a 12-year-old girl was sucked through a flooded storm drain pipe from severe weather on Monday. She emerged a half mile away, scratched and bruised but OK. Several weather spotters in the New York area reported hail. In the Western U.S., a monsoon brought heavy winds and rain that flooded Rexburg, Idaho. The same storm uprooted trees and cracked power poles in Tuscon, Arizona. At Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, the wind was strong enough to flip over a retired F-16 fighter jet that was sitting in the junkyard. In California, meanwhile, 80percent of the state remains in extreme drought and more than a third is in 'exceptional' drought - the worst classification. State lawmakers approved new authority to towns and cities to fine people $500 for washing their cars or water lawns - all in an attempt to conserve water. In Lakewood, New Jersey, cars were submerged nearly to the tops of their tires by a flash flood, leaving motorists stranded . Devastated: Residents in Rexburg, Idaho, were flooded out of their home thanks to the rains on Tuesday . New Yorkers ran for cover after the rains began to swamp the city - leaving traffic delayed and many millions of commuters soaked . Many towns, especially in Southern California, are in danger of running out of water entirely. Reservoirs are drying up and some rivers have run dry. 'Not everybody in California understands how bad this drought is ... and how bad it could be,' California Water Resources Control Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus told the Associated Press. 'There are communities in danger of running out of water all over the state.' The drought is expected to continue into next year - even if California gets a wet winter. Even El Niño, the powerful Pacific Ocean phenomenon - which promised to bring wet weather to the region - has petered out. The lack of water is historic. Downtown Los Angeles has recorded its longest dry spell since record-keeping began in 1877. Storms continues on Wednesday on the East Coast and out west. Southern California remains hot and dry .

"By . Michael Zennie . Thomas Ravenel used his fall from political grace, his federal cocaine conviction and his sordid personal life to become the biggest star of Bravo's hit reality show. Now, he hopes all of South Carolina will forget the southern-fried mess that made him a national celebrity and vote him into the United States Senate. The one-time state Treasurer who resigned in disgrace after he was arrested on federal cocaine charges in 2007. His felony conviction bars him from holding state office, but in South Carolina a felon can be elected to Congress. Ravenel presented about 16,500 signatures . from registered voters on Monday. If election officials verify the . signatures, he will be an independent on the November ballot, running against Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. Scroll down for video . Former South Carolina Treasurer Thomas Ravenel fills out paperwork Monday, July 14, 2014, at the state Election Commission headquarters in Columbia, S.C.,  to run as a petition candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by Lindsey Graham. He also presented a box of signatures to get him on the ballot as an independent.  Ravenel pleaded guilty to a cocaine charge that forced him to resign as treasurer in 2007 and he spent 10 months in prison. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins) His biggest supporter: Ravenel, 55, counts his 22-year-old girlfriend, Katheryn Dennis, as a supporter. She is both a 'Southern Charm' costar and the mother his baby . The couple debuted Kensington Calhoun Ravenel at the end of the first season of 'Southern Charm' He entered the Election Commission office . twice at the request of television news crews trying to get the best . shot of him carrying his paperwork. But he insists his candidacy is . serious. The first to cheer on the 51-year-old's run for office is Kathryn Dennis - his 22-year-old girlfriend, 'Southern Charm' costar and the mother of his child. A pregnancy scare for Dennis was a pivotal event in season one of the hit show. Ravenel accompanied her to her doctor's office for a test - thought at the time, it wasn't clear whether the potential father was Ravenel or another 'Southern Charm' leading man. When the cameras stopped rolling, Ravenel and Dennis stole away to Florida for a romantic tryst that resulted in Dennis becoming pregnant. The couple debuted Kensington Calhoun Ravenel at the end of the first season in a surprise flash-forward for viewers. Ravenel, a millionaire real estate developer, hasn't announced plans to marry Dennis, but the two appear to be together. Dennis has posted dozens of pictures on her social media accounts of Ravenel with his adorable daughter. Outside the law: Ravenel has been arrested twice - once in 2007 for possession of cocaine and again last July for drunken driving. Dennis was busted at age 20 for underage drinking and disorderly conduct . Kensington is already a TV star, having debuted on 'Southern Charm' with her parents at the end of the first season . Much of the cast of 'Southern Charm' showed up for Kensington's christening last month . Ravenel isn't the only one with a political past. Dennis' grandfather was a celebrated state legislator and she was romantically linked to a former State Representative (who resigned in disgrace after he was arrested for sexually harassing an ex-girlfriend.) She also claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name). Ravenel was once a rising star in the South Carolina Republican party. He is the son of Arthur Ravenel Jr., a U.S. Congressman, after whom a major bridge in his hometown of Charleston is named. Thomas Ravenel came in third in a 2004 Republican race for U.S. Senate. Today he's being treated as a laughingstock by his former party. The state GOP released a statement calling his candidacy an 'embarrassment.' 'We doubt many voters will be interested in a convicted felon who renounced his American citizenship,' Matt Orr, state Republican spokesman, told the State newspaper. Ravenel wrote on his Facebook page in 2011 that he was going to leave the United States because he was no longer allowed to own a gun because of his felony conviction. He told reporters Monday that the remark was just a joke. Dennis showed off her pride and joy at the baby's christening last month . Ravenel played up to the TV cameras as he delivered the signatures required for his run for office - but insisted he was serious about politics . Political past: Dennis claims to be the descendant of former Vice President John C. Calhoun - and is the granddaughter of a former noted state representative. Ravenel served 10 months in federal prison after being convicted of buying less than 500 grams of cocaine in 2005. Last July, he was arrested again in the Hamptons in New York - this time for drunken driving. Dennis seems to share her old boyfriend's penchant for trouble-making. She was arrested in 2012 for underage drinking and disorderly conduct. Despite Ravenel's popularity, he will not be returning for the second season of 'Southern Charm.' In a recent interview, Ravenel said he felt a 'duty' to run for Senate. Ravenel will no doubt revel in showing off his photogenic new family in his campaign ads as he tries to unseat Graham . TV star: Ravenel and Dennis showed off their baby on 'Southern Charm' after keeping the pregnancy secret until the very end of the first season . Political royalty: The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is named after Thomas Ravenel's father, a U.S. Congressman who secured support to build the $700million span outside Charleston . 'I just felt I wasn't hearing from the current crop of politicians anything that could save the country. And so - I know I'm an imperfect messenger - but I just think my message was better than the other guys,' he said. He is campaigning on a platform of several Tea Party favorite positions, including ending trade restrictions, lowering taxes, scaling back the powers of government and and 'returning to the Constitution.' 'I'm a student of history, student of the founding documents - the Constitution, the state constitutions, the Articles of Confederation.

"By . Will Payne In North Conway, New Hampshire . Police may have missed a golden opportunity to save kidnapped Abigail Hernandez when they went to the small trailer where Nathaniel Kibby was allegedly holding her captive, five months after she disappeared. Kibby was ordered to hand over his vast arsenal of guns after he was arrested at the start of March and charged with simple assault, criminal trespass and loitering or prowling. Incredibly the loner, who has been described as a 'gun nut' by neighbors, actually called police and invited them to his home in Gorham, New Hampshire to seize his weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions. A New Hampshire State Police officer carries ammunition boxes from the home of Nathaniel Kibby today in Gorham, New Hampshire. Kibby is charged with kidnapping Abigail Hernandez in October 2013 . An officer carries ammunition boxes from the home of Kibby on Friday. It was revealed that police had visited Kibby's home in March to retrieve guns - perhaps missing an opportunity to save the teenage girl that he is believed to have held captive . Official records show two officers went round to his property at 9.04pm on March 2013, stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns. Their visit raises serious questions as it is believed Abby Hernandez, now 15, was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her October disappearance. This has been backed up by the fact investigators have focused all their search efforts on Kibby's trailer, a storage container in his backyard and a small stretch of river that runs at the back of his property. At this stage it is believed this is the only place he could have kept Abigail. Yesterday the Attorney General's office refused to comment on the incident, but if Abigail was being held just yards away, while officers were inside Kibby's trailer, their visit will come under serious scrutiny. Some friends and neighbors have already questioned why Kibby, who has an extensive criminal record and used to work just a couple of miles from where Abby went missing, wasn't already on the police radar. Kibby, was known as, 'Crazy Nate' around the trailer park and neighbors have described him as a 'creepy, gun-obsessed, odd-ball', who always talked about conspiracy theories and the zombie apocalypse. One resident, who refused to be named, said a female relative of his visited Gorham Police this week to make a formal complaint against Kibby after he apparently kept her held in his trailer against her will for more than an hour. 'Crazy Nate': Kibby, who had a long, criminal record was described by neighbors on his trailer park as a 'creepy, gun-obsessed, odd-ball' The incident apparently happened back in February, but the woman, in her early twenties was too scared to report it. The relative told MailOnline: 'Apparently he had her in there for about an hour and wouldn't let her leave. 'I wish she'd told us at the time, because maybe we could have done something about it. We felt it was important to tell the police now so they have every possible piece of information.' Again the Attorney-General's office refused to comment on the complaint. Glen Alden, who lives in the trailer opposite Kibby, remembers March's police visit. He describes the 34-year-old suspect as, 'off-kilter', but finds it hard to believe he had Abigail held captive in his trailer or the container for nine months. He said: 'He was a strange guy, but I just don't see how it's possible. Someone would have seen or heard something. There was a girl in her 20's who used to visit him on weekends and the police were in there.' Abigail Hernandez (pictured center) at The Conway Daily Sun office on Thursday morning with her mother Zenya and family friend Amanda Smith, who helped spearhead the Bring Abby Home effort during Abby's nine-month absence . However one former classmate Randy Waldron, is not at all surprised by Kibby's arrest. He claims he was tormented by Kibby throughout his school years and describes Kibby as rotten to the core. They first met in sixth grade. MailOnline has obtained an exclusive yearbook picture of an angelic looking Kibby from that year, aged 12. Alongside the photo he says he has one brother and his interests include, 'collecting stamps and talking to his friends'. In 20 years he says he will be an, 'MIT graduate just getting out of the Air Force as an engineer'. But that sweet image is a million miles away from the boy Randy Waldron remembers. A member of the FBI evidence collection team walks out the home of Nathaniel Kibby on Thursday where a large container can be seen in the background warning against trespassers . A New Hampshire Fish and Game Conservation K-9 officer crosses the Moose River as he searches for evidence on Thursday in the kidnapping case of Abby Hernandez . Talking to The Conway Daily Sun, he said: 'I hope Abby gets word that she's not alone; there are more of us who were tortured by Nat Kibby. I'm really shocked no one could connect this to him sooner.' Describing the moment he heard Kibby had been arrested in connection with Abigail's kidnapping, he said: 'I immediately called my mom (Nancy) who was on vacation on the Cape and told her an arrest had been made in the Abigail Hernandez case. 'I said, 'I'll give you three guesses who did it.' The first words out of her mouth were Nat Kibby. He tortured me and my mom for years.' Another former classmate, Brian Duhamel, says he remembers Kibby as a loner who always got in trouble, but not a bully. He said: 'I don't think he was a bully, but from very young, you could see he had the potential to go down the wrong path. I was in classes with him all the way from elementary school, right the way up to Kennett High School. New Hampshire State Police officers speak outside the home of Nathaniel Kibby at the trailer park on Friday. Questions have been raised as to why Kibby, who worked a few miles from where Abby disappeared, had not been found sooner . A car belonging to Nathaniel Kibby is towed on Thursday, July 31 from his home in in Gorham. Kibby is charged with kidnapping Abigail Hernandez in October 2013 . 'There were a few incidents that stand out. I remember him having huge fights with some of the teachers, where he would scream and shout at them. SAU 9 superintendent Carl Nelson, who started in the district in July of 1998, told The Conway Daily Sun he was 'quite familiar' with Kibby. He also said 1998 was 'the year of all the bomb threats', but he couldn't say for sure whether Kibby was involved. And in February of that year, Kibby was arrested after he bought an AK-47 type weapon and ammunition from K-Mart, using a fake ID. Brian Duhamel says he doesn't know why Kibby behaved the way he did, but always assumed it may have been down to problems at home. Very little is known about the suspect's family life. From arrest reports it can be seen he lived with his father Wayne Kibby and his year book references a brother. Abby Hernandez bravely appeared in court on Tuesday to face down her alleged kidnapper Nathaniel Kibby at his arraignment (right) The North Conway home the family lived in was owned by Wayne's sister. One parent who had a child at Kennett High School, said: 'I really didn't know his father and I very rarely saw him at school functions or anything like that. It's strange because this is a small place and everyone usually knows everyone else.' Kibby is currently being held on $1 million bail after his arraignment on Tuesday. He is accused of kidnapping Abigail Hernandez last October as she walked home from school, just days before her 15th birthday. He then apparently held her captive for nine months, before she mysteriously returned home on Sunday July 20. Since his arrest on Monday FBI agents, State Troopers and local police have been conducting a rigorous search of his trailer and the shipping container in his back yard. It is believed he may have held her in the container, which is apparently sound proofed and has three rooms. Yesterday a K-9 unit was brought in for the first time to search a river back behind the property.","Nathaniel Kibby, 34, called police in March to his home in Gorham, New Hampshire to seize his guns which violated his bail conditions .

"By . Hazel Southam . After the wettest January for more than 100 years, we're all desperately looking forward to any sign that spring is on its way. One of the earliest heralds is the snowdrop. And since the beginning of February, gardeners with land not swamped by floodwater will have been looking out for the first shoots nervously peeping their heads above soil. But gardeners have another reason to feel protective and anxious about their flowers this year. Snowdrop collecting has seen a boom in Britain over the last few years, with sales reaching many hundreds of pounds for just one bulb. Flower power: Steve Owen is spending . £1,000 to protect his snowdrops . The most expensive is a variety called Galanthus Elizabeth Harrison: just one bulb went for £725 last February. Clearly, this is not a poor man’s hobby - and that's the problem. Thieves have seized upon the desirability of some of the rarest bulbs and are stealing them from verges, private gardens and public parks in worrying numbers. Now, the gardeners are fighting back with a range of measures to try to deter even the most determined thief. Some are even installing anti-theft devices worth thousands of pounds to protect their precious plants. No one can deny snowdrops are beautiful. On a walk in the pouring rain through Sir Harold Hillier Gardens near Romsey in Hampshire, they take your breath away. Carpets of them grow in the Winter Garden, yet only two are labelled. This is deliberate, says head gardener, Fran Clifton. Back in 2008, she planted out two pots of Galanthus Blewberry Tart, a rare variety that then cost £25 per bulb. 'Both clumps went missing. One day they were just gone,' she says. 'But the problems really started in the winter of 2011/12. We planted out a few rather rare snowdrops from a private collection and within a few weeks we noticed that some had gone missing. 'We got some more and we’ve planted them in subterranean cages so you can’t just dig them up. We do that with all our rare varieties now and we don’t label them.' Expensive: Galanthus Elizabeth Harrison is worth £725 a bulb . The gardens have 60 of the world’s 2,000 varieties of snowdrop in a 180-acre site. Over the past two years, however, to stop thieves stealing the rarer plants they have been removed from the grounds and rehoused in pots in locked greenhouses. The public's only glimpse of them is at an annual, two-week snowdrop exhibition in the main house. This spring some 40 varieties are on view to snowdrop enthusiasts - known as galanthophiles - from the diminutive Tiny Tim to the foot-tall Mrs W. M. George, named after the wife of Hillier's former head gardener. Two wardens patrol the room at all times to enforce a strict 'no touching' rule. Plants can be inspected only with the use of mirrors, which are provided. So far, fingers crossed, nothing has been taken. 'I think it's very sad,' says warden Jean Snowsill. 'They would all look beautiful in their natural habitat. They are so lovely. They make you think that spring is on its way.' But this simply isn't possible: after the exhibition, which ends this Sunday, the rare varieties are returned to their greenhouses, the doors locked and alarms set. 'It's just awful,' says Fran. 'It's very disappointing that this has happened and that we have to protect plants in this manner. 'I can understand that the bulbs are expensive, but you can just buy the cheap ones. You don’t have to buy the expensive ones. It’s like a mania for people.' 'Steve Owen owns, grows and maintains the National Collection of snowdrops in his back garden in a hidden corner of Bedfordshire. Here, over the last ten years, he has amassed the largest collection in the world, numbering some  900 varieties. 'It looks wonderful at the moment,' he says. 'There are snowdrops flowering everywhere. It's great.' But only Steve, his wife and perhaps a few select friends will see his stunning spring display this year. The reason is that Steve, too, has fallen prey to a snowdrop thief over the last two years. 'We usually make the gardens available for people to visit, to open up the collection,' he explains. 'We got lots of visitors the first time we opened in 2012. People brought cameras and took lots of pictures. Clearly, they marked where things were and came back under cover of darkness.' A few weeks after Steve’s open day he discovered that a variety named E. A. Bowles, which was only discovered in 2004 and was consequently very rare, had been dug up. Sparse: Bulbs are disappearing from roadsides and parks too . 'It was a particularly valuable variety,' he says. 'That theft alone cost me £900. It's not about the money; you don't look at your garden in terms of monetary value. But it did make me sad.' Last year, the same thing happened. He held an open day, and a few weeks' later discovered another two valuable varieties had been stolen. 'They just walked in the front gate when I was in bed and took them,' he says. 'I don't know who's doing it, but it suggests it's being done by people who know their snowdrops.' Steve didn't report either theft to the police, but this year his prized garden is closed to the public while he installs security measures to protect his plants. Four CCTV cameras and night-time anti-theft lights are being put in at the cost of £1,000. 'It's quite annoying, but I have to keep them safe,' he says. Joe Sharman, proprietor of Monksilver Nursery in Cambridgeshire, is known as The Snowdrop Pope and sells them across Europe. The rarest do not have a price. He simply accepts bids for them. This is his busiest period of the year, often working until 1am to package and send out plants 'in the green' (snowdrops are traditionally sold in leaf as they tend to not prosper as well when planted as bulbs). 'I think it's someone who’s doing this to stock their own garden,' he says. The plants are so rare no one has them for sale. 'The thief keeps incredibly good records of what's growing where. They know what's in each pot and where it is,' he adds. So far, he's not had any thefts, but is cautious about revealing the location of his nursery, where, he says, there are ‘people patrolling the whole time’ to protect the bulbs. Beautiful sight: But many displays are being ruined thanks to thieves . When attending special snowdrop events, he employs security staff to protect his wares. 'Now the 'mania' for snowdrops seems to be spreading beyond the inner circle of galanthophiles to the general public. Andrew Turvey is head gardener at Myddelton House Gardens on the outskirts of North London. The gardens have drifts of snowdrops in woodland and attract up to 55,000 visitors per year. They have experienced so many thefts - not just of snowdrops - that they have now installed a 600m-long, 2m-high metal security fence, costing £25,000. 'It was necessary to do it,' says Andrew, 'otherwise people could just have hopped over a four-foot wall into our snowdrop area and taken them.' And it's not just public gardens that are being targeted. Online gardening forums are abuzz with people lamenting thefts from their flowerbeds. Such is the paranoia that all of them hide behind pseudonyms and refuse to speak publicly about their losses, for fear of being hit again. Bulbs are disappearing from roadsides and parks too. On March 22 last year, Jill Eveleigh wrote to her local newspaper, the Kingston Guardian, saying that snowdrops had been stolen from Morden recreation ground in South London. 'It has upset me greatly,' she said. 'I, and no doubt countless others, have enjoyed for many years the snowdrops that come up and flower for weeks, and grow when nothing else is able to.' Back at Hillier Gardens, I walk back to my car through the Winter Gardens. Under a hornbeam tree there is a vast carpet of purple cyclamen and snowdrops. It is a beautiful sight. It’s hard to imagine who would want to spoil that by stealing some of the plants. But somewhere, someone is planning their next heist. This year, however, the gardeners are ready for them.","One bulb of Galanthus Elizabeth Harrison sold for £725 .

"By . Pat Hurst, Press Association . West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison has been remanded in custody until next Thursday after appearing in court accused of punching and slapping his ex-girlfriend and her mother. Morrison, 21, charged with two counts of common assault, closed his eyes and puffed his cheeks out after being refused bail at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Thursday. Morrison, who spoke only to confirm his name and age, is alleged to have assaulted ex-girlfriend Reah Mansoor, 19, and her mother Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of Sunday morning. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ravel Morrison's skills on the pitch . Trouble: Ravel Morrison (left in action for West Ham and right in a picture he posted on Instagram earlier this week) has been charged with the assault of two women in the early hours of Sunday . Talent: Morrison spent the second half of last season on loan at Championship club Queens Park Rangers . What happened last Sunday morning? Ravel Morrison is alleged to have assaulted two women in Manchester, one aged 39 and one 19. What happened next? Morrison was arrested on Wednesday. Has he been charged? Yes, he has been charged with two counts of common assault. Has he been in court? Yes he appeared in magistrates court on Thursday. Was he granted bail? No, he was remanded in custody until August 7. What will happen then? He will appear in magistrates again and the court will decide how to proceed. Morrison, from Urmston, Manchester, was arrested on Wednesday and appeared in court on Thursday. District Judge James Prowse refused a bail application made by Morrison's solicitor Ros Emsley-Smith. The defendant, who did not enter a plea, was remanded into custody until August 7. Reporting restrictions were not lifted. The former Manchester United player is alleged to have assaulted his ex outside a bar in Manchester city centre. A further assault on her and on her mother is alleged to have taken place a short time later at her mother's house on Alexandra Road in the Peel Green area of Salford. Wearing a white t-shirt and white jogging bottoms, Morrison, whose address in court was given as Welwyn Close, Urmston, Manchester, but who also rents an apartment at Canary Wharf in London, sat in the dock listening during the hour-long hearing. He was later handcuffed and taken back to the cells as bail was refused. District Judge Prowse told him: 'You are remanded in custody to appear back before this court by video-link from prison one week from today on August 7.' Earlier, a . spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'At about 3.20am on . Sunday, July 27 2014, police were called to an address on Alexandra Road, . Peel Green, Salford, following reports a 19-year-old woman and a . 39-year-old woman had been assaulted. 'Officers . attended and a . 21-year-old man was subsequently arrested at a later date. 'Ravel Morrison, of Urmston, is charged with two common assaults.' Morrison . was widely tipped to become a Manchester United regular as one of the . club's best home-grown prospects in their youth teams. But the midfielder was sold by former boss Sir Alex Ferguson to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. He has since been loaned out by West Ham to Queens Park Rangers and Birmingham City. Location: A Google street view of Alexandra Road in Peel Green . Scene: One Central in Manchester, the bar where Morrison is alleged to have assaulted his ex girlfriend . Heard: Manchester Magistrates' and Coroner's Court, where Morrison was refused bail . Transport: The van that took Morrison to court is pictured leaving . Flashes: Morrison has shown glimpses of his talent at West Ham but has struggled for consistency . Representing: Morrison won four caps for England's Under 21 side, scoring two goals in the process . Promise: Morrison was at the Manchester United academy but left the club in 2012 to join West Ham . Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison only appeared in the League Cup before Ferguson took the decision to allow him to leave. West ham boss Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was soon shipped out to Birmingham on loan, a move that the 59-year-old felt helped Morrison develop his attitude. Upon his return to Upton Park, Morrison established himself in the West Ham first team and was one of their better performers in the early stages of last season. He scored a memorable goal in a 3-0 win at Tottenham which was voted as goal of the season by Hammers' fans before a niggling groin injury and a drop in form saw him lose his place in Allardyce's side. Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under 21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October and was subject to a bid from Fulham in January - although the offer was rejected. Instead he was moved on to QPR on a loan deal until the end of the season as he helped Rangers to gain promotion from the Championship before returning to West Ham. Stunner: Morrison scored a brilliant goal against Tottenham last season in West Ham's win . Morrison did not travel with the squad on their recent pre-season tour of New Zealand as he underwent surgery on his groin problem, training alone at the St George's Park national training base in Staffordshire. His long-term future at West Ham has again been questioned after the club's co-chairman David Sullivan suggested Allardyce was not keen on keeping Morrison in his squad - even though the board wanted to offer the midfielder a new deal. But Allardyce came out on Wednesday to back Morrison, if he can prove he wants to make it at the club. 'We thought we'd brought Ravel to the forefront of his abilities this time last year,' Allardyce told talkSPORT. 'He had a fantastic pre-season and he started the season exceptionally well. I think that drifted away somewhat and he ended up with QPR on loan and ended up helping get them promoted.'

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . A couple in Michigan whose dogs fatally mauled a jogger is being held on $500,000 bond  each, as court officials worry they might try to flee the country if released. Lapeer County prosecutors wanted $1 million, saying Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, both charged with second-degree murder, might try to escape. But Magistrate Mike Delling settled on a lower amount Friday, although he noted there was 'some question' about the couple's status in the US. Both are undocumented immigrants, according to the Detroit Free Press. Lucaj and Quagliat are charged with the July 23 death of Craig Sytsma, of Livonia, who was attacked by their cane corsos while he jogged along a rural road. Sytsma, 46, was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where . he died of his injuries, police said. 'It's a horrible tragedy,' assistant prosecutor Michael Hodges said. 'But animal cases get a lot of attention.' Prosecutors say Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata might try to flee if they're released on bond. Lucaj, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, of Italy, are undocumented immigrants . Help: A neighbor reportedly witnessed the attack before he tried to shoot at and scare the dogs off . Victim: Craig Sytsma, 46, was mauled by the couple's dog while he jogged along a rural road . Lucaj, 44, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, 45, a native of Italy, have had a long-running legal battle with federal immigration officials after arriving here in the late 1990s. Lucaj was named in a bribery scandal involving an immigration official in New York, although she wasn't charged. The government said she and other immigrants paid a middleman to ensure they would be granted asylum. The government in 2010 took some steps toward deporting Lucaj and Quagliata, but legal challenges have stalled the process, court records show. In March, a federal judge in Detroit refused to overturn a decision rejecting the couple's application for naturalization. 'Given the posture of their immigration cases, ICE has not yet initiated removal proceedings against either individual,' said Khaalid Walls, a Detroit spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE. 'ICE will, however, continue to closely monitor the matter and take appropriate enforcement action once the local criminal proceedings are resolved.' Attack: Two cane corsos attacked Craig Sytsma . The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said. 'He was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers told the Detroit Free Press. According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off. The dogs have been quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter. A hearing on whether they will be put down was re-scheduled from Friday. Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported. WXYZ reported that Sytsma survived a battle with colon cancer last year. 'He was very competitive,' said friend Mark Raitanen who knew him for 23 years and spoke to the Detroit Free Press. Raitanen said he jogged, played hockey, and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volley ball. A huge music fan who was partial to Santana, the Allman Brothers, and Gov't Mule, he went to several shows a year but still listened to cassette tapes. Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs . But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28. 'He was a dad, he was a family man,' Raitanen said. Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 'I’d . say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan . Sytsma said. In May 2012, there was a report of a . dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora . Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal. And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address. Mallett told the newspaper he didn't know whether the same dog or dogs were involved. Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012 . The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal. 'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. 'When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.' Oxford resident April Smith told the Free Press, however, that one of the dogs involved on Wednesday attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs. 'It's just crazy to me,' Smith told the newspaper. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.' Some people in past dog attacks in Michigan have been charged. A Livingston County woman whose American bulldogs in September 2007 fatally mauled two people, including a 91-year-old man, was sentenced to prison in 2008. She pleaded no contest to two felony counts of keeping dangerous animals causing death and a misdemeanor charge of allowing her dogs to stray.","Valbona Lucaj, 44, and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, 45, are charged with second-degree murder .

"By . Emily Crane . Tully Kavanagh's death in 2011 was one of three examined during a coronial inquest, which looked at the involvement of former midwife Lisa Barrett . The deaths of two newborn babies delivered during home births have been declared major crimes, with police considering manslaughter charges. South Australia police are investigating circumstances surrounding the deaths of five babies who died following home births - three of which were examined during a coronial inquest in 2012. The deaths of Tully Kavanagh in October 2011 and a second baby who died in December 2012 have been officially declared as major crimes. Tully's death was one of three examined during the inquest, which looked at the involvement of former midwife Lisa Barrett. Detectives are now examining evidence given by witnesses during the inquest to determine if perjury was committed or evidence was withheld or concealed. The inquest before Deputy State Coroner Anthony Schapel looked at the deaths of Tate Spencer-Koch in July 2007, Jahli Hobbs in April 2009 and Tully Kavanagh, who was the second of twins born. The death of a baby in Perth in July 2011 was also referenced during the inquest and now police are probing a fifth home birth death of a boy in December 2012. In his findings, Mr Schapel said the three babies would have survived as a 'matter of certainty' if they had been born in hospital by caesarean section. Detectives are now examining evidence given by witnesses during the Adelaide inquest to determine if perjury was committed or evidence was withheld or concealed . SA police had initally sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions Adam Kimber in 2012 on whether any criminal charge might be laid in respect to Ms Barrett's role in the birth of Tully Kavanagh. Mr Kimber told police in early 2013 that there was no reasonable prospect of a conviction against the former midwife and homebirth advocate. Ms Barrett gave evidence in relation to two deaths at the inquest but she would not answer questions regarding the death of Tully Kavanagh and the baby who died in July 2011 on the grounds her answers might incriminate her, the Adelaide Advertiser reports.

"By . Emily Crane . Australians are drinking and smoking less but are getting more anxious and fatter with three in five people still considered overweight, a new report has found. In the new state of the nation health study, the report by Roy Morgan Research suggests anxiety might be a result of rising unemployment rates. Roy Morgan chief executive Michele Levine, who will present the report findings in Melbourne today, said about 20 per cent of young people have expressed feeling anxious in the past 12 months. Three in five Australian adults are still overweight with a body mass index of over 25 despite becoming a nation of 'weight watchers' 'It was increasing gently but it really starts to pick up around 2012. And that's the time also that unemployment and underemployment really started to kick up. When you put the two trend lines on a chart, they correlate quite strongly,' Ms Levine told ABC radio. Anti-smoking and anti-drink-driving campaigns across the country have had a positive effect and the report suggested the decrease in smoking numbers also had something to do with increased taxes and a focus on plain packaging introduced by the federal government. 'The reduction in alcohol consumption… I think we've actually seen, again, a fairly strong anti-drink-driving campaign. And there's been enough information to get people to curb their drinking. The only one form of alcohol that's actually increasing is cider,' Ms Levine said. The decrease in smoking numbers had something to do with increased taxes and a focus on plain packaging introduced by the federal government . But three in five Australian adults are still overweight with a body mass index of over 25 despite becoming a nation of 'weight watchers'.  This is a combined overweight total of more than 180,000 tonnes of extra weight, up from 150,000 in 2008. Ms Levine said certain facts in the report like being overweight had to be investigated, but suggested obesity was largely an older person's issue. 'We worry about our weight. We think about our weight. We say that we're monitoring the calories we eat and yet our weight continues to increase,' Ms Levine said. The report found Australians were also drinking less thanks to anti-drink-driving campaigns . The report found Australians had consistent levels of good eating and exercise, even though people don't tend to participate in as much organised sport. 'We've stopped doing so much organised sport but our level of engagement in physical activity like doing exercises and going for walks and going to the gym, that's actually taken off,' she said. The report examines how Australians are faring across seven key health areas: smoking, alcohol consumption, nutrition, activity levels, illnesses, Body Mass Index (BMI) and psychological well being. Results show that Australians have improved in every category particularly smoking with Australians now smoking almost eight million fewer cigarettes daily than in 2008.","State of the nation health report suggests anti-smoking and drink driving campaigns have had positive effect .

Feeding time for John, the crocodile, in his enclosure at Shoalhaven Zoo on Monday descended into a horror show when Trent Burton was almost dragged to his death by his 3.7m reptile pal. Mr Burton, is seen in the footage, taken by a disturbed onlooker, coaxing the crocodile to snap up the fresh piece of steak he is waving in front of him. Scroll down for video .

But it all took a turn for the worst after Mr Burton jabbed at the meat in the crocodile's jaw and his left hand disappeared into the animal's jaw . John happily obliges before latching onto Mr Burton's left hand when he decided to jab at the meat firmly clasped in the crocodile's jaw. Mr Burton was dragged by the hand into the water and slammed into the fence, but managed to break free and jump the fence when the crocodile released his clasp after the trainer fell on his head. The screaming school holiday crowd were immediately reassured by the unusually composed trainer: 'everyone calm down' he can be heard saying as soon as he was in the all clear on the other side of the fence.

Mr Burton escaped the ordeal with 3 – 4 tooth punctures and a 10cm gash in the palm of the left hand and a broken knuckle on his right hand. He underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair his left hand. Mr Burton, 31, who has been handling crocodiles for more than a decade, admitted to Seven News that it was a 'rookie' error when touching the steak in John's mouth. 'A very dumb small brain fart on my part - it seems more dumb when you watch it,' he said. ' I was fighting for my life.'

He flipped the food at his (the crocodile’s) face. He caught it in his mouth and as he’s tried to flick it up to put it in his mouth further, Trent tried to reached and take it out of his mouth,' Mr Schilko said. 'He was beating himself up over what he did. Basically his hand got caught in the moment... the crocodile has gone bonus and started backing up to the water and dragged him all the way into the water' Mr Burton, 31, who has been handling crocodiles for more than a decade, admitted that it was a 'rookie' error when touching the steak in the 3.7m  reptile's mouth .

It's not known when Mr Burton will be back working at the zoo, but Mr Schilko said the crocodile handler would want to be back soon. 'He’s not a sook so he wants to be back at work as soon as possible. I will allow him to come back to work whenever the doctors say he can,' he said.

Local media reported that the killer had . two  accomplices when he attacked the former drug lord at a rented beach . house, but this . was not yet clear. Arellano . Felix spent nearly 15 years behind bars for drug-related  offenses . after his arrest in Mexico in 1993. He was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 and after being granted parole and released he returned to Mexico in 2008. 'He was never really part of the leadership of the big organization, mostly because he was in jail [in Mexico]. He was arrested before they became what they really became,' John Kirby, a former federal prosecutor in San Diego, who co-wrote a 2003 indictment against the cartel, said. Another official working with state . prosecutors said  Arellano Felix, the oldest of the brothers who headed . the gang, was not wanted  by authorities at the time of his death. The possibility that his killer  had ties to organized crime was being investigated, the official said. Arellano Felix had been arrested in 1993 in connection with the murder of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, and served a ten-year sentence for weapons possession. Mexican officials were concerned that he would return to drug trafficking after serving his Mexican sentence and asked their U.S. counterparts to seek his extradition. 'The Mexicans were very concerned he was going to get out,' Mr Kirby said. Attack: A gunman disguised as a clown shot the former head of the Tijuana Cartel in the Los Cabos resort .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Consider two brothers who are identical twins. If one goes to space and the other does not, are they still genetically identical? That’s what Nasa will be aiming to discover in March 2015 in a ground-breaking experiment that will for the first time study the impact of space travel on the human body in real time, measuring any changes that occur between the two brothers as they happen. Living in space is known to have effects on the human body, including decreasing bone mass and causing muscle loss. Scroll down for video . Scott Kelly (left) will live aboard the ISS for a year while his twin brother Mark (right) stays on Earth. The two will be studied before, during and after the mission to see what effects space travel has on the human body . But, as of yet, we’re not quite sure what it does to the body on a smaller scale. For example, it could affect our DNA or alter how we age. To test out theories, Nasa is conducting an unprecedented twin experiment. In March 2015 Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly will join cosmonaut Mikhair Kornienko on a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The one-year mission is in itself interesting, as it will be the first time two humans have stayed aboard the ISS continuously for this period of time with missions to date lasting just six months. However, it is not the longevity of the mission that makes it interesting – while Scott is in space his identical twin brother Mark, a retired NASA astronaut, will remain on the ground as a ‘control’ in the experiment. Scott will spend a year orbiting Earth at 17,000 miles (27,000 km) per hour while Mark remains on Earth. Scott's one-year mission on the ISS with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will be the first long-duration stay on the station, with previous missions lasting only six months . ‘We will be taking samples and making measurements of the twins before, during and after the one-year mission,’ says Craig Kundrot of Nasa’s Human Research Program at the Johnson Space Center. For the first time Nasa will be able to monitor ‘two individuals who are genetically identical.’ Nasa recently announced the selection of ten research proposals to study the twins’ genetics, biochemistry, vision, cognition and more. ‘Each proposal is fascinating and could be a feature-length story of its own,’ says Kundrot. ‘We already known that the human immune system changes in space. ‘It’s not as strong as it is on the ground. ‘In one of the experiments, Mark and Scott will be given identical flu vaccines, and we will study how their immune systems react.’ Scott Kelly (left) is a current NASA astronaut with three previous missions under his belt, two aboard the Space Shuttle and one on the ISS. Mark Kelly (right), now retired, flew on four Space Shuttle missions . Scott Kelly's previous mission to the ISS was from 25 September 2010 to 16 March 2011. Here he's pictured in the Unity module playing with fruit in the weightless environment of the station . Mark Kelly peers out of the window of Space Shuttle Endeavour in May 2011. Around his neck is the ring of his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, a former US politician who was recovering from a gunshot would at the time after a failed assassination attempt . Another experiment will delve into whether humans age differently in orbit. On Earth, the loss of telomeres from human DNA has been linked to aging. This loss might be accelerated by cosmic rays. Comparing the twins’ telomeres will reveal if space travel is causing astronauts to age quicker. Among the other proposals will be experiments to monitor how vision is affected by space travel, while researchers will also delve into the psychological effects of being in space. The research, according to Nasa, could provide vital data with a view to one day sending astronauts to more distant destinations in space. The ‘twin paradox’ is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th Century. It is derived from his theory of special relativity. Einstein suggests that the faster you travel, the slower you move through time. If one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light, they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity. Known as ‘time dilation,’ this was proven in 1971 with the Hafele-Keating experiment. Atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes. The clocks were found to have ticked differently, proving special relativity.","Nasa will send an identical twin to the International Space Station for a year .

"By . Francesca Chambers . Reality TV show star Bristol Palin is asking conservatives to celebrate the Supreme Court's landmark contraception mandate decision by participating in a Hobby Lobby Love Day this Thursday. Shortly after the high court handed down its decision affirming the family-owned company's right to abstain from an Obamacare mandate that violates its religious beliefs, Palin called on her fans to support the Christian craft store by making a special trip to the store on July 3. 'The Supreme Court says that Obama can’t force Hobby Lobby to provide . “contraception” that cause abortions. Way to go, Hobby Lobby!!' Palin said in a blog post announcing the nationwide effort. 'We should all go to Hobby Lobby and buy something to celebrate.' Bristol Palin, pictured here with her son Tripp in a selfie posted to her Facebook account in April, is calling on fellow conservatives to shop at Hobby Lobby on Thursday to show their support for the Christian craft store . Yesterday the court ruled that Hobby Lobby and other 'closely-held' businesses with religious ties were eligible for exemption from a provision of the health care law that requires companies to provide their employees with health plans that cover 'preventative services' for women. Hobby Lobby challenged the government on the grounds of religious freedom, stating that it would go against its strongly held religious beliefs to pay for plans that provide access to contraceptives that prevent pregnancy after conception such as the morning after pill. The court sided with Hobby Lobby, saying that businesses that are majority owned by less than five people are afforded the same religious liberty protections as individuals. In observance of the court's decision, Palin asked conservatives yesterday to take photos of themselves shopping at Hobby Lobby this Thursday and send them to her. 'It can be with your favorite product, a cashier, or a selfie with the . store logo in the background,' Palin said, noting that pro-Hobby Lobby signs should be prominently featured in the photos as well. 'If I did that, mine might say “You can’t make us!” ' the pro-life activist wrote. 'No matter what your photo says, buying something at Hobby Lobby will send a strong message.'

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Barack Obama announced today that he would again go around Congress to enact immigration reform measures. In a hastily scheduled statement this afternoon from the White House Rose Garden, Obama said he would 'greatly prefer' Congress pass its own legislation, rather than having to take matters into his own hands, but House Republicans have given him no choice. 'I don’t prefer taking administrative action,' he said. 'I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.' The president said he had directed his administration to 'refocus' is efforts on border security and said it would use its 'existing legal authorities' to do 'what Congress refuses to do' and fix the broken immigration system. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . My way or the highway: President Barack Obama said today that in the absence of Congressional legislation addressing the broken immigration system, his administration would use its 'existing legal authorities' to enact its own reforms . This June 18, 2014 photo shows illegal immigrant children sleeping on the floor of a holding cell at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas . The President said he expected recommendations from his administration on what he can do without Congress by the end of the summer. It will still taken an act of Congress, however, Obama said, to truly reform the system, and Obama indicated that he had recently told House Speaker John Boehner as much. 'I’m going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill,' Obama said. 'Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they’re less worried about politics. Maybe it will be next year. Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.' The president said he'd be willing to look at . legislation other than the version he supports that is stalled in the . Senate. 'The only thing I can’t do,' Obama said, 'is stand by and do nothing while . waiting for [House Republicans] to get their act together.' 'I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill.  I think he genuinely wants to get something done,' Obama said at another point in his remarks. After Obama's announcement Boehner released a statement saying 'it is sad and disappointing' that the president 'won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems. 'In our conversation last week, I told the president what I have been telling him for months: the American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written. 'Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue,' Boehner said. President Barack Obama said he expects recommendations from his administration by the end of the summer on what it can do without Congress' approval . The president's announcement comes two years after he went around Congress to change how the administration handles deporting young people who have lived in the United States since they were children. The president's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order instructed immigration officials to stop deporting anyone under the age of 31 who had arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, lived in the U.S. continuously since 2007 and had no criminal record. That policy, Republicans claim, led to the current humanitarian crisis on America's border with Mexico. Unaccompanied minors have poured into the border since DACA went into effect. Many are coming from Mexico, but the majority are coming from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. The Customs and Border Protection agency expects 100,000 children to illegally immigrate to the Unite States by the end of the year. Neither Obama's DACA directive nor his immigration reform legislation that is currently stalled in the Senate would apply to them, but more than 200 a day are coming to the U.S. anyway under the false assumption they will receive amnesty when they arrive. 'They are principally motivated by a disinformation campaign that’s being propagated by criminal syndicates that are preying on vulnerable populations of people who are living in pretty desperate situations,' White House Press Secretary John Earnest told reporters today. Border enforcement officials have been overwhelmed by the flood of children, and detention facilities in the Rio Grande area in Texas are overflowing with teens and small kids awaiting deportation or other government action. 'The White House claims . it will move to return these children to their families in their home . countries, yet additional executive action from this president isn't . going to stem the tide of illegal crossings, it’s only going to make . them worse,' Boehner said today. Boehner accused the president was 'giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the . country illegally they will be allowed to stay.' Two female detainees sleep in a holding cell at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center in Nogales, Arizona . In his remarks Obama said today that crisis on the border 'underscores' the need for immigration reform and called on House Republicans saying otherwise to stop coming up with excuses not to pass reforms. 'It makes no sense. It's not on the level. It's just politics, plain and simple,' he said. Obama denied that his past actions had provided encouragement for the . mass migration of children, saying, 'I've sent a clear message to . parents in these countries, not to put their kids through this.' 'But the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear that folks don’t know what the rules are,' Obama said. So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act,' the president said, 'America cannot wait forever for them to act,' which is why he directing his administration to act on its own. And if House Republicans don't like it, they should pass their own legislation instead of trying to sue him, he said. Obama was referring to Boehner's announcement last week that the House would bring a lawsuit against the president for repeatedly going around Congress to amend the law as he sees fit. 'Pass a bill; solve a problem. Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done,' the president said of House Republicans. 'With the House of Representatives filing a lawsuit to curb Obama’s presidential overreach, you'd think this administration would get the message,' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement harshly rebuking the president. 'Our Constitution is not a list of suggestions. Our Founders were not mistaken when they created three separate branches of government,' Priebus argued, citing recent Supreme Court decisions rolling back Democratic-supported legislation. '[The president] wants a comprehensive immigration overhaul that's his way or the highway. But that doesn't give him the power to rewrite the Constitution or the law.' Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, a member of the Gang of Eight senators leading the way for immigration reform, said Obama's decision to go rogue today was a poor choice. 'We're all frustrated that IR hasn't moved in the House,' the Republican Senator tweeted, 'but POTUS . dismissing genuine concern about unilateral executive action doesn't . help.' Anxious for action on immigration . reform, President Barack Obama instructed his administration to stop . deporting young, illegal immigrants in a June 2012 memo. To . qualify for the president's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival . program, immigrants were required to: be under the age of 31; in school, . graduated or be a member or veteran of the armed services; have no . criminal record; arrived in the U.S. under the age of 16; and been . living in the U.S. continuously since June of 2007. Since the president announced DACA, the number of young, illegal immigrants coming to the U.S. via Mexico has skyrocketed. Since . last October, 52,000 minors, many of whom are unaccompanied by their . parents, have made the dangerous journey to the United States' southern border. The . president's policy does not apply to new illegal immigrants but . smugglers are purposefully telling families of foreign children that it . does.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Bill Clinton was once paid an astonishing $1.3 million for two days worth of speeches, an analysis of Clinton's finances published today shows. On another occasion he hauled in $1.4 million for speeches given during a a seven-day sprint across Europe. A comprehensive look at Clinton's post presidency pay day by The Washington Post reveals Bill really has been working 'very hard' to bring in the bacon for his family, giving 542 paid speeches since his term ended. The Post determined that Clinton made $104.9 million off of his speeches between 2001 and early 2013. Post presidential payday: Former President Bill Clinton, pictured here at the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative America, in Denver, Colorado, on Wednesday, was once paid $750,000 for one speech . In 2012 alone Clinton gave an impressive 72 paid speeches, bringing in $16.3 million. 'I’m shocked that people still want me to come give talks,' Clinton told Meet the Press host David Gregory in an interview this week at the fourth annual Clinton Global Initiative America meet-up in Denver. Data for Clinton's speeches after the beginning of 2013 is unavailable. Bill was required to file financial disclosure forms throughout his wife Hillary's tenure as a U.S. Senator and as Secretary of State, but when she left the Obama administration last year, that information became private. If Hillary ran for president in 2016, their tax information would likely become public again, giving Americans a clearer picture of how much of a boon the speaking circuit has been on the power couple's finances. Interest in the Clinton's wealth has piqued in the last month after Hillary told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'not only dead broke, but in debt' when they departed the White House in 2001, and that is why they charge so much for individual speeches. May 28, 2011: Achmea, $600,000 . November, 12, 2011: Ericsson, $750,000 . November 13, 2011: Hualua, $550,000 . March 25, 2011: THISDAY, $700,000 . February, 13, 2012: THISDAY, $700,000 . 'You know, it was not easy,' Hillary said. 'Bill has worked really hard — and . it's been amazing to me — he's worked very hard.' The remark has inspired a round of attacks from Republicans, including 'I Wish I Was As Broke As The Clintons' t-shirts and bumper stickers created by political action committee America Rising. The Clintons have been coy about how much they regularly receive to make remarks, but the number was thought to be around $200,000. WaPo's analysis of Bill's speeches indicate that it could be more. In 2011 and 2012 Bill was paid a respective average of $248,333 and $226,736 per speech. 'There’s not a lot of negotiating room,' Chuck Carr, a vice president of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries told the Washington Post of his organization's experience hiring Bill to speak in 2009. 'You are offered a contract and there’s very little in the contract that you can change.' Nice work if you can get it: On another occasion Clinton made $1.4 million in seven days for speaking to European business and political leaders . Bill's pay day has seen an increase throughout the last three years as a result of several high stakes speeches. Swedish . communications technology provider Ericsson paid Clinton $750,000 for a .

Clinton's biggest fans have come from the financial services industry, which has paid the former president $19.6 million since 2001 to grace 102 functions with his presence. TD Bank, an affiliate of TD Ameritrade, has paid Clinton $1.8 million for 10 speeches. Goldman Sachs has brought Clinton in to speak eight times to the tune of $1.35 million. The 42nd president has also been very popular abroad, collecting $56.3 million from foreign institutions, primarily in China, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom. Hillary Clinton is also in high demand, if not higher demand than her husband, as a speaker. Much of the information about her speeches is private, but Mother Jones posits that Hillary has made more than $5 million off her speeches since last year.","Former President Bill Clinton gave 542 speeches between 2001, when his term ended, and 2013 .

"By . Francesca Chambers . The United States ought to just take the Central American children pouring into the country through its border with Mexico, stick them on a bus and send them back home as soon as they arrive, Alabama congressman Mike Rogers said at a Homeland Security hearing this morning. That's what the U.S. does with adults who illegally enter the country, the Republican congressman said, 'Why aren't we putting them on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to Guatemala?' 'I don't know why these children are being treated any differently,' he said. 'What . are we doin' other than takin' 'em and puttin' 'em in a facility here . that's gonna make it more likely we will keep them here for months if . not years?' he said. Scroll down for video . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told members of the Homeland Security committee today that the Obama administration would direct 150 more border patrol agents to the area where Central American children are primarily crossing into the U.S. from Mexico . Rogers was one of several members of Congress at the hearing, featuring testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who called DHS to expedite its process for returning unaccompanied minors back to their home countries instead of investing additional resources into improving detention facilities along the border to make kids coming to the U.S. illegally more comfortable. Members also expressed concern over what the Obama administration was doing to correct the record about U.S. immigration policy and what steps it was taking to deter parents in Central American countries from putting their children's lives at risk by handing them over to smugglers. Coyotes are promulgating rumors that children who make it across the U.S. border will receive amnesty through President Barack Obama's 2011 Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals program or his immigration reform legislation that's stalled in the Senate. Neither would apply to new immigrants crossing the border, but criminal networks have successfully convinced thousands of children from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to illegally immigrate to the U.S. since Obama's DACA program was announced two years ago. On the trip many children are mentally and physically abused at the hands of the smugglers. 'I think the saddest thing about this whole story is the exploitation of the children,' committee chair Mike McCaul said, noting that he never thought he'd see detention centers at the border turn into 'refugee camps.' Shoes for children that have been donated for immigrants sit on a table at Sacred Heart Catholic Church . Sister Rency Moonjely helps sort a donation of shoes in a warehouse at the Mother Teresa Shelter in Corpus Christi, Texas. Over the weekend 10 tons of donations were received to help the Diocese of Brownsville in its response to an influx of women and children immigrants from Central America . The Diocese of Corpus Christi and Catholic Charities of Corpus Christi are working together to collect and deliver the items to detention facilities . A 2008 law requires the Department of Homeland Security to turn over all unaccompanied minors to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. That is not happening most of the time, Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Craig Fugate admitted during today's hearing, and the children are piling up at detention facilities. The federal agency, which was tasked by President Obama to coordinate the humanitarian relief to the children, has worked increase its in-take capacity, but the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border is rising at a faster rate than  either DHS or HHS is able to keep up with. McCaul noted during his opening statements that 52,000 children had illegally immigrated to the U.S. since last October, and the Customs and Border Protection agency expects approximately 100,000 to arrive before the end of the fiscal year. More than 250 are apprehended every day, he said. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said 52,000 unaccompanied minors had illegally immigrated to the U.S. since last October and 100,000 are expected to arrive by the end of the fiscal year . 'I'm very concerned that this recent surge is weakening our border security efforts here at home,' McCaul said, because border enforcement officers are being diverted away from their main duty, which is to stop drug smugglers. 'Cartels will no doubt take advantage of this situation,' he said. McCaul called on President Barack Obama to send the national guard down to the border to help ease the burden being placed on border patrol. HHS does not have enough space to licensed professionals on hand to take care of the children, Fugate said, or space to put them in, which is why HHS isn't fulfilling the requirements its legally bound to. As a stop-gap solution to the humanitarian crisis, Fugate said in testimony, FEMA is working toward getting the kids beds within the CBP detention facilities so they at least won't be sleeping on the cold, hard concrete. But the more 'proper humanitarian measures' the U.S. takes, the more the government makes being held in a U.S. detention facility something that encourages children to make the unsafe journey from their home countries to the U.S., New York Congressman Peter King said during the hearing. Rogers concurred during his testimony. 'Right now we have a crisis, and I don't see this administration doing anything about it other than trying to house the children,' he said. The rise in the number of illegal immigrants has caused a strain on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency's resources. Earlier this month it posted a notice asking for bids on an order for 3,500 pairs of White 100% Cotton Men's Briefs underwear, sizes medium through 6X-Large. 'This is a normal solicitation for routinely . procured items needed at ICE-owned detention facilities around the . country,' an ICE spokesperson told Breitbart News on Monday. 'At . ICE-owned detention facilities, the agency is required to provide basic . necessities in order to feed and clothe detained aliens.' The pairs of underwear are for a detention facility in El, Paso, Texas. 'And I understand the humanitarian basis for that, but we need send a signal to these other countries that it's not gonna work. You can't send your children up here and let 'em stay. We're gonna turn 'em right back and give 'em right back to you.' Johnson said during his testimony that the federal government was in fact doing addressing the situation outside of humanitarian concerns about the way the illegal immigrant children are being treated inside of the detention facilities, which has become a major focus of the border crisis in recent weeks. The U.S. is sending 150 additional border patrol agents down to the Rio Grande river area, where most of the children are crossing he said. The government is also in talks with the leaders of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras about how the countries can work together to provide a better life for the children in their home countries and get the word out that children who make it across the U.S. border alive don't get a 'free pass' into the country, Johnson said. 'I think whatcha need to do is ask the Guatemalan government where they want these kids dropped off when the bus is bringin' em back down there,' Rogers said, rather than asking how the U.S. could be helping the third world countries more. The White House announced on Friday, that the U.S. is giving Central American countries $250 million of new aid. A large chunk of that money will go to gang prevention programs in the region, Only a small part, $9.6 million, will go toward expanding repatriation centers in the countries. Johnson said today that DHS would be leaning on other agencies, including the Coast Guard, to try to get the children returned to their home countries more quickly. The most 'critical'  step that the U.S. can take at this time in resolving the crisis, Johnson said, is to correct the record about U.S. immigration laws.","More than 250 children are illegally immigrating to the U.S. every day and 100,000 are expected to arrive by the end of the fiscal year .
Many of them are unaccompanied minors coming from Central America by way of Mexico .
Smugglers have convinced Central American children and their parents that they will get amnesty through U.S. President Barack Obama's relaxed deportation policies if they hurry up and immigrate to America .
The Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have been overwhelmed by the mass migration and have been unable to come up with enough beds for children to sleep on .
At a Homeland Security Committee hearing today one Republican Congressman asked the Obama administration why it couldn't just send the kids back to their home countries on buses back to their home countries .
'What .
are we doin' other than takin' 'em and puttin' 'em in a facility here .
that's gonna make it more likely we will keep them here for months if .

"By . Associated Press . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the White House not to force a truce with Palestinian militants on Israel following the quick collapse of the cease-fire in Gaza, . Sources familiar with conversations between Netanyahu and senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, say the Israeli leader advised the Obama administration 'not to ever second guess me again' on the matter. The officials also said Netanyahu said he should be 'trusted' on the issue and about the unwillingness of Hamas to enter into and follow through on cease-fire talks. Scroll down for video . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, at the cabinet meeting at the defense ministry in Tel Aviv on Thursday. On a phone call with the US Ambassador Friday, shortly after a cease fire was broken, he vented his anger and said he expects US support on how he chooses to deal with Hamas . The Obama administration on Friday condemned 'outrageous' violations of an internationally brokered Gaza cease-fire by Palestinian militants and called the apparent abduction of an Israeli soldier a 'barbaric' action. The strong reaction came as top Israeli officials questioned the effort to forge the truce, accusing the U.S. and the United Nations of being naive in assuming the radical Hamas movement would adhere with its terms. The officials also blamed the Gulf state of Qatar for not forcing the militants to comply. With the cease-fire in tatters fewer than two hours after it took effect with an attack that killed two Israeli troops and left a third missing, President Barack Obama demanded that those responsible release the soldier. Obama and other U.S. officials did not directly blame Hamas for the abduction. But they made clear they hold Hamas responsible for, or having influence over, the actions of all factions in the Gaza Strip. The language was a distinct change from Thursday when Washington was focused on the deaths of Palestinian civilians. 'If they are serious about trying to resolve this situation, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible,' Obama told reporters. President Barack Obama spoke on Friday afternoon, in part about he Middle East. His administration condemned 'outrageous' violations of an internationally brokered Gaza cease-fire by Palestinian militants and called the apparent abduction of an Israeli soldier a 'barbaric' action . He added that it would be difficult to revive the cease-fire without the captive's release. 'It's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again if Israelis and the international community can't feel confident that Hamas can follow through on a cease-fire commitment,' he said. His comment reflected uncertainty in the U.S. and elsewhere that Hamas was actually responsible for the incident or if some other militant group was to blame. At the same time, Obama called the situation in Gaza 'heartbreaking' and repeated calls for Israel to do more to prevent Palestinian civilian casualties. Despite the collapse of the truce, Obama credited Kerry for his work with the United Nations to forge one. He lamented criticism and 'nitpicking' of Kerry's attempts and said the effort would continue. Kerry negotiated the truce with U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon in a marathon session of phone calls over several days while he was in India on an official visit. Kerry had spent much of the past two weeks in Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and France trying to mediate a cease-fire with Qatar and Turkey playing a major role because of their close ties with Hamas. A Palestinian supporter of Hamas holds the Quran as others shout slogans against the Israeli military action in Gaza, during a demonstration in the West Bank town of Tulkarem town on Friday . Those efforts failed with Israel saying it could not trust Hamas and some Israelis and American pro-Israel groups complaining that the U.S. was treating the group — a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the State Department — as a friend. Late Thursday, however, Israel accepted Kerry and Ban's latest proposal, despite its reservations. Once the truce was violated, though, Israeli officials hit out at not only Hamas, but the United States and Qatar for its failure. An Israeli official said the Netanyahu government viewed both Hamas and Qatar as having violated the commitment given to the U.S. and the U.N. and that it expected the international community to take practical steps as part of a 'strong and swift response,' especially regarding the return of the abducted soldier. In a phone call with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, Netanyahu vented his anger, according to people familiar with the call. Netanyahu told Shapiro the Obama administration was 'not to ever second-guess me again' and that Washington should trust his judgment on how to deal with Hamas, according to the people. Netanyahu added that he now 'expected' the U.S. and other countries to fully support Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to those familiar with the call. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter by name. They said Netanyahu made similar points to Kerry, who himself denounced the attack as 'outrageous,' saying it was an affront to assurances to respect the cease-fire given to the United States and United Nations, which brokered the truce.","The Israeli Prime Minister hit out after a truce was broken Friday morning .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Ryan Lipman . The international airline pilot who was carrying almost $900,000 in cash when he and his wife were arrested has told a Melbourne court he must clear his name. Finnish national Lauri Metsaranta, 35, said a conviction on the charge of handling the proceeds of crime would end his career as a Finnair pilot on long-haul routes. Failing to appear at his trial would effectively do the same, he said, as Interpol would declare him a fugitive, making passage though airports impossible. A Finnair pilot was carrying $900,000 cash when arrested with his wife in Melbourne . 'I must have my name cleared because as a fugitive, or a convicted felon, it would be very difficult to continue my job,' Metsaranta told the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday. 'I know the company policies - just getting the security clearance to go through the airport would be very unlikely if I am convicted.' Magistrate Ann Collins agreed and granted bail, allowing Metsaranta to return to Finland. He must also pay a $100,000 surety to be forfeited should Metsaranta fail to return to Australia for his trial expected in early 2015. Metsaranta had spent five months in custody, after he and his Chinese wife Changchen Chen were arrested outside a Melbourne hotel. Lauri Metsaranta is now trying to clear his name in the Melbourne Magistrates Court so he can continue to work as a Finnair pilot on long-haul flights . Cash totalling $899,460 was found in two bags, according to an Australian Federal Police statement tended to the court. The court was also told Ms Chen, and another Asian man involved in handing over the cash, had pleaded guilty to proceeds of crime charges. 'There is no evidence (Metsaranta) had any knowledge of the money before he got to the hotel room,' his lawyer Michael Gleeson also told the court. The date for Metsaranta's trial will be set at a hearing in the Victorian County Court on Friday.

"By . Aap . and Ryan Lipman . A memorial stone to First Fleet commander Admiral Arthur Phillip was unveiled at Westminster Abbey in central London on Thursday. The Duke of Edinburgh laid a wreath at the stone during an hour-long dedication service on Wednesday that was also attended by NSW Governor Dame Marie Bashir. Phillip, the first governor of NSW, is the latest addition to the long list of 3,300 notable people buried or memorialised in the abbey. This year marks 200 years since Phillip died in August 1814 in England. A memorial stone to First Fleet commander Admiral Arthur Phillip was unveiled at Westminster Abbey in central London on Thursday . Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh attended the service of dedication to Admiral Philip and laid a wreath at the memorial stone . During Wednesday's service Dame Marie praised the admiral as being 'enlightened, far-sighted and indeed humane'. 'Determined to ensure the fair treatment of the Aboriginal people he actively fostered harmonious relations with them,' she said. The memorial - carved from Sydney sandstone - is set in the floor of the Nave near memorials to David Livingstone, Thomas Cochrane and Isaac Newtown. It's also nearby to the grave of the unknown warrior. It reads: 'Admiral Arthur Phillip. Royal Navy 1738-1814. First Governor of NSW & founder of modern Australia'. There's a small outline of a kangaroo too. The memorial stone reads:  'Admiral Arthur Phillip. Royal Navy 1738-1814. First Governor of NSW & founder of modern Australia'. There is also a small outline of a kangaroo . Carved from Sydney sandstone, the memorial is set in the floor of the Nave near a memorial to Isaac Newtown . NSW Governor Marie Bashir attended the service and said the admiral ensured the fair treatment of the Aboriginal people and actively fostered harmonious relations with them . Admiral Arthur Philip was born on October 11, 1738 and died on August 31, 1814 . On May 13, 1787, the First Fleet of 11 ships set sail from Portsmouth, England for NSW . Mr Phillip captained HMS Sirius in the fleet . Over 252 days, the First Fleet brought about 1,500 men, women and children half way around the world from England to Australia . The fleet arrived first in Botany Bay on 18 January, 1788 and later in Sydney Cove (in Port Jackson), as named by Mr Phillip, on January 26 . Sydney Cove was preferred because of its access to fresh water for the colony . Mr Phillip was the first Governor of NSW and founder of the settlement, which became Sydney . The Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall, described the navy man as a 'modest, yet world-class seaman, linguist and patriot, whose selfless service laid the secure foundations on which was developed the Commonwealth of Australia'. Phillip was in charge of the 11 ships of the First Fleet which carried some 1,450 individuals, half of which were convicts. He was meant to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay but due to his rural background realised the soils and adjacent rivers were not suitable to sustaining agriculture. So in 1788 he sailed on to Port Jackson instead which later became Sydney Harbour. The memorial stone came about following years of lobbying by the Britain-Australia Society Education Trust whose patron is the Duke of Edinburgh. The society said in a statement: 'Admiral Phillip is hardly known in the UK, although in Australia, Phillip Bay in NSW and Port Phillip Bay in Victoria are named after him.' Admiral Phillip was in charge of the 11 ships of the First Fleet .

A NSW Police media spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the attack happened in Bellambi, a suburb north of Wollongong on the NSW coast. The young boy was bitten and wounded on his legs, arms, hips, stomach, buttocks and head in a gated front yard on Waley Avenue by an American Staffordshire terrier and German shepherd at about 2pm.

The NSW government has granted James Packer's Crown Resorts a 99-year licence to operate a casino within its planned hotel development at Sydney's prime Barangaroo South site. In return, Crown will pay the government $100 million within five business days, not including a $5 million deposit paid last year. Under the restricted licence, no poker machines will be permitted at the Crown Sydney Hotel Resort complex, on the southern end of Sydney's Harbour Bridge, once it begins operations after November 15, 2019.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Ryan Lipman . Australians will soon be able to test themselves for HIV after the federal government announced that restrictions preventing the manufacture and sale of oral home-testing kits have been lifted. This will enable kits to be sold straight to customers in the hope it leads to early detection and treatment in a bid to stop the virus be spread. The government unveiled its 2014-2017 national strategies on HIV, hepatitis B and C, sexually transmissible infections (STIs) and a special strategy on targeting blood borne viruses and STIs in the indigenous community. The HIV strategy aims to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV by 50 per cent by 2015, as a key step towards a 2020 elimination target. The Federal Government has announced Australians will be able to test themselves for HIV using home-testing kits . To help it achieve this goal the government has removed a restriction preventing the manufacture and sale of HIV home self-tests. Health Minister Peter Dutton said on Monday that companies can now apply to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for approval to supply their test kits, which will be able to be sold direct to customers. 'We know that there are Australians living with undiagnosed HIV,' Mr Dutton said. 'Home self-testing provides an additional testing option that complements current options and allows people living with HIV to learn their HIV status and seek appropriate treatment and support. 'It also overcomes some of the common concerns people have about receiving the test in a medical setting and gives them more choice.' Mr Dutton also said the early diagnosis of HIV was critical to supporting Australians living with the condition to get the treatment they need sooner and to stop its spread. The kits offer an alternative to visiting a clinic and being tested by a clinician . The move follows the successful rollout of the oral swab kits in countries including the U.S. and the kits will be available for purchase from pharmacies, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Therapeutic Goods Administration national manager John Skerritt said the home kits detect antibodies in oral fluid produced by people with the virus. 'A small purple band appears to show the antibody is present and you are therefore likely to have HIV. It's like a home pregnancy test,' he said. Professor Skerritt said the kits were sold in the U.S. for about $40 and people using them had access to a  24-hour hotline providing them with support and information. Mr Dutton also announced that from next July those living with HIV will be able to access their medicine from a pharmacy of their choice, rather than the hospital - $16.2 million over four years to improve patient access to HIV antiretroviral therapies in the community. Alfred Hospital infectious diseases director Sharon Lewin said the HIV strategy sets some 'ambitious targets'. It is hoped the kits will help the government meet its target of eliminating the virus by 2020 through early detection and treatment . 'Australia has taken a rather bold step working towards eliminating new HIV infections by 2020,' she said. 'The increased availability of testing and greater ease of accessing treatment through community-based pharmacies will both greatly assist in reducing new infections.' There were 1,200 new HIV infections last year and the highest prevalence of HIV is still among gay men in Australia. 'A big challenge will be in eliminating new infections in men who have sex with men,' Prof Lewin said. She said that home-testing offered people an alternative way of getting testing - rather than visiting a clinic to be tested by a medical practitioner. But she said it was essential that there was support available for people with a positive result. Meanwhile, the government plans to halve the incidence of new hepatitis C infections over the next four years. Chronic hepatitis C affects about 230,000 people in Australia and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Mr Dutton said the TGA recently approved a new hepatitis C treatment called sofosbuvir (Sovaldi, Gilead). This treatment can reduce treatment time and increase cure rates for hepatitis C to 90 per cent. Hepatitis Australia, who worked with the government to develop the national strategies, said immediate action was needed to halt the rising rates of new infections and 'appallingly low levels of treatment'. 'Without urgent investment in rigorous treatment programs, Australia will continue to fail in its efforts to halt escalating rates of serious liver disease due to chronic hepatitis B or C,' said Hepatitis Australia's acting chief executive Kevin Marriott. The 20th International AIDS conference will be held in Melbourne later this month.","The Federal Government has lifted restrictions on HIV home-testing kits .
Companies are now able to apply for approval to stock the kits .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Ryan Lipman . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended Australia's policy of turning back asylum seeker boats after the High Court granted an interim injunction to prevent the government handing 153 asylum seekers to the Sri Lankan authorities. On Tuesday, Mr Abbott  said what his government does at sea is in line with its international obligations and safety protocols. He also took a swipe at Opposition and Greens 'activists', accusing them of trying to disrupt the Government's policies. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said what his government does at sea is in line with its international obligations and safety protocols . 'The person who brought this injunction is a former Labor candidate,' he told the Seven Network, referring to George Newhouse, who was among the group of barristers who brought the claim before the High Court. The Prime Minister added: 'What I'm focused on is stopping the boats. That is what we are absolutely and constantly focused on, because as long as the boats keeping coming, we will keep having deaths at sea. 'So the most decent, humane and compassionate thing you can do is to stop the boats.' The United Nations has criticised Australia's decision to return 41 asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, as the High Court considers the future of 153 others who could face the same fate. But Mr Abbott dodged questions about the asylum seeker group and the court's decision. 'I'm just not going to comment at all on operational matters,' he told the Seven Network. 'Any commentary by government members about operational matters just gives aid and comfort to the people smugglers.' This comes as the father of a three-year-old girl named Febrina, who is among 37 children in the group of 153, has appealed for the government to protect his daughter. It is claimed that Febrina was travelling on a vessel which left the Indian city of Pondicherry on June 13. There has been no word from the boat since June 28. Sri Lankan girl Febrina, 3, is claimed to be a passenger on the missing boat of asylum seekers . Speaking to the Tamil Refugee Council, the unidentified man appealed directly to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison for information . 'I am desperate to know where my family is. I can’t function at all not knowing. I know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to Sri Lanka,' he said. 'I want to plead with the Australian minister to stop our pain and let us know what he has done with all the kids and families on the boat. I ask him to be kind to these people. They are all very frightened. 'They cannot be sent back to Sri Lanka. Many of them will be tortured again and even killed.' The man wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals. 'I cannot understand why a country like Australia would send people back to Sri Lanka, knowing they have been tortured there. Why would they do it?' he said. An image believed to be his daughter has appeared on  the Tamil Fightback website. It was impossible to verify if the girl in the picture was on the refugee ship. A late sitting of the High Court in Sydney on Monday barred the return of the 153 asylum seekers, 48 of whom are Tamil, until 4pm Tuesday or further order of the court. Their case will be heard at the High Court in Melbourne at  2pm today. The injunction is a major blow the the government's turnback policy. Pictured is an example of type of vessel used by asylum seekers trying to enter Australia by boat . Prime Minister Tony Abbott defended the government's actions at sea saying the government had met its international obligations. But he said he was not going to comment on 'operational matters'. 'Any commentary by government members about operational matters just gives aid and comfort to the people smugglers,' he said. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also criticised Australia's decision to return the 41 asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, saying it doubted the government's brief interviews on board the boat to assess refugee claims complied with international law. The agency said its experience with shipboard processing has generally not been positive. 'Such an environment would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure,' it said in a statement. Amid reports that 41 Tamils from another boat of asylum seekers were facing criminal charges following their handover to Sri Lankan police, lawyer George Newhouse says the 153 asylum seekers are 'entitled to have their claims for protection processed in accordance with Australian law'. 'The [immigration] minister cannot simply intercept their vessel in the middle of the night and ""disappear' them,""' Mr Newhouse told AAP on Monday night. 'The asylum seekers claim that they are fleeing persecution and that they're at risk of death, torture or significant harm at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities,' Mr Newhouse said. '[There's] a need for ongoing protection.' Forty-one Sri Lankan asylum seekers from a second boat already returned by the Australian authorities reportedly face jail despite assurances from the Abbott government they were in no danger of persecution. But Mr Newhouse argues there are serious concerns for the safety of the asylum seekers if they are handed over, and is worried they will also be charged and potentially jailed. 'In Sri Lankan jails, detainees are often subjected to torture and sometimes they never reappear,' he said. 'We're talking about a boat load of women and children, and I would have thought that the minister needs to think very clearly before he sends them into Sri Lankan jail.' The group already handed over will face court in the port of Galle at an unspecified date, charged under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act, a Sri Lankan police spokesman reportedly said. A High Court injunction is preventing the return of 153 asylum seekers to Sri Lankan authorities over concerns about their safety and relatives of those reportedly on a missing boat are appealing for information . The asylum seekers were transferred in mild sea conditions off the coast of Sri Lanka after the boat was stopped west of the Cocos Islands in late June. 'The sentence for those who are proved to have left illegally is two years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine,' the spokesman said, according to Reuters. The Australian government says none of the Tamils, who were screened via video link, are in danger of persecution. 'All were screened in terms of any potential protection obligation and none were found to be owed that protection,' Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday. Refugee lawyer David Manne said it was difficult to track the fate of returned asylum seekers. 'This is part of the problem that we've seen in Sri Lanka, with people being essentially summarily expelled there without proper due process,' he told ABC TV. Opposition frontbencher Penny Wong says Labor has 'serious concerns' about the treatment of the asylum seekers.Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says the government seems to believe it is 'above the law'. 'The Australian people are becoming sick and tired of the spin, the secrecy, and the danger we're putting these people's lives in.' The court's injunction ends at 4pm on Tuesday unless it makes an order to extend it.","An interim High Court injunction is preventing the return of 153 asylum seekers to Sri Lanka .

Police confirmed the man may have made the mistake of pushing his accelerator instead of breaking, reported The Daily Telegraph. Missing the station buildings, the car passed over the platform and landed on the train tracks, between platforms two and three. Scroll down for video .

Luckily, the car did not hit anyone on the platform at the time and despite being shaken by the accident, the man was not injured. Police and rescue teams attended the scene and scrambled to work out a solution for removing the car from the tracks as quickly and safely as possible. It took several hours for crews to get the car off the tracks and a Transport for NSW spokesman said all trains were diverted onto another line and only one of the station's platforms could be used while the vehicle was being removed. At about 11.30 a crane was brought to the station to move the car and this required the removal of overhead wires, which meant engineers needed to shut power to the tracks while the car was being moved. Despite the nature of the accident, the spokesman said it caused 'minimal disruption' until about 11.30am when the crane arrived. 'They took down the wire and so there were no trains for about an hour,' the spokesman said. 'Fortunately, being a Sunday, it wasn’t as busy as it might have been.'

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Aap . A Melbourne taxi driver has been left terrified and shaken after a violent bashing attack where his passengers tried to run over him in his own cab before smashing into a pole. The 30-year-old driver named Hamid said his male and female passengers became aggressive towards him when he dropped them off in north east Melbourne and asked for the fare. 'He hit me two or three times on my face and on my head,' the father-of-two told reporters. 'They started punching on my face and on my head, and he tried to kill me.' Scroll down for video . A Melbourne taxi driver was attacked by two passengers on Saturday morning after asking for the fare . Police have released the images of the offenders aged in their mid to late 20s. A woman of Caucasian appearance, thin build with long blonde hair and who was a light-coloured woollen jumper at the time, and a man described as being of European appearance, solid build and wearing a light-coloured vest, white t-shirt and jeans . The driver picked up the couple in Brunswick Street, near the intersection of Johnson Street, in Fitzroy, about 1.20am on Saturday morning. Driving them about 12 kilometres to an apartment block in Gotha St, Heidelberg Heights, Hamid dropped the passengers off just before the intersection of Bell Street, but the pair said they had no money for the fare. At this point the passengers got out of the vehicle and told the driver they would get money from inside a block of nearby flats. Hamid asked them to leave something as security, which saw the male passenger react aggressively - repeatedly punching Hamid to the face and demanding his wallet. Refusing to hand over his wallet, the driver got out of the car and ran toward Bell Street. Cab driver Hamid, pictured, ran from the cab and the passengers drove it towards him, before smashing the car into a nearby pole . 'I was just trying to save myself in that time,' he said. 'I'm just afraid because he tried to kill me.' 'He was aggressive and saying many things, I couldn't remember all those things because I was in shock.' At this time, the male and female got into the taxi and drove it toward the victim. The offenders then drove the taxi away, before crashing into a pole on Upper Heidelberg Road near Montgomery Street and fled before police arrival. The taxi driver was treated by paramedics for facial swelling at the scene but did not require hospitalisation.

"By . Ryan Lipman . A young teenager is the latest to be injured after a faulty USB charger gave him an electric shock - sparking warnings about the dangerous items and crackdowns on businesses stocking them. On June 20, a 13-year-old boy was hurt after he connected the device to a power point behind a bed. As he pulled the charger out of the power point, the casing must have dislodged from the frame, a Fair Trading spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'He touched the live wires that were exposed.' the spokeswoman said. 'He received an electric shock and reported his arm was sore.' Scroll down for video . Consumers have been warned about the dangers from knock-off chargers which do not meet Australian safety standards after a 13-year-old boy was hurt by a USB charger last month . The charger had been given to the boy as a gift by a relative and he had it for about two months. His mother is now trying to contact the relative to find out where the charger was purchased. On Monday, the boy's mother contacted Fair Trading after learning about the death of Sheryl Aldeguer, who was electrocuted and killed by a faulty $4.99 charger in her North Gosford home. Another teenage boy, 14, was also lucky not to suffer serious injuries when an imitation USB iPod charger exploded near his head on June 20, reported The Daily Telegraph. On the back oft these latest cases of USB device-related injury, Fair Training Minister Matthew Mason-Cox has warned the public not to use any unapproved knock-off USB-style chargers and electrical articles. A stern warning has also been issued to retailers and importers who must ensure any products they are selling or importing are approved and comply with Australian standards. Fair trading inspectors have been conducting raids across Sydney and in the Wollongong areas to prevent the sale of the devices . After receiving a tip off about dangerous USB chargers being sold, Fair Trading seized unapproved travel adaptors in a Bankstown store in Sydney's west on Tuesday and also at a Haymarket store in central Sydney today. Inspectors found unapproved travel adaptors during the raids and warned the business to remove all unapproved products from sale and investigations are ongoing. 'Anyone importing or selling electrical products must be aware that they may be putting lives at risk if they sell unapproved products,' Minister Mason-Cox said. Fair Trading has the authority to stop businesses selling unsafe electrical goods and can make them recall any unsafe electrical goods. To ensure consumer safety, there are 56 classes of declared electrical articles, all of which must be approved and bear approval marks. If retailers sell, import, hire or exchange electrical goods not listed among the declared articles, they must still ensure they are safe and meet minimum safety requirements. Consumers are advised to check with suppliers to make sure electrical items comply with safety standards. Fair Trading has the authority to stop businesses selling unsafe electrical goods and can make them recall any unsafe electrical goods . Fair Trading electrical safety experts also conducted covert inspections at Dapto markets, south of Wollongong and Haymarket Paddy’s Markets in central Sydney over the weekend and inspected two importers at Auburn and Silverwater in Sydney's west in relation to the possible supply of unapproved USB chargers to market stallholders. Four stall holders at Dapto markets and two at Paddy’s Markets were selling unapproved USBs and the products were seized for inspection. Thanks to tips off from local media, raids have also been conducted at other Wollongong and Bankstown stores. Mother-of-two Sheryl Aldeguer was electrocuted and killed by a faulty charger on April 23. Her husband Luigi Aldeguer told The Daily Telegraph his wife was speaking to a friend who was in Dubai when the incident happened. The charger, which did not meet Australian safety regulations, had inadequate shielding causing 240 volts to 'arc' and pass from the charger through the phone into her body. It is believed that Mrs Aldeguer died instantly and her body, which had burns to the chest and ears, was found the following day by friends and her landlord. Sheryl Aldeguer, 28, was killed in April through a faulty phone charger. She is pictured here with husband Luigi . Police closed down a stall in Campsie in Sydney's southwest in June after a friend of Mrs Aldeguer told police that the faulty charger had been bought there. Police seized a large amount of stock, including phone chargers, power boards and travel adaptors, which were found not to meet Australian safety requirements. NSW Fair Trading Commisioner Rod Stowe said the rip-off, cheap chargers seized by the commission were low quality plastic that could melt and did not have insulation on pins or approval marks. The accessory stall in Campsie faces fines of up to $87,500 and/or two years' imprisonment and Mr Stowe said it was very likely the commission would pursue prosecution. This is the only know fatality to date that seems to be connected to the devices, but Mr Stowe said the public needed to be informed immediately to avoid further deaths. 'It's a wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards,' said NSW Fair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe. 'If the deal's too good to be true, it usually is and it can prove fatal.' Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths. 'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said. It is believed that the voltage arced and passed through the charger into Mrs Aldeguer's body while she was talking on the phone . Police initially suspected Mrs Aldeguer was killed by her laptop, which she was also using at the time of her death. As well as talking on the phone, Mrs Aldeguer was wearing headphones, which were plugged into her laptop. The laptop was also plugged into a charger. It is believed the voltage completed its circuit by travelling from the faulty charger into the phone, into her body, then through her headphones into her laptop and then through the computer charger back into the wall. Ms Collins said that even without the laptop the incident could have proved fatal. Police in the Brisbane Waters Local Area command are investigating the woman's death and did not want to release more information about the death. Consumers who have already bought non-approved USB-style chargers for phones or tablets are advised to bend the pins on the chargers and throw them away immediately. People are also warned not to use devices while they are charging or plugged in. Anyone with more information about the dodgy chargers should contact Fair Trading on 13 32 20.","A young teenage boy is the latest injured by a faulty USB charger .

The finding due to sulforaphane naturally occurring in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, which may help protect against respiratory inflammation that can cause asthma. 'In Australia, asthma affects one in ten people and it's something that is on the rise,' said University of Melbourne honours student Nadia Mazarakis, who undertook research on the topic with supervisor Dr Tom Karagiannis.

Sulforaphane occurs naturally in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables and may help protect against respiratory inflammation that can cause asthma, which one in ten people in Australia . Broccoli is high in vitamin A and C, vitamin B-6 and contains iron, calcium and dietary fiber. Part of the cabbage family and is also believed to have anti-carcinogenic properties. Laboratory testing by the university also revealed eating vegetables from the cruciferous family, including kale, cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and bok choy, reduces and even reverses lung damage. 'Our research could help those people in particular that are resistant to the current treatment options,' Dr Karagiannis said. Ms Mazarakis said the research was still in the experimental phase and during an asthma attack or severe breathing issues normal medical advice must be followed. Kale has recently had a massive resurgence in popularity due to is 'superfood' qualities and high nutritional value. Extremely rich in vitamin A and C, K and in calcium, iron and beta carotene, the high in fiber vegetable is also low in caloriesm has no fat and is also full of antioxidants.

"By . Ryan Lipman . One Pound Jimmy: The stamp features  Indigenous Australian Gwoya Jungarai and was first issued in 1950. The shape of his head as it appears on the stamp was used to create the shape of a pool and open space of roof in a futuristic north Queensland home . Nestled deep in Queensland's Daintree rainforest sits a futuristic pod-like six-bedroom house on a man-made lake, inspired by its owners' passion for stamp collecting. Influenced by stamps inside and out, the centrepiece of the home is a swimming pool in the middle of the structure, based on the figure head of the One Pound Jimmy stamp. Dubbed the stamp house by architect Charles Wright, who designed it, he said the influences evolved after a conversation with his stamp collector clients and owners Rodney and Marider Perry. 'It's Rod's favourite Australian stamp - it's not particularly valuable I don't think, it's just one of his favourite, so the figure head in the in the stamp was used to create the central focus feature of the house,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The One Pound Jimmy was a stamp featuring Gwoya Jungarai, who was the first Indigenous Australian to be featured on a stamp when it was first issued in 1950. A picture of him is also featured on the $2 coin. The figure head shape is reflected in the open court yard roof above the pool and the cut out gardened area around it. 'The stamp idea is central, it's all about how spaces oscillate around the pool'. With each of the bedrooms in the pod-like arms of the building opening to the pool and courtyard area, this strikes a balance between the public and private areas of the house, Mr Wright said. The stamp-theme continues onto the exterior of the building, where perforations based stamp sheets cover the concrete steel-reinforced cyclone proof walls. 'It's almost as if the house has been gift wrapped,' Mr Wright said. Because the house is located in a lake, the exterior and the perforations are reflected back into the building. Located on 26 hectares and with a 600-metre private beach front, one of northern Queensland's largest, the man-made lake was inspired by Marider, who is originally from the Philippines, and the long tradition of South East Asian and Filipino people living over water. The 'stamp house' was inspired inside and out after conversations between the architect and the stamp collector owners and architect Charles Wright's unique design won the top award at the Queensland Architecture Awards on Friday and will go on to compete at the national competition . Centrepiece: The focal point of the home is a swimming pool based on the figure head of the One Pound Jimmy postage stamp issued in the 1950s. The stamp is owner Rodney Perry's favourite, and the shape is used in the roof of the open air courtyard and a cut out garden area around the pool . Mr Wright said this was another example of how his conversations with his clients, who gave him no brief, influenced the design of the house and how these were extrapolated into a larger idea. The lake also enables the surrounding forest to be reflected back into the house. Because of its sensitive location, the house is 100 per cent 'green' and completely off grid with no power, water or sewer. This sees it produce its own electricity, water and process waste including sewerage. 'It generates all of its own renewable energy through solar,' Mr Wright said. 'There are solar panels... and batteries. The house harvests all its own water through the roof and treats all of its own waste. Its carbon neutral in operation,' Mr Wright said. The water harvesting facility is located under the swimming pool. Mr Wright said the house's pod-like form was was based on a resort-style prototype based on relationship between public and private spaces within the home. On Friday, the house was awarded the Robin Dods Award for Residential Architecture - House (New) at the Australian Institute of Architects' Queensland Architecture Awards, the top award of the night. Mr Wright said winning was amazing. 'We were thrilled the result - the recognition from our peers that it was all worthy of what we were trying to do,' he said. Despite the house receiving its occupancy certification in December 2012, with the finishing touches still being completed after this date, Mr Wright did not enter it into the competition until this year. The exterior of the home also reflects the owner's passion for stamp collecting, with the perforated walls based on stamp sheets and creating a 'gift wrapped' effect . Called Alkira by its owners, the house is set on 26 hectares is currently for sale and due to be relisted for $25 million. The property also features about 600 metres of beach front, one of the biggest private beaches in north Queensland . The win will see the house entered into the National Architecture Awards to be announced in Darwin on November 6, against other winners from each state and territory. 'I don't know what it's up against... but national-level is pretty high so I'm sure there will be a range of high-quality homes vying to win. The competition will be tough.' Mr Wright, said both the clients and the five-year project were 'one in a million'. 'All our projects, we like them to be about the clients or the organisation we are dealing with.' He added that the clients' interests directly influence his firm's work. He said his clients were also 'thrilled with the finished product'. 'It's amazing that the original concept and design is what that have got - and they are loving it.' 'From our point of view its great. We had this idea that was a bit way out all these years ago and to have it now finished and crystallised into reality us quite unique.' Building a house in the middle of the Daintree rainforest meant there was an 'extensive' planning and approval process to build in such a sensitive area, but Mr Wright said it was 'worth it in the end'. Called Alkira, by its owners, the house is for sale and is due to be relisted for about $15 million. It is currently lived in and also available to be rented as an executive retreat and is believed to have cost the owners about $9 million to purchase the land and build the house. Mr Wright's firm, Charles Wright Architects was established 10 years ago and he has worked as an architect for about 14 years. Originally from Melbourne, the 39-year-old is based in Port Douglas in Queensland. With the house located on a man-made lake inspired by South East Asian floating homes, the reflection of the perforated exterior reflects back into the building, as does the lush Daintree forest surrounding it .

"By . Aap . and Ryan Lipman . Troubled former State of Origin player Blake Ferguson has been banned from pubs, clubs and bottleshops at his appeal hearing in Sydney. The judge upheld Ferguson's guilt over a 2013 indecent assault charge but set aside his conviction on the provision that he stay away from alcohol outlets and seek counselling for alcohol abuse. The 24-year-old former Canberra and Cronulla winger was convicted in December of groping a 24-year-old woman's crotch during a boozy night out at Cronulla's 2230 nightclub. Scroll down for video . Blake Ferguson has been banned from pubs, clubs and bottleshops after trying to appeal a two-year good behaviour bond . The incident occurred on June 16, 2013 as Ferguson celebrated his selection for the NSW Origin side with state teammate, Josh Dugan. Ferguson was handed a two-year good behaviour bond in February and immediately launched an appeal. Sydney District Court Judge Michael Finnane on Thursday reduced Ferguson's good behaviour bond to one year. 'Alcohol is an enemy for you, not a friend,' Judge Finnane told Ferguson. Judge Finnane said he was prepared to lessen the punishment, in part, because of Ferguson's 'deprived' and Aboriginal background. Ferguson was convicted in December of groping a 24-year-old woman's crotch during a boozy night out at Cronulla's 2230 nightclub and had hoped to make a playing comeback with the Roosters next season .

Launches appeal . June 26, 2014: On appeal, Ferguson was given a conditional discharge and no conviction recorded. His good behaviour bond was reduced to one year and he was banned from wholesale and retail alcohol outlets . He said he accepted Ferguson did not touch the woman on the vagina but on the upper thigh under her dress. 'Touching a woman under her dress in that area is an indecent assault, therefore I find the charge proven,' he added. 'What he did was reckless.' Ferguson was sacked by the Raiders and dumped from the NSW Origin side last year following a string of off-field misdemeanours and a well-documented battle with alcohol. In May he joined the Sydney Roosters in a non-playing, community and youth coaching role. Ferguson had hoped to make a playing comeback with the Roosters next season. The NRL said it would take Thursday's ruling and a range of other behavioural factors into account when considering any club's request to re-register him. 'We'd have to review any contract before deciding whether he was re-registered with the league,' an NRL spokesman said. Ferguson's fall from grace has been spectacular over the past 12 months after he burst onto the scene aged 18 and in 2011 was Canberra's top try scorer. Ferguson's lawyer Greg James QC said his client's troubles had been devastating and outlined his long battles with alcohol. Mr James said Ferguson was trying to stay off the booze and said he had the potential to restart his playing career. Ferguson left the court without commenting to the waiting media.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The U.S. Marines have shown off their new amphibious vehicle designed to storm beaches, transport troops and scale buildings. The Ultra Heavy-lift Amphibious Connector (Uhac) was unveiled at the Marine Corps Training Area Bellows in Hawaii during a month-long training and demonstration exercise. When it enters service at an unknown date the final vehicle will have a top speed of about 25 miles (40 km) per hour and be capable of scaling obstacles such as sea walls 10 feet (three metres) high. Scroll down for video . The U.S. Navy has tested a prototype of its Ultra Heavy-lift Amphibious Connector (Uhac), shown, created by Navatek Ltd and the Office of Naval Research. The vehicle uses large air-filled foam paddles that allow it to not only traverse water but also climb over obstacles on land without leaving much of a mark . This particular vehicle on show was a half-scale prototype of the eventual Uhac. It was shown as part of the Marine Corps Warfighting laboratory during the at-sea phase of the Rim of the Pacific (Rimpac) 2014 exercise. This involved 22 nations, more than 40 ships and submarines, 25,000 personnel and more than 200 aircraft in demonstrations of new and existing technologies and procedures. The half-scale version, made of aluminium, measured in at 42 feet (13 metres) long, 26 feet (eight metres) wide and 17 feet (five metres) high. Length: 84 feet (25 metres) Height: 34 feet (10 metres) Top speed: 25 miles (40 kilometres) Range: 200 miles (320 kilometres) Cargo capacity: 200 tons . Service entry data: TBA . The full-scale Uhac will be able to carry the equivalent of three M1A1 tanks, or cargo weighing up to 200 tons, at speeds of 25 miles (40 kilometres) per hour. It will ultimately be 84 feet (25 metres) long, 34 feet (10 metres) high and have a range of 200 miles (320 kilometres). The Uhac model consists of two tracks that are composed of dozens of air-filled foam blocks, which gives the vehicle the propulsion it needs for land and sea travel. In the water the tracks act as paddles but on land they are similar to a tank, letting it traverse across difficult terrain such as mud and sand. They also barely leave an impression on the ground as they flatten out on impact with a hard surface; in a demonstration the huge vehicle moved over a tar road without leaving a mark. In a test Uhac drove to the USS Rushmore, picked up an assault vehicle and took it back to shore.

In the water the tracks act as paddles but on land they are similar to a tank, letting it traverse across difficult terrain such as mud and sand . Although the final version will be bigger overall it will have a lower profile, as the elevated ‘cab’ will be removed. While the prototype can only go five miles (eight kilometres) per hour on water, the final version will be about five times faster. That’s half the speed of the Navy’s hovercraft known as the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), but the latter isn’t as adept as the UHAC of moving over tough terrain. ‘It has taken a number of years of development to get to this point,’ said Dr Frank Leban, program officer at the Office of Naval Research. ‘Over the past year the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab has gotten involved and they are looking at trying to put this technology in an operational context. ‘They have been coming up with vignettes and scenarios on how the UHAC can be used.’ Commander Thomas Stephens, commanding officer of the USS Rushmore, added: 'There was generally some degree of apprehension since it is a new and unfamiliar piece of equipment and how it would operate with the ship. 'At the same time, there was an excitement about being in a position to assist in the development of something significant like UHAC.'

When a New Jersey girl learned that someone scrawled graffiti in her hometown making fun of her body, the 14-year-old decided to turn a mark of shame into a source of pride and inspiration. Instead of brushing off the offensive writing referring to her rear end, 14-year-old Carleigh O'Connell, of Wall, marched down to the beach where the tag was left and posed with it for a selfie. 'I wanted to show whoever decided to write that that I was stronger than that,’ she told TODAY.com. ‘It didn't impact me at all. I didn't put my head down, I didn't cry about it. I didn't give the kids the power they wanted.' Ready for her closeup: When Carleigh O'Connell, 14, heard that someone left a tag making fun of her body, she marched down there and posed for a selfie with the offensive graffiti . The high school student said she had been teased about her body in the past, so when her friend told her that someone spray-painted the words 'carleighs a**' on a cement block near the local beach, she knew at once it was about her. With her mind made up, Carleigh went down to the beach dressed in a bikini, stood on top of the defaced rock with her back to the camera and posed for a picture. Her mother told BuzzFeed said that at first the teen snapped a photo with her face turned away, but later decided to flash a smile for the camera to show her tormentors that she has nothing to be ashamed of. 'It felt very empowering,' Carleigh told TODAY of the experience. 'It felt really good.' Carleigh’s mother, Daryl Lynn O'Connell, was proud of her daughter for taking a stand against bullies. She posted the teen's photo on her Facebook page and asked her friends to share it as many times as possible. 'I . hope it travels across the country and can help one teenager who is . bullied or the victim of hurtful things,' the mother wrote.

"By . Snejana Farberov . In the hot seat: Scott Kveton, 40, the CEO of a Portland start-up, has been accused by his ex-girlfriend of repeatedly raping her . The CEO of a prominent Oregon tech start-up is being investigated for sexual assault after his ex-girlfriend came forward accusing him of repeatedly raping her. Scott Kveton, the head of the Portland-based Urban Airship, has been publicly accused by his former paramour of being involved in a complicated physical relationship reminiscent of the bestselling erotica novel '50 Shades of Grey.' Mr Kveton’s former girlfriend, who is not being named, provided a heap of emails and text messages to the police and the newspaper The Oregonian detailing her and Kveton's twisted love affair. Kveton’s . attorney, Stephen Houzer, has released a statement asking the media and . the general public to accord his client 'the presumption of innocence . that is the cornerstone of our system of American justice, a concept . that can be so easily destroyed by the sensational reporting of . salacious and unproven allegations.’ Meanwhile, . Urban Airship declined to address the controversy surrounding the CEO, . only stating that 'it’s clearly a very personal, private matter for . Scott.' As the 34-year-old accuser described to investigators, she and the 40-year-old CEO engaged in sexual role-playing and pushed each other's buttons. But in numerous emails and text messages sent to Kveton, the lover claimed that he had gone too far. The police investigation into allegations of sex assault revolves around incidents that took place in 2012 and 2013. Mr Kveton has not been arrested or charged in connection to these allegations. Prior to that, Kveton's ex-girlfriend reached out to police in 2010 and 2011 accusing the tech CEO of sexual abuse, but he has not been charged with any crime. Geek squad: Kveton (second right), pictured with his friends and fellow co-founder of Urban Airship, which specializes in sending push notifications for companies like ESPN and MSNBC . The bespectacled, bow tie-wearing Mr Kveton has been cultivating a family-friendly image, describing himself on his website and social media accounts as an  'entrepreneur, bacon lover and proud father.' Kveton and his current girlfriend, Sarah Tuthill, are raising his two children. The Oregon State University graduate has been getting glowing reviews for his stewardship of Urban Airship - a mobile marketing company that sends push notifications to smartphones promoting such brands as ESPN.com, Groupon and MSNBC. He co-founded the tech firm with his friends five years ago after spending 12 years working as an engineer for several tech companies, including Amazon and Vidoop. Only last month, Forbes published a highly flattering profile of Mr Kventon, marveling at his ability to raise $46million in venture funding from high-profile backers. Unfaithful: Kveton and his accuser met online in 2008 and started dating while they were both married to other people; for a time, the woman worked as his family's nanny . Dark side: According to the 34-year-old former lover, Kveton was into role-playing sex games, which involved other women . The article tracing Kveton's meteoric rise in the tech world laid out his credentials as a team leader and a marketing visionary; it also mentioned a few early failures, including the time he was fired from his first stint as a CEO. The Forbes piece concluded with Kveton revealing that he hopes one day to take his firm public. But last week's article in The Oregonian tells a very different story about the tech wunderkind. Text messages and chat room exchanges between Kveton and his ex-girlfriend suggest that the two had a turbulent relationship. Some of Kveton's missives allude to the fact that he may have videotaped sexual acts with the woman without her permission. The couple's correspondence lays bare Kveton's alleged sexual proclivities, which included sex games with several women he had met online, one of them nicknamed 'Goldilocks,' and trips to a Portland swingers club. According to his 34-year-old accuser, she first met Kveton online in 2008, and their relationship lasted off and on for five years until their final split in 2013. Family man: Kveton is pictured with his current girlfriend, Sarah, and his two children . When they first started dating, Kveton and the woman were married to other people, and for a time the lover was employed as a nanny for the CEO's family. The first allegation against Kveton dates back to February 2010. The girlfriend told police that Kveton raped her as she slept on the couch in his home after a night of drinking. In the days after the alleged assault, Kveton sent the woman a number of emails apologizing for what happened. ‘Believe me, the concept of not having you in my life absolutely and utterly makes my heart ache,’ according to an email from Kveton obtained by the paper.  ‘... and I can't believe how I treated you the other night ... I just felt so betrayed and hurt that night with all of the things you were saying ... that doesn't justify it whatsoever ... I'm just hurt and for some reason I took it out on you in that awful way.’ In other messages, Mr Kveton indicated that the sex act may have been recorded on video, prompting the woman to obtain a restraining order against him. Tech rock star: Kveton has been getting glowing reviews for his business leadership . The order was later thrown out, and the couple eventually picked up where they left off. A year later, the girlfriend contacted police once again accusing Kveton of ambushing her in a closet and wrapping her in a bear hug, after which he allegedly dragged her into a bedroom and tied her up by the wrists. Scott Kveton was interviewed about the incident by police, but he denied the allegations and the prosecutors declined to charge him. The 34-year-old accuser has made three more similar allegations against Kveton in connection to incidents in 2012 and 2013, which police are now investigating. The Kveton saga is only the latest in a series of sex scandals involving successful businessmen. Last month, the founder and CEO of American Apparel was terminated over allegations of sexual misconduct. Just days ago, Justin Mateen, the co-founder of the dating app Tinder, was suspended over sexual harassment claims made by a former employee. In April, GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner was forced to resign over 'errors of judgment' also related to sexual harassment.","Scott Kveton, 40, is co-founder and CEO of mobile marketing startup Urban Airship based out of Portland, Oregon .
