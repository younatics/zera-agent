"By . James Salmon . House prices have grown at their fastest pace since the financial crisis, fuelling fears that the Help to Buy scheme is inflating a new property bubble. In the latest sign of recovery in the housing market, an influential report from Hometrack has found that three quarters of postcodes registered price gains this year. This is up from just a fifth last year. Across England and Wales, average prices rose by 4.4 per cent to £206,726 – the highest registered by Hometrack since October 2007 and a rebound from last year’s 0.3 per cent fall. House prices have grown at their fastest pace since the financial crisis, fuelling fears that the Help to Buy scheme is inflating a new property bubble . By far the biggest gains were in London and the south east, with average prices growing 9.1 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. The average price of a house in London is now £422,860, and Hertfordshire has the next highest average at £340,333. Demand for housing also soared by 25 per cent, the fastest pace for three years, while the supply of new homes fell to a record low, increasing just 6 per cent. The report said it expected ‘the momentum in house price growth to spill over into 2014 by a continued lack of supply and rising demand’. The huge inbalance lends weight to concerns that the housing market is overheating following the introduction of the Government’s Help to Buy Scheme in April, which was launched to help those with small deposits get their foot on the property ladder. But over the next fortnight leading forecasters are expected to show that the housing market has been turbo-charged by the Help to Buy scheme and a glut of cheap mortgage deals. Halifax’s latest index is expected to show prices rose 8.1 per cent in the year to December, the fastest since October 2007. Meanwhile, Nationwide is set to predict growth of 7.1 per cent, which would be the best since June 2010. This raft of data is likely to be latched on by critics of Help to Buy, ranging from business secretary Vince Cable to former Bank of England governor Lord King. They argue that Help to Buy is artificially driving up house prices – particularly in London and the south east – because there are not enough homes to cope with soaring demand. The Institute for Public Policy Research, the prominent left-leaning think-tank, also warned this weekend that the Chancellor ‘risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the Help to Buy scheme’. It fears a repeat of the massive build-up of household debt before 2008, which contributed to the financial crisis. But supporters of the scheme – including David Cameron – have played down the concerns.The Hometrack report shows a stark north-south divide in the housing market. The north was the only region to see a drop in prices, of 0.5 per cent, while homeowners in the north east experienced an average rise of just 0.5 per cent. In Merseyside the average house is now £149,300 and in Teesside it is £141,400. Hometrack said a ‘broader based recovery in the housing market is dependent on growth in the real economy, jobs and household incomes’.","Hometrack report found three quarters of postcodes registered price gains .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . It's an important moment in any courtship – when a woman first claps eyes on her boyfriend’s bachelor  pad. Will it be clean and tidy? Will it be decorated with any semblance of taste? Daisy Uribe-Mosquera needn’t have worried when she set foot inside her future husband Philip’s flat for the first  time. With its stylish vaulted ceilings and vast kitchen/living room, Daisy, 34, a marketing executive at auctioneers Sotheby’s, couldn’t have failed to be impressed. Banker Philip, 30, might also have pointed out that the flat played a role in the Second World War. It is on the fourth floor of a former factory called the Old Aeroworks, in St John’s Wood, North London, that used to make parts for Spitfire fighters and Lancaster bombers. Ultimate bachelor pad: The two-bedroom London apartment is on the market for £925,000 . What’s more, the building was converted into a residential block by architect Sir Terry Farrell – who designed London’s MI6 building on the Thames at Vauxhall Cross. He was so pleased with the Old Aeroworks that he now lives in another of the apartments. The couple are reluctantly selling Philip’s ultimate bachelor pad for £925,000 as they want a family-orientated home. The Old Aeroworks was built in the 1920s and was one of the first all-concrete buildings in Britain. It was originally owned by Bovis Homes and used to construct whole houses via timber transported along the nearby Grand Union Canal. When the Blitz began in 1940, the Government requisitioned the building to house  the Palmer Tyre Company’s aeroworks, which was producing parts for RAF warplanes in the heavily targeted London Docks. Classic work: The Old Aeroworks was built in the 1920s and designed by MI6 building architect Sir Terry Farrell . Spacious: The master bedroom in the flat in North London's St John's Wood . War jet: The former factory in St John¿s Wood, North London, used to make parts for Spitfire fighters (pictured) and Lancaster bombers . Since the surroundings were residential rather than industrial, it was less likely to be a priority target for German bombers. Braking . systems, tyres, wheels and gun turrets were made in the factory but, . owing to the secrecy of the operation, the workers were never told what . they were going to be used for. Anyone passing the building today would  be left in no doubt about what was once going on inside this Art Deco block. There are seven Spitfire models on the roof and a plaque to commemorate the Palmer Tyre Company’s production of the legendary fighter. Sir Terry Farrell is a particular fan of the Spitfire, saying it inspired him as a design icon. ‘The Spitfire continually evolved throughout the war,’ he has said. ‘By 1945 it was 30 to 40 per cent faster than at the beginning. That strikes a chord with my approach to architecture – evolving and innovating, but remaining true to the original spirit.’ Nothing could demonstrate this more than the Old Aeroworks itself and Daisy and Philip’s two-bedroom flat. Moving out: Daisy Uribe-Mosquera, 34, and her future husband Philip, 30, are selling the flat to more to a more 'family orientated' home . The design exploits the building’s generous dimensions – the rooms are airy and spacious and feature a uniform style of clean lines and white finishes. The couple agree that Daisy merely ‘softened a few edges’ when she moved in. ‘As a space to live in, the flat couldn’t work better – there are two evenly sized bedrooms and a great area for lounging or eating in,’ says Philip. ‘The spare room’s great for extra rent if you need it, or for a child or just somewhere for your other half to keep her clothes.’ The couple will particularly miss the  area, which is not renowned for family-size houses but is cosmopolitan – it’s a stone’s throw from the Edgware Road with its  Arabic restaurants. It’s also very convenient for the centre of London, and Philip and Daisy say they love having the canal and Regent’s Park so close. Rose Holden, sales manager at Marsh & Parsons’ Little Venice branch, said: ‘This apartment represents industrial chic at its very best. ‘It is just so characterful and would be an ideal space for an individual who likes something that is very much out of the ordinary. ‘The space has so much recent history that it must be unique among London’s housing stock, and the fact that it is home to one of London’s leading contemporary architects adds huge interest.’ marshandparsons.co.uk, 020 7993 3050 .","Four-floor lat is located in World War II factory that made Spitfires .

"By . James Rush . A police detective who helped to capture the leader of the Great Train Robbery is having to sell his 18th-century farm house after being convicted of damaging it 17 years ago. Former Detective Chief Inspector Brian McNeil was convicted following a five-day trial which cost more than £18,300 after he replaced a wooden box-winder spiral staircase with a straight one during renovations. A court heard Long Lease Farm at Hawsker, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, was 'unfit for human habitation' when Mr McNeil, who helped arrested Great Train Robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds, bought it in 1996 and spent £250,000 saving it from ruin. Mr McNeil, 76, and wife Jillian, 71, have now put the Grade Two listed property on the market to pay the £23,600 legal bill following their conviction. Brian McNeil and his wife Jillian have put their house up for sale after being convicted of damaging it 17 years ago by replacing a spiral staircase . The court at Scarborough heard how McNeil had offered to replace the spiral staircase as far back as 1999 - but there was then a dispute about which way round it should turn. McNeil wanted it facing to the right to prevent the steps coming up through the floor of his newly remodelled bathroom. But planning bosses at the North York Moors National Park insisted on the traditional turn to the left to preserve the original lay-out of the rooms. The couple denied failing to comply with an enforcement notice originally served in 1998. But they were convicted after a five-day trail costing more than £18,300 at Scarborough Magistrates Court. Mr McNeil, originally from Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, was fined £5,000 and his wife £1,500. They were each ordered to pay £8,553 court costs. During the renovations, ex-Scotland Yard officer Mr McNeil removed the wooden box-winder spiral staircase in the hallway and replaced it with a straight one . The couple have now put the Grade Two listed property on the market to pay the £23,600 legal bill . The couple are now planning on selling the house, but even if they could afford to stay on they still have to fix the staircase - which could cost another £20,000. District Judge Adrian Lower called the case a 'sorry saga' and said it would have cost the couple less money if they had carried out the work in the first place. Mr McNeil was a top 'thief catcher' whose career highlights included helping Tommy Butler arrest Great Train Robbery mastermind Bruce Reynolds (pictured) He understood how the couple must feel . 'frustrated and let down' by the rejection of a string of compromise . plans by the national park. But the couple were guilty under planning law - which might be seen as 'strict and Draconian' but was laid down by Parliament, he added. Anthony Eastwood, defending, said: 'This is not a case where someone has acquired a national treasure with almost irreplaceable visual aspect which has been vandalised. 'They have restored a derelict property to a thing of relative beauty which is an asset to the national park.' After the hearing Mr McNeil branded the verdict 'outrageous' and a 'travesty of justice'. Mrs McNeil, who said she expected a not guilty verdict, added: 'I’m not shocked. I’m just very angry.' The National Park has refused a Freedom of Information request to say how much the saga - involving three appeals, a full blown public inquiry and 16 years of legal proceedings - has cost. But the McNeils claim the cost to tax payers runs into six figures. Mr McNeil recalled: 'The staircase fell apart when we took it out. It was only held together with fence stakes.' He dumped the wreckage in the cow shed. It was in half a dozen pieces by this time and ended up on a bonfire. Bruce Reynolds handcuffed to two policemen for a court appearance in November 1968 . The country was left stunned after a train was hijacked and robbed 35 miles from its London destination in August 1963. A 17-strong gang launched the raid on the overnight service from Glasgow at the Bridego Railway Bridge in Ledburn, Buckinghamshire in the early hours of August 8 in what has been dubbed the 'crime of the century'. Led by the charismatic Bruce Reynolds, the group of criminals pulled off the notorious heist, making off with £2.6million - the equivalent of £40million today. The train was stopped at a set of fixed signals which the gang had switched, leading driver Jack Mills to go and investigate. He was knocked out by an iron bar wielded by an unknown member of the gang, forcing him to give up work, and he died seven years later. Following an outcry over Charmian Biggs cashing in on her husband's crime by selling her story to the Press, the Daily Mail sponsored a fund to help Mills's family, raising more than £34,000 by the time of his death. The bulk of the huge haul has never been recovered. The gang shared out the proceeds at isolated Leatherslade Farm - Biggs taking around £148,000 - but thereafter things started to go badly wrong, with nearly all the gang members being rounded up by the police. In fact, the Leatherslade Farm hide-out was a huge mistake on the part of the gang. The police were telling reporters that they were looking for an isolated farm which had just changed hands and which was 25 miles from the scene of the crime. Leatherslade met every one of these requirements. When the gang became aware that the police were hot on their scent, they quit the farm hurriedly, leaving behind scores of tell-tale fingerprints. Most of the ringleaders were quickly rounded up, and 11 of the robbers got jail sentences ranging from 14 to 30 years.","Brian McNeil and wife Jillian convicted of damaging 18th century home .

"By . James Rush . A derelict police station which used to house scores of police officers and dozens of prisoners is expected to fetch up to £1.5million after going up for sale. The three-storey building used to serve as the main police station for Poole, Dorset, until 2009 when the force moved to a state-of-the-art HQ nearby.

"By . Ruth Styles . Foam rubber might not be the obvious choice of material for a bookshelf but for Dutch designer Dewi van de Klomp, it has proved to be perfect. The designer, who is based in Utrecht, has created a series of 'soft cabinets' which work much like normal ones but change shape depending on what you put in them. The heavier the books, curios or trinkets, the more her amazing Dali style creations appear to be melting. Metamorphosis: The cabinet looks innocuous without books but transforms once they are added . Dewi, who says her work was inspired by the look of protective foam spray, says that the cabinets are an attempt to persuade people to see the cheap and cheerful material in a whole new light. 'Foam rubber is a well known material but doesnâ€™t get the attention that it deserves,' Dewi explained to MailOnline. 'With the Soft Cabinets, I am trying to increase the value [of foam rubber] through an unusual use of the material. 'I wanted to show the material in its pure form without a covering and embrace the [visible] changes in the material caused by use and time.' Young talent: Dewi, who is based in the Dutch city of Utrecht, will show her cabinets at Dutch Design Week . Choices: The limited edition cabinets come in a choice of sizes and a range of different colours . Although the cabinets will not go on . sale until the end of the year, they will be displayed at Dutch Design . Week in Eindhoven at the end of October. The cabinets, of which a limited number will be made, come in a range of colours including turquoise, green and Dewi's favourite, blush pink. 'My love for the material grew after seeing a piece of pink foam rubber and increased after a visit to a producer, called Recticel,' Dewi explains. 'I'm not professor in a laboratory who is looking for the newest technology - I look at what already exists. I'm fascinated by details that are unnoticed or forgotten.' Variety: Each cabinet is unique with the eventual look dependent on what is stored in it .","The 'soft cabinet' is the brainchild of Dewi van de Klomp from Utrecht .

"By . Liz Hull . It is the second most expensive street in Britain, with some of the most sought after properties in the country. But behind the doors of many of the mansions on so-called Billionaires Row, in The Bishops Avenue, north London, there is little in the way of opulence and luxury. It is estimated that a third of the homes, worth an estimated £350million, are in a terrible state of disrepair after lying vacant for a quarter of a century. Scroll down for video . Crumbling: An abandoned ballroom in one of the houses along the so-called Billionaire's Row on The Bishops Avenue, north London . Ferns creeping up a once-grand staircase. The house is supposedly owned by the Saudi Royal family . Some are derelict after being left to the mercy of the elements, with water streaming down the walls of former ballrooms, collapsed ceilings around chandeliers, ferns and other plants growing up staircases and out of roofs. In others, rubble and bird droppings, as well as the carcasses of dead pigeons litter the floor. Houses on the street are out of the price range of most Londoners and instead attract wealthy buyers from overseas. The empty buildings include a row of 10 mansions, worth £73m, which are thought to be owned by members of the Saudi royal family, supposedly purchased between 1989 and 1993 as boltholes to escape the turbulence in the Middle East during Saddam Hussain’s dictatorship in Iraq. Empty: The Towers - one of the properties thought to belong to the Saudi royals that has been left to rot . Also empty is 14-bedroomed Heath Hall, which was built for the founder of the Tate & Lyle sugar empire, and is currently on sale for £65million. Of those that are occupied, some are used infrequently by their owners for short periods each year, with residents complaining that there is little in the way of a ‘community.’ Most are registered to companies in tax havens including the British Virgin Islands, Curaçao, the Bahamas, Panama, and the Channel Islands, meaning their foreign owners were able to remain anonymous and avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in stamp duty when they were purchased. Egyptian-born Dr Magdy Adib Ishak-Hannah, a surgeon and businessman who has rented a home on the road for seven years, said he had never met his neighbours and reckoned only three of the houses were occupied full-time. Expensive: The expansive Jersey House is on sale for £40million . Dryades, pictured, went on sale for £30million after being repossessed from its owner- a Pakistani minister . Another resident, an Iranian who asked not to be named, said: ‘Ninety-five per cent of the people who live here don’t actually live here. It is a terrible place to live really. It is very boring and the road is very busy. I don’t think many people want to live in such big houses anyway.’ Property developer Anil Varma, who is renovating the former Saudi homes, told the Guardian that the area had become ‘one of the most expensive wastelands in the world.’ ‘Not many true local residents live on the road,’ he said. ‘It is the likes of the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Brunei. They buy a property and don’t do anything with it. No one has lived in some of these homes for 25 years and they are decaying. ‘When we did the searches on some of them the water authorities said they had no records of any water being used.’ £34million Stratheden is another home on 'Billionaires' Row' which is not being lived in . Pricey: The beautiful Heath Hall is on the market for £65million . There are more than 700,000 empty houses in England but politicians are divided on how they can be used to solve the national housing shortage, which is increasing by an estimated 100,000 homes a year. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, put himself on a collision course with the Government when he called for higher council tax for owners who fail to live in or rent out their properties for more than two years, saying ‘London homes aren’t ... just blocks of bullion in the sky.’ David Ireland, chief executive of the Homes from Empty Homes campaign group, said The Bishops Avenue epitomised ‘everything that is wrong with the London housing market.’ ‘The high values are being used as an extreme investment vehicle at the expense of homes being homes,’ he said. Around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty . ‘London’s shortage of homes is so great that this feels immoral and dysfunctional. There are countless people in inadequate housing and here are homes on The Bishops Avenue that could be used.’ But estate agents say high vacancy rates in London, which attracts wealthy property buyers come from all over the world, are inevitable. Trevor Abrahmsohn, founder of Glentree Estates, who has overseen more than 100 house sales on The Bishops Avenue over the past 40 years, said any attempt to interfere with what owners do with their property would be wrong. ‘One of the things people love about this country is its freedom and liberal views,’ he said. ‘You can’t start affecting what people do with their assets. That is sacrosanct.’","Many mansions on exclusive north London street left in state of disrepair .

"By . Michael Zennie . An American tourist has caused outrage in Florence, Italy, after accidentally snapping a finger off a priceless 600-year-old statue of the Virgin Mary at a museum. The unnamed tourist, a 55-year-old from New Fairfield, Connecticut, was attempting to comparing his finger to that on a marble sculpture at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Museum of the Works of the Cathedral) when the digit broke off. A security guard spotted the tourist and tried to stop him, but it was too late. Oops: An American tourist broke the pinky finger off a 600-year-old marble statue at a Florentine museum over the weekend. A museum administrator said the repair of the statue will be exceedingly complex . The sculpture, seen here before the accident, was created in the 14th or 15th century by Florentine Giovanni d'Ambrogio . The American, originally from Missouri and who was on holiday with his wife and another couple at the time of the mishap, was mortified and apologized profusely, fearing prosecution and a massive fine for damaging the historic piece of work. The sculpture was created in the 14th or 15th century by Florentine Giovanni d'Ambrogio. Timothy Verdon, an American who is the head of the Diocesan Office of Sacred Art and Church Cultural Heritage and the Cathedral Foundation Museum in Florence, condemned his countryman's behavior. He said the damaged finger was not an original, but was actually recast later. He said he is not sure how much the repair would cost - or whether it was even possible. The broken statue was sculpted by Florentine Giovanni d'Ambrogio. The finger itself was a cast, installed after the sculpting of the original . The statue is housed at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, next to the legendary Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore . 'In a globalized world like ours, the fundamental rules for visiting a museum have been forgotten, that is, ""Do not touch the works,""' he fumed. Many of the most precious works in Florence are actually kept away from the public under lock and key - with casts set out in museums. The originals that are available for public viewing are kept under close guard.

A dog owner was arrested after he broke his puppy's front two legs with a sledgehammer. Lyman Kenneth Morkunas was arrested on suspicion of felony animal abuse last Friday. Friends of the man brought the dog to a veterinarian when he refused to help the animal after the sustained beating. Morkunas had reportedly bragged about using a 16-pound hammer to break up a fight between the puppy and an older dog in Mesa, Arizona. The dog's two front legs were severely broken and had multiple puncture wounds, Brandon Jones, spokesman for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said. It was believed one of the dog's legs would have to be amputated due to infection because Morkunas had not taken the puppy to be treated in enough time. An animal rescue charity PAWS was caring for the dog because the owner had no money to pay for his pet's hospital care. Morkunas was arrested following a traffic stop in Mesa, 20 miles east of Phoenix. He was booked into Fourth Avenue jailed but released shortly afterwards. It was unclear whether he had an attorney.

"By . Associated Press . She lost her baby daughter and her right hand to a manic killing spree. He wielded the machete that took both. Yet today, despite coming from opposite sides of an unspeakable shared past, Alice Mukarurinda and Emmanuel Ndayisaba are friends. She is the treasurer and he the vice president of a group that builds simple brick houses for genocide survivors. They live near each other and shop at the same market. Their story of ethnic violence, extreme guilt and, to some degree, reconciliation is the story of Rwanda today, 20 years after its Hutu majority killed more than 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Rwandan government is still accused by human rights groups of holding an iron grip on power, stifling dissent and killing political opponents. But even critics give President Paul Kagame credit for leading the country toward a peace that seemed all but impossible two decades ago. In this March 2014 photo, Emmanuel Ndayisaba, right, and Alice Mukarurinda, left pose for a photograph outside of her house. In 1994 Edward sliced off her hand and killed her baby girl . Alice and Emmanuel, pictured, live near each other and shop at the same market . 'Whenever I look at my arm I remember what happened,' said Alice, a mother of five with a deep scar on her left temple where Emanuel sliced her with a machete. As she speaks, Emmanuel - the man who killed her baby - sits close enough that his left hand and her right stump sometimes touch. On Monday, Rwanda marks the 20th anniversary of the beginning of 100 days of bloody mayhem. But the genocide was really in the making for decades, fueled by hate speech, discrimination, propaganda and the training of death squads. Hutus had come to resent Tutsis for their greater wealth and what they saw as oppressive rule. Rwanda is the most densely populated country in mainland Africa, slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Maryland but with a population of more than 12 million. The countryside is lush green, filled with uncountable numbers of banana trees. The Hutu-Tutsi divide may be the country's most notorious characteristic but also its most confounding. The two groups are so closely related that it's nearly impossible for an outsider to tell which the average Rwandan belongs to. Even Rwandans have trouble knowing who is who, especially after two decades of a government push to create a single Rwandan identity. For Alice, a Tutsi, the genocide began in 1992, when her family took refuge in a church for a week. Hutu community leaders began importing machetes. Houses were burned, cars taken. Hutu leaders created lists of prominent or educated Tutsis targeted for killing. They also held meetings where they told those in attendance how evil the Tutsis were. Like many of his Hutu neighbors, Emmanuel soaked in the message. The situation caught fire on April 6, 1994, when the plane carrying Rwanda's president was shot down. Hutus started killing Tutsis, who ran for their lives and flooded Alice's village. Three days later, local Hutu leaders told Emmanuel, then 23, that they had a job for him. Emmanuel severed Alice's right hand and sliced her face . Emmanuel turned himself in and confessed to his crimes in 1996, and his prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003 . They took him to a Tutsi home and ordered him to use his machete. A Christian who sang in his church choir, Emmanuel had never killed before. But inside this house he murdered 14 people. The next day, April 12, Emmanuel found a Tutsi doctor in hiding and killed him, too. The day after, he killed two women and a child. 'The very first family I killed, I felt bad, but then I got used to it,' he says. 'Given how we were told that the Tutsis were evil, after the first family I just felt like I was killing our enemies.' In the meantime, Alice's family took refuge in a church, just as they had done before, crammed in with hundreds of others. But this time, Hutu attackers threw a bomb inside and set the church on fire. Those who fled the fire inside died by machetes outside. Alice lost some 26 family members, among the estimated 5,000 victims at the church. Alice, then 25, escaped with her 9-month-old daughter and a 9-year-old niece into Rwanda's green countryside, moving, hiding, moving. She hid in a forested swamp. 'There were so many bodies all over the place,' she says. 'Hutus would wake up in the morning and go hunting for Tutsis to kill.' By late April rebel Tutsi fighters led by Kagame had reached the capital and chased Hutus out. Hutu troops began to flee to neighboring countries, and the violence spread, with killings carried out by both sides. On April 29, Emmanuel joined Hutu soldiers searching the countryside for Tutsis. The attackers blew a whistle whenever they found a Tutsi hiding. The murders began at 10 a.m. and lasted until 3 p.m. Alice had been hiding in a swamp for days, keeping out only the top of her face so she could breathe. That was where the Hutus found her. They surrounded the swamp. Then they attacked. After she was attacked, Alice was left for dead, fell unconscious and was found three days later by other survivors . Emmanuel recognized Alice at a group for both genocide killers and survivors, who still meet weekly. Though he first avoided her, Emmanuel eventually kneeled before Alice to ask for forgiveness . First they killed the girls. When that was done, they came after Alice. She was sure she would die, but instinctively put up her arm up to defend herself. Emmanuel, Alice's school mate, recognized the woman but couldn't recall her name. Perhaps that made it easier to rain down machete blows on Alice's right arm, severing it just above the wrist. He sliced her face. His colleague pierced a spear through her left shoulder. They left her for dead. She was bloodied, scarred, and missing a hand, yes, but not dead. Alice fell unconscious, she says, and was found three days later by other survivors. It was only then that she realized she no longer had a right hand. In the months after the genocide, guilt gnawed away at Emmanuel. He saw his victims during nightmares. In 1996, he turned himself in and confessed. His prison term lasted from 1997 until 2003, when Kagame pardoned Hutus who admitted their guilt. After he was freed, he began asking family members of his victims for forgiveness. He joined a group of genocide killers and survivors called Ukurrkuganze, who still meet weekly. It was there that he saw Alice, the woman he thought he had killed. At first he avoided her. Eventually he kneeled before her and asked for forgiveness. After two weeks of thought and long discussions with her husband, she said yes. In this March 2014 photo, Rwandans are seen reflected in the windows of an office building go about their daily business.  Although Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide, ethnic tensions remain . 'We had attended workshops and trainings and our hearts were kind of free, and I found it easy to forgive,' she says. 'The Bible says you should forgive and you will also be forgiven.' Josephine Munyeli is the director of peace and reconciliation programs in Rwanda for World Vision, a U.S.-based aid group. A survivor of the genocide herself, Munyeli says more killers and victims would like to reconcile but many don't know who they attacked or were attacked by. 'Forgiveness is possible. It's common here,' she says. 'Guilt is heavy. When one realizes how heavy it is the first thing they do to recuperate themselves is apologize.' Although Rwanda has made significant progress since the genocide, ethnic tensions remain. Alice worries that some genocide planners were never caught, and that messages denying the genocide still filter into the country from Hutus living abroad. She believes remembrance is important to ensure that another genocide never happens. For Emmanuel, the anniversary periods bring back the nightmares. He looks like a man serving penance, who does not want to talk but feels he must. 'I've been asking myself why I acted like a fool, listening to such words, that this person is bad and that person is bad,' Emmanuel says. 'The same people that encouraged the genocide are the ones saying there was no genocide.' He, too, worries that the embers of the genocide still smolder. 'The problem is still there,' Emmanuel says. 'There are Hutus who hate me for telling the truth. There are those up until now who participated in the genocide who deny they took part.'","Tutsi Alice Mukarurinda's hand was amputated and her baby was killed by Emmanuel Ndayisaba, a Hutu, in 1994 .

"By . Hugo Gye . This extraordinary flower is almost identical to children's cartoon character Shrek - with its green 'skin', horns and brown waistcoat. The rare orchid looks as if it is giving a huge grin with outstretched arms, just like the misanthropic ogre who reveals a secret soft side in the beloved film series. The flower, called Ophrys Apifera or bee orchid, was pictured in Spain by British photographer David Chapman. Doppelganger: This orchid happens to look almost exactly like cartoon character Shrek . The truth: the Orphys Apifera is named for its resemblance to a bumblebee . The university lecturer from Cornwall caught sight of the remarkable flower while out walking through the Pyrenees. The 48-year-old, who is also a wildlife photographer and writer, spotted the orchid in a book years ago and had been hoping to see one for real ever since. 'This is a very special species of flower, I remember having seen them in my wildflower guidebooks and longed to see one in the flesh,' he said. 'When I first saw one I was amazed by how clever their mimicry is and how beautiful the flowers are. 'Despite the bee orchid being very colourful it is extremely difficult to spot because it is tall and thin and grows amongst tall grasses.' Original: Like the orchid, Shrek boasts green skin, horns, an open mouth and a brown waistcoat . David has also snapped the orchids in the UK - although they are harder to find here. He said: 'The quirkiest location I have photographed them is on a roundabout on the A30 near Hayle in Cornwall. 'It is thought that they grow there because their seeds were imported when soil was brought in to make the road embankments. 'I've never found bee orchids in the UK without prior knowledge, as they are quite rare - but I have found them on the north coast of Spain.' The flower gets its name from its resemblance to a bumblebee, which is thought to entice insects to land on it and transfer its pollen to other plants.","Ophrys Apifera was spotted in Spain by a British photographer .

"By . Andrew Chesterton . Grant Hackett pictured with his then-wife Candice Alley. The couple separated in 2012 . Grant Hackett has broken his silence over the prescription drug dependency that plunged his life into chaos, forcing him to check into a rehabilitation centre for a five-week program. The former Olympic champion, who became dependent on the sleeping pill Stilnox, says the 2012 breakdown of his marriage to Candice Alley had taken a 'physical, mental and emotional' toll on the 33-year-old. Hackett had taken Stilnox at the Crown Casino in Melbourne on Friday 21 February when he was photographed in his underwear and with a singlet pulled down around his waist in the hotel's reception. Witnesses at the time described the swimmer as appearing disorientated, and said the he was asking if anyone had seen his four-year-old son, Jagger. Hackett also had Jagger's twin sister Charlize with him. Describing the events that led to the incident, Hackett says he had visited a doctor who'd prescribed him sleeping pills because he felt like, ‘the wheels were falling off’. ‘I had seen a doctor because I needed a rest, I was exhausted,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘There was so much on my plate and the wheels were falling off. ‘I wasn't getting any sleep. I’d sleep for 45 minutes and wake up and need to do something for a couple of hours and then go back to sleep and I was anxious and sleep-deprived... so he gave me the Stilnox. 'The first time I’d taken it in quite some time was that Friday night. The now-infamous picture of Hackett in his underwear in the foyer of Melbourne's Crown Casino . 'I sleep in my singlet and briefs so that’s what I was wearing. Then I jumped into the lift, it was empty, and as I was going down I thought: ""Jeez, I’m not going to walk out into the foyer"", so I took off my singlet and wrapped it around me, put Charlize down, and there was a security guard right near the lift. I yelled out to him and he came over and I told him what was going on and it was literally minutes and they found (Jagger), on a different floor. 'I was disorientated. I definitely was. That medication was still affecting me at that point because I didn't take it until late in the evening.' It later emerged the 33-year-old had developed a reliance on the powerful sleeping pill during the latter stages of his swimming career. He said the public scrutiny following the breakdown of his marriage had seen him 'white-knuckling' for more than a year, before he finally admitted he needed help. This week he completed an intensive five-week stint in an Arizona treatment facility. He'll now move in with his parents for a unspecified period of 'supervision' as Hackett adjusts to normal life again. The three-time Olympic gold medal winner is considered one of Australia's finest athletes . 'I’d been talking to my mum and dad and I’d said things to dad for probably 12 months prior to that saying I don’t feel like I’m coping that well anymore with so many different elements of my life and being on my own,' he told The Sunday Telegraph. 'It was really difficult and I was white knuckle all the time, and I’d always push myself through it and physically, mentally, emotionally it really started to take its toll on me.' Hackett blamed the toughness instilled in him as an Olympic athlete for the delay in seeking help. He said he had been trained to never reveal a weakness, and it was a mentality that stayed with him long after his Olympic career ended. ‘I've been an athlete since I was four years old and every moment from there on ’til I was 28 was about pushing through, overcoming, push the pain away, get on with it,' he said. ‘But when it came to something emotional, you just learnt to suppress it. To actually stop and assess for a second, you didn't do it. You just get on with it and just execute what you have to do and you kind of get to a point where you probably can’t keep going like that. It’s unsustainable. ‘I was of that psychology in every part of my life. That was my approach and it’s probably good as an athlete, but not so good in every other part of your life.’","Hackett has just completed a five-week stint in an American rehab facility .

Kicking the surreal-level up a notch – even for Japan – Ms Takahashi sports strange ‘Popeye’ muscles as she speaks of how to lose weight and takes the viewer through the exercises. The clip, made by art director and commercial film director Nagi Noda, is a word-for-word copy of a workout video made by motivational speaker and 90s fitness celebrity Susan Powter. The poodles are, of course, humans, who had dog heads added later using CGI, and were used by Noda as she found the way poodle fur is groomed to resemble human muscles. Scroll down for video .

"By . Rupert Steiner . Driving force: Britain's sports goods retailer is controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley (pictured). The lucrative plan was created in 2009 . Thousands of shop workers at Sports Direct are in line for a bonus worth £76,500 after the High Street retailer posted bumper profits. The firm, which owns 396 shops including Lillywhites in London’s Piccadilly, has benefited from unprecedented success in British sport and has attracted more shoppers by slashing prices and revamping stores. It is set to distribute millions of shares among 2,000 staff – many of whom earn a basic salary of around £20,000. The firm says its generous incentive scheme is what has driven annual profit up 40 per cent to £207.2million. ‘The share scheme has been the glue to the performance,’ said chief executive Dave Forsey. ‘It has combined with better products, low prices and good value to deliver record results. ‘If you have so many people linked to performance, from thousands in the back office to the shop floor, all driven by such an incentive, it is very powerful. 'Everyone is thinking about how they can challenge the business and they really do care about every aspect. It is a very compelling culture – good for consumers and great for employees.’ Mr Forsey said he has been contacted by a number of non-competing retailers wanting to emulate the incentive scheme. Britain’s biggest sports goods retailer, which is controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, created the lucrative bonus plan in 2009. It is set to pay out to eligible staff – more than 2,000 of its 23,000-strong workforce – next month. An employee on £20,000 a year in 2009 will pick up 12,000 shares – worth around £76,500. Sports Direct is also part way through a four-year share incentive bonus scheme created in 2011 for about 3,000 staff. Mr Ashley owns 64 per cent of the firm and works under the title executive deputy chairman. Sports Direct is set to pay out to eligible staff - more than 2,000 of its 23,000-strong workforce - next month. An employee on £20,000 a year in 2009 will pick up 12,000 shares - worth around £76,500 . He is seen as the driving force behind the success of Sports Direct but has not taken a salary since floating the business on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. Plans to award him a bonus of £60million linked to performance were ditched after other investors felt the targets were not demanding enough. The proposal is being redrawn. Mr Forsey said: ‘We are very keen to look at how we can reward Mike because he’s absolutely making a massive difference to our business.’ Sports Direct’s profit hike comes after underlying sales increased 11.2pc over the past financial year as it strengthened its grip on the market following the collapse of rival JJB. The firm also owns Sports World as well as the Slazenger, Lonsdale, and Dunlop brands.","Firm owns 396 shops and is set to distribute millions of shares among staff .

The 6-foot-8, 500-pound Aaron told TMZ, which broke the story, that he usually purchases two seats to accommodate his considerable girth, but this time the small plane was fully booked. The actor boarded Flight 4215 at around 9.30am for a one-hour trip from Philadelphia to Rochester, New York. But his journey ended before it even began when a flight attendant came by and politely asked him to disembark. According to the 29-year-old actor, a passenger who booked the seat next to his was unable to squeeze himself past Aaron's full figure. Aaron said he attempted to reason with the cabin crew, but to no avail. Upon leaving the plane, The Blind Side star booked another flight, where he was able to purchase two seats for himself. 'I definitely need two seats,’ he told TMZ. ‘It worked out for the better … my knees weren’t pushed into the back of the metal on someone else’s seat.'

He learned Sunday that his wife's water broke, then traveled to Florida and missed Monday's 9-7 opening loss to Washington and Wednesday night's 5-1 defeat. He said his son was born at 12.02pm Monday. 'I appreciate it, anyone who supports me,' he said. 'My wife and I, we made a decision, and we were excited about it.' Murphy said his son was named after the Biblical character Noah, not for Mets teammate Noah Syndergaard. 'People . are going to say you named him after the monstrosity that throws like . 1,000 miles an hour,' Murphy said. 'We didn't. Noah came from Noah's . Ark. Peace and rest is what it means.' Ranting: Radio host Mike Francesa (pictured) believes paternity leave is a 'gimmick' and a 'scam' Murphy said he took the shockjocks' comments in his stride, including those of afternoon host Mike Francesa. ‘One . day I understand. And in the old days they didn’t do that. But one day, . go see the baby be born and come back,’ Francesa said during his afternoon program yesterday. ‘You’re a Major League Baseball player. You can hire a nurse to take care of the baby if your wife needs help... ‘I had three kids... I was at the birth and was back to work the next day. I didn’t see any reason not to be working. 'I’d rather go out and get a couple of hits if I was a player. That’s the best thing I can do. Go play. Go make some money - you just had a kid.' Francesa boasted that one of his three children was born at 9am and he was behind the mic that afternoon. He called the idea of fathers not being at work a ‘scam’ and a ‘gimmick’ when informed his own radio station allows fathers 10 days out of the office to tend to the mother of their children after a birth. ‘That's ridiculous, what the heck do you need 10 days for? What are you supposed to be doing, vacationing?’ he said. However Mets executives defended the paternity leave policy, with manager Terry Collins bristling at the radio hosts' comments. 'If you're accusing Dan Murphy of not wanting to play - this guy played 161 games last year, wore himself out, played through all sorts of discomfort,' he said. 'You know, the man had his first child. He's allowed to be there. The rules state that he can be there, so he went. There's nothing against it. 'There's nothing wrong with it. You know, he missed two games. It's not like he's missed 10. You know, when you start attacking Dan Murphy's credibility, you need to look in the mirror a little bit.'","Former .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Tragic twist: Marine Lance Cpl Andrew Silva, 23, was killed less than a month after returning home from Afghanistan when a suspected drunken driver smashed into his motorcycle . U.S. Marine Andrew Silva had survived a tour of duty in Afghanistan, but less than a month after returning home to his wife and son, the 23-year-old soldier was struck and killed by a suspected drunken driver in California. Silva died in the crash last Tuesday morning in Fremont after police say Alexander Yohn, 23, rammed his Mini Cooper into the veteran’s brand-new motorcycle. Police arrested Yohn, of Emeryville, in a nearby field after his car smashed into a utility pole. Witnesses say earlier Yohn had been acting belligerently and appearing intoxicated while going through a Taco Bell drive-through. He has been charged with murder, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and hit-and-run causing death or injury. Silva was a Marine lance corporal who had returned from Afghanistan in February after spending six months in Helmand Province. He is survived by his wife, Julie, and their 2-year-old son, Noah. According to Silva’s family, the young veteran was planning to go back to college and pursue a career in law enforcement, Mercury News reported. ‘He survived all the bullets and bombs . and explosions, and then he comes home and this happens,’ said Father . Geoffrey Baraan, the pastor at Saint Anne Catholic Church, where Silva’s . family have worshiped for years. Scroll down for video .

Tragedy struck at around 1.15am last Tuesday as Silva was riding his new 2014 Harley-Davidson from his parents' house to his in-laws' home. At the intersection of Fremont Boulevard and Decoto Road, Silva’s bike was struck by Yohn’s Mini Cooper doing about 90mph, according to police. The impact sent Silva . and his ‘hog’ flying into the air. He was pronounced dead at the scene, . but his body was not removed until 15 hours later as police investigated . the accident. When . police caught up with Yohn, who had fled to a field, the driver . allegedly admitted that he had downed at least five whiskey shots before . getting behind the wheel against the advice of a friend. Shorlty before the deadly collission, police got a 911 call from a Taco Bell worker, who reported that Yohn appeared very drunk while buying food from the drive-through window. A police officer spotted Yohn's Mini Cooper on Fremont Boulevard and tried to stop him, but the 23-year-old EMT allegedly blew through a red light and collided with Silva.

"By . Shari Miller . Ode to the poets: Presenter James May has asked the BBC to commission a programme on the poetry of First World War poets . Top Gear host James May hopes to turn his attentions from the power of cars to the power of words, with a special programme about First World War poets to mark this year's centenary. May hopes to convince BBC bosses to commission the programme, which would include the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke, among others. During an interview for forces radio BFBS, which was recorded while visiting  troops at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan ahead of tonight's Top Gear, the 51-year-old presenter said: 'I've put it forward - I haven't heard from them yet, weirdly obviously this year is the centenary of the outbreak of World War One. 'But I thought for the first year we could commemorate the Christmas truce of 1914 when they all got out of the trenches and played football and swapped gifts and so on - and we could do that through the words of the war poets and the people who kept diaries and postcards and things.' May, who first co-presented Top Gear in 1999, added: 'The words of the really big poets like Sassoon, (Edmund) Blunden and Owen have endured, while a lot of the other things about it, the understanding of it, is fading away. 'Those words may be the bit that survive the longest, and actually tell us a great deal about it in a very short space of time and very few words - which is what poetry is about, it's about imagery and stuff.' Wilfred Owen, who was killed in action just one week before the signing of the Armistice on November 4, 1918, is best remembered for his shocking and realistic war poetry about the horrors of trench warfare. This was in stark contrast to the usually patriotic verses penned by other war poets, such as Rupert Brooke. Among his best known works, which were published posthumously, are Dulce et Decorum Est and Anthem for Doomed Youth. Two voices: Rupert Brooke's patriotic poetry was idealistic compared to works by Wilfred Owen . Owen was heavily influenced by his friend and mentor Siegfried Sassoon, who survived the Great War and was awarded the Military Cross for his service. Described as an 'accidental hero', Sassoon's initial innocence soon diminished against the harsh realities of war, as seen in such poems as the darkly-titled, Suicide in the Trenches. Away from presenting Top Gear with Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, May's other television credits include Toy Stories, which looked at his favourite childhood toys and a number of drink-inspired journeys with wine expert Oz Clarke.

"By . Suzannah Hills . It may soon be impossible to find a home in London for less than £100,000 after the handful of properties on the market for five figures are being quickly snapped up by buyers, experts have claimed. At the end of last year, just seven flats across the capital were on sale for less than £100,000, the majority of which have now been sold. Property experts claim a 'milestone' has now been reached and it unlikely that freehold properties will drop under the £100,000 mark again unless there is a housing market crash. Bargain buy: This one bedroom flat in Lord Warwick Street, Woolwich, SE18, is being advertised for sale at £90,000 . Tight squeeze: The property in Lord Warwick Street in Woolwich has a small living room decorated in pink and purple . The kitchen of the Woolwich flat has also been painted yellow to match the outside of the building . 'Ideal for first time buyers': The property does have a good sized bathroom complete with a bath and shower unit . Research by Placebuzz.com found it is now near impossible to buy a home in London for less than six figures unless they are sold at auction, are part of shared ownership schemes, retirement homes, student accommodation or house boats. Andy Hatoum, founder of property search engine Placebuzz.com, said: 'The London property market has reached a milestone. 'This may be the last time we see properties under £100k being sold in the capital, well on land at least, as currently the only properties for sale under £100k are houseboats. 'In other parts of the country you can buy a family home for under £100k - in London it won't even buy you a studio flat in one of the cheaper boroughs. Just under six figures: A one bedroom flat in this apartment block in Blendon Terrace, London, SE18, sold for £99,500 . Natural light: The kitchen in the Blendon Terrace apartment has a large window - making it feel bigger . Estate agents believe properties such as this one in Blendon Terrace will be one of the last in London to be put on the market under £100,000 . Snapped up: Buyers are rushing to purchase the remaining five figure properties such as the one in Blendon Terrace, pictured . 'For many Londoners on normal salaries, not City sized wages, home ownership is quite simply out of reach.' Of the few remaining properties advertised for under £100,000 in recent months, these included four in the east or south-east of London and one in Barnet - although this was only a short term lease. A one bed flat in Blendon Terrace, London, SE18, sold for £99,500 while another one bed flat in Lord Warwick Street, Woolwich, SE18, is being advertised, under offer, for £90,000. Described as an ideal purchase for a first time buyer, the Woolwich property has a lounge, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and communal gardens.

Finally a two Bed flat in Kingsbury is on the market for £94,995 while a one bedroom flat in Thamesmead is still being advertised for £89,000. This leaves bidding at auction or shared ownership as the only other option for finding a home for five figures. A studio flat in this converted property in Grove Road, London, E17, was on the market for £74,995 . The advertisement for the £74,995 studio in Grove Road, London, E17, did not include any pictures of the inside of the property - just this floor plan . There are currently three houseboats on offer in the capital - a one bed barge for sale in E1W for £99,000, a houseboat in King’s Cross for £87,000 and a houseboat near Hammersmith for £80,000. Alex Gosling, managing director of online estate agents Housesimple.co.uk, said: 'I'm sure many people will be surprised that you could actually still buy something under £100k in London. 'The capital's property market is so hot at the moment that in many boroughs you would probably struggle to find anything under £200k let alone £100k.

'And properties in the most popular areas are selling well over asking price as buyers compete against each other. 'Will we ever see properties under £100k again? I'm sure we will but don't expect to get too much space for that kind of money. 'Also, the chances are if you're spending less than £100k the property will not be in great condition.

Just five figures: A two bedroom flat for sale in Kinsbury, London, for £94,995 . It comes as private sector rents in London increased at eight times the pace of those in the North East over 2013. Every region across Britain saw an annual rise in average rental prices paid by tenants, but London recorded the biggest increase over the last 12 months at 1.6 per cent. The North East saw the smallest increase at 0.2 per cent, according to the report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The combination of increasingly higher rents and stagnate wages has sparked concern in recent years that tenants are becoming 'trapped' in the rental sector because they cannot save enough money for a deposit to make the jump onto the housing ladder. But Government support schemes such as Help to Buy have resulted in some strong increases in first-time buyer numbers. But there's always the option of a house boat!

"By . Amanda Williams . The financial problems experienced by middle income families since the economic crash has been exaggerated, according to new research set to be published tomorrow. The middle classes may have even thrived since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008, according to the analysis by the Social Market Foundation (SMF). The independent think tank has used new research to tackle the conception that those on a low to middle income have been struck by a fall in real wages. Instead it claims that more than four in 10 families have moved up the income scale. The middle classes have even thrived since the beginning of the economic downturn since 2008, according to the analysis by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) The group says that families in the middle 20 per cent of income distribution – the third income bracket – have shown 'remarkable resilience'. The report claims that the middle classes . may have fared well in the recession by adapting their spending on . food, childcare, and housing. They tracked this group from the start of the economic downturn in . 2007-08 to 2011-12. The report, called Riders on the Storm, states that families within this bracket had a . total pre-tax income of between 26,100 and . £41,200, including benefits. It found that more than 40 per cent had stayed within this wage bracket, and 40 per cent had crept into the fourth bracket, with incomes of between £41,200 to £63,000. Meanwhile 18 per cent had fallen into the two lowest . income brackets, of £11,700 to £26,100 and below £11,700. The study is due to be published tomorrow. The SMF said it had tracked actual working-age households rather than relying on statistical averages and other data to make the findings. The independent thinktank has used new research to tackle the conception that those on a low to middle income have been struck by a fall in real wages and instead claims that more than four in 10 families have moved up the income scale . The SMF's director, Emran Mian, said that the middle earners had coped surprisingly well since the beginning of the economic downturn. Mr Mian said: 'Even in the teeth of the recession, two-fifths of them moved up the income distribution, just as many managed to stay where they were.' While the study found that today's families have a real income which is 13 per cent lower than in 2007-2008, because wages rose more slowly than inflation, 30 per cent of households had risen  one income group. Some ten per cent had even jumped from the middle group to the top bracket of earners. Mr Mian said: 'Families in the middle have adapted to evade the squeeze. 'The super-consumers among them have beaten the market, managing their costs so that they rise by less than inflation. 'We should expand access to consumer data so that everyone can see how they’ve done it.'","New analysis of families comes from  the Social Market Foundation (SMF)

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The celebration of a lifetime went down in flames for one couple on Saturday night, after a fire broke out during the middle of their wedding, forcing the evacuation of over 140 guests and destroying a beloved Massachusetts venue. The fire started around 7.15pm at the historic Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, moments after the marriage ceremony concluded. 'I had literally just pronounced them husband and wife, and they proceeded down the center aisle with the groomsmen and bridesmaids (and) I looked up and saw some smoke,' Justice of the Peace Jerry Cibley told The Sun Chronicle. 'I initially thought it was the fog machine.' Big day ruined by fire: Flames broke out in a Foxborough wedding facility just after a ceremony had been completed just after 7 pm Saturday. All wedding guests were evacuated from the Lakeview Pavilion before firefighters arrived on scene . A firefighter works on the scene of a multiple alarm fire at the popular Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, Mass. According to guests at the venue, the fire is believed to have started in a pile of newly-applied mulch . Several onlookers said it appeared the fire started in some newly-applied mulch outside the building, which is surrounded by a lake and woods, but it quickly spread to the building itself. 'The bride and groom are devastated — this was their big day,' Cibley said. 'I’m thankful everybody got out safely. It went up so quickly and could have been a lot worse with 140 to 150 people in there.' The couple have not been named after they wished to stay anonymous. Reports that surfaced on Twitter said the Renaissance Hotel in Foxborough quickly organized a makeshift reception. Firefighters battled the flames using water from the nearby lake, while scores of onlookers arrived at the scene to lament the loss of the 108-year-old landmark. 'Thank goodness the lake is there,' said Paul Hubrich, who lives down the road. 'It’s incredibly sad — thank goodness everyone got out okay.' Landmark: The Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough is 108-years-old and a celebrated venue in the area, accommodating countless weddings and proms . Firefighters respond to a multiple alarm fire at the popular Lakeview Pavilion in Foxboro, Mass., Saturday, April 5, 2014 . The facility first opened on July 4, 1906 as Lake View Park, complete with a dance hall pavilion, dining room, theater and bandstand, under the ownership of the Ross family, according to the facility’s website. It changed hands several times over the years and was purchased by Efstathios 'Steve' and Kiparisia 'Kathy' Kourtidis in 1988, when it was known as Lakeview Ballroom. The facility was renamed to Lakeview Pavilion and is managed by the couple’s daughters, Anastasia Tsoumbasnos and Natalia Kapourelakos. The popular wedding venue had undergone renovations in recent years. Patricia Kissinger, who lives down the road, said she felt badly for the owners. 'We heard a lot of fire engines and ambulances coming down the road and after 10 or so knew it was something serious,' she said. 'They just kept coming. It’s just so sad, this is such a beautiful, historic place. We all love it. And the owners have been so good to the neighborhood.'","Fire broke out at the Lakeview Pavilion in Foxborough, Mass., just after 7pm Saturday .

"By . Martin Robinson . Britain's house price boom is gathering pace with some areas seeing the cost of a home rise by almost a quarter in 2013, MailOnline can reveal today. In the past 12 months buyers have been scrambling to buy properties, particularly in London and the south-east, because there has been an 'insufficient rise' in new homes, driving up the cost of a flat or house by more than £1million in some cases. On average, house prices in the UK were up seven per cent this year, adding around £14,000 to the average property, which now costs £171,000. This will go up another eight per cent by the end of 2014 and up to 30 per cent by 2013, experts say. A new interactive map produced by experts from Savills, exclusively for MailOnline, also reveals that house prices in prime spots are now almost double what they were at the start of the 2008 crash. What has happened to prime property prices over the last 5 years? This map is from Savills. View the full version here. In . London the increases have been highest, with Fulham and Battersea, . known as 'nappy valley', up around 23 per cent in the past 12 months. Average houses in prime areas like these are close to the £2million barrier for the first time. Areas outside the capital, like Reigate, Winchester, Farnham and Oxford, have seen the biggest rises, with the cost of a home now between nine per cent and 15 per cent higher than a year ago. But experts insisted today that there no 'bubble'. Lucian Cook, Savills UK head of residential research, said: 'The simple mechanics of supply and demand have driven this price growth. 'Greater numbers of affluent families have remained in London, putting pressure on a limited pool of housing stock in certain areas. 'Those priced out are looking to emerging prime markets, while other have begun to re-look at the prime suburbs and commuter towns.' But there have been some losers this . year, with prices down almost entirely across the board in Scotland in . 2013, with little or no growth in Wales, the Midlands and the North of . England. Big rise: Battersea and Fulham had the biggest price increases in the past year, up around 23 per cent, which will add huge sums to many properties . Picture of Britain: House prices in some areas have now risen beyond the 2008 peak, before the crash, and are expected to go up across the board in the next five years . Trends: Savills predicts that next year there will be a rise in prime properties, followed by a lull in 2015, before more sustained growth on homes worth in excess of £800,000 today . The house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by £43,000. Buoyant: House prices will rise by up to eight per cent next year to build on strong gains this year, according to a forecast from Halifax . Prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018, according to Savills, fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who cannot afford to buy. The property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years – from £171,000 to £214,000. The news has coincided with annual figures released by the Halifax. It said further economic recovery and continued low interest rates would support a broadly similar increase to this year, which has already seen prices go up seven per cent in the first 11 months of this year. But a price surge in London, which has seen the steepest rises, is expected to slow down, the bank added. The forecast comes in the wake of a warning from Business Secretary Vince Cable that the Government might need to review its flagship Help to Buy programme amid what he called a 'raging housing boom' in the capital and the South East. Halifax’s housing economist, Martin Ellis said: 'The housing market has been stronger than expected during 2013. Higher demand, combined with an insufficient rise in housing supply, has resulted in increases in house prices and higher activity this year. Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence due to the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be underway, are helping to stimulate housing demand. Schemes, such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, also appear to have boosted demand. 'Nationally, house prices have increased by seven per cent in the first 11 months of the year. Activity has also picked up with transactions likely to exceed one million for the first time since 2007'.","Lack of new homes has led to buyers scrambling to buy property, pushing up prices by £14,000 on average this year .
Despite deepest recession in history a flat or house in some areas is now double what it was in 2008 .
Winners are London, south-east and East Anglia, but Scotland, the North and Midlands suffer decline or stagnation .

L-R: Tia, Mark and Shae Lowers have invited the Cambridges to their house for a barbeque after finding out that Kate is Mark's second cousin. They say the royal connection explains why their daughter is such a 'princess' He investigated his family tree in 2008. ‘I found out that my mum Lillian, and Kate’s mum Carole, had the same grandmother, Edith Eliza Chandler,’ he said. ‘That makes them first cousins and makes Kate and me second. I guess the little fella George is a third cousin of some sort. ‘Carole and Mum wrote Christmas cards to each other for years then lost touch.’ Mark’s wife Tia believes their nine-year-old daughter Shae is shaping up to become quite the little princess.

"By . Tom Latchem . Everywhere she goes, EastEnders actress Danielle Harold turns heads - but not, she insists, because she's one of soap's most glamorous stars. 'I get a lot of attention because my hair's so bright - I'm like a human light  bulb,' laughs the bottle-blonde youngster, who plays puffa jacket-wearing loudmouth Lola Pearce. 'I'm really not sexy at all.' But hang on, Danielle's up for Sexiest Actress at next month's British Soap Awards. 'Oh, can we not talk about that please,' she blushes. Scroll down for video . Danielle's up for Sexiest Actress at next month's British Soap Awards. 'It's so embarrassing. I'm at work so much I can't get my nails or hair done, and my roots are now down to my ears! When I heard I'd been nominated I just laughed.' Danielle insists landing her 'dream job' in the soap, let alone being nominated for awards, is remarkable. After missing much of her final year at school due to a serious bladder illness, and ending up as a waitress, the 21-year-old Londoner admits her lifelong acting ambition seemed to be slipping away. But she had a slice of good fortune when she spotted an advert asking for volunteers for a new Channel 4 show, Jamie's Dream School. Danielle appeared in the 2011 show - Jamie's Dream School (circled) The documentary series, which aired in 2011, saw Jamie Oliver enrolling  struggling teens into a very special school. Lessons were taught by celebs such as Dr David Starkey (history) and Simon Callow (English). Danielle applied and was accepted. 'It was either continue waitressing or do Jamie's Dream School. I worried quitting my job would be a mistake but it turned out to be the best decision I've ever made. Jamie was lovely.' Danielle thrived on the show and won scholarship money to further her career, which she spent on a drama teacher. An introduction to an agent led to her first audition... for the role of Lola in EastEnders. Danielle with her on screen family, Grandpa, Billy Mitchell and daughter Lexi . 'I was terrified,' she recalls. 'I didn't have a clue how to do an audition. I didn't think I'd get the part, and I was just happy being on set. Afterwards I cried because it was such a relief to get it over with. And when I heard I'd got the job I couldn't believe it.' A year later, Danielle was at the centre of the special 2012 live episode, when Lola gave birth. And this week she's in the thick of the action again - Lola gets run over by Ronnie Mitchell, and soon Lucy Beale, sister of her on-screen boyfriend Peter, will be murdered by a mystery killer. 'We're all trying to figure out who  it is,' Danielle reveals. 'Even the person who does it doesn't know. I thought people would be worried about it being them, but everyone's just really excited.' But what about Danielle - isn't she worried about getting the axe? 'Not in the slightest. I've had a great time here and when it comes to an end, it comes to an end. 'With this being my first job, and because it was so crazy how I came here, I just take life as it comes. Whatever happens, happens. I like that.' Pizza or pasta? Pizza. I’m a big fan of Two for Tuesday at Domino's! Everyone loves a bargain! Nightclub or bar? I like a nice cocktail bar in the West End – if  I go clubbing I get a bad hangover. Red Bull or coffee? I drink about three Red Bulls a day! I’m renowned for it on the EastEnders set - though I know it’s really bad for me. Holidays - America or Europe? America, because there are so many places and the buzz is amazing. Die Hard or Love Actually? The Die Hard films may be really old but they’re still fantastic action movies. Party Wright Around The World or Educating Joey Essex? Educating Joey Essex - it was so funny, and I’m hoping it’s more than just a one-off.","Danielle Harold landed her part as Lola in EastEnders in 2011 .

The pictures are among the first to capture the endangered species front on looking them in the eye as they hurtle towards their prey. The three big cats were caught on camera at The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (T.I.G.E.R.S) wildlife reserve in Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. Scroll down for videos . The three big cats were caught on camera at the Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (T.I.G.E.R.S) wildlife reserve in Myrtle Beach in South Carolina . The Bengal tiger is native to India, but can be found in smaller numbers in countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China . While footage already exists of big cats running from a profile view, it is thought to be incredibly rare to see them running directly towards the camera . They include a majestic white Bengali tiger called Uma, who weighs in at 350lbs, but can still accelerate at up to speeds of 47 mph. She is joined by two-year-old red tiger, Ravi who weighs in at 300lbs and Yam, a 360lb orange and black Bengal aged six. The tigers came out for play-time after record quantities of rain had left the ground at the wildlife reserve drenched. Even though the cats weigh over 300lbs, they can accelerate at up to speeds of 47 mph . Dr Bhagavan Antle, who runs the reserve said: 'Tigers love water and are excellent swimmers' Rare new footage has emerged of three Bengal tigers making a splash as they run towards their prey at a South Carolina nature reserve .

The Bengal tiger is native to India but can also be found in smaller number in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China. However, the species is endangered with fewer than 2,500 of the creatures left in the world.

"By . Mark Prigg . A real-life superhero mask that can boost the vision and hearing of its wearer has been revealed. Created by students at the Royal College of Art, the masks contain sensors to augment the person's sight and hearing. The team behind the real-life 'iron man' mask hope it could be produced to help sports stars improve their game and in art projects. Scroll down for video . The mask can show wearer's 'track' of movement, allowing golfers to easily see how their swing can be improved, for instance, in a similar effect to long exposure photography . The audio part of the mask lets people 'zoom in' on speech nearby, neutralising background noise using built-in speakers and microphones. The researchers have created too headsets to improve our senses: . Eidos Vision 'enhances the way we see motion, achieving a similar effect . to long exposure photography for live experience,' the researchers say. 'By detecting and . overlaying movement, it allows us to see traces and patterns hidden to . the naked eye.' Eidos Audio 'lets us hear speech more selectively. 'It neutralizes . distracting background noise and then amplifies the speech you choose. 'It uses the principle of bone conduction that creates the unique . experience of hearing someone speak right inside your head.' There are two masks at present, one improving hearing and one for vision. The face mask component has the ability to isolate sounds in a crowd and target people to listen in. The researchers say this could be developed as a hearing aid, or even help ADHD sufferers. 'Eidos has healthcare benefits where it can be used to boost sensory signals weakened by aging or disability. 'For example, it can help sufferers of ADHD who commonly find it difficult to concentrate in noisy and distracting environments. 'Eidos lets them focus on the speech or conversation they really need to, providing an alternative to drugs such as Ritalin.' The visor component has an embedded camera that transmits visual data to a computer and sends it back to the visor, which then displays the video information with enhancements that help the viewer detect patterns of movement, rather like a timelapse photograph. 'We are a multidisciplinary team of Masters students at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London studying Innovation Design Engineering,' said Tim Bouckley, who took part in the project with Millie Clive-Smith, Mi Eun Kim and Yuta Sugawara. 'The devices were designed to showcase our technologies, but they do work. 'In the future we will be refining the technologies to make them wireless and focusing on specific applications were were can productize our technologies. 'The most promising directions currently are in sports analysis and arts performance. 'We are also interested in the health applications of our bone-conduction technology, especially for the hearing impaired. The mask looks similar to the one worn by Robert Downey in the Iron Man series of films . 'However testing it difficult as there is much greater regulation in the healthcare industry, meaning that this is a longer term goal for Eidos.' The team say they wanted to 'improve human experience' with the project. 'On the one hand we were concerned with how to improve or even radically change everyday human experience, and on the other we were fascinated by technology and todayâ€™s products that give us ever greater control over the world around us,' they said. The team showed off the designs at the London College of Art earlier this year - and hope it could now become a real product . The mask could potentially be used to help athletes such as golfers improve their swing . The team created dozens of 'superhero' mask prototypes before finalising their design . Although they work, the versions of the mask shown here are early prototypes .","Mask can allow wearer to 'zoom in' on conversations in a crowd - and could be developed as a hearing aid and help ADHD sufferers .

"By . David Wilkes . An eco-warrior has made his home in an apple tree to prevent developers chopping it down. Rowan Burrough has spent most of the past week in the 150-year-old tree, in the heart of Cider With Rosie country in Gloucestershire. His efforts have drawn comparisons with those of Swampy – real name Daniel Hooper – the campaigner who hit the headlines in 1996 when he dug tunnels under the proposed routes of major road projects. Shall not be moved: Rowan Burrough has been camping out in the boughs of this apple tree for the past week . Happy camper: Mr Burrough has constructed a bed and brought up other essentials . He has garnered overwhelming support from residents, who have been bringing him soup, sandwiches and water. But the protest was almost ended yesterday when the 44-year-old climbed down at 3am to try to sneak a few hours' sleep in a bed. By 5am contractors had moved in and begun lopping the 20ft tree. Mr Burrough raced back, evaded police and scaled the tree again, joined by a second protester, Matthew Sell, 39. They want to protect the tree – and a thriving colony of badgers beneath it. Prime land: The apple tree is part of a site set to be turned into luxury homes . Support: Locals of Stroud, Gloucestershire, have shown their support for the protest . Supplies: Enthusiastic local supporters have been supplying Mr Burrough with soup, sandwiches and water . Teamwork: Mr Burrough was far from alone in his efforts . Developers want to build 14 luxury homes on the one-acre site at Stroud, near the childhood home of Cider With Rosie author Laurie Lee. Mr Burrough said: ‘This is an old tree and the badger sett . is unusually large. There’s a growing movement in Britain to save . orchard trees and I personally want the badger sett fenced off as mini . nature reserve rather than moved. 'Or why can’t they incorporate it as . part of the houses’ gardens? ‘Just because something has been given . planning permission doesn’t mean it’s correct. If more people did what . I’m doing more often, councils would get a bit tired and change the . rules so they can retract their decision.’ Poised: Developers are waiting to chop the tree down and continue building . The peculiarly English . stand-off is happening on the edge of Stroud, Gloucestershire, on a . patch of land which was in years gone by an orchard and a market garden, . then became a much-loved green space which planning officers called the . ‘last breathing space for local people’. But . planning permission to build the 12 three-bedroom and two four-bedroom . houses in terrace blocks was granted to developer Gerry Walsh after he . bought the land - despite more than 100 letters of objection about his . controversial plans to Stroud District Council. The . site is just two miles from Slad, the village where Laurie Lee lived . and around which he based his famous novel about his bucolic childhood, . ‘Cider With Rosie’, and in this little corner of the country feelings . run high particularly about protecting the countryside and conserving . nature. Contractors began . clearing the site a fortnight ago, but at first the 20ft apple tree . remained intact thanks in no small part to Mr Burrough’s tree-scaling . prowess. Opposition: The local council received more than 100 letters opposing the development . A . steady stream of locals have been supporting his cause by coming to the . site with supplies for him and banners saying ‘Stroud apple town’ and . ‘Houses out, badger in’. Some children have made t-shirts with the logo . ‘Paws off our setts’. Judith . Pfeifer, 35, a landscape architect, whose home borders the site, said: . ‘I’m not against building homes, we need homes, but there should be . space for wildlife as well - human habitation and precious wildlife . should find a way to live together. ‘This . was a wildlife haven and the apple tree was part of our heritage. It . was so peaceful here before. Since the work began it feels like we’re . under siege.’ Under the planning permission, Mr Walsh must leave a 2.5m . wide dedicated ‘wildlife corridor’ along the western and southern . boundaries of the site. He . has also been granted a licence from Natural England for the badgers to . be moved. This is likely to be done by installing one-way gates over . the 22 entrances to their sett so they can get out, but can’t go back in . again.' Battle ground: Neither side had showed any sign of relenting . It is expected they will then wander off and make a find a new home with another nearby colony. Mr . Walsh’s planning agent Ben Read, of Hunter Page Planning, said: ‘He is . doing everything in accordance with the policies and has the necessary . planning permissions and consents. ‘The trees were looked at as part of the planning application and no preservation orders were put in place. 'An ecologist was appointed to deal with badger relocation and is on site to make sure that everything is done correctly.’ After yesterday’s early morning drama, the contractors stopped working temporarily and a single bulldozer sat idle on the site. A . Gloucestershire Police spokesman confirmed that contractors started . taking the apple tree down early yesterday when no one was in it, but . two-thirds of the way into their work a protester climbed back up the . tree. He added: ‘No one . was arrested or threatened with arrest. The Chief Inspector responsible . for Stroud is meeting with the owner of the land and we believe that no . action will be taken against any of the protesters because the . contractors what things done as low key as possible.’ Developer Gerard Walsh said: 'I hope we can have a reasonable discussion with the guys up the tree and persuade them what we're doing is the best that could be hoped for from any developer on this site.'","Rowan Burrough, 44, has been camping out in the tree all week .

"By . Emma Reynolds . You may think you know what an addict looks like - but growing numbers of suburban mothers are becoming hooked on prescription drug Adderall in the battle to be the perfect parent. Overstretched women across the US are turning to medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which gives them the energy to keep pace with the frantic pace of their lives. Some mothers, who are often relatively affluent and usually aged in their late 20s and 30s, admit to stealing the drug from their children. Scroll down for video . Feeling inadequate: Betsy Degree, second left, started taking the prescription drug to keep up with the demands of being a mother of four . Between 2002 and 2010, there was a . 750 per cent increase in Adderall prescriptions for women between 26 and . 39. Critics say that is is obvious that not all of these women need the drug for ADHD. Betsy Degree, from Minneapolis, told ABC News that she started taking the prescription drug to cope with the pressure of taking care of four children. 'I grew up in a house where my mom was very neat,' she said. 'Everything was really clean, beautiful dinners every night and that didn't come naturally for me.' Several years ago, one of Ms Degree's children was prescribed Adderall, a central nervous system stimulant, for ADHD. In a moment of desperation she stole a pill from her own child, thinking it would be a one-off, but she was hooked almost immediately. Faking it: Getting hold of the drug often involves telling increasingly convoluted lies to doctors . 'I was able to get all the stuff done around the house,' said Ms Degree. 'I was able to cook the dinner and have everything perfect.' She felt like a 'supermom', she said, and would stay up until 3am doing laundry. 'I couldn't stop,' she said. 'I could not stop taking them. I'd say, I'm just going to take them one more time.' When she ran out she resorted to tricking the family doctor into writing more prescriptions. 'I would call and say we lost them. I would call and say that dose isn't right so can we try a different dose,' said Ms Degree. '[I was trying] every trick in the book.' The need for tricking doctors in order to maintain such habits has created an ominous online community. If you type 'How do I get my doctor to prescribe Adderall?' into Yahoo, you will get tens of millions of hits. While many women start taking Adderall to keep up with the demands of career and home, others use it as a quick weightloss fix. Addiction doctors say the situation is getting out of control. 'This is a significant problem,' said Dr Marvin Seppala, chief medical officer at Hazelden, an addiction treatment facility. Near-death experience: Joani Gammil nearly died of an overdoes after taking ten Adderall pills . 'We've got an increase in women using drugs like Adderall ending up in our treatment programs... It's dangerous and can cause seizures, strokes, heart attacks, even death.' Joani Gammil, a registered nurse, . started taking Adderall after reading a book that told her how to lie to . her doctor to get the drug. One day, Ms Gammil took 10 Adderall pills and nearly died of an overdose. 'I had a sharp pain in my chest, sweating, fast heart beat, pain down my arm,' she said. Today, she helps other women struggling with addiction and has written a book called The Interventionist. For Ms Degree, the consequences were even more extreme. When she realised she could no longer fool her doctor into giving her Adderall, she switched to meth. She lost her business and nearly lost her children. Both women are now clean and warn mother considering taking Adderall to seek help elsewhere. 'It's pretty addictive,' said Ms Degree.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . and Martin Robinson . A major investigation is under way at Bolton NHS Foundation Trust and acting chief executive Dr Jackie Bene has stepped down . Another hospital could be at the centre of a Mid Stafford-type scandal after 'discrepancies' were found in the way patient deaths were recorded. Experts fear cases of septicaemia have been  incorrectly listed at the Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester. Four times as many cases of blood poisoning were recorded than would normally be expected at the hospital in a year. Around 800 cases were recorded between March 2011 and April 2012 , although a similar-sized trust would expect to have just 200. This has raised questions about whether some patients may have been recorded as dying from septicaemia when they also had other conditions that should have been treated or prevented. A death from septicaemia is classed differently to one from, say, pneumonia, where more questions are likely to be raised as to why it happened. A major investigation is now under way and Dr Jackie Bene, acting chief executive of Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, has stepped down. Dr Bene was in charge of recording the information. It came on the eve of a crunch meeting for much-maligned NHS boss Sir David Nicholson, who is refusing to quit despite presiding over catastrophe at Stafford Hospital. Sir David’s fate lies in the hands of the 19 directors on the NHS Commissioning Board, which will hold its first meeting since the Francis report into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal on Thursday. Campaigners . whose loved-ones died unnecessarily at Stafford and other hospitals are . expected to picket the Manchester conference tomorrow morning. In a speech to health professionals today Robert Francis QC said that workers should not wait for . Government recommendations to implement a change of attitudes towards . care in the health service. The discrepancies at Bolton were identified by the independent health watchdog, Dr Foster, which compiles mortality statistics for all trusts each year. Investigation: It is feared that since 2001 an estimated 2,000-plus patients may have died unnecessarily while being cared for by Royal Bolton Hospital NHS Foundation Trust . Today in a statement, Bolton NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The issue . is the way in which some conditions and some causes of death were . recorded on the Trust’s administrative system.  It does not change the . number of people who have died. 'And it does not change the facts or reliability of a patient’s death certificate.' It continued: 'We do not believe that . there are any clinical concerns regarding the care of patients, but . rather there are questions that need answering about how the trust . reports information about their care for administrative and financial . purposes. Pressure: NHS boss Sir David Nicholson will face protests at a Commissioning Board meeting tomorrow as he resists calls to resign . 'The steps we have taken will provide . the Trust and our community with information about what has happened, . any steps that need to be taken and any lessons that may need to be . learned.  The Trust will report back on this in public.' If Bolton NHS Foundation Trust's deceased patients . have been coded incorrectly as dying from septicaemia - when they had a . different cause of death - it could have a drastic impact on the Trust's . death figures. The coding could also affect income, as . hospitals receive money for results and types of illnesses - and septicaemia . receives a higher payments than other infections. Dr Foster and Bolton's Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) are now investigating the septicaemia cases. Their . report, which is supported by NHS Commissioning Board and Professor Sir . Bruce Keogh, the UK's national medical director, is expected to be . completed on March 6. It . is too early to say why the Trust had so many cases of septicaemia, but . the CCG said its interim findings for 50 of the cases show 'cause for . concern'. It is believed patients' records could have been coded incorrectly causing the 'discrepancies'. After six years as one of the worst performing trusts for death rates, Bolton recorded a significant improvement in 2011 and the death rate was in line with expectations for a trust of that size, according to Dr Foster figures. On Monday, . the Trust's interim chairman David Wakefield informed staff that Dr Bene . had 'stepped aside' to 'allow a fully independent view to be taken'. Mr . Wakefield, who was appointed by health watchdog Monitor after the Trust . was put in the highest risk rating for governance and finance, said an . independent team would be brought in to look at coding practices. Dr . Wirin Bhatiani, chairman of Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group, said . it first became aware of the 'unusually high' number of septicaemia . cases in October and commissioned Dr Foster to carry out an independent . audit. Investigation: Death rates at trusts all over the UK are being looked at after up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily in Stafford Hospital between 2005 and 2008 . Pressue: Groups like 'Cure The NHS' have been created in the wake of the scandal, led by campaigner Julie Bailey, pictured in front of a memorial wall for the dead . CCG chiefs . discussed concerns with the Trust, Monitor, quality experts from the . Strategic Health Authority in the North, NHS Greater Manchester and the . Care Quality Commission on January 24. Dr . Bhatiani said: 'While we are keen to wait for the final report, we are . sufficiently concerned by the interim findings to commence further . investigations, and to inform the chair of the trust. 'When . the final report is available on March 6, we will present the findings . openly and transparently, reflecting the fact that the Bolton public are . our main concern and priority.' The new scandal comes just weeks . after a public inquiry into Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust found up to . 1,200 patients died needlessly between 2005 and 2008 because bosses put . government targets ahead . of patient safety. The NHS chief executive is already under pressure to quit after presiding over the scandal. Sir David Nicholson was previously head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority . between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire – but . failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care. Campaigners . whose loved-ones died unnecessarily at Stafford and other hospitals are . expected to picket the Manchester conference tomorrow morning. Campaigners have called for him to quit his £211,000 post, which . he has held for six years, following the public inquiry into the . failings. Tomorrow morning Cure the NHS will stage a silent . protest outside the meeting in Manchester to demand Sir David be held to . account. Its founder, Julie Bailey, said the campaign group would . demonstrate at every board meeting until the under-fire civil servant . resigned or was sacked. Meanwhile the chair of the . public inquiry into the 'disaster' at Stafford Hospital said culture change in the NHS must happen immediately. Robert Francis QC today reiterated some of his . recommendations in the damning report this month, including his call for a registration database for . healthcare support workers. 'Isn’t it odd that the security . guard at the door of the hospital, the driver of the minicab who takes . you there, have more regulation attached to them and more sanction . available to their supervision than does the support worker who is . cleaning the bottom of your grandmother?' he said. Culture change in the NHS should happen immediately, the chair of the public inquiry into the 'disaster' at Stafford Hospital said. Robert Francis QC (right) said that healthcare workers should not wait for Government recommendations to implement a change of attitudes towards care in the health service. Mr Francis’s report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' between 2005 and 2009. He made a total of 290 sweeping recommendations for healthcare regulators, providers and the Government. In his first public appearance since publishing the report, Mr Francis told healthcare professionals at The King’s Fund: 'We are of course waiting for the Government’s response to the recommendations. 'But why are we waiting? There is much in this report that doesn’t require a change of law, it doesn’t require a policy guidance from the Care Quality Commission. 'It doesn’t require anything other than a change of attitude on the part of people. 'Everyone in this room who has a job in the health service can walk out and actually start doing something that makes a difference.' Mr Francis said the 'first and foremost' thing that healthcare workers could do was to listen to those who have complaints because 'there is almost always something you can do about it'. He also reiterated some of his recommendations, including his call for a registration database for healthcare support workers, saying: 'Isn’t it odd that the security guard at the door of the hospital, the driver of the minicab who takes you there, have more regulation attached to them and more sanction available to their supervision than does the support worker who is cleaning the bottom of your grandmother? 'We have to have a system where those who are unfit for the job are excluded from doing so.' He said that patients should be put first in a set of values which each healthcare worker should commit to. He also said there should be “no tolerance” for breaches of fundamental standards in care. Quoting Florence Nightingale, who said it was a strange principle to have to say that the very first requirement of a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm, Mr Francis said: “Also in 1860 there she was saying ‘what can’t be cured must be endured is the very worst and most dangerous maxim for a nurse’. 'Unfortunately we have now found that it was a maxim that was prevalent in the National Health Service at numerous levels even today.' NHS Medical Director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'If we’re to have an open and accountable NHS, where patients and the public know how NHS hospitals are doing, those hospitals must behave openly and honestly about their performance.' 'There are clear national guidelines on how death rates should be recorded, and I expect all NHS hospitals to follow them.'","Major investigation underway at Royal Bolton Hospital, Manchester .

"By . Ashley Collman . Prosecutors say a 25-year-old Colorado mother carried out a 'death sentence' against her two young sons when she locked them in a hot car to have sex with a boyfriend. Heather Jensen sobbed loudly as her trial began Wednesday in Mesa County District Court. While prosecutors are painting her as a 'selfish' and 'lying' mother, her defense says her actions need to be seen in the context of her poor intelligence, young age, and the fact that she had lost her husband two months earlier in a car accident. Head down: Heather Jensen's trial began Wednesday in Mesa County. She is accused of accidentally killing her two young sons, 2 and 4, after leaving them in a car to have sex . Tragedy: Two-year-old William (left) died on November 27 in Colorado while his four-year-old brother Tyler (right) died a week later in hospital. The two had been left by their mother in an SUV with the engine running for 90 minutes . 'It was a tragedy, but it was an accident. It was not a crime,' said public defender Elsa Archambault. The tragic deaths of 2-year-old son William and 4-year-old son Tyler occurred on November 27, 2012. Just two months after her husband Eric's death, Jensen already had a new live-in boyfriend and she told him she was taking the kids to play in the snow. She strapped the boys into their car seats and drove to Grand Mesa, east of Grand Junction to a snow park parking lot where she met up with a male friend to have sex. At first, she left the two boys in the car with the heat on and the doors unlocked. Widowed: Heather Jensen, 24, lost her 26-year-old husband Eric in a car accident last year . Devastating loss: The young mother lost both her sons in the tragic accident last year . Deadly: Heather Jensen dialed 911 on November 27 when she realized that her youngest son was not breathing in the back seat . About a half hour into her tryst, Tyler opened the door and Jensen returned him to the car, gave him her cellphone to play with and locked the child locks. She then went back to her male friend's truck for more than half an hour. In total, the children spent 90 minutes in the car and the investigation revealed that internal temperatures could have reached 140 degrees. The two boys died of hyperthermia. Prosecutors say Jensen is 100 per cent responsible for what happened to her children. 'Ms Jensen created the situation that caused her children to die,' prosecutor Danielle Lewis said in opening statements. Jensen failed three drug tests in the months leading up to her sons Tyler (left) and William's (right) deaths . But Jensen's defense says her poor decisions were a result of her low IQ. Jensen has an IQ of 76 which makes her borderline developmentally disabled. They say she sought the company of the man because she was lonely, and that she was only trying to provide comfort to her children by leaving the heat on in the car. But a boyfriend also told police that she had been smoking marijuana the day her children died. According to the Daily Sentinel, in the months leading up to their deaths, she had failed a court-ordered drug tests three times. Jensen's drug-testing was a mandate of her 18-month deferred judgement following a March 2012 arrest for domestic violence. Her husband Eric told police that Jensen became violent after he confronted her about hanging out with friends who supplied her with Vicodin and Percocet. Prior arrest: Before husband Eric's death, Jensen punched him in a fight and was charged with domestic violence . In and out of jail: Jensen has been arrested several times. She was charged with the domestic abuse of her husband in march 2012. After the death of her two sons, she was arrested yet again after fleeing Colorado to Florida . The charge would be wiped from her record if she stayed out of trouble and kept off drugs but she failed  tests on march 21, October 8 and October 26. Following her boys' death, she even violated the terms of her probation and fled the state to Florida to stay with her family. 'I believe it would be a great opportunity for me to start my life over again in Florida, and being surrounded by all my family who loves me to help me get through the losses Iâ€™ve had in this past month,' Jensen wrote in the letter to a Mesa County judge. 'And I would greatly appreciate it if you will let me move on with my life in Florida.' Jensen's request was denied and she was arrested at her mother's home in North Fort Myers, Florida on January 16, 2013. Her trial is expected to last 9 days. She is being charged with  criminally negligent homicide, child abuse resulting in death and false reporting. The jury deciding her case is made up of 10 women and five men.

"By . Beth Stebner . George Zimmerman has broken his silence, telling the nation of the timeline of events the night Trayvon Martin was shot dead, and saying that he has been vilified into being a racist and a murderer, two things he vehemently denied. Speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Zimmerman recounted the night of February 26 in the gated community in Sanford, Florida, sensationally saying that he did not regret getting out of his car that night. Throughout the hour-long interview, Zimmerman maintained his composure, sitting for much of it with his hands folded neatly in his lap, and keeping a stoic face. When asked what he would tell the nation, Zimmerman firmly said, ‘I’m not a racist, and I’m not a murderer.’ Scroll down to see the interview . No regret: George Zimmerman, left, tells Fox News' Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview that aired Wednesday night that he did not regret being armed or carrying a gun . Opening up: Donations poured in on George Zimmerman's fundraising website after he spoke exclusively to Fox News's Sean Hannity . This is the first time Zimmerman has . publically spoken about the fateful night, explaining that it was no . longer a choice for him to reach for the gun once he said Trayvon Martin . started bashing his head into the sidewalk and noticed his gun. He said: ‘At that point, I realised . that it wasn’t my gun, it wasn’t his gun, it was the gun. He said you’re . going to die tonight, (exploitive). I felt one of his hands going down . my chest to my bolster. It just happened so quickly.’ Hannity later asked him if he . regretted getting out of his car initially. Zimmerman said no, then . saying he didn’t regret being armed, nor his other actions that night, . adding: ‘I feel that it was all God’s plan. For me to second guess it, . um…’ However, at the tail end of the . interview, Zimmerman corrected his first statement saying: ‘I do wish . there was something, anything I would have done to put me in a position . where I didn’t have to take his life.’ Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . He said: ‘I do want to tell everyone – . my wife, my parents, the parents of Trayvon Martin – I’m sorry this . happened. I hate to think that it’s polarised America.’ Booking photo: Zimmerman is pictured in an April 11 mugshot . In the interview, Hannity also . touched on several repercussions of that night. He spoke about how his . wife, Shellie, is facing criminal charges following Zimmerman’s bond . hearings. Hannity asked Zimmerman to walk him . through the night he shot Trayvon. Zimmerman said he was making his . weekly trip to Target to buy food. He also said that unless he was going . to work, he was always carrying his 9mm gun, which he had obtained . through the proper channels. He said he got the gun after an . August 2011 home invasion scared his wife. ‘It frightened her, shook her . up,’ he said. ‘I promised I’d do what I could to keep her safe.’ The night Zimmerman said that Trayvon . was ‘walking very leisurely for the weather. It didn’t look like he was . a resident’ or ‘a fitness fanatic who would train in the rain.’ All of . that, he said, sparked suspicion. He said that Marin was ‘skipping, . going away quickly’ and ‘wasn’t running out of fear.’ At that point, the . former Neighbourhood Watch volunteer said Trayvon came up to him and . asked him what his problem was. Legal battle: The trial of Zimmerman, pictured at an April 20 bond hearing, is set for next June . Grieving parents: Sybrina Fulton, left, and Tracy Martin, second right, the parents of Trayvon Martin, as seen on April 20th . He said he responded, ‘I don’t have a . problem,’ and was looking to grab his cell phone again. It was at that . point, Zimmerman said, that Trayvon punched him squarely in the nose, . breaking it. ‘I don’t remember if I went immediately to the ground,’ he said, ‘but he started bashing my head into the concrete sidewalk.’ All the while, Zimmerman said he was . screaming for help, again saying that the screams heard on the 911 tapes . were his. ‘It was my voice, absolutely,’ he said. Throughout the interview, Zimmerman’s . attorney, Mark O’Mara sat beside his client, listening, and at one point . taking a moment to say that with all the evidence presented, . Zimmerman’s second-degree murder charge should be dropped to . manslaughter. He told Hannity that if given the chance, he would ‘tell them that, again, I’m sorry.’ He continued: ‘I’m sorry that they buried their child. I can’t imagine what it must feel like. And I pray for them daily.’ Outraged: Many, including Rev. Al Sharpton, demanded justice for Trayvon Martin; he is pictured speaking during a public rally at Fort Mellon Park in Sanford on March 22 . Hoodies for Trayvon: Protesters rallied across the country in the weeks following Martin's shooting; this one was held in New York in April . The interview comes one day after it was . revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he . raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car . payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he . was in jail at the time. He went into hiding because he received . thousands of death threats after he was initially not arrested because . he claimed he opened fire on the unarmed teen in self defense. 'Zimmerman will open up about what happened the night of Trayvon Martin’s death and his experience in the aftermath of the fatal shooting,' Fox News says. The hour-long interview will air tonight at 9pm on Fox News. Zimmerman appeared alongside his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, and talked about what led up to and what followed the shooting. Before a jury: Zimmerman, pictured in court earlier this year, will have his next 'stand your ground' hearing in April . Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, center, who says that he has not collected any legal fees from Zimmerman's fund . The interview is the culmination of several months of work by Hannity to land the exclusive interview. In April, at the height over the public uproar over the shooting, Zimmerman called Hannity and had an off-the-record conversation with him. The details of the call have never been made public. The interview is also expected to discuss the $200,000 in donations he received from supporters via a PayPal he set up on his site therealgeorgezimmerman.com. Court filings from O'Mara show that in 18 days, Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 to pay off credit card bills, buy phones, make car payments and pay for an Internet connection -- all of it while he was still in jail. Among the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports. In many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially from the PayPal account. The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000. However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay . down credit card bills -- $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. O'Mara says the bills were for expenses the Zimmerman incurred when they . had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats.

"By . Associated Press . The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas 50 years ago changed the way the media worked for decades to come. On November 22, 1963, a transformative live, global TV news event took place and the idea was born of broadcasting live from the scene, having an anchor for the coverage and letting the images do the talking. It swept an industry without a playbook for covering a breaking story of such magnitude and utterly changed how people receive their news. Scroll down for video . President John F. Kennedy slumps into the arms of his wife Jackie, immediately after he was shot as his motorcade made its way through Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas . For four days, starting with gunfire in Dallas, Texas, and ending with Kennedy's funeral procession in Washington, major U.S. TV networks went live with wall-to-wall coverage, suspending commercials. Other live TV news events followed, and the next time networks devoted as much time to commercial-free news broadcasts came with the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. 'The Kennedy assassination became the template for coverage,' said Bob Schieffer, who 50 years ago covered the event for the Fort Worth Star Telegram and is now a veteran broadcaster with CBS. 'We were working in one of the worst moments of the nation's life back then and we didn't know what to make of it, much like what happened on 9/11,' he told Reuters. The technology was primitive in 1963, but the idea was born of broadcasting live from the scene, having an anchor for the coverage and letting the images do the talking when possible. Some of the tasks were daunting, such as moving studio TV cameras that weighed hundreds of pounds into places such as Dallas police headquarters and stringing heavy cables up a wall and through the police chief's office. Texas Governor John Connally (foreground) adjusting his tie as President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie prepare for their tour on November 22, 1963 of Dallas, Texas . By the time the White House confirmed Kennedy's death just after 1:30 that Friday, 45.4 percent of U.S. homes with a television had their sets in use, according to ratings agency Nielsen. On Monday, soon after the caisson carrying Kennedy's coffin arrived at Arlington National Cemetery, 81 percent of U.S. homes with a television had their sets in use, one of the highest TV ratings in U.S. history, Nielsen said. Mourning and a sense of loss were visceral, with a survey at the time saying about two-thirds of Americans watching the events fell ill or felt emotional distress. Newspapers and radio were the main sources of news the day before the assassination, but the pendulum had swung. 'This is when America became a TV nation,' said Patty Rhule, a senior manager of exhibits at the Newseum, a museum for the news industry in Washington. In 1950 only 9 percent of U.S. households had television. By 1960 it was 90 percent, and the telegenic Kennedy family was part of the draw. New York news papers on the 50th Anniversary of the Kennedy assassination: His death changed the media for decades to come . The look of TV changed as well as the technology. At the time of the assassination, NBC and ABC anchors broadcast from studios that slightly resembled living rooms. Yet the enduring video image is of Walter Cronkite reporting on Kennedy's death for CBS, which moved its camera to the newsroom - a decision that seemed to increase the authority of its broadcasts and which others would follow. Instant replay, a technology CBS planned to roll out a few weeks later for the Army-Navy college football game, made its national debut when Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot suspected assassin Lee Harvey Oswald dead in the basement of the Dallas police building. Japan's first satellite TV broadcast carried news of the JFK assassination. The initial plan was to receive a prerecorded message from Kennedy. Instead, Japanese learned of his death. 'The fact that the tragedy was brought live into people's houses made for compelling viewing, no matter where you were,' said Gary Mack, curator of The Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, housed in the former Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald shot Kennedy. Army cadets during the commemorative wreath-laying ceremony for the former United States President John F Kennedy, on the 50th anniversary of his death at the JFK Memorial Park and Arboretum in New Ross, Co Wexford . 'TV networks realized it was so much easier to connect to people and also that they now had to be prepared to cover everything,' said Mack, whose museum is the main holder of documents and artifacts surrounding the assassination. Reporters were given far more access than is imaginable today, walking up to the body of the president at Parkland Hospital, where he was taken. They camped out with police, demanding Oswald be paraded before them. Much was caught on camera, surprising many viewers with the rawness of how news was put together. After Ruby shot Oswald, the first murder broadcast nationally on U.S. television, Dallas police mostly ended the 'perp walk' for cameras. American officials generally started to keep the media at a greater distance, with many other governments following suit. Cynicism also grew in the public, with many asking if the official version of Oswald acting alone were true. The Vietnam War, race riots in U.S. cities as well as the assassinations of JFK's brother and civil rights leader Martin Luther King further disillusioned many Americans in the 1960s. 'From that weekend, we began to question everything in the country,' said Schieffer, 'even things that we had taken for granted.'","On November 22, 1963, the idea of broadcasting live from the scene, having an anchor for the coverage and letting the images do the talking, was born .

"By . Ben Spencer . Genetically modified crops 'have a role to play' in helping feed the world, the Princess Royal has said - putting her at stark odds with her older brother Prince Charles. Her acceptance that the development of GM crops is 'inevitable' is staunchly opposite to the Prince of Wales who is on the anti-GM side of the debate. The Queen's daughter admits she seldom discusses the issue with the Prince of Wales, who once . suggested the method risked creating ‘the biggest disaster . environmentally of all time’. Princess Anne said new methods are needed to ensure the world's population is adequately fed, adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to accept GM crops will be cultivated. Princess Anne told BBC's Countryfile that GM crops have a role to play in feeding the world, putting her at odds with her brother, the Prince of Wales who is anti-GM . In an interview for the BBC's Countryfile programme she said: ‘I think it (GM) has a role to play, to be honest.' When asked what Prince Charles thought of her viewpoint, she said it is natural for families to adopt differing opinions. She said: ‘I . do think there are some things which, even if you don’t like the sound . of it yourself, you know that it’s got to a point where you’re not going . to stop it, because you can’t.’ Appearing on the BBC One show Princess Anne also advocated gassing badgers as a 'much nicer way' to control the Bovine TB outbreak, than shooting. Princess . Anne’s intervention came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson . refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls. An . independent report found that the ‘controlled shooting’ used so far has . not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in . the South West. Princess Anne said ‘gas is a much nicer way of . doing it, if that’s not a silly expression’. The Princess Royal made the comments in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday on BBC1 . In an . extraordinary interview full of outspoken comments, Princess Anne also . suggested that eating horsemeat is ‘worth looking at’. She said she has tried eating it and found it tasted ‘very good’. In . a series of discussions on countryside matters, Anne backed the recent . pilot badger culls, one of which was carried out in Gloucestershire . where she lives and farms. Her remarks were met with fury from animal rights campaigners, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane. An . independent report published on Thursday found that the badger cull in . Somerset and Gloucestershire had been marred by poor marksmanship. Badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed. Controlled shooting - the shooting of free-running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals, the report found. Asked . about alternatives to gunning them down, Anne said: ‘Most people will . tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it, if that’s not a silly . expression, because of the way it works. ‘And how it works is that you go to sleep, basically.’ Princess Anne's remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane (file picture) The royal’s comments were condemned by animal campaigners and zoologists. Professor . Rosie Woodroffe, senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of . London, said: ‘Gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s, and . reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just wasn’t . very effective. ‘Sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane. That’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982. ‘The . problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in . and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal . concentrations of gas.’ Princess Anne's comments about gassing badgers came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls . She added: ‘Culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour. ‘It’s . much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination, which . could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve . the effectiveness of TB control.’ Mark . Jones, of Humane Society International, said: ‘It is extremely . disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse . the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal. ‘Gassing . experiments carried out at Porton Down in the early 1980s were . abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the . badgers were exposed. ‘Any . attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and . painful death for many badgers, and potentially other non-target . animals.’ Princess Anne . has farmed at her Gatcombe estate for nearly four decades, and bovine . TB has wiped out a third of one herd in the past two years. But . she added that the feared spread of TB to cattle was not the only . reason to cull badgers, which she said were getting out of control in . some areas, causing problems for other species such as hedgehogs, bees . and ground-nesting birds. The . Queen’s daughter said: ‘Even if you took the cattle completely out of . this debate, from a conservation issue alone, you’d have to say there . are too many badgers. ‘A bigger growth in the badger population is not good for the balance of conservation anyway.’ Caroline . Allen, a working vet and member of the Green Party, said: ‘Research . clearly shows that gassing badgers is even more inhumane than shooting . and the Independent Panel Reports has shown that was bad enough. ‘Defra . has clearly stated that gassing with cyanide should never again be . considered and there are no alternate gases available without similar . unacceptable effects.’ CONTROLLED SHOOTINGDuring pilot culls last year marksmen shot at freely running badgers, aiming to cut numbers by 70 per cent. Only 48 per cent were killed in Somerset and 39 per cent in Gloucestershire. Up to 23 per cent took more than five minutes to die. TRAPPED SHOOTING Alternative is to use bait to lure badgers into small cages before killing them with a shotgun. Pilot culls were only meant to use traps as a last resort, but an independent review found contractors started using the method after just two days. GASSINGExperiments in the 1970s and 1980s found too many badgers were injured but not killed by cyanide gas, which critics said was cruel and painful. VACCINATIONSAnimal rights campaigners argue a vaccination programme would be far more humane and effective. A scheme for a ‘buffer zone’ around the worst-affected areas was announced on Thursday, but ministers say it is too late to vaccinate in high-risk areas.","Princess Royal said development of GM crops is 'inevitable'

"By . Ashley Collman . Olympic hockey star T.J. Oshie and his fiancee Lauren Cosgrove welcomed a daughter on St Patricks Day, but the new mom wasn't able to hold her daughter until more than a week later since Lyla Grace was born with a rare stomach condition. Little Lyla was born with a condition called gastroschisis, meaning her intestines were born outside of her stomach. After her birth, doctors placed Lyla's bowels in a silo and slowely returned them to her abdomen, mom Lauren explained in an Instagram post. New baby: Olympic hockey star TJ Oshie (right) and his fiancee Lauren Cosgrove (left) welcomed daughter Lyla Grace (center) on St Patrick's Day. Little Lyla was born with a rare stomach condition and she's still in the hospital . Tough girl: Mom Lauren posted a picture with her little girl after she underwent surgery late last month . Dad and daughter: Lyla was born with a rare stomach condition called gastroschisis, which means she was born with her intestines outside of her stomach . Once the intestines were back inside the infant's stomach, she underwent surgery to close the cavity. Hero: Despite barely making the team, TJ Oshie became a star of the Olympics after helping the men's hockey team advance past Russia in the tournament . According to the CDC, about 1,871 babies are born with the condition each year and there is a 90 per cent survival rate. 'Now we wait to see if she takes to feeding well,' Cosgrove wrote. 'Thanks again for all of the prayers and well wishes, we really, really, appreciate the support.' The hockey-wife-to-be is due to speak more about her daughter's condition on the Today show Friday. 'She's been doing better than we could have ever hoped,' Cosgrove told TODAY in a preview excerpt of the interview. 'It was really upsetting,' Cosgrove said. 'It was tough at first.' But it helps that she has her fiance Oshie for support. 'I'm usually a little more pessimist and he's more optimistic,' she said. The couple made headlines late last year when Oshie was chosen to play on the U.S. Olympic Hockey team. Cosgrove was in the final months of her pregnancy, and therefore wasn't able to travel with her fiance to Sochi. As her soon-to-be-husband became an Olympic sensation, Cosgrove told reporters at home the tale of their romance. 'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' Cosgrove told KSDK. His cheerleader: At the time of the Winter Olympics, Cosgrove was too pregnant to travel and had to cheer on her fiance from home . Victorious: Post-Olympics, Oshie is back playing for the St Louis Blues. Pictured above at the April 1 game against the Philadelphia Flyers . The longtime couple met in North Dakota and Cosgrove moved to St Louis shortly after he joined the Blues. He proposed to her on their 3-year anniversary, just before he left for Sochi, but a then 8-months pregnant Cosgrove had to stay home. 'I might go into labor,' Cosgrove joked about watching the nail-biting Olympic matches. Oshie emerged as one of the real stars of the games after helping the U.S.propel past Russia in the tournament - a remarkable feat considering he barely made the team. He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year. Mom's first cradle: Cosgrove holds her daughter for the first time on March 25, more than a week after she gave birth to the girl . Her rock: Cosgrove says Oshie has been extremely supportive and optimistic as they deal with their daughter's condition . Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win. So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected. Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game. 'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him. 'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.' History in the making: USA forward T.J. Oshie scores the winning goal against Russia goaltender Sergei Bobrovski in a shootout during overtime of a men's ice hockey game at the 2014 Winter Olympics .

"By . Suzannah Hills . and Associated Press . They say it pays to complain, but it seems there is a limit to what even the most generous of companies will tolerate. A rabbi who was tossed out of an airline's frequent flyer programme for constantly complaining has lost his lawsuit against the company. Rabbi S. Binyomin Ginsberg attempted to sue Northwest Airlines over its decision to strip him of his top-level frequent flier status and then end his membership. But U.S. Supreme Court justices unanimously dismissed his lawsuit on Wednesday. Complainer: Rabbi Binyomin Ginsberg sued Northwest Airlines for breach of contract after the airline said he had abused their frequent flyer program by complaining 24 times in seven months . Northwest Airlines, which has since absorbed by Delta Air Lines Inc., said it cut off Ginsberg because he complained too much. The rabbi said Northwest did not act in good faith, and was trying to cut costs because of its merger with Delta. Justice Samuel Alito said that the federal deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 prohibits most lawsuits like the one filed by Ginsberg. The frequent flyer programme is clearly connected to the airline's prices, routes or services, which are covered under the Airline Deregulation Act, Alito said. Ginsberg and his wife flew almost exclusively on Northwest, logging roughly 75 flights a year to travel across the U.S. and abroad to give lectures and take part in conferences on education and administration. He said he flew on Northwest even when other airlines offered comparable or better flights and in 2005, reached the highest level of the WorldPerks programme. Court battle: Northwest Airlines accused the rabbi of abusing its frequent flier programme. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Ginsberg's lawsuit . Northwest cut him off in 2008, shortly after Northwest and Delta agreed to merge. Ginsberg said Northwest was looking to get rid of the high-mileage customers. Northwest says Ginsberg complained 24 times in a seven-month period, including nine instances of luggage that turned up late on airport baggage carousels. Northwest said that before it took action, it awarded Ginsberg $1,925 in travel credit vouchers, 78,500 bonus miles, a voucher for his son and $491 in cash reimbursements. The airline pointed to a provision of the mileage program's terms that gives Northwest the right to cancel members' accounts for abuse. Alito said the court ruling does not leave airline customers without recourse. The Transportation Department has authority to punish unfair and deceptive practices in air transport and can investigate complaints about frequent flier programs. Customers also have the option of enrolling in a rival airline's program, he said. Defense: Ginsberg's lawyers said he and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year, and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10 percent had resulted in a call to Northwest's customer care . In a statement, Delta said it was pleased with the decision and would continue 'to provide customers with a loyalty program that offers valuable benefits and rewards our members' travel'. Ginsberg's attorney, Adina Rosenbaum of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said she was disappointed. 'We think it's one that harms consumers by giving airlines greater freedom to act in bad faith in performing their contracts with consumers,' she said. A federal trial judge cited earlier Supreme Court cases involving claims against frequent flier programs in dismissing Ginsberg's lawsuit, including his claim that Northwest did not live up to the terms of the contract. The judge said the contract gives the airlines the right to kick someone out of the mileage program at its 'sole judgment'. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said part of the suit could go forward involving whether Ginsberg and others can sue under state laws that require parties to a contract to act in good faith.","Rabbi S.

"By . Mark Duell . It’s certainly a good excuse to have when you’re slumped on the sofa and feel like you're simply obliged to finish off that shiny tin of Quality Street. Chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium, according to a study that found amazing comparisons between obese people and drug addicts. In the study, a natural brain chemical called enkephalin - an endorphin with similar properties to opium - surged as rats began to eat M&M chocolates. Addictive: Chocolate has an effect on the brain similar to opium, according to a study that found comparisons between obese people and drug addicts . When a drug was used to stimulate the dorsal neostriatum - the brain area releasing the chemical - the number of M&Ms eaten more than doubled. In the brain, enkephalin binds to molecular ‘receptors’ sensitive to opiate chemicals to reduce pain and produce pleasurable feelings. Previous research mostly linked the dorsal neostriatum to movement, and recent work suggested it also plays a role in reward-driven behaviour. But study leader Dr Alexandra DiFeliceantonio said the extraordinary findings showed comparisons between and drug addicts and the obese. Opium links: The researchers looked at the same brain area which is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes . She said: ‘This (study) means that the brain has more extensive systems to make individuals over-consume rewards than previously thought. 'The same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes' Dr Alexandra DiFeliceantonio . ‘The same brain area tested here is active when obese people see foods and when drug addicts see drug scenes. ‘It seems likely that our enkephalin findings in rats mean that this neurotransmitter may drive some forms of overconsumption and addiction in people.’ The findings of the University of Michigan researcher and her team have been published in the US journal Current Biology. In their paper, the scientists concluded: ‘Opioid circuitry... could in this way participate in normal motivations and perhaps even in generating intense pathological levels of motivation to overconsume reward in binge eating disorders, drug addiction and related compulsive pursuits.’","Study looked at natural brain chemical of enkephalin .

"By . James Daniel . It looks like a modern-day miracle and you could forgive people for wanting to take a closer look at a building that appears to be floating. The Provo Tabernacle in Provo, Utah, was gutted by fire in December 2010. Instead of demolishing the whole building, the residents decided they wanted to save the exterior of the 130-year-old building, so they placed the entire seven million pound structure onto 40-foot-high steel stilts. Scroll down for video... Up in the air: Provo City Center Temple on construction stilts . Darkest day: December 2010, a fire in the middle of the night destroyed everything except the bricks of the building . Doubts: There were worries over whether the building could be saved whatsoever after the extensive damage during the fire of 2010 . Long standing: Before the fire, the tabernacle had been in use since 1886 . 'People are amazed when they see the . construction site,' says project manager Andy Kirby. 'They haven’t seen . anything like it before. They just say it doesn’t look real and are just amazed that we can do that, that we can lift a building up with the piles like that.' Engineers first gutted the damaged interior and then supported the exterior walls with special scaffolding as they dug down to create space for a two story basement. The extra space will allow for more meeting rooms and even parking for worshipers cars. Incredibly, the exterior of the building hasn't moved one bit. Local landmark: The Construction on the tabernacle, which was first recommended by President Brigham Young, began in 1883 . Although the pile-supported elevation technique being employed here has been used in other locations around the world, no one associated with the project is aware of it being used on a building nearly 130 years old. 'We felt this was the best way we could protect and preserve the original tabernacle structure while building a new temple within it and under it,' says Andy Kirby, project manager for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 'As a construction project, it is unique in all the world.' Monitors and load sensors are being employed so engineers can be constantly aware of any changes in elevation or material stress, no matter how slight. 'We are tracking it carefully — every day,' Kirby said. 'We can see an issue before it becomes a problem, and we can make adjustments.' Trick photography? From certain angles it literally appears as though the building is floating . Pricey: No value has been given for the cost of reconstruction but many are questioning why the Mormon Church didn't simply rebuild elsewhere . Gutted: The entire building was destroyed by fire in 2010 with just the outer shell of the building remaining . A concrete wall was inserted on the inside of the brick, giving the building more stability and strength than it had when it was completed in 1898. With a stable exterior, crews then installed the stilts and excavated the soil around the stilts 40 feet below the buildings base. The entire structure is now on stilts some 40 feet in the air and from some angles appears to be floating above ground. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the building is being converted into a Mormon temple. The Provo Tabernacle is a historic treasure for the Church, originally constructed from 1883 to 1898 at a cost of $100,000. The venue used to a community gathering place for meetings and cultural events. After the fire damaged the tabernacle, Church leaders contemplated the future of the tabernacle’s shell. The way we were: The 112-year-old building in its former state. The reconstruction projected will be completed in 2015 . History preserved: The Provo Tabernacle is a historic treasure for the Church, originally constructed from 1883 to 1898 at a cost of $100,000 . Local landmark: The town of Provo believe the reconstruction of the building will bring more visitors to the town . The President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Thomas S. Monson announced in October 2011 that the building would be rebuilt and converted into a Mormon temple. The Provo Tabernacle was severely damaged on December 17th 2010, when a lighting technician mistakenly set a 300-watt light fixture on a wooden speaker box in the attic according to Provo fire investigators. The blaze caused an estimated $15 million in damage. Some have seen the progress on the temple as a catalyst for the rejuvenation of Provo's downtown area. 'There is definitely increased enthusiasm for downtown with this. A lot of interest has been piqued from developers and retail outlets wanting to be associated with the temple,' said Nathan Murray with the Provo City Economic Development Office. 'The restoration of this landmark is attracting a lot of people who want to see history in the making as the pioneer-era tabernacle is transformed into what Latter-day Saints believe is a 'house of the Lord.'' 'We were just talking about how much more expensive it probably is to do a restoration like this, but it seems really worth it to preserve a building that is so important to Provo's history.' The project is expected to be completed in 2015.","Provo Tabernacle almost destroyed by fire in 2010 .

"By . Daniel Martin . A cure for dementia could be found by 2025, David Cameron said today as he announced a doubling in finding for the disease. The Prime Minister also announced that . Britain will be the first place in the world where a new brain scan that can help doctors confirm or rule out a diagnosis of  Alzheimer’s disease will be available for free. The test will mean that, for the first time, doctors will be able to definitively rule out Alzheimer’s in some patients for five years.  Currently, one in five cases of the disease is misdiagnosed. NHS patients will benefit from a new brain scan that can help doctors confirm or rule out a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The scan on the left is of a brain without Alzheimer's, and the one on the right does have it . Promise: David Cameron told health leaders from the G8 nations that the UK government will double funding for dementia research by 2025 . It could also help doctors to confirm an existing diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, ensuring people get the treatment they need. The World Health Organisation forecasts that numbers of dementia sufferers will almost double worldwide every two decades. Mr Cameron said he wants UK Government investment in dementia research to double from £66 million in 2015 to £122 million in 2025 - with similar increases from the commercial and charitable sectors. He said he hoped it would mark the point when 'the global fightback really started, not just in finding a cure for dementia, but also in preventing it, delaying it and, crucially, helping those with dementia to live well and with dignity'. The PM told a major . international summit in London on dementia that he wanted the UK's life sciences industries to play 'a leading role' in the fight against dementia. 'The challenge is huge and we are a long way from a cure, but there is hope,' he said. 'We meet with the conviction that human ingenuity can overcome the most daunting of challenges and we meet with the determination that we will take the fight to dementia and improve and save millions of lives.' And he added: 'The aim of trying to find a cure or disease-halting therapy by 2025 by a big collective boost to research funding is within our grasp.' Mr Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (centre) pose with health ministers from the G8 nations at the Dementia Summit at Lancaster House in London . The . new Alzheimer's test – which costs £810 per patient – involves giving the patient a . tiny amount of a radioactive chemical called Amyvid which binds to the . tell-tale plaques in the brain of an Alzheimer’s sufferer. This . chemical will show up the plaques on a brain scan for the first time, . allowing doctors to definitively rule out Alzheimer’s in a patient for . at least five years if no plaques are present. It means the patient will . not be given potentially harmful treatments if they don’t need them. Until . this breakthrough, it was not possible to definitively diagnose someone . as having the disease until after their death, by cutting up their . brain. Such examinations . show that one in five people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s do not in fact . have it, meaning they may have been given the wrong treatment while they . were alive. These patients will be the test’s main beneficiaries. In . addition, if the test reveals the presence of plaques on the brain, it . could confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. However, the plaques can be . present in other conditions and so the scan alone is not enough to . pinpoint the disease. Until this breakthrough, it was not possible to definitively diagnose someone as having the disease until after their death, by cutting up their brain . There . are 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and about two thirds of . those are Alzheimer’s. By 2021, more than a million people will have . dementia. It is one of the main causes of disability in old  age, ahead . of cancer, heart disease and stroke. Mr Cameron said: ‘It doesn’t matter whether you’re in London or Los Angeles, in rural India or urban Japan – this disease steals lives, it wrecks families, it breaks hearts and that is why all of us here are so utterly determined to beat it. ‘In generations past, the world came together to take on the great killers. We stood against malaria, cancer, HIV and Aids and we are just as resolute today. ‘I want December 11th 2013 to go down as the day that the global fight-back began.’ The Amyvid test – developed by US drugs firm Lilly – has previously been used elsewhere in the world, but only through private health schemes. Use of the technique by the NHS is the first time it has been available as part of a state-funded health system. The first British patient to benefit will be scanned tomorrow at  Charing Cross Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, in London. Dr Richard Perry, consultant  neurologist at the trust, said it could help hundreds of people every year. ‘For people who have memory problems and who are concerned about them, knowing the cause is the first step in getting the right sort of treatment. ‘Until now, diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease has not been always straightforward because we haven’t had a simple test. A positive scan in the right context could support a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, but you would have to look at a person’s other symptoms as well.’ He said research indicates that a negative scan would mean a person would be highly unlikely to develop Alzheimer’s in the next five years. But it would be no guarantee that the condition could develop in future years.","Doctors will be able to rule out Alzheimer's in some patients for five years .

"By . Daniel Miller . He's the singing Cardinal who uses Facebook to spread the word of the Lord, and he's now being tipped as a contender to become the first Asian Pope. Philippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Asia's most prominent Roman Catholic leader, sings on stage, preaches on TV and reduces churchgoers to laughter and tears with his often light-hearted sermons. With his down-to-earth, personable manner, Tagle, nicknamed 'Chito' by his adoring followers, seems a world apart from the conservative Cardinals and Bishops of Europe and North America. Contender: Philippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is being tipped to become the first Asian pope . On the pulse: The Cardinal's Facebook page Facebook page advertising his televised Sunday sermons . His compassion for the poor and unassuming ways have impressed followers in his homeland, Asia's largest Catholic nation, and church leaders in the Vatican. Despite this his chances of becoming Pontiff are considered remote, as many believe that Latin America or Africa - with their faster growing Catholic flocks - would be more logical choices if the papal electors look beyond Europe. But even the hint of papal consideration has electrified many in the heavily Catholic Philippines, where past pontiffs had been welcomed by millions with rock-star intensity. 'It'll bring such immense glory to us . and our country,' said Leo Matias, one of several waiters at a Chinese . restaurant in Manila's suburban Quezon city who served dinner to Pope . John Paul II when he visited in 1995. The . restaurant has displayed the set of spoon, fork, table napkin, water . goblet and knives - still unwashed after the pope's meal of grilled fish . and fried shrimp. The . talks surrounding Tagle have been fueled by prominent Vatican experts, . who see in the boyish-looking cardinal the religious zest, stamina, . charisma and communications skills that could energize the church facing . crises on many fronts. Appointment: Cardinal Tagle receives his biretta hat from Pope Benedict XVI as he is made a cardinal in November last year . Personable: Cardinal Tagle, seen here with fellow Filipino Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, has impressed church leaders in the Vatican with his compassion for the poor . John Thavis, a Vatican analyst and author of 'The Vatican Diaries,' said the selection of Polish-born John Paul II in 1979 shows the 'unthinkable' can occur once the cardinals are closed off in the conclave. 'There are people, even Vatican officials here, who have whispered to me, `Tagle, he's the man,'' Thavis told The Associated Press. When asked about the papal buzz, Tagle demurred: 'Only a speculation.' 'He's an effective communicator and missionary at a time when Catholicism's highest internal priority is a new evangelization,' John Allen, a Rome-based analyst, wrote for the National Catholic Reporter . 'Tagle incarnates the dramatic growth of Catholicism outside the West, putting a face on the dynamic and relatively angst-free form of Catholicism percolating in the Southern Hemisphere,' he said. 'He would certainly be a symbol of the church in the emerging world, but given his intellectual and personal qualities, hardly a hollow one.' Still, Tagle's relative youth - at 55, he's the second youngest among the cardinals - could be a liability. Cardinals could be reluctant to risk giving the reins of the Vatican to someone who could reign for decades. The churchman who last caught the deep adoration of many Filipino Catholics was Cardinal Jaime Sin, who died in 2005. A beloved spiritual leader and moral compass, Sin helped rally multitudes in the massive 'people power' revolts that ousted two presidents, including dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. Cardinal Tagle waits for the start of a vespers celebration in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican yesterday . Sin's death left a vacuum in the church saddled with the task of shepherding Catholics in a country plagued by poverty, divisions, crimes and long-raging Muslim and Marxist insurgencies. Unlike Sin, Tagle was not propelled by any extraordinary events. But people who know him say that Tagle slowly carved a reputation for simple, day-to-day acts that defined him as a man of deep faith and intellect. The younger of two children of a pious Catholic couple who worked in a bank, Tagle dreamed of becoming a doctor. But he was redirected by a Jesuit friend to the priesthood at a seminary in the upscale Ateneo de Manila University, where he graduated summa cum laude, according to his theology professor, the Rev. Catalino Arevalo. He's gifted with great communications skills. A wonderful storyteller with a bent for music, Tagle speaks fluent Italian, English and Tagalog. He also has proficient French and can say Mass in Latin. But he prefers to stay in the background. 'He's not somebody who sort of wants to, by personality, put himself at the center of the stage,' Arevalo said. 'Now, if he's called to be in front, he has all the capability of doing it.' Tagle took clear positions on church and social issues but was never confrontational or 'super militant,' Arevalo said. For instance, he encouraged dialogue when he helped lead an unsuccessful church campaign against the government-endorsed health plan that promotes contraceptives. Tagle was ordained in 1982 and became bishop in 2001 at an old cathedral, about a block from his family's home in Imus just south of Manila. Aside from his church work, he taught theology in a hilltop seminary, where he lived for about two decades, staying in a room that had no television or air-conditioning, according to seminary staffers. Even as a bishop, Tagle did not own a car. He took the bus or 'jeepney,' the popular working-class minibus, to church and elsewhere. He ate with workers and sang for a church charity, impressing many with his baritone voice. Tagle stood out for his powerful homilies. A few years ago, he started hosting a Sunday gospel show on TV, where he preached and answered questions. Staffers then opened a Facebook page for him, which has jumped to more than 120,000 followers. Tagle's path at some point crossed with the future pope, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who introduced him to John Paul II and reportedly assured the pontiff in jest that the Filipino with a youthful face has received his first communion. Ratzinger appointed Tagle as a member of the Vatican's International Theological Commission, or ITC, and was impressed with his research work and papers. 'I am sure that it was because of what he saw in him at the ITC that Pope Benedict chose him for Manila and then for the red hat' of a cardinal, said the Rev. Joseph Komonchak, one of Tagle's instructors at Catholic University of America. In October 2011, Benedict declared Tagle the new archbishop of Manila, then just a year later, elevated him to cardinal. Tagle tearfully acknowledged in a recent homily in Imus that he was overwhelmed by his rapid rise. 'It's unnerving,' he said. Larger audiences have turned up to listen to his talks and homilies, where he often raised the need for the Catholic Church to reconnect with people. Almost always, Tagle is mobbed like a movie star by fans jostling to get his picture. 'I think many of the cardinals will say, `It's too much, too soon,'' the professor Arevalo said of Tagle's chances in the conclave. But he added: 'We don't know what God wants. If God wants it, God will make up for it.'","Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is Asia's most prominent Roman Catholic .

"By . Ashley Collman . Two men were killed Sunday evening in a plane crash while filming a low-budget zombie movie in Central Florida. Dennis Monroe, 65, was piloting the small single-engine airplane around 7:30pm while 70-year-old Joseph Sardinas filmed him from the back seat. The two men were in the air about Monroe Airpark in Summerfield for about an hour before witnesses heard the engine stall and the plane took a nose dive. Tragic end: Pilot Dennis Monroe, 65, and cinematographer Joseph Sardinas, 70, were filming a scene for a low-budget zombie film when their plane crashed in a Central Florida Sunday evening, instantly killing both men . Passed: 70-year-old cinematographer Joseph Sardinas (pictured) was in the back seat filming Monroe fly when the engine stalled and the plane crashed . 'Then all of a sudden the last pass around, the sound stopped and it just dropped,' neighbor Jennifer Crandall told WESH. 'They were neighbors and very nice neighbors, they've been here for years and years, Ms Crandall added. 'He's flown for years, had his own plane, he built that plane, he'd fly quite regularly.' Both Monroe and Sardinas were killed instantly. The two were filming the finale to zombie film 'What Tomorrow Brings' and according to Monroe County fire officials, there were 'lots of extras' nearby at the time. 'It could've been much worse, because if it came down where all those people were it could've been very tragic,' Ms Crandall remarked. According to the film's Facebook page, 'What Tomorrow Brings' follows the lives of seven people as they fight to survive as zombies takeover Ocala, Florida. One of the filmmakers posted an event invitation for the shoot of the 'epic movie finale'. 'What Tomorrow Brings is hitting the skies with an explosive airplane finale sequence filming!!!! '...There will be planes. There will be guns. And, of course, zombies!' the post read. Agents with the Federal Aviation Association and National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the crash site Monday. Monroe was flying a Van's RV-7 plane, a single-engine, two-seat plane that is sold in kits to be assembled by the owner. Monroe, from Summerfield, was the public works director and neighbors said he built the plane years ago.

"By . Chris Pleasance . America's fattest and thinnest places have been revealed in a new survey which highlights the continuing national obesity crisis. Huntington-Ashland, a metropolitan area which covers parts of Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, has been revealed as the nation's fattest location with 39.5 per cent of adults classed as obese, based on data collected between January 2012 and December 2013. In a separate survey last month, Hutington was also named as the most miserable place in the US, largely thanks to residents' poor health. Boulder, Colorado, scooped the award for thinnest area in the U.S. with just 12.4 per cent of the population tipping the scales as obese. Named and shamed: A survey has revealed the fattest and thinnest places in America, with Huntington-Ashland faring the worst, with nearly two in five adults being obese (map shows main city in each area surveyed) Huntington-Ashland, Ohio, has been named the fattest place in America as a separate survey reveals it is also the second-most miserable location. Boulder, Colorado, has been the thinnest place in the States since 2011 . FATTEST . Huntington-Ashland, Oh, W. Va, Ky. (39.5) McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas (38.3) Hagerstown-Martinsburg, Md, Wv.

(19.6) The new figures reveal that, since the last survey was done in 2011, Huntington-Ashland residents have become heavier. In 2012 the area had an obesity rate of 36 per cent and ranked third in the table. Of all 10 locations featured in the top 10 in 2011, it is also the only place to have moved up the rankings. McCallen, Texas, remains in the top 10 but has dropped one place to second, while Charleston, West Virgina, has stayed at number 6. In 2011 Boulder was also the thinnest location, although on that occasion only 12.1 per cent of people were obese, meaning the city's residents have also become fatter over the last two years. In a separate survey Huntington-Ashland was also revealed to be the most miserable area in the U.S., just in front of Charleston, West Virginia. Nearly one in ten residents has previously had a heart attack. They also reported the lowest levels of emotional health, had lower evaluations of their own lives than any other US city, and were more likely to feel worried or depressed than other Americans. Researchers for the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index noted that the least happy cities tended to be those with higher obesity rates, and lower exercise rates. The most miserable also tended to smoke more, earn less money and have a lower level of education. Boulder was listed as the second happiest place in the U.S., only beaten by the cheery residents of Lincoln, in Nebraska. On the obesity tables, Charlestown has held its position in 6th place between 2011 and 2012/13 with an obesity rate of 34.6 per cent, up from 33.8 per cent in the last survey. The surveys were conducted for the annual Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which tracks obesity levels across the country using Americans' Body Mass Index scores. The indexes are calculated based on a person's self-reported height and weight radio, with scores of 30 or above considered obese. All seven other places in the most obese table are new, with Haggerstown, Maryland, taking third place, Yakima, Washington, coming in fourth and Little Rock, Arkansas making up the top five. Skinny city: Boulder, Colorado, was found to be the thinnest place in the survey with just 12 per cent of residents being obese . Gallup attributes this to the state's vast 'outdoor spaces and activities,' that helps promote residents' active lifestyles. The study found that more than 15 per cent of adults are obese in all but one of the 189 cities surveyed. It also found that last year, the national obesity rate increased to 27.1 percent, which is the highest on record since the annual surveys began in 2008. In 2010 the government set 15 per cent as the national obesity target. 'Rising obesity rates have significant health consequences,' Janna Lacatell, Healthways Lifestyle Solutions Director said. 'In order to combat the trend and encourage individuals to make healthier choices, community-based policy and environmental approaches can, and should, be used,' she added. However, other factors could include exposure to sunlight, as last week U.S. researchers revealed that just 20 to 30 minutes of exposure to morning sunshine had an effect on BMIs. Researchers from Northwestern University believe this is because daylight sets our body-clock, meaning we feel less hungry and use energy more efficiently. Founded in 1775 as 'Holderby's Landing' by Collis P Huntington, quite a rotund man himself, Huntington (the largest city of the Huntington-Ashland area), was originally a river trading post, cited near where the Guyandotte River and Ohio River join one-another. It also served as the terminus point for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, and its early industry depended heavily on producing steel and manufacturing. The town went into decline after the Second World War, with residents moving away in droves. Obesity . capital: Huntington-Ashland has been found to be the fattest place in . America with almost forty per cent of residents registering as obese . Since obesity records started being kept in 2008, the area has featured highly ever single year, coming in third place in 2011, and now topping the table for 2012/13. As a result Huntington formed the backdrop for ABC's Food Revolution, featuring British chef Jamie Oliver as he tried to persuade American schools to feed children healthier food. The Huntington area also came first in a table of the most miserable places in the US published last month, with respondents among the most likely in the US to report physical health problems including high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Nearly one in ten residents has previously had a heart attack. They also reported the lowest levels of emotional health, had lower evaluations of their own lives than any other US city, and were more likely to feel worried or depressed than other Americans. Just 19 per cent of residents have a college degree, one third of adults smoke, and the average household income is $38,000 a year.

"By . Ashley Collman . The New York bakery known made world-famous for introducing the Cronut remained closed Monday after a failed health department inspection last week. Dominique Ansel Bakery on Spring Street has been host to hour-long waits in the morning with tourists and locals alike dying to try the Cronut -  a croissant/doughnut hybrid. But the sidewalk was empty Monday after inspectors found several hundred mouse droppings on the premises. Scroll down for video . Still closed: Dominique Ansel Bakery remained shut Monday after failing a health inspection on Friday. The health department sent inspectors to the Spring Street shop after a customer posted a video online showing a mouse on the bakery floor . Appetite ruined? The bakery became world-famous last year after introducing the Cronut, a croissant/doughnut hybrid. Department of Health officials say they found several mouse droppings on the floor at the bakery . The health department responded after a customer posted a video online Thursday showing a mouse scampering around the bakery floor. YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, telling Gothamist: 'I . pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't . believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave. 'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it. 'This . was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the . place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out,' Mr Pickrodt said. After . the video was posted online, workers at the bakery spent seven hours in . a deep clean and a spokesman told MailOnline that not a single mouse was found. But . a health department spokesman had a very different story tell after . shutting the establishment down for a 'severe' pest infestation. 'What . made the infestation severe was that the health inspector found several . hundred mouse droppings,' a DOH spokesman told Gothamist. Bakery . spokesman Amy Ma maintained that the DOH 'did not find a single mouse . or any rodent' and that 'evidence of infestation' was really just cracks . and holes in the walls. She says they are now waiting for a re-inspection which they expected for Monday. The . health department spokesman said a re-inspection wouldn't happen until . the bakery submitted a pest control plan which hadn't been turned in . yet. The restaurant previously had an A health rating despite being cited for 'evidence of live mice present' in October. The shuttered door at the bakery came as a disappointment for many who showed up unaware of the recent health inspection. 'This . bakery was our first stop in New York,' a tourist from Atlanta, Georgia . told the New York Daily News. 'I would think they'd keep their food in . good condition, I would have waited.' Local Carmine Soprano, 28, was just as angry when he showed up to get a few doughnuts for co-workers and saw no line. 'This is horrible!' Mr Soprano said. 'I . worked in a lot of restaurants and bakeries, it's just a part of most . restaurants in New York, You can't really prevent it,' he added. Bold mouse: The YouTube use who took the video says he saw the mouse scamper around for a good 20 seconds before taking out his camera phone . The video came just a few days days after . another YouTube user posted two videos of rats infesting a Garment . District Dunkin' Donuts location. After . hearing about the reports, the New York City Health Department . investigated and shut down the store at West 37th Street and 8th Avenue, . citing a 'severe' pest infestation.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Charged: David Gherity, 60, has been charged with first-degree assault after lighting his longterm girlfriend on fire in his condominium . A suspended lawyer with a history of abusive behavior has been arrested for dousing his longterm girlfriend with nail polish remover and hair spray before setting her on fire. David Gherity, 60, has been charged with first-degree assault after the attack that left his girlfriend without an ear and burns all over her body. The victim- who had burns on her legs, scalp and face- has not been named and was the one to identify Gherity as her attacker. The Star Tribune reports that the fire alarm went off at Gherity's Burnsville, Minnesota condo on February 9 and the emergency responders saw the victim 'on fire sitting at a table'. They were able to control the blaze and rushed the woman to a nearby hospital. 'The b****** tried to burn my house down,' she reportedly told one of the firemen during the rescue. Police began to suspect Gherity when he arrived at the hospital smelling of smoke. When they asked if he had been present at the scene, he told them that he had arrived there later and not been caught in the blaze. Two weeks later, police spoke to the victim's sister who said that she had received a hushed voicemail from her sister on the day of the attack saying Gherity 'has gone berserk. I can't talk right now. I'll call you later.' The couple had been together for about 10 years at the time of the February attack. Legal past: Gherity, seen in an undated photo, was disciplined four times after he passed the Minnesota bar in 1982 and was charged in 2001 for assault after attacking his then-girlfriend . The victim's condition immediately after that accident was not instantly clear, but The Star Tribune reported that she spoke to police on March 4 and said that he was stressed on the day of the fire. The last thing she remembered was drinking and taking undisclosed medication before falling asleep on the couch. She then woke up during the fire. Emergency responders found alcohol bottles near her body when they arrived, and other bottles that they said could have contained nail polish remover and hair spray in the vicinity. Gherity told the victim's sister that maybe the hairspray and nail polish she uses caught on fire, but the victim later told police that she does not use either product. Gherity had four earlier disciplinary incidents since passing the Minnesota bar in 1982 and was convicted of assault in 2001. He has been suspended since 2004 as a result of that brutal attack. Living in the past: Gherity posted this photo of his bar identification card in March 2013- nine years after his legal license was suspended . Reports by the Office of Lawyer's Professional Responsibility describes how he was convicted of fifth-degree assault and disorderly conduct in late 2000, which led to the 2001 arrest. 'The convictions, which were affirmed by the court of appeals, arose from an incident on October 29, 2000 in which Gherity assaulted his girlfriend by repeatedly kicking her in the hallway outside of her 26th floor apartment and when a neighbor attempted to intervene, Gherity also assaulted the neighbor by chasing him to the 26th floor balcony, forcing him against the railing with his hands around his throat, and then repeatedly punching him,' the report reads. The girlfriend involved in the 2000 assault was not identified, but given the timeline, it does not seem likely that it was the same woman from this year's attack.","David Gherity, 60, is charged with lighting his girlfriend on fire in his Burnsville, Minnesota condo .

"By . Ap . A big drop in customer complaints helped U.S. airlines post their best ratings ever even though more flights were late and more bags were mishandled, according to a report released Monday by university researchers. Virgin America topped the ratings, and three regional airlines scored at the bottom. Among the four biggest airlines, Delta ranked best followed by Southwest, American and United, according to researchers from Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Tired of complaining? Fewer customer complaints helped U.S. airlines post their best ratings ever even though more flights were late and more bags were mishandled . The researchers have graded airlines since 1991 on government figures for on-time performance, mishandled bags, bumping passengers, and complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Their key findings: . ON-TIME PERFORMANCE: Airlines operated 78.4 percent of their flights on time in 2013, down from 81.8 percent in 2012. Best: Hawaiian Airlines; worst: American Eagle. Only two airlines improved: American Airlines and United. BAG HANDLING: The rate of lost, stolen or delayed bags rose 5 percent. Best: Virgin America; worst: American Eagle. BUMPING: The rate of bumping passengers from flights fell 8 percent. Best: JetBlue Airways; worst: SkyWest. COMPLAINTS: Consumer complaints to the government dropped 15 percent in 2013 after rising 20 percent the year before. Best: Southwest Airlines; worst: Frontier. The best: For the second year in a row, Virgin America tops the list of the nation's best airlines . 1) Virgin America . 2) JetBlue . 3) Hawaiian . 4 Delta . 5) Alaska . 6) Endeavor . 7) US Airways . 8) Southwest . 9) American . 10) AirTran . 11) Frontier . 12) United . 13) ExpressJet . 14) SkyWest . 15) American Eagle . One of the report's authors, Wichita State business professor Dean Headley, credited the drop in complaints partly to United Airlines. The company suffered several computer-network outages and grounded hundreds of flights in 2012 when it combined the United and Continental computer networks after a merger, but ""got their act together"" in 2013, he said. Headley said the drop in complaints might also reflect 'a certain amount of resignation' that 'it's never wonderful for airline passengers.' It's not clear that the researchers captured the mood of travelers. No matter how much people gripe about airlines, very few of the millions of fliers ever bother to file a complaint with the government. The Department of Transportation, or DOT, received just 9,684 complaints last year after getting 11,447 in 2012. Chris Lopinto, CEO of ExpertFlyer.com and not involved in the academic report, said he believes that most consumers complain directly to the airlines instead. 'The DOT can't comp you miles or comp you a voucher — only the airlines can do that,' Lopinto said. 'A passenger might not think to file with DOT.' The Worst: American Eagle has dropped from the 11 spot to 15, making it the worst of the nation's 15 airlines . Luggage: The The rate of lost, stolen or delayed bags rose 5 percent. Virgin America received the highest rating . Most of the worst grades — from late flights and lost bags to bumping passengers off planes — were earned by smaller regional airlines. In the overall standings, American Eagle, the regional affiliate of American Airlines, finished last, just ahead of SkyWest and ExpressJet, which operate regional flights for United and Delta. Regional airlines fly smaller planes, their flights are the first to be canceled in bad weather, and they operate at smaller airports that might lack the maintenance capability of bigger airports. However, they have become critical to the so-called hub-and-spoke system that United, American and Delta use to connect passengers to flights at big 'hub' airports. 'If you have hubs, you need spokes or the wheel doesn't work,' Headley said.","Of the nation's 15 leading airlines, Virgin America topped the list, according to a recently released study .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Police believe they've finally closed a 17 year old cold case of an Illinois teen who was sexually assaulted, murdered and dumped in a Wisconsin swamp. Amber Creek, 14, was found posed against a tree with the word 'hi' written on her hand in a wildlife refuge just days after she ran away from a shelter for abused and neglected children. The runaway was known as only Jane Doe by Racine County investigators for the next 16 months, and only this past Saturday was an arrest made in the horrific 1997 case. Scroll down for video . Cold case: Illinois 14-year-old Amber Creek was raped, murdered and dumped in the woods in a gruesome murder that went unsolved for 17 years . Police announced they planned to name the 36-year-old suspect at a press conference Monday. 'My investigators and I sifted through thousands of reports, and spent thousands of hours over the years trying to solve this senseless murder of a child,' Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling told the Journal Times. Creek was a ward of the state when her body was discovered naked from the waist down by two hunters on February 9. 1997. It took nearly a year and a half for investigators to uncover her identity. Runaway: The teen ran away from a shelter for abused children in January 1997 and her body was found days later. Police announced Saturday that an arrest had been made in the cold case . In addition to the haunting message left on Creek's palm, her killer stuck a $5 price tag from an area bookstore onto her arm. 'Today by far was the best moment for my investigative team as we informed Amber’s dad that we caught her killer,' Schmaling said. 'It was an emotional exchange for everyone in the room.' Creek was last seen getting into a gray luxury vehicle with a placard on the license plate that included the word 'mayor.' A description of the white male driver allowed police in conjunction with America's Most Wanted to create a sketch of the suspect. The sketch was shown on the air in a December 1998 episode of the crime stoppers series that dealt with Creek's murder.

Teleka Patrick, 30, had a personal protection order filed against her . by pastor and gospel singer Marvin Sapp, 46, who said Dr Patrick had . visited his home and contacted his young children to get close to him.

They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship. Her family has now asked the investigator handling another famous missing persons case, Mary Land, who disappeared ten years ago, to help find her. Dr Patrick's parents met with Jim Carlin of Justinian Investigative Services in Battle Creek and the agency will now work on her case. Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked . Dr Patrick had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring . Close to home: The hotel is located just five minutes from Dr Patrick's apartment . Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.' She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida. 'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked. Her . family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her . disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator.

"By . James Rush . Jesse Jackson Jr, the son of Reverend Jesse Jackson and former congressman, has been moved prisons after he was locked in solitary confinement following a dispute with prison officials, it has been claimed. A guard at the federal prison in North Carolina where the 49-year-old has been held since October reportedly took exception to him advising fellow inmates about their rights. Jackson, who was a Democratic congressman from 1995 until he resigned in November 2012, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison last August after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items. Jesse Jackson Jr (pictured arriving at federal court in Washington last August with his wife Sandra) has moved prisons after spending time in solitary confinement when a guard took exception to him advising inmates on their rights . Jackson's transfer reportedly transpired after he was placed in solitary confinement for four days last month following a dispute with a guard, a source told The Chicago Sun-Times. A hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing and Jackson asked for a transfer. He has now been moved to the prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base, in Alabama. He is now listed on the Bureau of Prisons' website as an inmate at the Montgomery facility. Family members confirmed the move to The Chicago Sun-Times on Saturday. His father, the Rev Jesse Jackson, told The Chicago Tribune that his son's spirits were 'great'. 'He's been writing and teaching and honoring his medical regime,' he said. Jackson has been treated previously for bipolar disorder. Jackson was sentenced to two and a half years in prison last August after he pleaded guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items . At the time of his sentencing last year, Jackson, who emotionally apologised to his father, mother, congressional colleagues and others, was given less prison time than federal guidelines recommended. The judge recognised him as a 'complex person' who had done both good and bad. His wife Sandra Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns. She will serve her time once her husband is released. According to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TVs, restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items.","Former congressman was locked in solitary confinement following dispute .

She said she was awake in bed after her husband left for work when she heard a massive crash. 'It sounded like . someone was in the house going through all of our things,' Costanzo told MailOnline. 'I was convinced someone was in the house. I was trembling.' Caught! Police officer Greg Connolly caught and released a duck who flew into a Massachusetts home through its chimney and was mistaken for a home intruder. It was covered in soot when it was found . Fearful that the intruder might have a weapon, she locked herself and her pet dogs inside her bedroom and called 911. Dispatchers told her to remain on the line and stay inside the bedroom until police arrived. Officers reached the house minutes later, checked the perimeter and concluded that there were no signs of forced entry. At that point, they told the pajama-clad Costanzo to meet them downstairs.

"By . Alex Greig . The White House may ban all presidential selfies, bringing to an end a series of selfies taken by illustrious personalities, ranging from prime ministers to science guys, with President Obama. The possibility was raised by White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday morning. Pfeiffer said that following the controversy after a Red Sox player took a photo with Obama on Wednesday and was later revealed to have a deal with Samsung, the White House had 'had talks' with the Korean company. Scroll down for video . Say cheese: Obama allows David Ortiz to take a selfie with him, unaware the latter is contracted to Samsung . Going viral: If Samsung did instruct Ortiz to take a selfie with Obama, it's certainly garnered a lot of attention - although not necessarily the right kind . He emphasized that Obama didn't know that the selfie was part of a Samsung promotion. 'Well, (Obama) obviously didn't know anything about Samsung's connection to this,' he said, adding 'perhaps maybe this will be the end of all selfies.' President Obama unwittingly became part of Samsung's marketing campaign when the Red Sox visited the White House last week. Hitter David Ortiz snapped an apparently impromptu selfie with the president, but it later turned out he had inked a deal with Samsung to be the company's 'social media insider.' The role requires him to promote the company's smartphones and contribute to viral marketing campaigns. Ortiz tweeted the image, garnering more than 38,000 retweets - including one by Samsung, which has more than 5.2 million followers.

Science guys: Obama smiles with scientists Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson . Ortiz denies he was instructed to take the Obama selfie by Samsung, but the idea of the president's likeness being used to market electronics caused uproar. Pfeiffer said that the White House has 'had conversations with Samsung about this and expressed our concerns' but did not elaborate, saying only, 'We've left that conversation to our lawyers.'

Robert Bzdek, 34, attacked daughter Zuzanna on Friday afternoon at their home in Woodridge, Illinois, before going to his bedroom and hanging himself. Bzdek's stepson, Emanuel Szyszka, discovered the gruesome scene on when he came home to collect sports kit for gymnastic practice. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Zuzanna Bzdek, 3, was stabbed to death by 34-year-old father Robert in their home. His teenage stepson Emanuel Szyszka (right) discovered the scene on Friday afternoon . The teenager said he discovered bloody footprints at the door of his home and called out to Bzdek, who said he had cut his foot on broken glass. When Emanuel went inside he discovered the door to the master bedroom had been barricaded shut and called police. By the time officers arrived and got into the room, Bzdek had hanged himself. Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel said: 'I watched as they carried my limp sister out the door.' Zuzanna, who was alive when police officers arrived, was taken to hospital but later died in surgery. Emanuel has since set up a webpage to raise fund's for Zuzanna's funeral and burial costs. Writing on the page, Emanuel said: 'We are trying to raise money for my deceased sister Zuzia's funeral service and wake. 'The whole family would really appreciate if each person contributed some sort of dollar amount for our cause, and to every contributor, thank you sincerely for your time and support given such an atrocity. You will always be in our hearts.' The page surpassed its initial goal of $9,000 within hours of being posted and is now aiming for $15,000. The total currently stands at $12,020. Emanuel added: 'The family is really thankful for all of your support and love that all of you guys have provided for us. 'We will be able to give out precious Zuzia the burial that she deserves because of you guys. I can sincerely say that I love all of you for helping us out in one of the hardest moments of our lives. 'We are getting so much support from all of you kind and wonderful people, and we are oh so pleased to have such a great community. Emmanuel has set up a webpage to raise fund for Zuzanna's funeral, and has collected more than $12,000 . 'We aren't quite sure how much is needed for the funeral/wake, but all the possible funds are appreciated to cover all the expenses. 'Thank you everyone so much, you are bringing tears to my eyes at how good and kind you are in the face of such an evil and cruel act to the most wondrous sister I could have asked for. 'I know this is going to be a really tough time for all of us (extended family and friends included), but if we just keep strong and unite against this awful atrocity; we can and will make my sister proud of us all. 'All of you kind-hearted souls are making this tragedy easier for the family, so thank you again.' NBC Chicago interviewed elderly neighbour Raymond Davis who described Zuzanna as a 'beautiful child' who used to play on the sidewalk outside his house. He described Bzdek as a 'hardworking' father-of-three who built their home, and said he 'couldn't imagine' why he would have attacked his own daughter. According to the Huffington Post, officials in Woodridge have not yet determined a motive but say there's no further danger to the community. Two people have died and another 20 have been injured since Friday night in a weekend of violence in Chicago. Micheal Flournoy, 16, died after being shot in the head on Saturday. Police found his body at 7.53pm on the 1000 block of East 93rd Street. At 1.10pm on Saturday 24-year-old Jordan Harris was also killed after being shot in the throat at a house party in the 4300 block of West Wilcox Street, police said. According to officers people were standing on the second-floor balcony when someone began shooting at them from an alley. When they started to run inside another shooter opened fire from the entrance to the house. Mr Harris was taken to hospital along with five others but later died. The spate of weekend shootings represents a sharp escalation in violence for Chicago, which saw 50 per cent fewer killings in January 2014 compared to January 2013. While some have suggested this was because of bad weather and sub-zero temperatures, police have sought to play down the link saying that weather neither causes nor prevents crime.","Robert Bzdek, 34, stabbed daughter at his home before hanging himself .

The . report comes only days after news that LR Credit, based in New York, . obtained a judgment against Belfort for $27,597 from unpaid retail . purchases Belfort made during the height of his hedonistic lifestyle in . the 1990s, reports TMZ. Belfort . temporarily avoided paying that judgement by fleeing to glitzy . Manhattan Beach, where he reportedly rents another glamorous mansion. The collection agency has since filed new legal documents to make their NY judgment enforceable in California. The . former stockbroker was ordered to pay $110.4 million in restitution to . his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003, but so far, he has paid . just $11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property. The . staggering sum was agreed to as part of his punishment for running the . Long Island-based 'boiler room' brokerage Stratton Oakmont alongside . co-defendant Danny Porush. The . pair and others made their millions by 'pumping and dumping' shares . after high-pressure sales calls to investors led them to . unwittingly buy the stocks - causing their price to rise - allowing . Belfort and co to dump them at a large profit. They raked in a known $200million from the fraud, which they spent on . cocaine, prostitutes and a yacht once owned by Coco Chanel. The FBI caught up with them in 1996, and Belfort eventually spent 22 months in prison. Porush was sentenced to 39 months. Belfort, who is the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, in which he is played by Leonard Dicaprio, is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s . Belfort has written a pair of . memoirs detailing his past misdeeds, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2008 and . 2009's Catching the Wolf of Wall Street. The . first was named after a nickname given to Belfort after a magazine . article profiling his firm - which even handled the initial public . offering for Steve Madden's shoe company. Madden also did time in jail on securities fraud charges stemming from the Stratton Oakmont investigation. Red Granite Productions paid Belfort $1.045 million for the rights to his best seller story in 2011. But Belfort paid only $21,000 in restitution that year, according to the government. He has claimed many times, including during a contentious interview on 'Piers Morgan Live,' that he has never profited from the book or the movie, and that he has . paid much more towards the restitution than was required. 'I . am not making any royalties off the film or the books, and I am totally . content with that. My income comes from new life, which is far better . than my old one,' Belfort wrote on his Facebook page on December 29. 'For . the record, I am not turning over 50% of the profits of the books and . the movie, which was what the government had wanted me to do. Instead, I . insisted on turning over 100% of the profits of both books and the . movie, which is to say, I am not making a single dime on any of this. This should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be . more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there,' he added. New career: The former stockbroker owes victims $110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution . Prosecutors say Belfort . is living off book royalties, the money from the film rights and fees . from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker. In . addition, say prosecutors, Belfort has skipped the country to . Australia, complicating the government's efforts to track his income. 'We . want to set the record straight,' Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the . U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn told the Wall Street Journal. 'Belfort's making these claims, and they're not factual. He's in Australia and using that loophole to avoid paying.' 'The . government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of . Belfort's profits from his book and the movie Wolf of Wall Street would . yield, in his words, ""countless millions,"" much less the approximately . $100 million that is still owed to the victims,' he said. Belfort's . lawyer denies that charge, saying his client traveled to Australia for . work reasons but lives in Manhattan Beach, California. Dispute: Prosecutors say Belfort and his partner have relocated to Australia to avoid paying back what he owes, but his lawyer says the pair are based in California . Belfort's Facebook page . tells a different story: photographs appear on his page dated from . April 10 2013 through May and June. He then appears to head to London . and Los Angeles before arriving back in Australia in November, where . he's apparently spent most of his time up until now. His most recent posts appear to come from and be centered around Australia. The U.S. government contends that . Belfort must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution, . but Belfort's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with . the court-ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is . now over. Belfort's lawyer, Nicholas De Feis, told the Wall Street Journal that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes. 'He's made payments as . he was required to make payments and as he earned income,' said De Feis. 'He has never run from his obligations.'","Belfort still owes more than $100million in restitution stemming from a plea deal struck for crimes dramatized in the box office smash .

"By . Alice Smellie . My five-year-old daughter, Lara, caused something of a stir at the school gates last week as she waltzed in with a canvas rucksack slung across her shoulders. Because this was no ordinary rucksack. This was Chanel’s highly sought-after canvas graffiti backpack, designed by creative director Karl Lagerfeld for  his Pop Art collection, modelled at  Paris Fashion Week by model of the moment, Cara Delevingne, and, despite the eye-watering price of £2,100, already a sell-out. Except it wasn’t. What sort of a mother do you think I am? I would no more buy my daughter a Chanel bag  than I would buy her a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos. Scroll down for video . 'Homage': Alice (left) and Lara (right) pose with their take on the designer bag . This was, in fact, a fake. But I don’t like the term fake — it conjures up images of nasty backstreet market stalls and ill-gotten gains funding drug cartels. I prefer to think of this as a carefully crafted, handmade homage. Let me explain. When I saw the pictures of this coveted and unattainable item I thought I must be mistaken. Rather than being the elegant leather accessory Chanel is famous for, this resembles the kind of customised and grubby backpack touted around by particularly scruffy school children. But cooler and richer people clearly disagree. Twilight star Kristen Stewart was spotted in Paris in March carrying  a black version of the backpack, complete with her trademark skinny jeans and sneakers. In a magnificent truism, Lagerfeld  said of the collection that spawned the bag: ‘Life is not a red carpet. This is for daily life.’ But of course, because we all drag  £2,100 backpacks round Sainsbury’s, don’t we? Frankly, this bag looked like it had been made by a five-year-old. Which, of course, made me wonder: Could a five-year-old make it? I decided to find out. Lara was up for the challenge, so I scoured the internet to find a basic bag that we could customise. I finally found a plain beige canvas rucksack on Amazon.co.uk, costing just £7 — which would buy me approximately one third of a Chanel lipgloss (£22). Lara (left), aged 5, poses with the homage to the designer bag (right) she made with her mother Alice . For the all-important Chanel logo, Helen McLaughlin, editor of new magazine Love Sewing, advises I use freezer paper. This is sold by craft shops, and is ordinary paper on one side and has a thin plastic coating on the other. This means that when you iron the plain side, it sticks to fabric. Using a cereal bowl and a mug as a template for the concentric circles that make up the interlinking ‘C’s, Lara draws the design on to the freezer paper, carefully cuts it out and I then iron the two ‘C’s on to the bag. We are amazed at how authentic it looks. I wonder where this might lead — Lara and I could do pencil cases and wash bags for the next school fete and make our fortune. I’m just taking the top off the red paint, a leftover from one of the children’s art projects, when we’re interrupted by a very cross voice. It’s my husband, Justin. ‘Don’t use spray paint in the kitchen,’ he thunders. ‘Go outside. On the grass.’ I bet Coco Chanel never got yelled at mid-creation. Out in the garden, we gently spray the paints on in layers  of brown, then red, then green and finally the beige, and then use some of the children’s  stencils to write the words, ‘31 Rue Cambon’. Lara (left) was in charge of plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that Alice (right) bought from a craft shop . The bag only cost £7 to make but Alice (left) admits: 'If we were less of an artsy-crafty . family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had . to spend about £50 on materials.' Pictured: Lara (right) Now, we have to make the — frankly messy looking — rope of tangled cord and carabiners, those weird hooks used by mountaineers, and, fortuitously, my husband for securing his bike to the car. Why on earth they are on a fashion backpack is beyond me. I task Lara with plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that I bought from a craft shop, and then, to make the final, smaller Chanel ‘C’s in silver and white, we draw around a pepperpot and then outline the edges of the ‘C’s with a silver pen. We are shamelessly pleased with the final result and  prance around like delighted show ponies. My husband, who has been sniggering as he watches us painstakingly plait, spray and glue, is genuinely impressed. (OK, his exact words were: ‘It’s really good, I thought it was going to be rubbish.’) I have a host of arty friends whom I text with a picture of the bag. They are similarly wowed — one claims not to be able to tell the difference at all. I’m pretty sure that everyone (myself included) assumed  that this project was going to be a disaster. If we were less of an artsy-crafty family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had to spend about £50 on materials. Still, that’s about one fortieth of the retail price of the real thing. Now all we need is for some sap to offer more than £2,100  for our version, and we really  will be laughing all the way to the bank. But not as much as Chanel, who have created a bag so simple that even a five-year-old can make a convincing copy.","Alice Smellie and daughter Lara re-created the Chanel bag .

Two New York City police officers were overcome by smoke while responding to a suspicious fire in a residential building in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn Sunday and were in critical condition, according to police on Sunday. 'Police officers Rosa Rodriguez and Dennis Guerra took the building's elevator up to the 13th floor where they were overcome by smoke in the hallway as they exited,' Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said. Bratton said firefighters found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor. Scroll Down for Video . Emergency: Rosa Rodriguez, 36, was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, Dennis Guerra, 38, was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx . The firefighters pulled both officers back into the elevator and brought them downstairs where they were treated by EMS personnel, he said. Rodriguez, 36, was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center. Suspicious fire: Firefighters located both officers unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the hall of the 13th floor . Location of the fire: Both officers remain in critical condition in the ICU . Between them the two officers have eight children. Both officers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of smoke inhalation and remain in critical condition, Bratton said. Fire officials said the blaze in the 18-story building on Surf Avenue broke out just after noon on the 13th floor and was brought under control within an hour. 'The cause of the fire has been deemed suspicious and is under active investigation at this time,' Bratton said. Fire Department spokesman Jim Long said three firefighters and two civilians were also treated for minor injuries. Mayoral response:  Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the officers. 'It's incredibly difficult work that these men and women do,' he said . Louise Harrington, 70, who has lived at the building for 36 years, said cops were going door-to-door looking for information about the fire. 'I heard it was a mattress set on fire. That's what the cops told me,' she said to The New York Daily News. 'I just think itâ€™s evil,' Harrington added.

"By . Associated Press . Bernie Fuller has fished for decades, yet he's never witnessed anything to match the sight of dozens of zombie bass eerily rising out of a north Alabama lake. Americans like Fuller spend about $48 billion annually fishing for fun, and they like knowing what's in the water with their bait. To provide answers to that question and more, biologists are conducting a study where they use 'electrofishing' to stun fish in Tennessee Valley Authority lakes. Momentarily incapacitated by a weak electrical charge that's fed into the water from a boat equipped with a humming generator, fish large and small floated motionless to the surface during an electrofishing trip last week. They were scooped up with a net and placed into an aerated holding tank. Eyes wide and mouths agape, stunned fish were measured, weighed and checked for illnesses and parasites. Within a few minutes the animals snapped out of a zombie-like state, and workers put them back in the water to swim away. Protection groups including People for . the Ethical Treatment of Animals contend fish feel pain, but . electrofishing has become a standard tool for biologists. Scroll down for video . The 'swimming dead'! 'Zombie bass,' like the one seen here, are briefly stunned by a small electrical current, float to the surface and are measured by biologists before they swim away . John Justice, a fisheries biologist with TVA, said fish rarely suffer any lasting effects from electrofishing. 'Generally speaking they recover within a few seconds to a couple of minutes,' he said. Justice said a . slight shock is much easier on fish and other wildlife than the . previous practice of dousing a sealed-off cove with a chemical compound . called rotenone, which killed fish so they could be scooped out and . counted. Fuller was among nine area anglers who went along on a TVA research trip last week on Wheeler Lake near Rogersville, and he grinned as one big fish after another floated to the top in a reservoir where he thought there were far fewer and much smaller bass based on his fishing experience. 'I've learned there's a lot of fish in here,' Fuller said after a day on the water. Another fisherman, Roger Morris, laughed as a big bass popped to the surface. 'They're pulling some 3- to 4-pounders regularly and all day we may catch three or four that size,' said Morris, of nearby Courtland. Is it dead? TVA workers Andrew Hopper, left, and John Justice, right, are seeing weighing a 'zombie bass' caught with electrofishing. The technique is used to assess the health of both fish and reservoirs . Justice said data collected during successive years of electrofishing provides biologists with valuable information about how to best manage the lakes, which are some of the most biologically diverse in North America. The statistics show whether adjustments need to be made to things including water flow, catch limits, stocking programs and water levels, he said. 'By looking at the overall health and condition of the fish we collect we can tell a lot about what's going on with the fishery,' said Justice. Electrofishing is simple enough. A boat is equipped with a pair of fiberglass arms that support a metal pole that hangs off the bow over the water. Three metal cables hang from the pole into the water, and an insulated wire connects the cables to an electrical generator in the rear of the boat. On the hunt? Tennessee Valley Authority workers are seen electrofishing and looking for 'zombie bass' to float to the surface . With the current flowing and cables in the lake, an operator steps on a foot pedal to electrify the water with a 6-amp charge that extends outward and downward as much as 8 feet. Fish within the field are stunned and float to the surface, along with the occasional turtle or snake. Once in a tank on board the boat, stunned fish appear lifeless as they float atop the water. Most recover within moments, and some are actively flipping and jumping by the time they are measured. Of about 200 bass and crappie collected during three hours of electrofishing at Wheeler Lake, every fish went back into the water alive once researchers were done. 'They look real healthy,' Morris said. Fishing doesn't always mean catching, but Fuller said seeing how many fish gather around fallen trees and rocks taught him a lesson about where to concentrate while on the water. 'I think it will help me be a better fisherman,' he said. 'A much more patient fisherman, anyway, for sure.'","Tennessee Valley Authority employs 'electrofishing,' which electrifies water with a small charge .

"By . Sam Webb . A newly-opened apartment building on the outskirts of Zurich has stringent rules banning smoking, perfume and mobile phones in a bid to provide a haven for those hypersensitive to everyday chemicals. The structure has been purpose-built for people who say exposure to everyday products such as perfume, hand lotion or wireless devices make them so sick they cannot function. 'I have been suffering since I was a child. This will really move my life in another direction,' said Christian Schifferle, the 59-year-old head of the Healthy Life and Living Foundation, the organisation behind the project. Sterile: A new apartment building in Zurich does not allow smoking, mobile phones or perfume to cater to those hypersensitive to everyday chemicals . Refuge: The project aims to make daily lives more comfortable for people whose conditions have often left them isolated and unable to hold jobs . Schifferle and the other residents suffer from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), a chronic condition not broadly recognised by the medical community. Those afflicted, however, believe it is sparked by low-level exposure to chemicals in things such as cigarette smoke, pesticides, scented products and paint fumes. Twelve of the 15 apartments in the earth-coloured building in a remote part of Leimbach, on the outskirts of Switzerland's largest city, have already been rented since it opened in December. Many occupants also suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, in which electrical circuits and radiation from wireless equipment make them equally ill. 'It makes me weak, anxious, I can't breath, my lungs hurt, and I get dizzy,' says Schifferle, who suffers from both conditions. Verboten: A sign shows residents and visitors what is not permitted in the apartments . A chair displays the cleaning and personal hygiene products residents are allowed to use . While living in the building will not cure Schifferle or others, it aims to make daily lives more comfortable for people whose conditions have often left them isolated and unable to hold jobs. Schifferle, who first felt sick from the fumes in his parents' furniture factory when he was three or four, has lived most of his adult life in a trailer in the pristine Swiss Alps. It was not until he was 35 and stumbled across an American book on MCS that he realised he was not alone, but it was another decade before he found a doctor who took him seriously. 'All my life it has been like I was only half alive,' he said. The new building is the first of its kind in Europe, according to officials in Zurich who decided to play a pioneering role in helping people with what they called 'a very harmful problem'. They estimate about 5,000 people in Switzerland alone suffer from MCS. Anyone entering the building is expected to switch off their mobile phones. Perfume is also banned as it can trigger reactions for MCS sufferers. File pictures . The city made available the land and provided interest-free loans to help finance the £4.1m project. 'We wanted to help these people to have a calm home where they hopefully will be less sick,' said Zurich housing office spokeswoman Lydia Trueb. With a mask covering his nose and mouth, Schifferle proudly shows off the 0.0 reading on a handheld electricity-measuring instrument with a triangular, green antenna. 'This room is very good, because we have almost no electricity,' he said, nodding around a large common area equipped with a big carbon filter to purify the air. The Zurich building was constructed with special materials, by purpose-trained builders banned from smoking or using scented products like cologne as they worked . Anyone entering the building is expected to switch off their mobile phones, which in any case do not function inside, but there are landlines for telephone and Internet communication in the building. Near the entrance, the only cleaning and personal hygiene products residents are allowed to use in the building are on prominent display. 'Avoiding the environmental burdens is really the only thing that helps most of these patients,' said John van Limburg Stirum, an internist specialised in environmental medicine who has treated Schifferle and other MCS patients at the Seegarten Klinik near Zurich. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is an unusually severe sensitivity or allergy-like reaction to many different kinds of pollutants including solvents, VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds), perfumes, petrol, diesel, smoke, 'chemicals' in general and often encompasses problems with regard to pollen, house dust mites, and pet fur. Multiple chemical sensitivity - unlike true allergies where the underlying mechanisms of the problem are relatively well understood and widely accepted- is generally regarded as 'idiopathic' - meaning that it has no known mechanism of causation and its processes are not fully understood. Source: www.multiplechemicalsensitivity.org . 'They have to find shelter somewhere where there are no antennas, no radiation from cell phones, which is getting more and more difficult,' said Stirum. The condition is difficult to pin down, and sufferers are often dismissed as hypochondriacs. But a growing body of research suggests an initial chemical exposure can spark an 'allergic reaction' in some people when they later confront even very low levels of a range of chemicals. 'These patients are really suffering,' said Stirum, who is urging medical recognition of the condition. The Zurich building was constructed with special materials, by purpose-trained builders banned from smoking or using scented products like cologne as they worked. It has a ventilation system aimed at sucking out all odours. 'I think a good example for the whole thing is the plaster on the wall,' said architect Andreas Zimmermann, who designed it. 'It doesn't smell, and that is very important for these people,' he added, saying he searched for months for a completely odourless plaster. The floor plan is layered like an onion 'so that the deeper you enter the apartment, the cleaner the rooms get,' he said. The building's most 'contaminated' parts are the common areas, main hallway, stairwell and the lifts. From there, residents enter their apartments, moving through a hallway where they can remove 'polluted' clothing, the bathroom and kitchen or other technically equipped rooms, before getting to the 'cleanest' rooms: the living room and bedroom. A special 'net' has also been built into the facade and roof to protect inhabitants from electromagnetic or electrostatic waves or fields, Zimmermann said. Despite all the efforts, Schifferle still only spends a few days a week in his new apartment. More ventilation is needed, he said, until all traces and scents of the builders are gone.","Zurich apartment caters to sufferers of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Scientists have developed a new battery-powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin to shock failing hearts back to life. S-CID, or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter-defibrillator, is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all. The device can then deliver 80 joules to . the chest wall, 'much like you see on a television shows where a doctor . will say, ""Stat,"" and shock a patient with paddles,' said Dr. Manoj Panday, director of cardiac electrophysiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center. State of the art: S-CID, or the subcutaneous internal cardioverter-defibrillator, is a new battery-powered defibrillator that can be implanted under the skin and shocks failing hearts back to life . 'Having a defibrillator that's there as . an insurance plan, so to speak, is important because it helps to protect . them whenever it may occur but at the same time allows them to live a . normal life and not have to think about the defibrillator,' Panday said. 'It's there doing its job silently all the time.' One of the first patients to test the new technology was Ruben Rivera, who has a weak heart muscle and heart valve problems. But the 62-year-old San Antonio resident has no regrets since becoming the first patient here to undergo the procedure late last month. High-tech: The device is implanted in the chest and analyses the heart's rhythm via a sensor without having to pierce any area of the organ at all . Doctor and patient: University of Texas Medicine San Antonio cardiologist Dr. Manoj Panday (right) meets with patient Leonardo Perez . 'I feel good,' said Rivera, acknowledging that while his heart is still weak, 'I have peace of mind, which makes it feel that much better.' 'I know that if I go into cardiac arrest, this apparatus will take care of my needs,' he told the San Antonio Express-News. Rivera is one of hundreds of thousands of patients in the United States that have cardiomyopathy, or a weak heart, which puts them at a higher risk of dangerous abnormal heart rhythms, said Dr. Panday. Tense moment: The tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in the chest. Panday and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through Perez's still unconscious body, jolting his heart back into life . Cardiomyopathy can be caused by . coronary artery disease, a prior heart attack, a viral infection or an . adverse reaction to certain medications, Panday said. Hundreds of . thousands more people in the United States may be at risk of . life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, he said. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, a prior heart attack, a viral infection or an adverse reaction to certain medications . It can also run in families and can affect one or many members of a family. There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart. They are: . Cardiomyopathy can also affect the heart's electrical system. There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy. Source: British Heart Foundation . Panday . implanted the new device, created by Boston Scientific, in Rivera last . month at the Audie Murphy VA Hospital. The company selected the initial . physicians for the procedure based on their experience and ability to . offer this type of care to patients, he said. It . is not the first implantable defibrillator on the market, but doctors . say is a huge step forward in the field because traditional ones . required puncturing a blood vessel and screwing an electrode or lead . into the heart to conduct the charge. The . new device, however, was designed to avoid some of the resulting risks, . which include puncturing the lung or the heart or introducing bacteria . that could cling to the defibrillator and cause a serious infection. Rivera was a good candidate for the new device because a previous surgery had caused a bacterial infection that entered his bloodstream, Panday said. At University Hospital on Monday, Panday implanted another such device in Leonardo Perez, 50, of San Antonio. Perez said he had triple bypass surgery last year and felt lucky to benefit from the new technology. 'Let's get going,' he said, eager to get the hour-long procedure underway. 'I'm ready.' Once . Perez was sedated, Panday cut a pocket a few inches below his left . armpit to insert the generator, which is about the size of a deck of . cards. Using two small . incisions, Panday ran the lead — a thin, insulated wire — across from . the pocket to the center of the chest and then up the chest. The . battery lasts about five years before the generator needs to be . replaced in an outpatient procedure. The battery runs down faster than . the traditional defibrillator because it requires a greater charge — . it's not as close to the heart. The . tensest moment of the procedure came after the device was inserted in . the chest. Panday and his team tested it by inducing a cardiac arrest . and then watching as the device sent a shock trembling through Perez's . still unconscious body, jolting his heart back into a normal heart . rhythm — ready to save his life should he need it again.","S-CID can be implanted into the chest and attached to heart via electrode .

Landing: Mr Gainza, a test pilot for NZ Aerosports and Icarus canopies and professional stuntman with more than 7,000 skydives under his belt, required months of training before taking on the challenge . The extreme reduction in size however meant the parachute was at risk of going into a dangerous spin, which can cause an almost instant loss of consciousness. Mr Gainza, a test pilot for NZ Aerosports and Icarus canopies and professional stuntman with more than 7,000 skydives under his belt, therefore required months of training to ensure he would be able to deal with any situation during the jump. Mr Gainza said: 'Project  XCF  is  the  product  of  a man's  dream  to  fly and  land  the  world's  smallest parachute. 'Regardless of the size of the challenge, a dream will always be a dream if there is no determination to make it reality.' The jump was performed under highly experimental conditions and using specially designed prototype equipment. The previous unofficial record for the smallest parachute landed was held by Luigi Cani who jumped a 37 square foot canopy in 2008.

In the emotional interviews with NBC News, Mr Utash's brother-in-law Max Mohr broke down in tears as he revealed medics were unable to say if the 54-year-old would survive. 'I pray to God he had better make it,' he said. 'They're saying that they don't know for sure yet'. Mr Utash's daughter Felicia added: 'It's hard just to see him lying in bed not knowing who we are, where he is, what's going on.' Two Detroit boys aged 16 and 17 were arrested on Saturday over the beating, with Detroit police spokesman Sgt Mike Woody saying investigators believed they had a direct role in the attack on the city's east side.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . It looks like a beautifully choreographed scene, as a wide-eyed sea lion drifts through a tunnel of silvery fish. But in fact the gorgeous natural spectacle is a frantic life-or-death struggle, as the thousands of schooling fish thrash and dart through the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Desperate to escape the hungry sea lion, they instinctively form swirling herd formations in a bid to escape. The fish - black salema, a type of bottom feeder - form elegant patterns beneath the waves. Their survival techniques can adapt instantly as predators stalk around the mass of fish, creating new shapes such as the  tunnel. Underwater photographer David Fleetham captured the rare moment in the waters around the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. He said: 'Thankfully I was at the right place at the right time. The school was enormous and moved as if a single creature. 'Galapagos sharks and sea lions had worked the school up into the shallows were they were trapped against the island. In the shallows, the school spread out to be almost the size of a football field.' Scramble: The sea lion glides through a mass of black salema fish, which dart out of its way to form a tunnel .

'The surgeons came into the room and said they would be surprised if he made it through the night,' Mrs Shaw said. Landon did make it through the operation however, and his condition improved enough that on April 1 she was able to bring her baby home. But the child still has a long road ahead, with chemotherapy sessions, MRIs and CT scans. Mrs Shaw said that although she and her husband Brandon are on Medicaid  - the U.S. government program that provides health care coverage for lower-income Americans - it isn't nearly enough to cover the medical bills that are now starting to arrive. The plunge group's Facebook page had more than 23,000 members by this morning - 14 times the number of people who live in the small farming community of Tarkio, two hours north of Kansas City. Lydia Hurst, who helps maintain the group's page, said participants include a soldier in Afghanistan, and people in Germany, South Korea, Spain and Ireland.

The post went viral, retweeted more than 6,000 times, and even prompted a call to the police. 'He (the caller) actually thought we were doing that,' Wilde told Philly.com. Creating dialogue: Sixth-generation funeral director Caleb Wilde uses occasionally-inappropriate social media posts to 'shed light on an industry that for the most part is cast in shadows' Wilde's commentary as won him an avid following and national acclaim for shining light on a dark subject in a away that is both hilarious and heartfelt. His blog, Confessions of a Funeral Director, gets 600,000 to 1 million hits a week, and he has more than 17,000 followers on Twitter. Wilde refuses to take money for discussing death and offering his opinion, despite appearing on 20/20 and NBC News, as well as in TIME magazine and the Huffington Post. 'Funeral directors are too often seen as opportunists who are looking to take advantage of people in their weakest moments,' Wilde wrote on his site. 'I am not one of those funeral directors . . . this website exists (so that) people can share freely and honestly without fear of ulterior motives or profiteering. 'I want to start a conversation about death. 'A main part of our humanity is our mortality. 'Death makes us realize how precious and fleeting life is and how much each day is a gift.' Wilde grew up playing hide and seek in the casket room of his family's funeral home in Parkesburg, the only mortuary in this rural town of about 3,600. By 16, he was mowing its lawn, parking cars during services and accompanying relatives on calls to pick up bodies. Death has always been at the core of the family, with the first Wilde's making their first caskets in 1850. Wilde's grandfather Thaddeus, who was born in the funeral home, was embalming bodies by age 12. 'It's who I am': Caleb White grew up playing hide and seek in the caskets of the family funeral home, and eventually got into the business himself . Wilde's mother and father were each from families that ran competing funeral homes. But Wilde didn't want to follow his ancestors into the family business and became a minister. 'The act of rebellion for a funeral director is to seek something that's surrounded by life,' he said. However he eventually returned to the mortician business and said his commitment grew with each drive to pick up a body and each conversation he had a grieivng family. He realized the need and importance of funeral directors in the grand scheme of things, especially in a rural setting. 'It's who I am,' he said. Wilde says he uses the humor his posts online and writing on his blog as therapy for the grimness of his work, and openly discusses taking antidepressants. He says that the format of Twitter is perfect because too much talk of death is too heavy for people to take. 'We want to take death in pieces, small pieces, anything bigger is too big to handle,' he said. Besides zombie jokes and photos of pimped-out hearses, Wilde also aims to 'shed light on an industry that for the most part is cast in shadows'. That means essays on topics like funeral director 'burnout and compassion fatigue', funeral etiquette (including a post defending funeral 'selfies'), consumer rights (like Do Funeral Homes Charge Too Much for their Services?) and a 'You Want to Be a Mortician? 21 Tips' post.","Caleb White is a sixth-generation undertaker who operates his own funeral home in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania .

"By . Katie Nicholl . The Duchess of Cambridge will use the Royal tour of New Zealand and Australia to champion the cause closest to her heart – the children’s hospice movement. The Duchess is its most high-profile ambassador and she plans to use the tour, which starts tomorrow, to highlight the importance of palliative care for sick children. It’s a movement that’s hardly recognised in Australia, where there are just two children’s hospices. Sources close to Kate say her visits to Rainbow Place in Hamilton, New Zealand, and Bear Cottage in Manly, a suburb of Sydney, mark a decisive new step in her philanthropic work, as well as a touching acknowledgement of the mother-in-law she never met. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge with youngsters in Grimbsy last year during an official visit to the town . Diana charms children in Korea in 1992, cutting a strikingly similar figure to that of Kate . William’s mother, whose unofficial title became Diana, Queen of Hearts, dedicated much of her life to caring for sick children, a legacy that Kate has now resolved to continue. Since her marriage to Prince William, Kate has become the public face of a growing campaign to highlight the work of hospices, and wants to use her fame to raise the international profile of care for dying children and to make hospices happier places. The 18-day visit, which begins in Wellington, New Zealand, is the Cambridge family’s first official overseas trip together and Kate and William’s first major journey with eight-month-old Prince George. Kate with 6-year-old Diamond Marshall in Calgary in 2011, as she toured Canada with Prince William . Diana with Alexandria Zoriana, 11, at a hospital in Chicago in 1996. Both woman made children their mission . There will be many echoes from the past when the Cambridges’ plane touches down in New Zealand at 11.45am (almost midnight in Britain). This is the country that played host to Charles and Diana when a nine-month old Prince William accompanied them on his first official tour in 1983. In a breach of Royal protocol, sanctioned by the Queen, the Cambridges are travelling together. Heirs to the throne normally fly separately for safety reasons. There is already huge excitement in both countries, particularly at the prospect of Prince George’s arrival. But all eyes will be on Kate, just as they were glued to Diana during her six-week visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1983, a trip that transformed the young Princess of Wales, who had just turned 22, into an international celebrity. Not that the Duchess is looking for the limelight. Rather, she wants to make it clear she has a serious charitable role as well as that of a wife and mother to the heirs to the throne. According to a Royal aide, out of the 51 engagements in the next three weeks, it is the visits to two children’s hospices that are especially close to the Duchess’s heart. Kate meeting wheelchair-bound Riley Oldford, 6, at Yellowknife airport during 2011's Canadian tour . Diana meets a youngster in a wheelchair, also in Canada, in 1991 . The Duchess intends to share her experiences of hospices in Britain with the centres she is visiting. She may also choose to use one of the visits to give her second overseas speech about the importance of the hospice campaign. Kate is already patron of the East Anglia Children’s Hospices (EACH), based in Cambridge, which now works closely with Rainbow Place and Bear Cottage. Campsite near Ayers Rock where they are to stay . ★The Duke and Duchess – minus George – are expected to spend a night of their Australian tour under canvas, ‘glamping’ in a luxury tent at a resort at the edge of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in the shadow of  Ayers Rock. ★25-year-old Kate Kauri, a media-savvy reporter, will document the New Zealand tour on her iPhone and stream it live to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr  and YouTube. ★Kate has had a spray tan to ensure she looks bonzer next to the surfers. Each of her 32 outfits  has been tried on and photographed. The hems will contain tiny lead weights to prevent Marilyn Monroe-style ‘wardrobe malfunctions’. ★The 11-strong entourage includes Sir David Manning (one of the Queen’s most trusted advisers), George’s nanny, two private secretaries, four press officers, two PAs, an orderly – and Kate’s hairdresser. ★Prince George will make his first appearance on Wednesday on the lawns of Wellington’s Government House, the spot where a nine-month-old William crawled for the cameras on a visit with Charles and Diana in 1983. ★George will be taken to Sydney’s Taronga Zoo on Easter Sunday to meet Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats and other locals. ★The Cambridges  will chillax on April 23 at a trendy Adelaide recording studio. The Duke and Duchess will also get a display of skateboarding from the local yoof. Totally rad. The Duchess will conduct the first hospice visit by herself on Saturday at Rainbow Place. She will meet children, parents and staff, and watch a play therapy session. On Good Friday, April 18, the Duchess will accompany William to Bear Cottage, which is set on the beach at Manly in Sydney. Here Kate will meet six-year-old Kaiya Miller, who suffers from cystic fibrosis. Kaiya will present the Duchess with a bunch of flowers. Kaiya said: ‘I’m most excited about meeting her. I think she’ll be nice and fun.’ One of the senior nurses, Narelle Martin, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Duchess’s visit to Bear Cottage is extremely exciting for the palliative care movement within Australia and the world. Little is known of children’s hospices in Australia and how they function. ‘The Duchess’s visit will showcase to Australia and the world that children’s hospices are happy places, filled with love, care and positive memories.’ The Duchess gave her first public speech at a hospice in 2012 when she opened The Treehouse in Ipswich, which is run by EACH. It was there that she met eight-year-old Tilly Jennings, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, who suffers from Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare heart condition in which only half the organ functions properly. It was day none of the Jennings will ever forget. ‘Kate did everything she could to make Tilly feel at ease,’ said Tilly’s mother, Jeanette. ‘She’s so natural with all the kids. Tilly calls her Princess Kate and that’s definitely how she seemed.’ According to Jeanette, the Duchess’s support was invaluable both on a personal and practical level. She said: ‘Tilly can get very down, but when she met Kate she was on a high for weeks. She still talks about it now. ‘As for the hospice, the Duchess’s support has lifted our profile and in turn that has led to so many more opportunities with all sorts of different people offering help. I can’t tell you what a difference it makes.’ And according to Graham Butland, chief executive of EACH, the Duchess’s support has boosted the campaign internationally. He said that EACH is now working closely with a number of hospices around the world. ‘There can be little doubt that the Duchess is raising the awareness of the need for children’s palliative care services across the world,’ he said. ‘It has received a huge boost, nationally and internationally, since she started to champion it.’ In 2012 Kate launched the first palliative care programme in Malaysia at the Hospis Malaysia. Since the Royal visit, the country plans to open more hospices in different states and the Duchess is being closely consulted about the developments. It is a sign of the movement’s importance to her that last year the Duchess gave her first and only televised address in a video message to support Children’s Hospice Week. Her interest dates back more than a decade, well before she married Prince William. Her parents’ business, Party Pieces, worked closely with the children’s charity Starlight and Kate found herself helping to organise parties and party bags for sick children. While she was still plain Kate Middleton she made private visits to Naomi House, a hospice in Hampshire. A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duchess is going to Bear Cottage and Rainbow Place to learn about the work of palliative care teams in Australia and New Zealand. She is there to learn and discuss and to share experiences.’","The Duchess of Cambridge will visit two children's hospices during the tour .

"By . Sam Webb . New images taken from space show an island that formed last year after a volcanic eruption in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean is swallowing up a neighbouring island. The land mass, named Niijima, was first spotted in November 2013, in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo, as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time. Overwhelmed: Niijima, was formed as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. It has now merged with its smaller pre-existing neighbour Nishino-shima . My, how you've grown: In this NASA satellite image from December 8, Niijima can be clearly seen next to the larger Nishino Shima . But the mass, located in the Pacific's volatile 'Ring of Fire', has grown rapidly to merge with its smaller pre-existing neighbour Nishino-shima, as these satellite images from the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 show. The new landmass measures about 3,000ft across and has soared to a height of 200ft above sea level, reports the Huffington Post. 'The intermittent, pulsing shape of the cloud stream might be a reflection of the volcanic eruption itself,' officials from NASA's Earth Observatory said. Growing presence: This picture was taken on December 6, just over two weeks after the island formed . Smoke billows from the new islet off the coast of Nishino Shima, a small, uninhabited island in the Ogasawara chain off the coats of Tokyo. At that point, it was around 600ft in diameter . The formation of the new island was the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years . 'Strombolian explosions are essentially bubbles of lava and gas rising from Earth's interior in pulses. 'Underwater, sediment appears to be stirred up in a green plume that stretches eastward from the island.' In September a similar new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan. It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide. The phenomenon on the coastline near the port of Gwadar caused astonishment when it emerged from the Arabian Sea, but experts from Pakistan's National Institute of Oceanography say it is now fast eroding. Although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions, they are rarely as powerful as the one that formed Niijima. The chain is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands. The islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor. Volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as 1,000C when it emerged. Similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in Japan's territory that have since disappeared. Experts initially said the islet, pictured, may not last long due to erosion, but it is still growing .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Claims: The Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system . The Malaysian opposition leader has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information. Politician Anwar Ibrahim said that when he was the Malaysian finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar, and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course. The 66-year-old also suggested it was possible that the Malaysian authorities had colluded in the fate of flight MH370, and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft. He said that the integrity of the entire country was in jeopardy, and added that the families of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on board the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were correct to seek more information from the Malaysian government. The aircraft was carrying 239 passengers and crew on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished on March 8. Mr Anwar, who has admitted he was related to the plane's pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah via an in-law, said the Marconi radar system, which covers the Malaysian mainland, including its east and west coastlines from its base in the South China Sea, was approved by him in 1994. He said the radar would have instantly noticed when the plane turned west away from its planned route, and said he could not understand why radar operators were unable to check on the plane's journey. Mr Anwar also questioned why the . Malaysian air force had not gone after the plane, and said had concerns . over the way the hunt for the plane had been carried out in the days . after it vanished. 'I . believe the government knows more than us. They have the authority to . instruct the air force … or Malaysia Airlines,' he told The Daily Telegraph. A Royal New Zealand Air Force crew member looks out for debris from the Malaysia Airlines plane . Mission: Search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, around 1,100 miles north of Perth, Australia . Location: Mr Anwar said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there . 'They are privy to most of . these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this . mysterious disappearance of MH370.' He said he was unable to comment on a suggestion that the Malaysian authorities knew what had happened to the plane, or whether a terrorist act had been responsible for its disappearance. But he said that the government should . not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South . China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there. Fading hopes: No trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it vanished, and hopes of locating the plane's data recorders before the batteries fail are slim . Search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, around 1,100 miles north of Perth,. Australia. No . trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it . vanished, and although there is no timeframe for ending the search, . hopes of locating the plane's data recorders before the batteries fail . are slim. Finding the . data recorders, often called the black box, would provide a wealth of information . about the condition the plane was flying under and the communications or . sounds in the cockpit. Official: Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the director general of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Department is seen giving a press conference after briefing Chinese relatives on the progress of the investigation . Desperation: Mr Anwar said families of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on board the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were correct to seek more information from the Malaysian government . False hope: One government source said authorities could not provide families with information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the investigation . The . data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by special equipment in . the immediate vicinity. But the battery-powered devices stop . transmitting the pings about 30 days after a crash. Locating the data . recorders and wreckage after that is possible, but becomes an even more . daunting task. Mr Anwar described the Malaysian government's efforts as 'at the least, incompetence, but claimed there was an 'intention to suppress key information'. Opposition: Mr Anwar was once Malaysia's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties . However, critics of Mr Anwar had said he is trying to exploit the tragedy for his own political purposes. One . government source said authorities could not provide families with . information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the . investigation as well as giving them false hope. Malaysian authorities have not commented on Mr Anwar’s accusations, but previously the country's sports minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he had spoken of pilot Captain Shah's support for his party so he could 'play the victim'. Denial: Some reports suggested Captain Shah (pictured) may have hijacked the plane, although both his family and Mr Anwah have rejected the claims . Mr Anwar was once Malaysia's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties. In the country's election last year they won more than 50 per cent of the popular vote, but lost the election - prompting allegations of corruption. The day before the jetliner went . missing, Anwar was sentenced to five years in jail for a second sodomy . offense, preventing him from running in a by-election later this month. His prosecution on a . charge of sodomy is seen by many Malaysians as political persecution. Campaigners . say the politician, the key challenger to Malaysia’s ruling party, was . the victim of a long-running smear campaign and had faced trumped-up . charges. Captain Shah, a supporter of the pro-democracy coalition, was thought to be . incensed by the verdict. Some reports suggested Captain Shah may have hijacked the plane, although both his family and Mr Anwah have rejected the claims. Mr Anwah said that had the pilot been involved in the aircraft's disappearance, he would have been unable to hide radar readings. He said: 'To condemn a person because he is a supporter of democracy is totally unjustified. Having said that, there’s nothing stopping the police or the authorities from conducting an open and fair investigation into anybody – including the radar operators, the defence minister – why are they concealing this information?'","Anwar Ibrahim said radar would have seen missing .

"By . Mark Duell . Two love rivals who moved in together when the woman they loved died fell out so badly that one tried to kill the other, a court heard today. Mark Motteram, 45, and Steve Cook, 37, put any romantic rivalry behind them so they could raise Anne Motteram’s children together. Mrs Motteram had three children with ex-husband Mr Motteram and one with her new partner Mr Cook. But she suffered a fatal heart attack at her home in Southampton aged 40. Family: Pictured in 2011, Mark Motteram (left), 45, and Steve Cook (right), 37, put any romantic rivalry behind them so they could raise Anne Motteram's children together . Mr Motteram and Mr Cook then vowed to raise the children together as an ‘unconventional family’. But Winchester Crown Court was told that the animosity between them became too great. They eventually went their separate ways and became embroiled in a ‘bitter custody battle’ over Mr Cook and Mrs Motteram’s youngest daughter, four-year-old Catherine. Mr Cook moved to Derby, where he won custody of his daughter on the condition she took four short holidays a year in Southampton. He dropped her off for her first visit and went straight to Southampton Central Police Station where he told officers he had ‘concerns for the children’s welfare’. Disgruntled Mr Cook - annoyed that Mr Motteram had access rights - claimed there was a stash of drugs in the house and no food, the court heard. It led to police raiding the property, where they found healthy food, a full freezer, and no sign of drugs. The false allegation angered Mr Motteram, who armed himself with a 4in kitchen knife when Mr Cook arrived to collect his daughter at the end of the week. Tom Wright, prosecuting, said Mr Motteram lunged at Mr Cook as he opened the door, stabbing him once in the chest, on November 26 last year. Fathers: Mrs Motteram had three children with ex-husband Mr Motteram (left) and one with her new partner Mr Cook (right). But she suffered a fatal heart attack at her home in Southampton aged 40 . The court heard there was no animosity between the pair at the time Mr Cook started a relationship with Mrs Motteram, but things deteriorated after her death on February 26, 2011. 'The circumstances surrounding this case are tragic. Mr Motteram is remorseful and wishes it was himself he harmed' Keely Harvey, defending . Mr Wright said: ‘After Mrs Motteram’s sad demise, the children and two men did try making a go of things as a family. Unhappily, the two men did not get on well - friction and animosity led to that situation breaking up. ‘The break-up was acrimonious and was exacerbated by the custody battle that then went through the court.’ Mr . Wright told the court Mr Cook contacted police to report his welfare . concerns, and added: ‘Whatever Mr Cook’s motivation, the effect was to . further sour Mr Motteram’s attitude towards him. Relations: Luke Motteram, 18, son of Mark . ‘When he went to collect Catherine at the end of her stay, he rang the doorbell and Mr Motteram immediately lunged at him with a kitchen knife. The knife struck Mr Cook just below the ribs, above the abdomen. ‘Perhaps because Mr Cook was on his guard - and expected Mr Motteram to be angry - he was able to grapple with Mr Motteram and get the knife off him as they fell to the ground.’ Mr Cook was taken to hospital by ambulance where he was treated for the non-life-threatening wound. Mr Wright said: ‘When police arrived, Mr Motteram was calm, co-operative and compliant. He readily accepted he had stabbed Mr Cook and confided to the officer that it had been his intention to kill Mr Cook. ‘In interview he explained his animosity had been building, and over the previous weeks he had nurtured a strong desire to do him harm and to kill Mr Cook.’ Keely Harvey, defending, accepted Mr Motteram had told officers he intended to kill Mr Cook - but insisted he never meant it. She said: ‘This is an offence born more out of love for a child than hate for Mr Cook. The circumstances surrounding this case are tragic. ‘Mr Motteram is remorseful and wishes it was himself he harmed. Catherine spent a happy week with the family and was well cared for. She did not want to go back home.’ Mr Motteram shook his bowed head repeatedly as he sat in the dock, weeping loudly. Sobs could also be heard from the public gallery, where Mrs Motteram’s older children from a previous relationship sat with those she had with Mr Motteram - Luke, 18, and Toni, 15. Mr Motteram admitted wounding with intent and was jailed for four years. An alternative count of attempted murder, which Mr Motteram denied, was dropped. The judge, His Honour Mr Justice Teare, said: ‘There are mitigating factors but that does not excuse what you did.’ Mr Cook and Mrs Motteram had two other children together but both tragically died - one was stillborn and the other was delivered after Mrs Motteram’s death but died a week later. 'After Mrs Motteram’s sad demise, the children and two men did try making a go of things as a family. Unhappily, the two men did not get on well - friction and animosity led to that situation breaking up' Tom Wright, prosecuting . Speaking after the case, Flower of Justice church pastor Bob Light, who is now raising Mr and Mrs Motteram’s son Ben, ten, said: ‘The family are devastated. ‘This has been an incredibly tough time for them and is not going to get any easier. They have lost their mother and have now been deprived of their father. ‘It is a tragic case but they are doing their best to help each other through these tough times and will stick together.’ Speaking shortly after Mrs Motteram’s death, Mr Motteram said of his unusual relationship with Mr Cook: ‘People do think it is strange but we have always got on. Now it is more important than ever. ‘It is a weird situation but the most important thing here is the kids and what is best for them.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mark Motteram and Steve Cook tried to raise Anne Motteram’s children .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Former soldier Jeremy Green, 26, was sentenced to life in prison today after admitting murder and attempted murder . A former Army officer who killed an estate agent after imprisoning her and her flatmate for hours while he tortured them has been jailed for life. Jeremy Green, 26, held 32-year-old Nicole Waterhouse and 23-year-old Karen Browne hostage while he tortured them, stabbing them and slashing their throats. Miss Waterhouse died as a result of the attack at the York flat, while Miss Browne, who worked with Miss Waterhouse at Hunters Estate Agents, suffered devastating injuries. Miss Waterhouse's family sobbed in court today as they told how Green had 'destroyed all of our lives'. Green, a graduate of Sandhurst Military Academy who had served with the Yorkshire Regiment in Afghanistan, was sentenced to ilfe in jail today after admitting murder and attempted murder. Leeds Crown Court heard that Green had dated Miss Browne briefly, but the relationship had ended before he turned up at the flat the two women shared in York one Sunday morning last autumn. Green arrived at around 10am on 20 October and went into Miss Browne's bedroom where he attacked her.  Despite Miss Browne shouting to her flatmate: 'Get out or get help', Miss Waterhouse went to her friend's assistance. The court heard that Green did not leave the flat for nearly nine hours, during which time he attacked and tortured both women, drinking beer as they suffered in separate bedrooms. Before he left he took money and mobile phones from the women, and left Miss Waterhouse with 65 injuries and Miss Browne with 19. He had tried to suffocate Miss Browne three times, strangled her with a belt, cut her throat three times with a piece of glass and left her with two deflated lungs and a serious injury to her spinal cord. As a result of the injury to her spine she was unable to move, and was forced to listen as her friend screamed through the walls as Green attacked her. Miss Waterhouse, known as Nicki to her . friends, had been smothered, stabbed and had her throat slashed more . than once. She was found naked. Nicole Waterhouse, 32, left, was murdered while her flatmate Karen Browne, 23, right, suffered serious injuries . Scene: The women were attacked at the flat they shared in York on 20 October last year . Survivor: Miss Browne suffered devastating injuries in the attack that killed her flatmate and colleague last autumn. In the picture on the right the scars from the attack where the killer slashed her throat are painfully visible . Forensics teams enter the flat at Phoenix Boulevard in York shortly after the attack last autumn . The court heard the former soldier, who gave no reason for the attacks, used a pillow to press on Miss Browne's stomach to speed up the blood flow and hasten her death. During his time in the flat, unemployed Green, who had money problems, contacted both victims' families using their mobile phones, making it appear that they were on dates or running out of battery.  He also contacted other women via his phone - women who later said he seemed 'perfectly normal'. After killing Miss Waterhouse and thinking he had killed Miss Browne, Green took their phones, bank cards and jewellery and left the flat. Although no weapon was found, Green later told police he had used a lock knife he had got while serving in Afghanistan. Prosecutor, Peter Moulson QC said Green told police 'He was a former soldier, and following the attack on Lee Rigby he felt he had to arm himself at all times'. Green gave no explanation for the attack, and psychiatrists who examined him could find nothing wrong . He said Green had gone to the flat thinking both women would be out and intending to burgle it, but after conning his way into the building decided to rob them when he found them in their bedrooms. The court heard that Green, who was courtmartialled and dismissed from the Army last April for stealing, was short of money.  He withdrew cash using both victimsâ€™ cash cards when he left the flat, before going to a supermarket and buying food. But Mr Moulson said psychiatrists had examined him and found nothing that could explain his actions. Green, of York, who sat in the glass-fronted dock dressed in a suit, looked down as the women's relatives addressed him. Miss Waterhouse's sister, Danielle, stared straight at him and said: 'I will always have three sisters and no-one will take them away from me - not even him. Jailed for life: The former soldier, of York, was dismissed from the Army after stealing from colleagues . 'He's destroyed all our lives and he's taken a part of our family we can never replace.  My heart aches knowing she died alone with no-one around her.' Miss Waterhouse's estate agent father, John, stopped repeatedly to wipe tears from his eyes as he read out his statement facing Green, saying: 'She was totally conned by this man's evilness.' Sentencing Green to life in prison with a minimum of 33 years and 198 days, the Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier, QC, said:  'Your final savagery to each of them is almost beyond belief.' 'Throughout the day you engaged in the most appalling and prolonged series of attacks on these young women. Miss Waterhouse's father, estate agent, John, and his daughters Danielle and Chloe, outside court today . 'They . were completely at your mercy. Apart from being physically stronger . then them, you were armed throughout with a knife and you also armed . yourself with other weapons - a belt, a bottle. 'It . is impossible to imagine the torment to which they were both subjected . and the terror they experienced over those long hours.' Judge Collier also sentenced Green to 24 years in prison for the attempted murder of Miss Browne, to run concurrently with his life sentence. Speaking outside court, Miss Waterhouse's father said: 'Our love for each other will help us to continue without her. We will always love Nicki and we will never forget her.'","Jeremy Green, 26, attacked Nicole Waterhouse, 32, and Karen Browne, 23 .

"By . Mark Duell . Stalker: Kevin Rainbow, 28, of Deptford, south-east London, was called a 'desperate man' by a judge . A predatory stalker who relentlessly harassed his ex-girlfriend and hid under her bed was today jailed for 18 months. Kevin Rainbow, 28, of Deptford, south-east London, was called a ‘desperate man’ by a judge for the crimes, which saw him try to contact the woman - despite being banned from doing so. Rainbow stalked the 31-year-old woman, with whom he has two young children, at her office and her parents’ home, where he broke in and hid under her bed after being spotted outside. Sentencing him at Lewes Crown Court, Judge Shani Barnes said: ‘You are a predator who is both relentless and manipulative in your actions. You have made the life of your ex-partner a misery and have terrorised your in-laws.’ Rainbow had lived with his former partner in the capital for five years but became increasingly controlling and abusive towards her, culminating in him hitting her on January 4 this year. He was charged with harassment, common assault and criminal damage - but granted bail providing he did not contact her. However, he still got in touch with her and tried to find out her workplace. The police were called and, while they tried to track Rainbow down, she went to Sussex to stay with her parents. On January 27 she was outside the house when she saw Rainbow in her parked car. Sentencing: Rainbow was jailed by Judge Shani Barnes at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex for 18 months . She ran towards the house but he chased and caught her, only for her father to come outside and pull her away from Rainbow and get her indoors. Rainbow then continued to lurk outside. Police were called again but by the time they arrived he could not be found. As officers were taking statements from the family they heard a noise upstairs and found Rainbow under the woman’s bed. He was arrested and charged using a law introduced in November 2012 that makes stalking a specific offence, following an amendment to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Detective Constable Stuart Macpherson of Sussex Police said: ‘This was a frightening series of events, in which Rainbow clearly showed very manipulative and abusive behaviour towards a woman who initially trusted him but eventually became terrified of him. ‘What he would have done if we had not found him under that bed can only be guessed at.’ Home road: Rainbow, who lived on this street in Deptford, south-east London, admitted stalking, harassment, criminal damage and common assault . He added: ‘It sends another signal that we take all such reports seriously. You don't have to put up with this kind of behaviour. We will take every step we can to safeguard victims and achieve justice for them.’ 'What he would have done if we had not found him under that bed can only be guessed at' Detective Constable Stuart Macpherson, Sussex Police . Rainbow admitted stalking, harassment, criminal damage and common assault. Judge Barnes said: ‘I consider you to be a dangerous individual and suggest that you present a high risk of further harm, both physical and emotional, to your ex-partner.  You clearly would not accept the end of the relationship. Your actions are those of a desperate man.’ As well as the jail sentence, the judge also imposed a restraining order for an indefinite period on Rainbow, banning him from contacting his ex-partner or her family other than through solicitors on any access issues relating to their two children.","Kevin Rainbow of Deptford, London, labelled 'desperate man' by judge .

"By . Martin Robinson . On trial: Max Clifford was defended by a string of stars at Southwark Crown Court, where he denies 11 counts of indecent assault . PR guru Max Clifford is a 'good, decent man', actress Pauline Quirke told his sex trial today. The Birds Of A Feather star gave evidence at Southwark Crown . Court, where the 70-year-old is accused of 11 counts of indecent . assault on seven girls and women. 'The word I've always associated with Max, since I've known him, is the word integrity,' Ms Quirke said. Scroll down for video . The actress told the jury she had known Clifford for 20 years, having met him through their charity. They went on the celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and raised £32,000 for the Rhys Daniels Trust. She said: 'We are good friends, we've been out for dinner, Max has been to my house for dinner, I've been to his house, he was at my wedding, I was at his wedding.' Asked by Richard Horwell QC, defending, how well she had got to know Clifford, she said: 'We didn't have any holidays together, or that sort of thing, but I would say he's a good, decent man, yeah. 'I've been in his company on a number of occasions and found him very down to earth, a normal, decent man.' Asked if she had ever seen him behave inappropriately with a woman, or heard of him behaving inappropriately with a woman, she said: 'I've certainly never seen him behave inappropriately with a woman, and I've never heard any rumours over the years.' Sky TV presenter Clare Tomlinson said she worked for Clifford for six months from January 1991 as his personal assistant. 'I wanted to work in football, and we parted on very amicable terms,' she said. Asked to describe him, she said: 'He wasn't a strict boss, he had an old school charm, he would open a door for you, he worried about you getting home if you had been to a function.' Asked if the office had been 'sexually charged', as has been alleged during the case, she said: 'Certainly not during my six months, or any time after if I visited the hairdresser downstairs, and went for a cup of tea - it wasn't like that.' Friend: Pauiline Quirk with friend Linda Robson last week. Ms Quirk told the jury that Max Clifford is an old friend with 'integrity' and is a 'normal, decent man' Support: Sky Sports reporter Clare Tomlinson worked for Clifford as a PA and said 'He wasn't the sort who would pat people on the bum' She said Clifford was 'avuncular with ladies', adding: 'He wasn't the sort who would pat people on the bum.' Ms Tomlinson told the court: 'In my career subsequently I have experienced sexual bullying and harassment, and I wouldn't be here giving evidence if I believed that Max was capable of that sort of thing.' Carmen Almeida, who worked from 1987 as manager of a beauty salon at a hairdresser's below Clifford's office in New Bond Street, said: 'It was a normal atmosphere, I had no reason for concern whatsoever. There was no gossip or anything that would have concerned me.' The case was adjourned until 10am tomorrow when the defence will close its case.

"By . James Chapman . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith will use a major speech today to outline his latest reforms of the welfare system . The unemployed will no longer be able simply to ‘sign on’ for benefits and welfare cheats are to face higher fines and losing their homes, ministers will say this week. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith used a major speech today to outline his latest reforms of the welfare system, announcing that from later this month jobseekers will have to prepare a CV and agree to weekly meetings with an adviser before being given benefits. Mr Duncan Smith also suggested that the ‘open door immigration’ policy run by the last Government had meant foreign workers taking jobs and helping to trap British people in ‘dependency, hopelessness and despair’. Later this week, employment minister Esther McVey will flesh out the Government’s efforts to restrict benefits for jobless foreigners. Welfare minister Mike Penning will also set out plans to make welfare cheats sell their homes if necessary to pay higher fines to reimburse taxpayers for the money they have wrongly claimed. Ministers aim to reduce the proportion of benefits lost to fraud and error from 2.2 per cent in 2010 to 1.7 per cent by next March. Mr Duncan Smith points to the strength of the UK labour market - with record numbers of people in work, accompanied by dramatic falls in worklessness - as evidence that his reforms are having an impact. Welfare reform has been a crucial part of Britain’s recovery, helping to create ‘a stable economy matched by a strong society where people are ready and capable of work’,’ he said. Under Labour, he argues, ‘a combination of the welfare system trapping people in dependency and removing the drive to go to work... and the open door immigration policy meant British people were so easily replaced by foreign workers coming in’. ‘Taxpayers paid a financial cost for rising welfare payments, and society paid the cost as well – with too many of our own fellow citizens falling into dependency, hopelessness, and despair,’ Mr Duncan Smith added. That situation is now being turned around, with UK nationals making up nearly 90 per cent of the rise in employment in the last year, he insisted. The unemployed will no longer be able simply to ¿sign on¿ for benefits and welfare cheats are to face higher fines and losing their homes, ministers will say this week . ‘Labour’s Great Recession slashed 7.2% off our economy and cost 750,000 people their jobs,’ he added. ‘Following the crash we heard gloomy forecasts of a million jobs disappearing from the private sector, mass unemployment, lost generations - yet they could not have proved more wrong. ‘Britain’s economic recovery is established and taking hold faster than forecast – and nowhere are the signs of this recovery clearer than in our labour market.’ The tightening of the welfare system, as well as the Government’s pro-business measures, have helped give businesses the freedom and confidence to create 1.7 million new jobs since the election. Mr Duncan Smith, speaking to the Business for Britain campaign group, pointed to record employment – more than half a million higher than its pre-recession peak – and the falling numbers of people absent from the labour market, falling long-term unemployment, and falling number of workless households. He warned that the job is far from done, however, detailing new measures to take effect this month.Jobseekers will be required to take steps to make themselves attractive to employers before they claim Jobseeker’s Allowance. Changes include a requirement to prepare a CV, set up an email address and registering for the Government’s new jobs website before making a claim. There will also have be regular meetings with job centre advisers – weekly rather than fortnightly – for those claimants judged to need more regular monitoring.","Iain Duncan Smith will use a major speech to outline latest reforms .

"By . Martin Robinson . Britain's youngest undertaker could be the next star of the X Factor. Rachael Ryan, 18, has sailed through her audition for Simon Cowell's ITV show and won the panel over when she admitted to having to stop herself singing pop songs to corpses while at work. The mortician, from Newport, South Wales, first started working part time at her father's undertakers at 13. Going places: Teenage undertaker Rachael Ryan, Britain's youngest, has won through the first round of the X Factor . In the family: Rachael helps run the business with father Mike and sister Louise and revealed to the X Factor panel she has to stop herself singing to corpses at work . At 16 she was made director of the firm, which is now called Michael G Ryan Son and Daughters Funeral Directors. 'I think they were just a bit surprised when I told them I'm an undertaker,' she said. 'I love my job - I've grown up in the family business and started helping when I was only 13. 'But my real ambition in life is to be a singer - I've been singing since I was just five years old.

"By . Mark Duell . Legal battle: Nathan Roberts, 30, of Middleton, Greater Manchester, claims that the North West Ambulance Service's policy forced him to resign . A 999 operator with an anxiety disorder is suing his bosses because he was ordered to hot desk. Nathan Roberts, 30, of Middleton, Greater Manchester, claims that the North West Ambulance Service's policy forced him to resign. The father-of-two - who said he would suffer panic attacks after finding colleagues in his preferred seat - has seen his case thrown out by London judges, but could now take it to Europe. He had asked bosses for a desk close to a window and near the back wall of the busy office in Belle Vue, to prevent his disorder flaring up. Ambulance chiefs put a ‘reserved’ sign on Mr Roberts's preferred seat - but they said overlapping shifts made it impractical to guarantee he could always sit in the same place. Mr Roberts quit and sued the NWAS, alleging constructive dismissal and a breach of the Disability Discrimination Act. His case was  rejected by a tribunal and an appeal tribunal before going before London’s Appeal Court - where it has now also been dismissed. But Mr Roberts said he had not yet given up on his four-year battle and was considering taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights. He added: ‘It’s the end of the road domestically and the only alternative is Europe. It’s something I’m considering and I will speak to my solicitors about it. ‘I don’t think the Disability . Discrimination Act, and its replacement the Equality Act, provide enough . protection for people with mental health disabilities. Request: Mr Roberts had asked bosses for a desk close to a window and near the back wall of the office in Belle Vue to prevent his disorder flaring up - and chiefs put a 'reserved' sign on his preferred seat . ‘I don’t think people with mental health disabilities are treated the same as those with physical disabilities, and that’s the point I would make to the European court.’ Mr Roberts started working for NWAS in 2008, handling incoming 999 and non-emergency calls. He said that his panic attacks could be triggered by a number of things, including the amount of people in the vicinity. He resigned on New Year’s Eve in 2009 when, following the introduction of hot-desking, he arrived for work to find his seat taken for a third time. Legal fight: Mr Roberts said he had not yet given up on his four-year battle and was considering taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights (pictured) Lord Justice Moore-Bick, sitting in the Appeal Court, said his supervisors had agreed to place a reserved sign on his chosen seat to ensure it was available for him when he started his shift. 'I don't think people with mental health disabilities are treated the same as those with physical disabilities' Nathan Roberts . But he added that, in the high-tempo working environment, it was not always possible for his seat to be available if he arrived for work early. The court heard there were isolated incidents when colleagues would be at his desk. But Lord Justice Moore-Bick said NWAS had done its best to ensure that Mr Roberts had a desk of his own. MailOnline also covered his case in February 2012, reporting that a win for Mr Roberts could see him receive a pay-out of up to £500,000 - paid for by the taxpayer.","Father-of-two Nathan Roberts claimed bosses' policy made him resign .

"By . Mark Duell . The family of an 82-year-old man in hospital for routine surgery found a ‘do not resuscitate’ order in his notes - written without their permission, it was claimed today. John Flatt was waiting for an operation at York Hospital to change a kidney stent under general anaesthetic when a nurse checked with his wife Anne whether the DNR order still stood. But Mrs Flatt, 70, claimed she had never even been consulted about the order. She has now made a formal complaint to the hospital and asked for a full investigation. Shock: John Flatt (left) was waiting for an operation at York Hospital to change a kidney stent under general anaesthetic when a nurse checked with his wife Anne (right) whether the DNR order still stood . Guidelines from the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both state that, in all cases, DNR orders should only be issued after discussion with patients or their family. She said: ‘The whole thing is very bizarre and could have had terrible consequences. I’m disgusted with what’s happened. John is not going out of my sight. ‘He has his age against him and a heart condition - and if anything had happened they would just look at the form and leave him. ‘What happened is shrouded in mystery. It’s not a situation that should just be put on the back burner because of the potential consequences for other people.’ A staff nurse alerted the family to the instructions, signed by a doctor when he was in hospital in November last year. DNR order: Mrs Flatt has made a formal complaint to York Hospital (pictured) and asked for a full investigation . The form indicates the matter was agreed with his ‘daughters’, but Mr Flatt’s stepdaughter Susan Rogan said no such discussion had taken place. A man with Down’s syndrome took legal action against an NHS hospital after a ‘do not resuscitate’ order was allegedly put on his file without his family’s knowledge. MailOnline reported in September 2012 how a note on the 51-year-old’s medical record said he should not be revived if he had a heart attack or stopped breathing, apparently on the basis of his disability. His family said they were not told about the DNR order, despite visiting him almost daily during his three-week stay at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent. His horrified relatives only learned about the instruction when one of the man’s carers found it folded up in his bag after he was discharged. Lawyers for the man, identified only as AWA, said the choice to withhold life-saving treatment on the basis of his learning difficulties was ‘nothing short of blatant prejudice’. East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust has not yet commented on the case’s progression, and has been contacted today. Mrs Flatt said: ‘My daughter went into shock. She is not aware of it. John is her stepdad and she is heartbroken. ‘She said “What would have happened if anything had happened to him? Would you ever have forgiven me?”’ The nurse brought the surgeon into the ward to officially rescind the order before the surgery. But now they want answers to the alleged lack of . proper communication which could have cost the life of Mr Flatt, who has prostate . cancer and is in the early stages of dementia. Dr Alistair Turnbull, spokesman for York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, said: ‘We were concerned to hear Mrs Flatt’s account. ‘Mrs Flatt has been in contact with us and we are continuing to work with her to provide answers to the issues she has raised regarding her husband’s time in hospital. ‘The hospital has very clear guidance around good practice when making decisions about resuscitation. 'So fundamental is this that we audit regularly our clinical teams’ performance in this area. 'The guidance includes discussion with patients and their families. 'The form used in the Trust and across the region is partly a record of that discussion and reflects both the appropriateness of attempted resuscitation and the wishes of our patient and their loved ones.’","John Flatt, 82, was waiting for an operation to change a kidney stent .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A council crippled by cuts has paid out nearly £1million in health and safety claims to teachers, pupils and school visitors in just five years. One teacher was given £113,905 after they were hurt breaking up a playground brawl, while a school caretaker got £40,000 after trapping his thumb in a window, and a dinner lady was paid £1,500 for injuries caused by a 'defective saucepan lid'. Birmingham City Council, which is to axe 1,000 jobs to help it save £822million by 2018, refused to answer questions about the circumstances in which the employee who was given the six-figure sum of public money was injured during the playground fight. But the Labour-run council was criticised today for spending an 'extraordinary sum' on claims described as 'frivolous by any stretch of the imagination'. Birmingham City Council, which must save £822million, spent nearly £1m on school health and safety payouts . Other examples of the council's payouts include £1,750 to a cleaner who was hurt by 'a defective mop', £34,539 to a worker who tripped in a store cupboard, and £5,513 to a child who fell over in a sandpit. Meanwhile a student who was hit in the face by a ball received £18,316, a pupil who suffered a chemical burn to their hand in a science lesson received £17,250, and another who suffered 'debility contracted during a camping trip' was paid £19,288. The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, show that council employees received £546,753 in compensation, while compensation and costs claims by pupils and visitors amounted to £364,775 between 2009-2014. Today campaigners said the claims, which totalled £911,538, were an example of Britain's 'out of control' compensation culture. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'An extraordinary sum of taxpayers' money has been paid out in playground compensation claims, some of which appear frivolous by any stretch of the imagination. 'Legal fees on top of this will only add to the bill landing on residents' doorsteps. 'This is further evidence of a compensation culture out of control that councils and ministers must do a better job of counteracting.' There to learn: But vast sums have been paid out for accidents at schools in Birmingham (file picture) One deputy headteacher, who works at a state school in Birmingham but did not wish to be named, added: 'Schools feel like they are treading on eggshells with children and staff these days. 'We are living in a blame culture, and . thousands of pounds are being spent on settling these sort of claims . rather than being invested in children's education.' 'Thousands of pounds are being spent on settling these sort of claims rather than being invested in children's education' Anonymous Birmingham teacher . A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said that health and safety of pupils and staff was 'a paramount consideration' but admitted there was 'always room for improvements'. 'When accidents do occur, appropriate reviews are undertaken, safety policy is revised as required and lessons learned to ensure we continue to maintain high standards of safety', the spokesman said. Chris Keates, general secretary of teaching union NASUWT, said: 'It is a myth that compensation is easy to obtain; in reality, the hurdles and barriers facing claimants are extremely high.

"By . Richard Spillett . A football fan who never got to see his daughter because he died in the Hillsborough disaster dreamt of being 'the best daddy ever', an inquest jury has heard. In a moving tribute to victim Steven Brown, his widow, Sarah, said words could not describe the void left by his death at the age of 25. Mr Brown, who was brought up by his grandmother in Holt, Clwyd, was one of 96 Liverpool fans who died at or following the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died at or following the Hillsborough disaster at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989 . Addressing jurors on the fifth day of fresh inquests into the tragedy, Mrs Brown said she first dated her future husband on her 16th birthday. Reading out a 'pen portrait' statement giving details of her husband’s hobbies and life, Mrs Brown told the hearing in Warrington, Cheshire: 'I can honestly say that he loved me with a passion that I never knew existed - the dedication and commitment that he showed towards me left me giddy. 'When I found out that I was pregnant and that his dreams were coming true, he was over the moon and full of pride. 'For Steven to have passed away when I was six months pregnant and never got a chance to meet and greet his new little baby, there are no words to describe that void.' Mrs Brown, whose daughter Samantha was born in July 1989, frequently paused to compose herself in the witness box as she went on: 'Not only was I grieving for me but for her too. 'Since that day I have tried my best to shower her with Daddy’s love, which I know would have flown in abundance for Samantha from Steven. 'She has listened to stories of him, and how we met, and how much we were in love, and how desperately he wanted a little girl and to be the best daddy ever.' Hillsborough survivor Stuart Littlewood arriving at the inquest (left), . which today heard from the family of 17-year-old victim Henry Rogers (right) Family members arrive at the inquest last week, with Margaret Aspinall (second right), the Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group . Coroner Lord Justice Goldring has ruled that 'pen portrait' biographies of each of the 96 victims should form the first section of evidence at the inquests. Victim Henry Rogers, who was 17, was described as a 'natural person and a charmer' who was loved by adults, his teachers and his friends. 1) What was the layout of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and structure of Hillsborough in 1989? Did it contribute to the disaster or the deaths? Were there dangers which should have been appreciated? If so, by whom? 2) Were steps taken to control the allocation and level of the crowd in general terms to prevent pens three and four becoming overcrowded? Could anything more have been done to prevent pens three and four becoming over crowded? If so, by whom? Was the system of fans finding their own level a satisfactory one? 3) What was done to manage the approach of fans to the turnstiles at Leppings Lane? Did a crush outside the entrance develop? If so could anything or anything more have been done to avoid or minimise that risk? If so, by whom? 4) When the exit gates were opened to relieve any crush at the turnstiles, should anything or anything more have been done to avoid the risk of a dangerous situation developing in pens three or four? If so, what? 5) What was the emergency response of the police and the ambulance service and the other services? Could any more have been done? If so, what? 6) What was the conduct of the fans or some of them, excluding those who died, and did that play any part in the disaster? His mother Veronica - whose other . son, Adam, died of diabetes in October 1989 after surviving the . Hillsborough disaster - said Henry was an 'entrepreneur-in-the-making' and had applied to study at the London School of Economics. During . a second day of family tributes, the jury of seven women and four men . also heard a statement from John Collins, whose 22-year-old son Gary . died at Hillsborough. In his tribute, read out by Gary’s brother Ian, Mr Collins said the death of the food factory quality controller, from Bootle, Merseyside, had robbed his son of a chance of becoming a father himself. The family’s statement concluded by saying: 'Gary’s memory is with us each and every day of our lives and it breaks our hearts even to write this statement. 'To think that the Hillsborough disaster could have been prevented is excruciating to live with. The fact we will never see Gary reach his full potential is the cruellest thing life has ever dealt us.' Jurors were given a short break between each family statement, including successive readings by the sister of two brothers from Birkenhead who died aged 16 and 26. Theresa Arrowsmith said Martin Traynor, known to his family as Kevin, and his older brother Christopher Traynor, both worked as joiners. The inquests heard that the brothers - one of four sets of siblings who lost their lives at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium - had discussed potential safety fears concerning Hillsborough following an FA Cup semi-final at the ground in 1988. Their sister told jurors that Kevin, who attended the match in 1988, had remarked 'Oh no, not that stadium again' when he heard the 1989 match was also being staged at Hillsborough. Ms Arrowsmith told the coroner: 'Christopher tried to reassure his younger brother by saying ""Don't worry I will be there with you"". None of them came home.' Nine pen portraits of those who died were read out at the purpose-built courtroom today. Liverpool fans lift others from the crush in the Leppings Lane End of Hillsborough . At the start of new inquests into the deaths, jurors were read 'pen portraits' of victims by their families . Liverpool-born hospital nurse Eric Hankin, who worked in Maghull, Merseyside, was remembered by his daughter Lynsey as a 'big friendly giant' who had done his best to make his family happy. Miss Hankin, who was 12 when her father died aged 33 in the crush on the Leppings Lane terracing, said: 'A big giant-shaped hole has been left in my heart since the day he died. I've learnt how to live with it but I don't think the pain will ever leave me.' Francis McAllister's brother Mark told the hearing the 27-year-old had 'found his niche' working for the fire service at Manchester Square station in central London. After relating how Francis was saved from drowning in a boating lake during a family holiday in Wales, Mr McAllister said: 'Our father died nine years after Hillsborough, always regretting that he had not been on hand to save his son one more time.' Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar leaves the pitch as fans desperately try to escape the crush on the terraces behind his goal . Supporters used hoardings as makeshift stretchers as they battled to save the lives of fellow fans . The final personal statements read to the jury were tributes to Nicholas Joynes, 27, from St Helens, Merseyside, and Hillsborough's second oldest victim, 62-year-old John Anderson. Lift company engineer Mr Joynes, known as Nick, was a talented footballer who had a trial with Liverpool FC, but did not quite make the grade. His brother Paul said: 'His death has left a massive void in our family and we miss him deeply. All our family feel such a tremendous loss.' Mr Anderson's son Brian said: 'My dad worked really hard all his life to ensure we lacked for nothing. 'We wouldn't have been considered rich in financial terms, but we were very rich as we had a loving home with a dad that placed us first, before everything else.' The inquests were adjourned until tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","New inquests hear victims' families read 'pen portraits' of those killed .

"By . Mark Duell . Balance needed: Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said children are being 'institutionalised' too young . Children are being ‘institutionalised’ too young and need a decent balance between time at nursery and school and being at home with their parents, a teachers' leader suggested today. Parents and young children have a right to get to know each other and should have time to do so, according to Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). She warned that the UK is the ‘poor man of Europe’ in terms of long working hours and that more needs to be done to support family life. Dr Bousted's comments came as Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said that in the past, many school nurseries could only offer standard time slots for families, making it difficult for parents trying to combine childcare with work. Action has been taken to allow all schools to cater to younger children and to open for longer hours to give families more flexibility, she added. At its annual conference in Manchester next week, ATL is due to debate a motion raising concerns that calls for youngsters to start school at an earlier age, along with proposals for longer school days and shorter holidays do not put children first. It says that strong families are the ‘bedrock of a strong and stable society’ and that families need a work-life balance that allows them to spend time together. Speaking ahead of the conference, Dr Bousted said: ‘Obviously, children need a work life balance, just like their parents do. Family time: Parents and young children have a right to get to know each other and should have time to do so, Dr Bousted said (file picture) ‘And for children, if you are in a childcare setting, or in a nursery, or in a school, in a sense, for them that's work, because it is time away from home which is where they are most relaxed. ‘I think the motion speaks to the concern that we institutionalise our children too young, and that our children need to know their parents and parents need to know their children.’ Children are coming to school ‘frightened’ after playing violent computer games, a headteacher has warned. In the monthly newsletter to parents of children at Whitstable Junior School in Kent, Gill Moody voiced her concerns over some of the children playing ‘inappropriate computer games’. It is the second time she has written to parents asking them to consider the impact playing games containing 18-rated material could be having on their children. She said: ‘We are becoming increasingly aware that some of our children are playing inappropriate computer games and as a result are coming to school frightened by what they are seeing. ‘Please do consider the impact 18-rated material has on young children who do not understand the content and cannot cope with the feelings or images they are seeing. ‘No apologies for repeating this item in this newsletter from the last newsletter. ‘I appreciate that this is only a very small minority of children, but if your child is playing Grand Theft Auto and you have not checked out what this game includes - please do so.’ In February, the headteacher of Coed-y-Brain Primary School, in Llanbradach, Caerphilly, sent a letter to parents following concerns that children as young as six were re-enacting scenes from Grand Theft Auto (above), which sees players take on the role of criminals in America's dark and seedy underworld. Morian Morgan said young pupils were initiating games involving ‘simulating rape and sexual intercourse’ as well as having playground chats about ‘drug use’. A letter sent to parents said children were ‘acting out scenes from the game which include the strongest of sexual swear words’, ‘having conversations’ about sexual acts and ‘play acting extremely violent games that sometimes result in actual injury’. He stressed that the letter was a way of making parents aware of the trend, rather than criticising them. She added: ‘That's not say that we are against mothers working full time, that's not to say we're against very good childcare facilities for young people, but we do work the longest hours in Europe and there is a massive pressure on family life, both parents really juggling childcare and working life. ‘We are the poor man of Europe when it comes to unpaid overtime and there is a massive pressure to be present in the workplace and there is not a culture in the UK as there is in other European countries, particularly Scandinavian countries, which understand that raising a family is hard work and that if we're going to have a healthy next generation and if we're going to make family life do-able and if we're going to do something about the breakdown in families, the incidence of divorce and family break up then we have to do more to support family life, whether that's both parents working, one parent working or no parents working.’ Dr Bousted said that high quality childcare and nurseries were one part of supporting families. But she added: ‘The effect of that is diminished if your parents are exhausted and your parents are irritable and if you don't see your parents from seven in the morning until seven at night routinely throughout the week. ‘There needs to be a balance between high quality childcare and the opportunity for parents, the right of parents and young children to know each other. I don't think we've got that balance right.’ In a speech to the Policy Exchange think tank in Central London, Miss Truss said that government reforms have made it easier for schools to open new nurseries and operate longer hours to give families more choice. ‘For too long, it's been difficult for schools to open new nursery provision and to provide the flexibility modern families need,’ she said. Miss Truss added: ‘The vast majority of school nurseries offer only a standard nine to 12 or 12 to three slot. Not easy for a parent who works two days a week or works shifts, trying to combine childcare with work and other commitments. ‘So we've made it the case that every school - local authority, academy or free school (independent schools can do this already) can now lower the age range to cater for three and four-year-olds without having to go through a legal process or submit burdensome business cases; and can open a nursery for the whole day from 8am to 6pm. ‘Under this Government, every school in the country has been given the power to open a nursery. ‘That means school nurseries can offer the free 15 hours of care flexibly for parents - for example, offering three five hour slots to suit a part time job.’","Dr Mary Bousted says children are being 'institutionalised' too young .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Peter Hain called for a de-facto amnesty, warning you cannot 'keep going back all the time¿ . Terrorists responsible for bombing and killing innocent people during the Northern Ireland Troubles should not face future prosecution, a former Labour minister has claimed. Peter Hain, Northern Ireland Secretary in Tony Blair’s last Cabinet, called for a de-facto amnesty, warning you cannot 'keep going back all the time’. But David Cameron rejected the idea and Irish president Michael D Higgins said it would be wrong to ‘wipe the slate clean’ over the historic conflict, as he prepared to make a state visit to the UK. There are around 3,000 unsolved murders from three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. Tensions have mounted in recent weeks after it emerged some on-the-run IRA members had been sent ‘comfort letter’s to protect them from prosecution. Mr Hain told The Times: ‘I think there should be an end to all conflict-related prosecutions. ‘That should apply to cases pre-dating the Good Friday agreement in 1998. This is not desirable in a normal situation. 'You would never dream of doing this in England, Scotland and Wales - but the Troubles were never normal. ‘You can keep going back all the time and you can keep looking over your shoulder or turning around all the time, but what that does is take you away from addressing the issues of now and the issues of the future.’ He added: ‘This is not going to go away. It's going to continue stalking the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the entire body politic there. The past just stalks them and they're either going to confront it and deal with it together or they're going to continue to be stalked by it.’ However, the idea has been rejected by . London and Dublin. Mr Higgins said that progress in the Northern . Ireland peace process should not be about forgetting the past. He is making the first ever state visit to the UK by an Irish head of state. The . significance of the trip has been further deepened with the presence of . Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and ex-IRA commander Martin . McGuinness who will attend a banquet hosted by the Queen - a move . unthinkable only a decade ago. Mr . Higgins will spend four days on the extended visit as a guest of the . monarch, a sign he says is symbolic of the importance both countries . place on the normalisation of relations more than 90 years after . independence. Atrocity: The site of the bombing which took place at the Baltic Exchange in 1992. The picture was taken just days after the blast . Irish President Michael Higgins (left)  is on a four-day state visit to London, including a banquet hosted by the Queen which will be attended by Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister and ex-IRA commander Martin McGuinness . Mr Higgins said: ‘The peace process is that, it is a process that comes after the formal agreement at one level. Ultimately it is an exercise in consciousness at the level of community,’ President Higgins said. ‘The challenge is to hand to a future generation all of the prospects of the future. You are not inviting them to an amnesia about any deep dispute. ‘There are a lot of very difficult memories and it would be to my mind wrong to suggest to anyone that you should as it were, wipe the slate clean.’ Downing Street also insisted Mr Cameron would not support the idea. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view has not changed at all. As he did in opposition, as he does in government, he does not support the idea of amnesties.’","Former Labour Cabinet minister urges de-facto amnesty for Troubles .

"By . James Chapman . Opposition: The findings are a setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has made declining living standards of the 'squeezed middle' one of his party¿s main attacks on  the Government . Middle class families weathered the recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today reveals. Households in the social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a think-tank. Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn. The findings are a setback for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has made declining living standards of the ‘squeezed middle’ one of his party’s main attacks on  the Government. Instead, data from the Social Market Foundation paints a picture of the group that has most successfully dealt with the economic fallout since the crash of 2007-8. More women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per cent. An analysis of household income also found that the middle classes became bargain seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 per cent increase in food prices. And there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to cut the cost of a childminder or nursery. Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report. Around one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result of the financial crisis. But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets. Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, said: ‘Families in the middle have adapted to evade the squeeze. The super-consumers among them have beaten the market, managing their costs so that they rise by less than inflation. Adapting: Many families saved money on childcare by asking grandparents to look after their children . ‘Ed Miliband has said that the greatest challenge for our generation is restoring the living standards of the middle class, while many on the Conservative benches have been pushing for middle class tax cuts by the election. ‘In reality the middle has coped surprisingly well since 2007-08. We found that even in the teeth of the recession, two-fifths of them moved up the income distribution. Just as many managed to stay where they were.’ He added: ‘By 2011-12, the middle as a whole had the same earnings in real terms as they did in 2007-08. With the recovery under way, their prospects are likely to improve further.’ The Coalition says its economic measures – including dramatic increases in the personal tax allowance, which reached £10,000 this week – have benefited millions of middle earners. However, interest rate rises could be a cloud on the horizon, the report suggests. It reveals how more than half of the households in middle income brackets own their own homes, meaning that low interest rates remain critical for their ability to sustain their current standard  of living. Some 10 per cent of families in the middle also  fell behind on their rent or mortgage payments. Mr Mian warned: ‘For the rest, the big question is whether the rise in their incomes will outpace the rise in interest rates. That’s how it looks for the moment, not least because the Bank of England is showing a high level of caution in raising rates.’","Some managed to move into higher income bracket despite downturn .

A British adventurer has been shot dead in a bungled burglary during his dream trip to South Africa. Jeremy Brooke, 32, was on holiday with friends in Transkei, a remote part of the country, when armed men burst into their farmhouse and opened fire. Police said Jeremy, who was working as a farmer in the village, was shot in the chest and neck and died in hospital hours later. Five men have been arrested in connection with the murder.

'After leaving school he travelled extensively funding his trips and dreams through stints of working in factories and in farming. 'Jeremy attended Durban Prep School in South Africa before going on agricultural college where his passion for nature was further nurtured. 'Jeremy loved South Africa and it is regretful that such senseless and criminal violence is robbing the country of so many valuable, proud citizens.' Jeremy, a nature warden, studied agriculture on a course for farmers' sons where he learned building, electrical, plumbing and welding skills. His family said he was also a talented mechanic, stripping and rebuilding the engine of his dream car a Nissan 1400. While at home in Bridgend he worked at the town's giant Sony factory and at a recycling plant.

"By . Sharon Churcher . The US Government’s bid to put Abu Hamza behind bars for his alleged links to Al Qaeda has  been thrown into doubt after the British terrorist who is the star prosecution witness refused to fly to America to give evidence against the preacher. Hate cleric Hamza is due to stand trial later this month in a federal court in New York, accused of sending extremists to Afghanistan to fight for Al Qaeda, as well as trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the US state of Oregon. One of the key prosecution witnesses is the convicted British terrorist Saajid Badat, 35, a former lieutenant of Hamza who was sent by him to fight in Afghanistan for Al Qaeda. I won't go: Convicted British terrorist Saajid Badat, left, 35, is one of the key prosecution witnesses in the U.S. trial of cleric Abu Hamza, right, who is accused of sending extremists to fight for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan . Badat, a former grammar school boy from Gloucester, pulled out of a plot to blow up a transatlantic airliner with a shoe bomb in 2001. Although he was jailed for the attempted attack, Badat was released early in return for agreeing to give evidence in trials in Britain and the US. Badat had agreed to give evidence at Hamza’s trial from a secret location in the UK by CCTV. But on Friday, the judge who will preside over Hamza’s trial, Katherine Forrest, asked Badat to fly to the US to give evidence. He refused because he fears he will be arrested over the shoe bomb plot once he arrives in America. If found guilty, 56-year-old Hamza – who uses a metal hook in place of his amputated hands – will spend the rest of his life in a maximum-security US jail.","Terrorist Saajid Badat is a key witness in the prosecution of Abu Hamza .

Rebekah Brooks's 'daft' husband Charlie once downed an entire pint of washing up liquid in a bid to cure a particularly bad hangover, the Old Bailey heard today. The bizarre incident was revealed by Sara Bradstock, a former housemate of Brooks, as she offered a warm tribute on behalf of the 51-year-old to the phone hacking trial. He stands accused of hiding computers, papers and other material from detectives on his wife's behalf when he knew his homes were about to be searched. The former racehorse trainer, who later worked as a novelist, claims he was only hiding his work computers and a stash of pornography from police, not evidence relating to phone hacking or corruption. Ms Bradstock, the daughter of former jockey and BBC broadcaster Lord Oaksey, said the allegation was 'out of character' for Brooks, but admitted he could be 'completely daft'. 'I remember finding him frothing at the mouth and close to death one morning', she said in a statement to the court. 'He had not been bitten by a rabid dog, but had drunk a pint of Fairy Liquid to try to rid himself of the excesses of the night before.' The Old Bailey heard that Brooks and Ms Bradstock had shared a while they worked on the racing circuit. She also told how he had introduced her to her future husband Mark Bradstock, another horse trainer. Brooks was best man at their wedding, and remained friends with the couple, she said . 'While he is kind and good company, one of his greatest assets is [that] what you see is what you get', she said. 'The allegation is out of character - that he is capable of perverting the course of justice.' Sir Mark Prescott, who also works with horses, called Brooks a 'man of great talent, a high achiever' and testified that he was 'generous of spirit, entertaining, non-judgemental and humane'. Accusations: Brooks is accused of hiding materials from detectives to protect his wife, former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks . Another trainer, Tom Lacey, gave a statement describing the impact in the racing world to the allegation against Brooks. 'He is hugely respected in the racing world', he said. 'Each time I have gone, I have found an overwhelming number of people asking me to pass on best wishes to Charlie. He is someone that is not only well respected by also well-liked.' He added that Brooks has lost his fortnightly racing column in the Daily Telegraph because of the trial, and that the strain of the claims against him had begun to show. But Kevin Perry, the racing editor at the newspaper, said he hopes Brooks will rejoin the paper once the case has concluded. 'Pizza plot': Former News International security chief Mark Hanna (pictured) allegedly ordered pizza as cover for moving material hidden from police . Earlier Will Smith, a Pizza Hut worker, gave evidence about an order collected on July 17, 2011, the day Brooks is accused of hiding material with the help of News International head of security Mark Hanna. It is alleged that Hanna, 51, arranged for fellow security guard Daryl Jorsling to deliver a pizza to Brooks at his Chelsea Harbour home, as a cover for dropping off a bag of possessions that had been kept from police earlier in the day. Mr Smith confirmed an order of a large Italian Supreme pizza with a side order of garlic bread had been collected from the Fulham Road Pizza Hut that evening. Charlie Brooks denies a single charge that he . plotted with his 45-year-old wife and News International head of . security Mark Hanna, 50, to pervert the course of justice. Rebekah . Brooks denies the same charge and conspiring to hack phones and commit . misconduct by approving payments to public officials. Hanna also denies . conspiring to pervert the course of justice. All seven defendants in the case deny all the charges against them. The Â£9.99 bill was paid in cash, and Pizza Hut boxes seen on CCTV being delivered to Chelsea Harbour may have come from that branch. Mr Smith gave a detailed description of the order, including that the pizza had taken 606 seconds to cook and had gone in the oven at exactly 8.17pm. As he left the witness box, Mr Justice Saunders joked: 'It will never be the same for me ordering a takeaway pizza.' Jurors have now been sent home until tomorrow morning, when former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, is due to start giving evidence. The judge has said former News of the World Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is still too unwell to return to court, where he is due to be cross-examined further.

"By . Mark Duell . A rare navigator’s watch recovered by a Royal Air Force officer from the underpants of a captured German who had tried to hide it is up for auction. The timepiece is one of four ‘liberated’ by the officer whose job it was to interrogate German prisoners of war, who often tried to conceal valuable items about their person when first caught. One airman stuffed his watch in his underpants, hoping his captors would not look there - but the unnamed British officer performed a thorough search and soon recovered the item. Up for auction: Two of the four watches which were 'liberated' by the officer whose job it was to interrogate German prisoners of war, who often tried to conceal valuable items about their person when first caught . Valuable: Two of the timepieces going under the hammer at auctioneers at Charterhouse in Sherborne, Dorset,  are Hanhart pilot’s chronograph watches, made by the famous Swiss watchmaker Johann A. Hanhart . It went along with three other . Luftwaffe-issue timepieces he acquired during the Second World War. The . four watches are now being sold at an auction on May 8 with a total . pre-sale estimate of £8,000. They . belong to the son of the late serviceman who inherited them. He said: . ‘My father was an RAF intelligence officer and his job was to . interrogate German airmen who had been captured. ‘He spoke German and pressed the men for worthwhile information such as the equipment the Luftwaffe were using. 'One prisoner had his watch wrapped around something that wasn’t his wrist because he was so desperate not to lose it' RAF officer's son . ‘He . had to search them and one prisoner had his watch wrapped around . something that wasn’t his wrist because he was so desperate not to lose . it. ‘My father ended up having it and kept it as a souvenir or as part of the spoils of war. When my father died over 20 years ago we had a clear out of his things and acquired his four watches.’ Two of the timepieces are Hanhart pilot’s chronograph watches, made by the famous Swiss watchmaker Johann A. Hanhart. The other two are made by German watchmaker Glashutte. Historic event: The officer arrived in France 11 days after the D-Day landings in 1944 and interviewed rounded-up German prisoners, which is when it is believed he acquired the four Luftwaffe pilots' watches . Auctioneer Richard Bromell said: ‘The . vendor’s father, from Manchester, was of Dutch origin and spoke fluent . French, German, Dutch, and towards the end of the Second World War . Russian too.’ More than 400,000 German POWs were still being held in Britain one year after the Second World War ended. One fifth of all farm labour in Britain in 1946 was being done by German POWs, who were also working on roads and building sites. A ban on the Germans socialising with local populations near the UK camps was lifted towards the end of the year, and many British people invited them in for a family Christmas. Some 250,000 German POWs had been repatriated by the end of 1947, but 24,000 chose to stay in Britain. One of them, Hans Siegfried Vallentin, married a girl he met in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, and they had five children and 11 grandchildren. Perhaps the most famous POW who settled in England after the war was Bert Trautmann (above), who became a legendary goalkeeper for Manchester City FC. He died last July. ‘As an officer . in the RAF, and as a linguist, he is believed to have worked in MI19, . the division formed from MI9 as the enemy prisoner of war interrogation . department. ‘He . arrived in France 11 days after the D-Day landings and interviewed . rounded up German prisoners, which is when it is believed he “acquired” these four Luftwaffe pilots’ watches.’ The vendor, who is from the Somerset area, said: ‘If you wind them up they do start to tick but they would need to be repaired as they haven’t been properly used for 70 years. These watches have been locked up in a drawer for many years. 'You can’t go on hoarding things forever and I don’t have any romantic association with them, so I think it is best to pass them on.’ Mr Bromell, of auctioneers Charterhouse in Sherborne, Dorset, which is selling the watches, said: ‘They are four high quality wristwatches used by German pilots and navigators in the war. ‘They need some work doing to them to get them going again. However, with all the watches being quite similar the vendor isn’t sure which one was recovered from the PoW’s underpants.’ The owner’s father worked in Lloyds Bank before the war, and after it had ended he joined the family business which supplied animal feeds.","Timepiece is one of four 'liberated' by officer who interrogated POWs .

Cameron Waugh died in hospital after the accident at the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge. He was found by fellow rider Jakub Przygonski, from Poland, who set off the satellite alarm and performed cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Two doctors and a paramedic arrived at the scene by helicopter within 13 minutes, and Mr Waugh was immediately transferred to hospital. He was later pronounced dead, a statement on the event's website said. Cameron Waugh died in hospital after an accident sustained while taking part in the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge. The British expat was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Supermarkets should end ‘buy one get one free’ offers to help cut food waste, a group of peers has said. It also suggested that unsold produce could be sent to food banks. The House of Lords European Union Committee said it was ‘morally repugnant’ that at least 90million tonnes of food were dumped each year in the EU, including 15million in Britain. 'Morally repugnant': The EU Committee of the House of Lords blasted offers that fuel food waste . ‘It is an absolutely shocking waste of resources,’ said Baroness Scott of Needham Market, who chairs the committee. Lady Scott said: 'Food waste in the EU and the UK is clearly a huge issue. 'Not only is it morally repugnant, but it has serious economic and environmental implications. 'The fact that 90 million tonnes of food is wasted across the EU each year shows the extent of the problem and explains why we are calling for urgent action. Supermarkets were advised to find people who need the excess food before sending it to landfills . 'Globally, consumers in industrialised nations waste up to 222 million tonnes of food a year, which is equivalent to nearly the entire level of net food production of Sub-Saharan Africa. 'We cannot allow the complexity of the issues around defining and monitoring food waste to delay action any further. 'We are calling on the new European Commission, which will be appointed in November this year, to publish a five-year strategy for reducing food waste across the EU, and to do so within six months of taking office.' The report found that the carbon footprint of worldwide food waste is equivalent to twice the global greenhouse gas emissions of all road transportation in the US. She added: ‘We are urging supermarkets to look again at offers such as “buy one get one free”, which can encourage excess consumption, which leads to food waste. 'There is also much that can be done domestically, and in particular by the big retailers, to reduce food waste. ‘The UK Government... can consider whether tax incentives might be used to encourage retailers to ensure unsold food that is still fit for human consumption is actually eaten by people, for example by working with food banks, rather than sent to compost or landfill.’ Lady Scott also urged supermarkets to work closely with farmers to ensure they did not cancel food orders unnecessarily.","EU Committee in House of Lords blasted 90million tonnes food waste .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . The Army should let women soldiers take career breaks to raise families and consider allowing them to fight on the front line, the Chief of the General Staff said yesterday. Female soldiers should be allowed to enter front-line combat, Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff said yesterday . General Sir Peter Wall said that terms of service should be flexible to allow ‘individuals to dip in and out of Army careers’. The Army’s most senior officer also opened the prospect that the Army may ease its last restrictions on women taking their place in front-line fighting. Women remain excluded from the infantry and from tank crews. He said he wanted to show women that the army was ‘open’ and an equal opportunities employer. A review of the role of women in combat is due before 2018, and comes at a time when other Western armies are moving to allow women soldiers into all roles. Australia will open all units to women at the beginning of 2016, and the US last year removed its official ban on women in combat roles. On allowing more flexible terms of service Sir Peter said: ‘That would be particularly important for females who want to take a break to have families,’ he said. ‘We’re not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career. If we were better at that we’d have a better Army.’ Sir Peter remained guarded about the possibility of women in hand-to-hand fighting but said in an interview with the Army’s Soldier magazine: ‘We are in a minority of armies now in that respect. ‘It’s definitely something that we need to be considering seriously but we need to go about this with great care, especially with all the other changes going on. ‘This isn’t just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the Army.’ The suggestion of the introduction of career breaks, so that young women who train as soldiers can take a few years off and then return as their children get older, comes at a time when the military are under severe pressure to build up a reserve army. Sir Peter Wall said: 'We're not very good at making it easy for talented women who want to have a family and sustain a service career. If we were better at that we'd have a better Army' Troop numbers are to be cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with the shortfall to be made up by the recruitment of 35,000 reservists. Last week a senior general, Sir Richard Shirreff, described the scheme as ‘a hell of a risk’. A flexible working contract for women soldiers could both boost recruitment by bringing mothers back into the ranks after a few years raising children, and help maintain a trained reserve of women with families. Such a reserve force would, however, risk controversy if mothers with young families were called up in a crisis. The idea comes at a time when mothers of young are routinely expected to work in civilian life and Government policies are bent on providing cheap childcare to encourage them to do so. Sir Peter Wall, pictured here with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, said: 'This isn't just about getting more females into the 30 per cent of roles that are combat trades but getting more of them into the Army' Sir Peter said: ‘Our engagement with British society is important in making sure the service is supported by the public and well manned. He added that the withdrawal of British troops from Germany, due for completion next year, will be conducted in a family-friendly manner. Soldiers, he said, ‘if they are married, rely on more than one income to achieve the lifestyle they want. It’s difficult to do that if you are moving back and forth to Germany on a regular basis. ‘The military covenant will give our families more surety about plugging into local health and education services in British communities and all this adds up to more stability for our personnel.’ The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles . Sir Peter said of the Army strength reductions: ‘Those were, essentially, economic choices made by the Government. We are not doing this because the threats to British interests around the world are diminishing. ‘We’ve got to be absolutely honest about our capability and the Army 2020 structure delivers most of what we can currently do, albeit with slightly less resilience.’ The Army currently has 7,500 women soldiers, who serve with the artillery and engineers in front-line roles. Women fly as fighter pilots as well as taking more traditional female duties as medics and intelligence officers. In the Royal Navy, the first women who will be allowed to serve as submariners are now in training. Sir Peter said: ‘We have always said that we will look at the evidence and base our decision on what impact it will have on operational capability. ‘Women need to see they have equal opportunities right throughout the organisation. Allowing them to be combat troops would make us look more normal to society but there will always be people who say the close battle is no place for female soldiers.’ Opponents of women in combat roles make two central objections. The first is that the physical strength of women is insufficient for hand-to-hand fighting of the kind occasionally demanded of infantry in Iraq and Afghanistan. The second is that in combat male soldiers would be likely to try to protect or help wounded women comrades, distracting them from their main job of trying to kill the enemy. Australia: Roles formerly closed to women, in infantry, special forces . and artillery, will be open to both sexes from 2016. However, as of last . year, only 20 of the 8,000 women in the country’s defence forces had . asked to transfer to combat units. Canada: All duties have been open . to women for 25 years and two per cent of combat troops are female. Women have served on submarines since 2000 and the first woman commander . of a warship was appointed in 2003. New Zealand: Equality in the . military has been law since 2001, when women were admitted to the . infantry, and armour and artillery units. However, a British report on . the results found ‘variable success in attracting and recruiting women . to these areas’. United States: Announced last year that the ban on . women in combat is going. However, no woman has yet been admitted to the . Marine Corps or special forces. Denmark: All service branches open . to women since 1988 following a decision that women are capable of close . fighting. However, physical strength requirements have prevented women . from joining special forces. France: All jobs open to women except . submarines and riot police. However, although 20 per cent of armed . forces personnel are women, only 1.7 per cent of the infantry is female. Israel: . Infantry and combat roles open to women since 1985. Over the last . decade women have been recruited to artillery, anti-aircraft and rescue . jobs. However, while all women must carry out military service, they are . required to join for only two years, against three for men.","Sir Peter Wall said terms of service should allow soldiers to 'dip in and out'

More than 600 refugees are now living in the French town with most living just yards from the port in the camp, which has poor sanitation and where men fight for food. The camp is a reminder of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte where as many as 2,000 immigrants were gathered before it was shut down in 2002 after sparking a British immigration crisis.

The migrants, who round the clock take turns to try and jump on UK-bound lorries on the roads leading to the port, huddle around camp fires during the evening. The camp is littered with bits of rubbish and many of the tents are in poor condition. The hundreds of migrants have had to share just three portable toilets next to the site since a toilet block was torched. The door to one of the toilets has been torn off.

Whitehall officials believe hackers managed to infiltrate the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's account @DCMS - which has 55,000 followers - just after 7.30pm yesterday. At least three messages were posted which said: 'Seriously though guys which one of us hasn't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer?? #FreeMariaMiller.

We have got our technical team looking into it.' The spokesman added there was no indication as to whether the hack had originated from inside or outside the department. Mrs Miller made a 32-second apology to Parliament on Thursday after a 16-month inquiry into her expenses claims found she had frustrated investigators. A report by the Commons standards committee concluded she should repay £5,800 overclaimed on her mortgage in 2009. Under fire: The Culture Secretary leaves the House of Commons after her apology to MPs on Thursday . The country property which was designated a primary home (left) and the second home in Wimbledon (right) She had designated a house in Wimbledon, south west London, as her 'second home', claiming a rented cottage in her Hampshire constituency was her main residence. But critics felt that because her parents lived in the Wimbledon house, it should be designated as her main residence. The Culture Secretary bought the property with her solicitor husband Iain for £234,000 in 1995, and taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – the year Mrs Miller became MP for Basingstoke. Taxpayers would not have been billed for the interest in the same way if she had designated it as her main home. The couple then sold the Wimbledon house in February for £1.47million, making a profit of £1.2million. Mrs Miller, a 50-year-old mother of three, was appointed Culture Secretary and minister for women and equality in a 2012 Cabinet reshuffle.","Three messages were posted on @DCMS account on Saturday night .

"By . James Salmon . The pressure on Marks & Spencer is set to increase this week when the retailer confirms yet another drop in clothing sales. Britain’s biggest clothing retailer is expected to report an eleventh straight fall in clothing sales, despite attempts to revive its fortunes with an expensive advertising campaign. The 130-year old group is on Thursday forecast by City analysts to reveal a fall in sales of general merchandise - which includes clothing footwear and homewares - of 1pc in the three months to the end of March. Scroll down for video . Slump: Despite millions spent on the fashion range and the 'Leading Ladies' promotion, sales have fallen again . Food sales are expected to have nudged up 0.1pc. The failure to arrest the long term decline in clothing sales is an embarrassing blow for chief executive Marc Bolland who has pumped millions into overhauling the fashion range and improving its IT systems. It has also launched a ‘Leading Ladies’ advertising campaign to win over its Middle England clientele. This features a wide range of women from disparate careers and backgrounds, including actress Emma Thompson and Stephen Lawrence’s campaigning mother Doreen. Mr Bolland is expected to point to unhelpfully wet weather and having to compete with rival retailers which continued to slash prices after Christmas. City analysts predict that M&S will on May 20 announce it made a pre tax profit of £623million in the financial year 2014-14, down from £665million in the 2012-13 financial year. Embarrassment: The figures will be a blow for chief executive Marc Bolland who has invested a great deal in reviving the clothing line of Marks & Spencer, as well as improving the IT systems, since he took over . Abroad: Marks & Spencer is now looking to open stores in the Middle East and India to boost profits . M&S is now looking further afield for its profits and plans to open 250 new stores outside the UK  - including in Europe, the Middle East and India - over the next three years. But it has been forced to admit defeat in its attempts to expand across China. US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs recently signalled its concerns about the prospects for M&S, downgrading its recommendation for the company’s shares to a ‘conviction sell’. The decline in clothing sales has seen M&S lose ground to arch rival Next, which has reported stellar sales.","Sales announced this week expected to show drop of 1% in 3 months .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A former model who used sunbeds for over 20 years has called for them to be banned after she was diagnosed with rare eye cancer and given weeks to live. Mother-of-one Debi Gibson from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, starting using sunbeds at the age of 14. She decided not to use protective goggles when on the sunbed so she would be free of any tan lines. The 42-year-old was diagnosed with rare eye cancer in April 2012 - and has now been given a terminal diagnosis after the disease spread to her liver. Debi Gibson, pictured with her husband Darren, 36, and her daughter Sienna, seven, left, and in her modelling days in 2000, right. Mrs Gibson has called for sunbeds to be banned after she was diagnosed with eye cancer . The mother, who had one eye removed in October 2012 because of the disease, is now calling for sunbeds to be banned. Speaking today she said: 'I want . something good to come out of my death. All this because I wanted to be . brown. I would like sunbeds to be banned. 'I am going to have to leave my . daughter behind. She knows it all. She doesn't understand everything, . she just knows that mummy is going to go to heaven soon, that mummy has a . nasty disease called cancer and it is going to kill her.' Mrs Gibson, who has starred in Eastenders and alongside Madonna in musical Evita, gave up sunbeds in 2005 after hearing stories of others being struck down with cancer. But after suffering blurred vision in April 2012 she was told she had a choroidal melanoma, a type of cancer that affects the eye. Debi Gibson in 1987 aged 16, left, and in 1998, right. The former model started using sunbeds aged 14 after feeling pressured to be tanned for her work . Mrs Gibson in 2005. The mother was forced to have an eye removed after chemotherapy on the cancer failed . A year later surgeons removed her left . eye after chemotherapy failed to kill the deadly growth, which was . covering half of her eyeball. Earlier this year she was handed the devastating news that the disease had spread to her liver. She said: 'There . is this pressure when you are modelling or in the acting profession to . be the perfect colour. I saved up the money myself when I was 14 to buy a . sunbed and had it at my parent's house. 'I used it all the time, back then there weren't any guidelines around, people thought this was the safest way to tan. 'I eventually became a personal trainer at a gym and I used to use the sunbed there as well. 'They came with goggles, but those left you with ugly tan lines so I didn't use them, I never thought that would kill me. 'I moved to London when I was 18 to become an actress and a model. There was so much pressure to look tanned, I went through that with the film industry. Ms Gibson aged 25. The mother decided not to use protective goggles while on sunbeds to avoid tan lines . 'Then around 2005, there was a lot of bad press around sunbeds, so I stopped using them. 'In 2012 I woke up and found everything was blurry, I went to my doctors and he sent me to the hospital. 'They did a scan and sat me down and told me that half of my eye was covered in a tumour. 'It's rare, only around one in every six million people get it, the doctors said it is only seen in sunny countries and they only thing they could think caused it was my use of sunbeds without the protection. 'They tried chemo but eventually they told me it hadn't worked as they had hoped. 'I was already going blind at this point, so it felt easier when they told me they were going to take the eye out. 'It . happened pretty quickly. They told me I needed the operation in the . October, and it was removed in the November. It was a horrendous time. 'Then after about a year I went back for another scan and they told me it had spread to my liver and I was going to die. 'The doctor gave me eight weeks to live, which runs out next week.' 'At first I went mad, completely mad, I pulled my daughter straight out of school and we all went on holiday. Ms Gibson wants sunbeds to be banned after her cancer spread to her liver and she was told it was terminal . 'But after a little while I came to terms with it. The doctors have me on a trial drug and are giving me chemo to shrink the tumour. That could give me months or years more time.' Her husband Darren Gibson said: 'It has been horrendous. Nurses have been coming out to see her from the Douglas Macmillan Hospice and they have been fantastic.' 'Debi is an amazing woman. She never seems scared, I'm sure she's struggling inside sometimes, but she is an actress.' The Sunbed Association (TSA) was set up in 1995 and is a non-profit representing operators, manufacturers and distributors of sunbeds. Members of TSA agree to comply with the Sunbeds (Regulations) Act. It includes making sure sunbeds . meet European standards, that trained staff are on duty at all times and . that protective goggles are always worn. A new law introduced in 2011 . means it is illegal for under-18s to use sunbeds. Research has shown using sunbeds increases your risk of skin cancer by up to 75 per cent.

'Therefore, to call for a ban on a product or service when it has been used inappropriately is unfortunately misguided and even more so when self-diagnosis on the cause of a disease has taken place. 'Education about responsible use of sunbeds and sunbathing in general is of course very important, which is why we would always recommend anyone using a sunbed does so in a Sunbed Association member salon, where they will receive correct advice and information from properly trained staff. 'UV penetrates the skin, so it is insufficient either on a sunbed or when sunbathing just to close your eyes, as this will not protect them.'","Debi Gibson, 42, started using sunbeds when she was 14 years old .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A plot to send £300 of cannabis through the mail was uncovered – thanks to two dogs at a village post office. Staff at the post office in Frampton on Severn, Gloucestershire, thought they could smell something suspicious when a parcel was left to be sent to London. Then two cocker spaniels belonging to the shop's owner, Frankie and Badger, started barking before tearing open the outer packaging and staff realised it contained the illegal Class B drug. Cunning spaniels Badger (left) and Frankie (right) sniffed out a package of cannabis - which had been posted at a Post Office in rural Gloucestershire . The parcel had the sender’s address inside it, and drugs squad police raided a nearby farm where they discovered four small cannabis plants. Police said a 23-year-old man was cautioned for possession of cannabis with intent to supply. It is understood that a relative, who did not know its contents, dropped the package off at the local post office. A worker at the post office said: ‘The smell was horrific. The dogs were very interested in it – it really stank. It raised suspicions, as it was either a bad pair of old socks, or something that wasn’t legal. 'Obviously we were shrewd enough to know it was not something we should . be sending. Perhaps they thought we were naive but it turned out we were . correct.

A police spokesman said the parcel was addressed to a recipient in London but they intercepted it before it was loaded in to a delivery van, on Thursday, March 13. A police spokesperson said: 'We conducted a search of a premises near the post office and found three to four plants. 'He had been intending to send the cannabis to a friend in London. 'The 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession and cultivation of cannabis, and on suspicion of possession of cannabis with intent to supply. 'He was cautioned for the second offence.'

"By . Amanda Williams . A mother who went on a huge shopping spree after she discovered £52,000 had mistakenly been put into her bank account has defended her actions. In a case which has divided moral opinion, Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 . on expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day . spending splurge after finding the transfer from her council. She also gave her mother £1,000 in cash, and put . £40,000 into a savings account, before she was caught by police on April . 24 last year. Cheers: Michaela Hutchings went on a spending spree after she found her £52,000 in her bank account. She was on Monday found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer . While some have taken to social media sites to criticise her since her appearance at Stafford Crown Court, others - including her family - have defended her actions, claiming that 'anyone would have done the same.' Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Miss Hutchings said: 'All of this is my fault and I feel so sorry. I put my family in a position where they are being looked down on by everyone. She described the day that she discovered the money, after going to the shop to buy some milk. 'Then when I went to the cashpoint to take out some money I checked my balance and ­everything changed. There was over £50,000 in there. I didn’t know what to do. Who would?' She claims that when she asked the cashier where the money had come from, she could not say. She added that had she known it was from the council she would not have touched it. 'Seizing a good opportunity': Hutchings in . self-shot pictures posted online. The 23-year-old spent £9,000 on . designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day splurge after . finding the transfer from her council . The young mother said that her former boyfriend - who is currently in custody awaiting trial for drug related offences - told her to keep the money. Under the 1968 Theft Act, if you realise money has been paid into your bank account by mistake, you must repay it. Keeping . the unexpected windfall could lead to a charge of ‘dishonestly . retaining wrongful credit’ and to a prison sentence of up to  ten years. In . rare cases defendants have successfully argued that they did not . realise they had been paid the money in error and have not had to return . it. She added: 'But also, part of me liked the idea that I suddenly had all that money. I was a single mum – money isn’t always easy. But this was not how I was brought up.' Hutchings was found guilty of . dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer when she . appeared at Stafford Crown Court last week. Recorder Derek Desmond accepted she had been encouraged to spend by her boyfriend.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A tiny baby has a new chance at life after she was given open heart surgery minutes after being born. Chanel Murrish, now five weeks old, developed a rare heart condition in the womb, and doctors said she was unlikely to survive. Surgeons were able to put a stent into the young girl's heart, which gave her enough time to make it through to a second procedure just a week later, making her the youngest patient to undergo the surgery. Survivor: Chanel Murrish was given heart surgery minutes after birth, and a further procedure one week later. She is pictured recovering from the later operation . Fighters: Parents Fay and Micheal Murrish (pictured with Chanel) decided to go through with the birth despite the low chances of survival after they felt her kicking . Her mother Fay, 24, was told 20 weeks into her pregnancy that her daughter had developed hypoplastic left heart syndrome - a condition where only one side of the heart can beat properly. Doctors even took the step of recommending that she terminate the pregnancy - since Chanel was so unlikely to survive - but Fay and her husband Micheal were determined to see it through once they felt Chanel kicking in the womb. Mrs Murrish told the Sunday Mirror: 'Chanel has proved she is determined to live. Iâ€™m so proud of her. The doctors say one in three million babies are at risk of the same condition. 'We were told Chanel could have operations but would only have . a 50/50 chance of surviving the first and would need two more... when you hear that you wonder if you should bring a child into the world.' Stronger: Chanel, pictured in the past week, has recovered well from the procedures - though there is more to come . Mr and Mrs Murrish were told they could either terminate the pregnancy immediately, give birth naturally and let Chanel die in their arms shortly after birth, or persevere with the surgery - which they chose to do. Mrs Murrish gave birth to Chanel, who weighed 7lbs, by caesarian at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, and could not even hold her before she was rushed off to surgery. Chanel remains in intensive care in the hospital, but has been introduced to her two brothers:  Chase, four, and Cole, 22 months. She has more procedures to come, but has so far gone from strength to strength.","Tiny Chanel Murrish has rare condition where only half her heart beats .

A further 19 were killed because of untreatable tendon injuries. Since 2010, of those destroyed nine were deemed to have dangerous temperaments, eight had untreatable injuries and six had colic. The MoD said killing the animals was always a last resort. A vet - who asked to remain anonymous - told the paper the statistics were worrying. They said: 'I’d like to know why euthanasia was regarded as the only appropriate treatment.' It is not the first animal welfare scandal to hit the MoD. Last month it was revealed that more than 100 pigs have been blown up in Britain over a three-year period for research into battlefield injuries. Some 115 have been killed to test if they could be saved after being injured in blasts - and a group were even put in body armour before being blown up at a military base in Porton Down, Wiltshire.

"By . Tara Brady . A partygoer bit a stranger on the face as she danced in a cage in a night club after drinking to celebrate her birthday, a court has heard. Katie Bateman turned on the man in the club because she is suffering from a stress disorder as a result of traumatic events in her childhood, it was said. She admitted attacking a fellow customer at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon, and grabbing a second by his T-shirt in a confrontation at the bar. Confrontation: Katie Bateman turned on the man at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon . Bateman, 27, had been celebrating her birthday in August last year when she carried out the attack while suffering from anxiety which made her 'hyper vigilant' about approaches from men. A psychologist's report showed she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder which makes her prone to panic attacks and depression. She was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her. Bateman, of Bideford, Devon, admitted causing actual bodily harm to Aaron McMahon and assault by beating of Richard Ball. Her sentence was adjourned for reports by Judge Erik Salomonsen. The Judge told her she would not face an immediate jail sentence. He said: 'I have seen the letter from her doctor and the psychological report and it seems to me a case where she needs to be treated in the community to ensure there is no further offending.' The judge made his ruling after being told that CCTV from the club showed the incident in which the first victim suffered a small graze and bruising to his face after she leaned over and bit him on the cheek. The second was grabbed by the shirt in a second incident shortly afterwards. Kate Bateman was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her . She had been drinking, taking drugs and dancing in a cage shortly before the attacks and later said she had little memory of what happened. Miss Beth Heaton, defending, said Bateman was out celebrating her birthday with family and friends.She said: 'She suffers from PTSD among other conditions and that may be relevant to these offences in that she may have believed she was going to be assaulted. 'She reacted in a hyper vigilant way to what she perceived as threats from males. When she was shown the CCTV she became very anxious and had a panic attack. 'She reacted very differently from someone who was not suffering from her condition. She has been suffering for some time, having been diagnosed in 2007.' Miss Heaton said the attacks in August last year coincided with the start of a new treatment regime which is proving successful.","Katie Bateman suffering from a disorder as a result of her childhood .

The pair of 20ft white sculptures, by artist Gerry Judah, will hang at the head of the nave, greeting visitors as they walk into the cathedral . Speaking to the Mail Online, Mr Judah said he chose to use modern conflicts as his inspiration in order to 'contemporise' the First World War. He said: 'Given that there are going to be many memorials to the First World War itself, I chose to say it's no just about remembering, but realising that the conflicts that are being fought now are knock-ons from that war. 'For example when they carved up the Ottoman Empire they created states like Syria, which is where these conflicts are being fought. 'I wanted to contermporise the War, to say we can look at 100 years ago, but let's also look at today. 'These wars may not be on the vast scale of people that died in the First World War, but these conflicts are still a tragedy.

'These sculptures are intended to appeal to our feelings of pity and charity, as well as filling us with hope for the future, which, I feel, is one of the principal purposes of a great place of worship, contemplation and meditation such as St Paul’s.'

Murderer: Adam Cross, 35, was originally jailed for grievous bodily harm but has now been convicted of the more serious crime after his victim died . A violent attacker whose victim died three years after being left in a vegetative state by his vicious assault has been convicted of murder. Adam Cross, 35, launched his unprovoked attack on Joseph Starzacher at a takeaway after a night out in 2007. He was originally jailed for grievous bodily harm, and has been in prison since 2008. But, in an unprecedented move, he has now also been found guilty of murdering Mr Starzacher, who died of his wounds in 2010. In a new trial last week, Winchester Crown Court heard how Joseph was out with friends in Salisbury, Wiltshire, when Cross . began shouting abuse at him in a takeaway. He punched him to the floor and then knocked him unconscious with a brutal kick to the head. CCTV . footage showed that Joseph had initially tried to get up after first . being knocked down and it was the kick to the head that had knocked him . out. He was rushed to . hospital in Southampton and had life-saving brain surgery, but never . recovered. Mr Starzacher, a father of one, needed constant care and had to move to a home in the wake of the unprovoked attack. After three years in a vegetative state, he died in August 2010 from pneumonia caused by his immobility. Medical experts concluded that the 37-year-old's death was linked to the head injury Cross caused.Cross was found guilty following a fresh trial last week and is due to be sentenced at a later date. The full extent of the sentence Cross will receive is to be decided at a future hearing. It is believed to be the first time someone convicted of an assault has then be successfully retried for murder after their victim died. Victim: Joseph Starzacher, pictured after the attack, died aged 37 in 2010 . Mr Starzacher's family has spoken of their 'horrific ordeal', and said that the murder conviction will finally allow them to move on. A joint statement said: 'Joseph was a kind, gentle and caring person who abhorred violence. We as a family have lost a lovely young man in the prime of his life. 'To see Joseph's life taken away in such an act of unprovoked, mindless violence has had a devastating and heartbreaking effect on all those who knew him. 'We have had to endure seeing Joseph locked in his body unable to communicate for three years watching his deterioration that eventually led to his death in 2010. 'This has been deeply distressing for us all but especially for his daughter Megan who was the apple of his eye. 'Despite going through two trials and two appeal processes we can now begin the process of moving on from this horrific ordeal knowing that Adam Cross, the person responsible for our grief, has been found guilty of murder.'

But an . appeal saw his life sentence quashed and replaced with an indefinite . term of imprisonment with a minimum of five years. The murder sentence . is likely to be significantly harsher.

Father: Mr Starzacher, pictured with his daughter Megan, was left in a vegetative state after a vicious attack at a Salisbury takeaway . Speaking after the court case, Detective Sergeant Pete Ritson, who worked on the case from the start said that the family had been devastated by the attack. He said: 'Joseph was only 34 when Cross assaulted him in an entirely unprovoked attack, there was no reason for Cross to take such action. 'Joseph effectively lost his life that night, he never recovered and spent the next three years in a specialist nursing home with 24-hour medical care. The effect on his family was devastating. 'Cross was serving the initial sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent, but following Joseph's death it is right and proper that he was put before the courts to stand trial for his murder. 'This case is a stark reminder of the serious consequences of violence. Joseph lost his life and his young daughter lost her dad because of the actions of Adam Cross. 'We are content that justice has been done for Joseph and we hope that his family can finally find some peace of mind.'","Adam Cross, 35, viciously assaulted Joseph Starzacher in 2007 on night out .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Wayne Rooney will play through the pain barrier to make Manchester United’s crucial Champions League clash with Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena on Wednesday night. It is believed that Rooney might have suffered a chipped bone in his foot in the first leg at Old Trafford – and not a badly bruised toe as first thought – but he will take strong painkillers to play in United’s biggest game of the season. United boss David Moyes hinted that a painkilling injection was a possibility on Friday after revealing that his 17-goal striker would miss the trip to Newcastle.

"By . Rob Waugh . Our ancestor? The remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that English people originally came from Spain . The remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that English people originally came from Spain. The remains - found in a cave in Cantabria - included a near-complete skeleton. The prehistoric genetic fragments date back 7,000 years - . 1,700 years before Otzi, the Iceman whose mummy was discovered in the Alps. They are believed to be from an ancient population that continued to move northwards into territories such as England, Germany, Lithuania and Poland.' They come from two individuals who lived in what is now . Valdelugueros near Leon and share the same characteristics as that of people . from England and other parts of northern Europe. Evolutionary biologist Dr Carles Lauleza-Fox, of the Spanish . National Research Council, said: ‘These hunters-gatherers shared nomadic habits . and had a common origin. ‘Despite their geographical distance, individuals from the . regions corresponding to the current England, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and . Spain, shared the same mitochondrial lineage.’ The site where the remains were found was only discovered in . 2006 by chance. The cave is in a cold and mountainous area which is why the DNA . was preserved. But it is believed they continued to move northwards meaning . that today’s Spaniards do not have the same lineage. Bones belonging to them were found in the Brana-Arintero cave in . Cantabria. They included one skeleton that was almost complete. The prehistoric genetic fragments date back 7,000 years, -  1,700 years before Otzi, the Iceman whose mummy was discovered in the Alps . The study published in Current Biology also shows modern day . Iberian populations do not come from the pair. Dr Lauleza-Fox and colleagues managed to decipher from one the . complete mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down the maternal line, revealed . Europeans from this time were very uniform genetically. The overall DNA data represents 1.34 and 0.5 percent of both . individuals’ total genome, and found Iberians from then were more closely related . to northern Europeans who may have assimilated part of their genetic legacy. The mummy of Otzi belonged to a man who lived 5,300 years ago, . a period known geologically as the Neolithic, and was found in the Tyrolean . Alps, on the border of Austria and Italy. Dr Lalueza-Fox said the team eventually hopes to recover the . complete DNA of the individuals, and to compare it with that of modern humans. He said: ‘The arrival of the Neolithic Period brought about a . replacement of populations, and could cause genetic changes in genes associated . with new infectious diseases, and in metabolic genes linked to changes in diet.

'This is necessary to protect the privacy of Michael and his family and to enable the medical team to work in full calmness.' Schumacher has been in an induced coma at the Grenoble Hospital since he fell while skiing on December 29. Gary Hartstein, a former Formula One doctor, said 'wakening' would mean that Schumacher has opened his eyes. He said: 'This eye opening can even be cyclic, following what looks just like a sleep-wake cycle (even if not synchronised to real day-night hours).' And he said the 'moments of consciousness' meant that Schumacher would have had interaction with his environment. He said: 'It consists of episodes of clear, purposeful interaction with the environment, and/or clear signs of awareness of self, even if these signs are not constantly present.

Despite the encouraging statement, it is understood the 45-year-old will not be moved from hospital in the imminent future. His . family and friends have also stressed there is no truth in reports that . his wife Corinna has built a medical suite at their home in . Switzerland.

'The team at the BIC continues to offer Michael and his family its best wishes.' Schumacher was placed in an induced coma after undergoing two separate operations to remove blood clots from his brain following his accident on December 29. Mercedes, who the German returned to the sport with in 2010, added on Friday: 'Positive news from Grenoble today.

"By . Pete Jenson . Barcelona have been thrown into chaos by a FIFA ruling that bans them from signing players for the next two transfer windows. The club are in desperate need of summer reinforcements with goalkeeper Victor Valdes, defender Carles Puyol and possibly midfielder Xavi Hernandez all leaving in the summer. Barca had earmarked up to £100million for new recruits with a new keeper, two defenders and a midfielder as their priorities but those plans will need to be shelved for a year after the game’s governing body banned and fined the Catalan club for illegally signing Under 18 players.

The Spanish FA have also been fined . £331,000 for contravening article 19 of FIFA regulations concerning the . signing of young players. Barcelona confirmed on Wednesday night that they would appeal to FIFA against their transfer ban. They issued a 14 point statement saying: 'The rule supposedly infringed, exists to protect minors against sports clubs that incorporate them without guaranteeing their rights and education but those are the very things our youth academy stands for. 'Barcelona forms people not just players and this has not been considered by FIFA who have applied the their criteria ignoring the educative side of our programmes.' The club also said all its players were legal residents of Spain and that none of them had played in official games since FIFA began investigating their cases and withdrew their registrations. The statement went on: 'Barcelona has challenged FIFA for some time to reevaluate the rules that are supposed to protect young players in order to make it more effective.' The transfer ban has cast a shadow of doubt over . moves already agreed for Borussia Monchengladbach keeper Marc-Andre ter . Stergen and Croatian 17-year-old Alen Halilovic, who turns 18 in June.

Barcelona has been found to be in breach of article 19 of the . regulations in the case of 10 minor players and to have committed . several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players. 'The . disciplinary committee regarded the infringements as serious and . decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and . international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, . together with a fine of 450,000 Swiss francs. 'Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.' The FIFA statement added: 'The . disciplinary committee emphasised that the protection of minors in the . context of international transfers is an important social and legal . issue that concerns all stakeholders in football. 'The . committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in . specific cases, be favourable to a young player's sporting career, they . are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a . minor. 'Young football . players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country . without the proper controls. This particular fact makes the protection . of minors in football by the sport's governing bodies, especially by . FIFA, even more important.' Dilemma: Barca will have to work out a way of coping without goalkeeper Victor Valdes . Problem: Valdes suffered a serious knee injury last week and is due to leave the club in the summer . Deep pockets: Barca have made at least one big-money buy in recent summers, including Fabregas in 2011 . The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol (RFEF) and Spanish club FC Barcelona for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. The sanctions follow investigations initially conducted by FIFA Transfer Matching System GmbH (FIFA TMS) over the course of last year and subsequently by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee as part of disciplinary proceedings. The RFEF and FC Barcelona were found to have violated several provisions concerning the international transfer and first registration of non-Spanish minors with the club, as well as other relevant regulations with regard to the registration and participation of certain players in national competitions. The investigations concerned several minor players who were registered and participated in competitions with the club over various periods between 2009 and 2013. Currently, the main provision relating to the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is art. 19 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (the 'Regulations'). According to art. 19, international transfers of players are only permitted if the player is over the age of 18. However, the same article stipulates that international transfers of minor players are permitted under three limited circumstances, and such exceptions may only be granted after evaluation by the sub-committee of the Players’ Status Committee. In this respect, the Disciplinary Committee emphasised that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football. Above all, the committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in specific cases, be favourable to a young player’s sporting career, they are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a minor. On the basis of this analysis, the committee concluded that 'the interest in protecting the appropriate and healthy development of a minor as a whole must prevail over purely sporting interests.' The Disciplinary Committee underlined that FIFA takes the protection of minors in football very seriously. The protection of minors is one of the key principles included in the agreement concluded between FIFA, UEFA and the European Commission in 2001. The Disciplinary Committee acknowledged that young football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls. This particular fact makes the protection of minors in football by the sport’s governing bodies, especially by FIFA, even more important. With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations. The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned. With regard to the RFEF, the Disciplinary Committee determined that the association had also violated art. 19 of the Regulations and other provisions in the context of the transfer and first registration of certain minor players. In this respect, the RFEF was sanctioned with a fine of CHF 500,000 and granted a period of one year in which to regularise their regulatory framework and existing system concerning the international transfer of minors in football. In addition, the RFEF and the club were issued with a reprimand in accordance with art. 14 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code. The web-based Transfer Matching System (TMS) became mandatory for all international transfers of professional male players within the scope of eleven-a-side football in October 2010. As early as 2009, the use of TMS was obligatory in all applications for a first registration of a minor or an international transfer involving a minor in accordance with art. 19 of the Regulations. FIFA TMS, founded as a FIFA subsidiary in 2007, established a compliance programme in 2010 to ensure that all international transfers of professional football players are conducted through TMS in accordance with the Regulations, and to control the integrity of club and association behaviour and data in TMS. Cases involving violations of the Regulations, in particular Annexes 2 and 3, are identified and investigated and, where applicable, are then forwarded to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for evaluation and decision. FIFA TMS monitors transfer activity using internally-developed market intelligence, external sources and information received from the FIFA Players’ Status & Governance and Disciplinary & Governance departments.","Barcelona's plans are thrown into chaos by transfer ban imposed by FIFA .

"By . Nicole Lampert . Maisie as Arya in Game Of Thrones . Game Of Thrones isn't just one of the biggest shows on TV - thanks to its bloodlust and lashings of female nudity it's also one of the most controversial. And few figures are more controversial than that of Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark. On screen she's a fearsome creature who, aged just 12, has already killed one man - and you can expect the murder count to tot up in the new series, which starts this week. She's been orphaned by the terrible war that sees several factions vying for the throne. In the last series' now infamous Red Wedding scene, her brother, sister-in-law and mother were all brutally murdered while attending what was meant to be a happy occasion. But 16-year-old Maisie's attracted controversy off screen too, thanks to her decision to leave formal education before she even took her GCSEs. But the articulate, Bristol-born daughter of a university administrator and businessman insists she didn't really have a choice. 'My school wouldn't let me go off and film so we had a polite conversation where they kind of asked me to leave,' she says when we meet. 'It's fair enough; they can't teach me if I'm not there and it's a black mark against the school to have someone who's absent. But I was working, not bunking off.' Maisie hasn't abandoned education though, as she recently started a course in performing arts at Bath Dance College. 'They're encouraging me to work and they make it easier to slip back in. I know this is something I want to make a career out of. Game Of Thrones is just the beginning.' The youngest of four children, Maisie had no professional acting experience when she won the part of Arya in the huge HBO production. She had hoped to make a future in dance but an agent put her forward for the role which required a tomboy-ish girl; Maisie fitted in perfectly. The show's been a bigger hit than any of its mainly British cast could have predicted. Based on George RR Martin's series of fantasy novels, it may feature dragons, zombies and women who give birth to shadows, but even non-fantasy-loving viewers fell in love with its epic battles for power. 16-year-old Maisie is attracted to controversy off screen too, thanks to her decision to leave formal education before she even took her GCSEs . A huge hit around the world, it attracts 14 million viewers in the US and over 4 million here - it's Sky Atlantic's biggest show. It's brutally gory, but Maisie says it didn't take long to get used to the blood. 'Because I'm the youngest in my family I had to watch movies I was too young for, and they were a lot scarier,' she says. 'Now I know it's pretend. The fake blood is a sugary liquid which tastes amazing. The only things I struggle to watch are torture scenes - but everyone struggles with those.' For Maisie, who has two films, Corvidae and Falling, out this year, the hardest aspect of being a star is dealing with the fame; she's been the victim of Twitter abuse but insists she can deal with it. 'I've put myself on social media so I have to take the consequences,' she says. 'One thing that comes up is I have a wide face and big eyebrows. Everyone has their insecurities so I wear it as my armour. Instead of tweezing my eyebrows I make them bigger.' Indeed, on the day we meet she's painted make-up on her eyebrows. War paint for a surprisingly normal girl. Game Of Thrones, Monday morning at 2am and evening at 9pm, Sky Atlantic.","Maisie left school at 16 to pursue a career in acting .

"As Kate and William’s royal tour to Australia draws near, interest in the minute details of their schedule, childcare plans, and of course Kate’s wardrobe is reaching fever pitch. A worldwide fashion icon, the Duchess’s wardrobe will be under even more scrutiny than usual as she embarks on her second official royal tour, seen by millions as an ambassador for British fashion. As well as no doubt remaining loyal to some of her long standing favourite designers such as, Temperley, the 32-year-old has apparently also commissioned Ralph & Russo to design some of her pieces for the trip. Kate, pictured performing her royal duties recently, has reportedly turned to Ralph & Russo for help with her hot anticipated wardrobe for the upcoming tour . The trip to Australia, which starts next week, marks the second official tour the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have undertaken on behalf of the Queen, and interest is high worldwide, especially as they will be joined by Prince George . Looking through the Ralph & Russo SS14 collection it is not hard to image Kate in many of the elegant designs . Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo are the Australian couple behind the British brand . Grazia reports that a source confirms Kate has approached the designers, saying: ‘Kate visited Ralph & Russo’s boutique last month and said she was looking for inspiration for the tour. ‘She liked that they had Australian connections and has apparently given them specific instructions for a gown.’ The brand, which hit the news earlier this year when they became the first British designer ever to be welcomed into the official Couture Fashion Week in over 100 years, is sure to be a crowd pleasing choice for her upcoming tour down under, Ralph and Russo, despite being a British brand, was founded in 2007 by Australian couple Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo. And Kate will be in good company as the pair boast some serious A list clientele including Angelina Jolie and Beyonce, and their outfits have price-tags to match with a cocktail dress . Looking through the latest collection it is not hard to imagine Kate looking elegant in a number of their pieces, which included tailored skirt suits with Kate’s favoured cinched-in waist and breath-taking red carpet worthy gowns. However the commissioning of the designers marks a distinct change in direction for the Duchess, who is known for her love of high-street designers. Ralph & Russo were the first British designer to be officially part of Couture Fashion Week for 100 years . The designers have yet to make a ready-to-wear range and a bespoke gown can cost as much as £50,000 . The Duchess, pictured here in 2012 at the third stop of the couple's nine-day tour of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, kept her look casual, wearing lots of high street brands as well as designer clothes . The Queen is apparently is keen to see Kate looking more regal on the upcoming tour, with longer hemlines and more jewels. William and Kate’s 2012 tour of Asia saw Kate pairing British designers such as Alexander McQueen with plenty of high street favourites such as Russell & Bromley and Hobbs. In contrast to her usual humble fashion tastes, Ralph & Russo represent the very top end of design, having never in fact produced a ready-to-wear range, focusing instead on custom made pieces and couture collections. Speaking to Vogue earlier this year Ralph said of their ethos: ‘We create an experience around the dress; we have a very personal relationship with each of our clients. ‘I have always loved the fantasy or fashion and it was important for me to focus on something I loved.’ The move up the fashion ladder may be prompted by the Queen, who apparently is keen to see Kate looking more regal on the upcoming tour, with longer hemlines and more jewels.","Duchess and William embark on royal tour of Australia next week .

Ollie, who uploads snaps of himself to his style blog, Proudlock Style, admits he never gets camera shy. He said: 'While modelling was never my main intention, my mum is a photographer and she always took loads of photos of my family and I, putting on mini photo-shoots whilst we were on holiday so I have been used to the camera from an early age, which is fortunate for where I am now.'

Proudlock's bun may have become the butt of all jokes between his Made In Chelsea co-stars but, as man buns - or muns - become the hottest hair accessory, who's laughing now?

"By . Katy Winter . Standing at a statuesque 6ft 2in Stas Fedyanin looks totally at ease strutting down catwalks and posing in glamorous shoots. Clothed in dresses and high heels, with long hair, a willowy frame and even a hint of cleavage it is almost impossible to believe that the model is in fact, a male. The 18-year-old Russian is the latest androgynous model to make waves in the fashion industry, with his story made all the more unusual because he regularly dates women, and is in all other ways a normal red blooded male. Stas is represented by Dopamin Models, a German male model agency, but works almost exclusively as a female model . Stas says he has got used to walking in heels and that despite his delicate features and lean body, there is still a fair bit of preparation involved in turning him into a female . The model, who can now command up to £2,000 for a single shoot, says he has no problems finding a date . Joining the realms of Andrej Pejic, who has become a favourite with the world's top womenswear designers, Stas says he has got used to walking in heels and that despite his delicate features and lean body, there is still a fair bit of preparation involved in turning him into a female. Speaking to Closer, he says: ‘I’ve learnt to walk in six-inch heels by watching female models, I tuck my penis into a G-string when I’m modelling swimwear or underwear and I often wear hair extensions.’ Stas also says that while there are now a few ‘gender neutral’ models in the fashion world he has yet to meet another straight male that works as a female. He can now command up to £2,000 for a single shoot, says he has no problems finding a female date. In order to keep up his feminine appearance Stas avoids the gym to prevent developing masculine muscles and also keeps up regular leg and bikini line waxes . Stas, who stands at 6ft 2in, reportedly weighs just 99lb or 7 stone . ‘Like any man, I enjoy working with gorgeous women and I’ve dated a few of the girls I’ve worked with. They don’t have a problem with me dressing as a woman- in fact some of them find it a turn on. I go for blondes and I like curvy girls.’ Reportedly weighing just 99lb, or just over 7st, Stas is represented by Dopamin Models, a German male model agency, but works almost exclusively as a female model. In order to keep up his feminine appearance he avoids the gym to prevent developing masculine muscles and also keeps up regular leg and bikini line waxes, often finding himself attracting male attention. However Stas insists that off the catwalk he leads much the same life as any other man, enjoy football, beer, and spending time with friends. ‘Although I model as a woman, I am all man between the sheets,’ he says.","Stas Fedyanin stands over 6ft and weighs just 99lbs (7st)

"By . Margot Peppers . Playing with food: Marilinda Hodgdon has been a food stylist since 1978, using her artistic eye to make food look as appealing as possible . A woman whose job it is to make food camera-ready has revealed the techniques behind her most mouth-watering ads. Marilinda Hodgdon, who got her degree in ceramics and metal sculpting, has been a food stylist since 1978, using her artistic eye to make everything from ice cream to pasta look as appealing as possible. She told ABC News that the biggest challenge of her job is not just rendering food picture-perfect, but accomplishing that while also maintaining its authenticity to the real-life product. 'If it's, say, Burger King, or a fast food chain, everything must be . according to a standard,' she explained. 'I have to slice a tomato exactly to . their specification; I have to use their meat and their rolls and their . cheese and their condiments... It has to be representative of what . the real thing is.' A . big part of her job is attention to detail, and Ms Hodgdon is a . perfectionist when it comes to getting the photo exactly right. She claims, for example, that she has . sifted through hundreds of sesame seed buns before to find the perfect . one for a hamburger shot. Perfectionist: She claims that she has sifted through hundreds of sesame seed buns before to find the perfect one for a hamburger shot (pictured: a Burger King ad by Ms Hodgdon) The former sculptor, who ran a home renovation company before becoming a food stylist, says her unconventional background gave her the skills necessary to excel in the field. Her knowledge of ceramics and . sculpture, for instance, gave her 'a great sense of color and design and . texture and drama' which she was able to translate into food styling. Much like a make-up artist, she carries a . tool bag to each job, complete with brushes, Q-tips and spray-cans . filled with olive oil to prep her food before it gets in front of the . camera. There are some widely-used tricks of . the food styling trade - like adding water to beverages before . photographing them so that light will filter through and add sparkle. Tools of the trade: Much like a make-up artist, she carries a bag of brushes, Q-tips and spray-cans filled with olive oil to prep her food (pictured: a Cool Whip ad) For the most part, however, Ms Hodgdon tries to avoid these somewhat deceptive tricks, using her own creative techniques instead. She says, for example, that a mark of a truly talented stylist in her field is being able to create a picture-perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream, which tends to melt quickly in a spotlight. Indeed, while many stylists use mounds . of Crisco bound together with corn syrup to simulate ice cream, she . sticks to the real stuff, painstakingly creating a new scoop for every . single camera take. Some of Ms Hodgdon's work includes . commercials for Friendly's, Applebees, Dunkin' Donuts and TGI Friday's . as well as print ads for Publix and Cool Whip. Keen eye: The stylist, who has done ads for many food chains, says her knowledge of ceramics and sculpture gave her 'a great sense of color and design and texture and drama' which she brings to food styling . No faking: Many stylists use mounds of Crisco bound with corn syrup to look like ice cream, but Ms Hodgdon sticks to the real stuff, painstakingly creating a new scoop for every single take . She's also coming out with a book detailing her life as a food stylist, with food shots styled by her and shot by photographer David Bishop. Food styling has long been an important part of advertising and film, but the rules and regulations that stand today came about after an incident in 1970. That year, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of the Campbell Soup Company and discovered that they were photographing bowls of soup with glass marbles inside to make the liquid look chunkier. Professional: She is one of the most in-demand people in an industry where the best stylists get paid up to six figures annually (pictured: a deviled egg styled by Ms Hodgdon) Life story: Ms Hodgdon is soon coming out with a book about her time as a food stylist, with photos taken by David Bishop (pictured: a shot of baked arctic char form the book) Since then, Ms Hodgdon and her fellow food stylists have had to follow a strict set of advertising guidelines. But that doesn't mean she doesn't get creative when it comes to getting the right food photos . When, for example, a director asked her to style meatballs so that they'd bounce when they landed on sandwich bread, Ms Hodgdon was quick on her feet. Since meatballs are too light to bounce, 'I cooked t[them] with lead weights inside them,' she revealed.","In 1970, food advertising rules were tightened after an investigation found that Campbell's used glass marbles to make soups look chunkier.

"By . Katy Winter . A man claims to have wooed hundreds of women into bed using the power of social media. Ben James reckons he has bedded over 200 women in a year - by chatting them up on Twitter. The 20 year-old romeo sends out saucy messages and gets hundreds of replies a day from girls including full-frontal naked selfies. Self-proclaimed Casanova Ben James pictured with his current girlfriend Abby Lugg. Ben claims he has four or five 'tweethearts' on the go at any one time . The 25 year-old Romeo sends out saucy messages and gets hundreds of replies a day from girls including full-frontal naked selfies . Some of the messages Ben has received from women who follow him on Twitter . He claims two or three of those will ask him for sex and he has four or five 'tweethearts' on the go at any one time. Ben, from Croydon, South London, is the originator of the popular tweet: 'Quote this with your best selfie to show off your body'. He has 74,000 followers on the social network and claims the key to success with the ladies is being cheeky enough to say what nobody else would dare. Ben, who lives in a three-bed semi with his healthcare worker mother, says women love his 'honesty' Ben, who sends around 20 tweets a day, said: 'I'll send out a funny tweet, something edgy, and then it gets retweeted a few hundred times. 'Every retweet gets me a hundred or so followers, plus a few celebs, and from that I get a bunch of direct messages. 'Girls send me hundreds of messages a day. Some send naked pictures, some ask for my phone number; and some ask me straight out for sex. 'I normally have about four or five girls on the go at once then I get bored and find some others.' Ben, whose huge following includes celebrities Amy Childs and Callum Best, says his ideal woman is Beyonce - but he's not picky. He added: 'I have a reputation for being a man whore. But if they've got a big bum, I'm interested. 'I normally just tell a girl I want to sleep with her instead of making her think I want a relationship. 'I put in some graft for a day - take her to the zoo, or to the park to feed the ducks - and then the next day I move on to another one.' 'If a woman is upset hold her & tell her how beautiful she is If she starts to growl, retreat to a safe distance and throw chocolate at her.' 'Sweat pants hair tied chillin' with no Makeup on - that's why you single go and put some on' 'Oh, your Twitter account is protected? What the f**k do you tweet? Nuclear launch codes?' 'If you're broke near your girlfriend's birthday just buy her a sexy pair of Sports Direct brand goalie gloves and tell her she is a keeper.' 'I dare a girl with drawn on eyebrows to argue with me. I'll lick my thumb.' 'You fat girls needa stop biting your lips when you take pictures. You look hungry, not sexy.' 'You can measure a person's intelligence by the number of times they get back with their ex.' 'Girls will find a misspelled word in your Tweet but can't find their baby father.' Ben lives in a three-bed semi with his healthcare worker mother and says she doesn't mind sharing her home with Britain's biggest tweetheart. He said: 'My mum doesn't mind. I'm very respectful, at the end of the day. 'She does think I only have one girl coming round all the time, not lots of different ones. 'My dad was a player like me when he was younger. 'He thinks I'm a bit of a legend - I think the apple didn't fall far from the tree.' Ben's tweets usually involve a healthy dose of chauvinistic stereotypes about women and have evoked a odd assortment of responses such as 'Thanks for the other night, babe, really hit the spot', 'Hey babe, last night was awesome, can't wait to **** you again', 'Let's have sex J', 'Maybe we can hook up next time you're in London?', and 'How's about I book you in one day next week?'.

"By . Claire Coleman . Sales of scented candles are booming. Last year we spent £91.4 million on them, an increase of almost 14 per cent since 2011.

But can even Lawrence’s expert ‘nose’ sniff out a cheap candle? We asked him to compare some high-priced candles with cheaper alternatives . . .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Next time you're swatting away a bee, it will be all too apparent what areas of the body to protect - thanks to the research of Michael Smith. The Cornell University student has made a series of painful conclusions into stings by letting honey bees attack every part of his own person. Smith subjected himself to several stings a day to his face, arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs. After weeks of research Smith found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable, the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril. Ouch: Cornell University graduate student Michael Smith subjected himself to five bee stings a day for 38 days and ranked the pain associated with stings collectively. He determined the most painful was a sting on the nose, giving it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 ¿ higher than on the upper lip (8.7) or penis (7.3) Science of stings: Cornell student Michael Smith researched the most painful places for a bee to attack . His usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser. 'We speculated it probably really would . hurt to get stung in the testicles. Two days later, by . chance, I did get stung there. It didn't hurt as much as I expected it . to,' he told the Independent. Smith measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful: . 1) Nostril  - 9.0             6) Cheek - 7.0 . 2) Upper lip - 8.7          7) Armpit - 6.7 . 3) Penis - 7.3               8) Nipple - 6.7 . 4) Scrotum - 7.0              9) Middle finger tip - 6.7 . 5) Palm - 7.0               10) Abdomen - 6.7 . Intrigued by his 'eureka' moment, Smith chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain. He then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him. Like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so, over the course of 38 days, he administered five stings a day. Each body part was stung three times during the experiment, and the pain level was given a mark out of 10. Because the experiment needed a control, he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day's research. His research raised some unusual problems, including being able to maneuver a bee to the more hard-to-reach body parts. 'Some locations required the use of a . mirror and an erect posture during stinging (e.g., buttocks),' he wrote . in his study, which has been published in PeerJ. The . results were surprising, with Smith finding that although stings to the . genitals were painful, there were worst places to be stung. 'There’s . definitely no crossing of wires of pleasure and pain down there. But if . you’re stung in the nose and penis, you’re going to want more stings to . the penis over the nose, if you’re forced to choose,' he told National . Geographic. Experiment: Smith held bees to his body so he could research the most painful sites for stings . Pain map: To be sure of his results, Smith administered three bee stings to 25 locations on his body . 'I really don't want to get sting in the . nose again – that's not fun. Your body really reacts. You're sneezing, . wheezing. Your eyes are streaming,' he added. Smith admitted that there were times when he regretted embarking on his experiment, and said he was glad his supervisor, Tom Seeley, had talked him out of testing stings to the eyes. 'He was concerned that I might go blind. I wanted to keep my eyes,' Smith said. The graduate's fascination with bees . has formed the basis of his research at Cornell's Department of . Neurobiology and Behavior, where he is studying honeybee colonies. While . studying molecular biology at Princeton in 2009 he founded the . Princeton University Bee Team, which has led to the creation of two . hives on the university campus. He also runs the College Beekeeper group, which advises students on how to get hives up and running. Dedication: Smith, a graduate student researching hive colonies, also promotes beekeeping at universities . While measuring pain is subjective, and the study used only one person's measure of pain, Smith has no plans to further his research into bee stings. 'I didn’t see a lot of merit in repeating this with more subjects,' he said. And for those wanting to avoid accidentally repeating his experiment, Smith advised: 'If you have a bee buzzing around you and . you think it's peeved, if you calm down, don't breathe a lot – they are . attracted to carbon dioxide – and slowly walk away, you will be fine. Most stings are probably wasps.'","Cornell graduate student Michael Smith made himself the experiment for a study of bee stings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The number of cases of the highly contagious scarlet fever has reached a record weekly high, health officials have warned. In the last week of March, Public Health England (PHE) was notified of 883 new cases â€“ the highest weekly total since records began in 1982. Since September 2013 PHE has noted 5,012 new cases when they would normally only expect to see around 1,400. In the last week of March, Public Health England was notified of 883 new cases of Scarlet Fever which causes a distinctive red rash, the highest weekly total since records began in 1982 . 'We are continuing to see increases in scarlet fever notifications across England and are working closely with healthcare professionals to try and understand the reasons behind these increases and do our best to reduce the impact of this infection,' said PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance Dr Theresa Lamagni. 'PHE urges people with symptoms of scarlet fever, which include a sore throat, headache and fever accompanied by a characteristic rash, to consult their GP. Scarlet fever should be treated with antibiotics to reduce risk of complications. Symptoms: The highly contagious bacterial illness  causes a pink-red rash which feels like sandpaper to touch . 'Once children or adults are diagnosed with scarlet fever we strongly advise them to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection.' Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash which feels like sandpaper to touch. It can be itchy and start in one area, but soon spreads to many parts of the body, such as the ears, neck and chest. Other symptoms include a high temperature, vomiting, a flushed face and a red, swollen tongue. Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or skin infection and is most common between the ages of two and eight. It is caught by breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes, or through touching their skin. Sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes, bedding, cups and utensils can also pass on the infection. It is treated by antibiotics which must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days. There are normally seasonal rises in scarlet fever between December and April each year. Every few years there is also a notable increase in the number of cases and the latest bout of infections is likely to be part of that cycle, experts have said.","In last week of March, Public Health England was notified of 883 new cases .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when his bicycle was hit by van has stood up for the first time since the accident. Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma and fighting for his life after he decided not to wear a helmet for fear it would ruin his hairstyle. The teenager has remained in hospital since the accident on July 22 last year near the village of Chapel St Leonards, Lincolnshire. Scroll down for video . Ryan Smith has stood up for the first time since being knocked off his bike by a van nine months ago . Ryan's parents are now campaigning for a change in the law so cyclists are forced to wear helmets . At the time, his family released a heart-breaking image showing Ryan’s father, Mark, cradling his son’s head as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets. Then, in November, the family were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time after he came out of his four-month coma. And yesterday, the family reached another milestone when Ryan defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust’s Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey. His sister, Rachael, 22, immediately sent the picture of her brother standing to their paramedic father, Mark, 44. Ryan (pictured before the crash) was not expected ever to stand again because his injuries were so severe . When Ryan was in a coma, his family released this picture to try and encourage cyclists to wear helmets . It was initially feared that Ryan would never wake up. He is pictured with his father when he was in a coma . He said: ‘It was an extremely emotional moment when I saw the picture of Ryan standing unaided - it was a special moment. ‘I was in tears, he is such a fighter, I would not have dreamed he would have come this far in such a small amount of time. ‘He has had quite a remarkable progression, although there is obviously a very long way to go and the movement on his left side is limited, but he isn’t giving up and we are all behind him supporting him. Ryan's father, Mark, said: 'It was an extremely emotional moment when I saw the picture of Ryan standing unaided - it was a special moment' Ryan (pictured with his father, Mark, in hospital) was not wearing a helmet when the accident happened because he was worried about messing up his hairstyle . ‘I don’t use the term miracle a lot in my profession but he is becoming somewhat of a miracle. ‘We are still going round to schools and teaching people about how safe it is to wear a cycle helmet and the affects it can have on people who don’t and their families. A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken. People who are in a coma are alive but have very little brain activity. Every case is different - some are unable to hear voices while others have some awareness of their environment. Comas are most often causes by events such as a severe head injury or a stroke. They can last for hours, days or months. Some people remain in a coma for years, but this is unusual. The chances of recovery depend upon how much of the brain has been damaged. Generally, the longer a person has been in a coma, the poorer the outlook. People don't usually suddenly wake up from a coma - they come round gradually. Some will make a full recovery while others will have severe long-term health problems. ‘It is hard to get it debated in parliament, but we will not stop trying to get people to wear them. ‘Right now, we are preparing everything at home, we have a lot of work to do there as Ryan will be leaving Tadworth in two months to come home. ‘We are literally counting down the . days till we can see him back at home, but we are under no illusions . that it will be hard work for us and for Ryan.’ The . Smith family are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear . helmets after Ryan chose not to wear one due to his fashionable hair style. Cycle helmets are not compulsory in Britain. Olympic . champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed . calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads. Former Welsh international footballer John Hartson, 38, who beat testicular cancer in 2009, visited Ryan on his birthday on March 31. Since seeing Ryan’s story, Hartson . has taken Ryan on as his ‘adopted son’ according to Mr Smith, and even . changed his Twitter picture to the pair of them together and asked his . 205,000 followers to support the teen. Mr Smith added: ‘John Hartson has been magnificent with Ryan and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him. Ryan was in a coma for four months before he finally woke up in November. He is now going through intensive rehabilitation before he goes home in two months . Ryan is being supported by former footballer John Hartson who has taken him on as an 'adopted son' ‘He has been tweeting and supporting online, he has literally taken on Ryan as his “adopted son” it has been great. ‘When someone that famous helps you out it really gets people behind the cause and makes more people aware. ‘By him doing all of this for us, which he didn’t have to, he wanted to, it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant.’","Ryan Smith, 17, was knocked off his bike on July 22, 2013 .

These century-old photographs show before, . during and after pictures of the groundbreaking medical procedure . carried out on the disfigured sailor nearly 100 years ago, . Mr Yeo sustained terrible facial injuries including the loss of upper and lower eyelids while manning the guns aboard HMS Warspite in 1916. Remarkable recovery:  Sailor Walter Yeo was horrifically wounded during World War One (left). He became the first person in history to undergo plastic surgery (right). Researchers are now trying to find our how successful the surgery was from any surviving relatives Mr Yeo may have . The first stage of the skin graft from Mr Yeo's neck . But in 1917 he was treated by Sir Harold Gillies - the first man to use skin grafts from undamaged areas on the body and known as ‘the father of plastic surgery’. His remarkable transformation . features an upcoming exhibition at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum . which will explore the pioneering efforts to repair the lives of WW1 . veterans through plastic surgery. Researchers . working on the '1914FACES2014' project for this year’s World War One centenary have appealed for information from any of Mr Yeo’s surviving . relatives. They . want to to find out how successful the pioneering op proved to be and . trace others whose shattered features were rebuilt by Gillies and his . colleagues. Marjorie . Gehrhardt, associate researcher with Exeter University’s college of . humanities, said: 'I am trying to find out how the wounded sailors and . soldiers - and also their families and the people they met every day out . on the streets - coped with these very visible injuries. “It would be wonderful to hear from people who knew the wounded combatants directly or indirectly. 'If . they have memories or anecdotes they are happy to share, photographs of . the men before or after their injuries, letters, family portraits or . memoirs, everything can help us learn more about how veterans lived . after the war, and how society at large coped with their return.' London-based . Sir Harold opened a specialist ward for the treatment of the . facially-wounded at Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup, Kent. Mr Yeo suffered terrible facial injuries, including the loss of upper and lower eyelids . He later had a skin graft taken from his neck . Mr Yeo was born in 1890 and after marrying wife Ada, he was severely injured during the Battle of Jutland while manning guns. Records show he was admitted to Sir . Harold's care on August 8, 1917 - just two months after he opened . his specialist hospital. He . is thought to be the first patient to benefit from his newly-developed . technique, a form of skin grafting called ‘tubed pedical’. The young sailor, of Plymouth, Devon, was given new eyelids with a ‘mask’ of skin grafted across his face and eyes. He was treated by Sir Harold Gillies, who used tubular ‘pedicles’ from the forehead, scalp, chest, neck or shoulders but retained a connection to allow blood flow . Documents show that after the procedure, Mr Yeo, a gunnery warrant officer, was ‘improved, but still had severe disfigurement’. Sir Harold is credited with developing new, untried techniques to treat the injuries created by this new kind of war, taking grafts from undamaged areas of flesh. He used tubular ‘pedicles’ from the forehead, scalp, chest, neck or shoulders but retained a connection to allow blood flow. He and his colleagues developed many techniques of plastic surgery and carried out more than 11,000 operations on over 5,000 men.","Walter Yeo became the first person in history to have modern plastic surgery .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Angkor in Cambodia is one of the most significant archaeological sites in southeast Asia and home to the magnificent remains of the Angkor Wat and Bayon temples, as well as their elaborate bas-reliefs. Armchair tourists can now explore these . remains using more than 90,000 panoramic images captured as part of Google's latest Cultural Institute project. Google said the images 'let people experience the scale and beauty of Angkor wherever they are', but also demonstrate how technology can change the way cultural treasures are preserved for future generations. Armchair tourists can now explore the remains of Angkor Wat and Bayon temples, pictured, in modern-day Angkor including the elaborate bas-reliefs, iconic towers and decorated terraces. Google captured more than 90,000 panoramic images as part of its latest Cultural Institute project in Cambodia . 'The temples at Angkor each have a unique story - whether it’s the way they were built, the ancient Khmer cities they sit on, or the artwork they contain,’ explained Manik Gupta, group product manager at Google Maps. 'To give you the most complete picture, our team used all the tools available to us: Street View cars, Trekkers and tripods to carefully photograph the exteriors and interiors of Angkor’s temples as they stand today. Angkor Wat lies 3.4 miles (5.5km) north of the town of Siem Reap in Cambodia. The region contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries. At the beginning of the 9th century the two states that covered the territory of modern Cambodia were united by Jayavarman II. The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway it actually consists of a series of elevated towers, covered galleries, chambers, porches and courtyards on different levels connected by stairs. The galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels, while the third level supports five towers  - one in each corner, pictured, and one in the centre . The guardian monkey statues, pictured, sit at the Banteay Srei temple in Angkor and the whole temple is in the process of being restored. Anastylosis restoration, which involves reassembling structures based on their original materials and positions, was first used at Banteay Srei in the 1930s. The work continues today through a joint venture between the Swiss and Cambodian governments. Though vandalism and pilfering have taken their toll, the temple is one of the best preserved sites in Angkor . Carvings at Angkor Wat's central sanctuary's west entrance, pictured, depict a duel between monkey brothers Valin and Sugriva from the Hindu tale Ramayana. Wat is the Khmer name for temple. It was built as a Hindu place of worship but in 1432 the capital moved to Phnom Penh and Angkor Wat was maintained by Buddhist monks . He laid the foundations of what became the Khmer Empire, which was a major power in southeast Asia for five centuries, and established two cities. The first was built with temples in its centre at Roluos, alongside the Bakong and Preah Ko temples - all constructed around 880AD. The second capital at Yasodharapura, modern-day Angkor, was built in the 960s, with the state temple of Pre Rup. The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Wat is the Khmer word for temple. It was built as a Hindu place of worship but in 1432, when the capital moved to Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat was maintained by Buddhist monks. The outer gallery of the temple contains bas-reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft (600m), inlcluding the Ramayana gallery in the western section of the temple and this gallery in the east. The Churning of the Ocean of Milk, pictured, is the most famous of Angkor Wat's bas reliefs. In it, gods and demons stir up the Ocean of Milk to retrieve the treasures within, including the elixir of immortality .

At the beginning of the 9th century the two states that covered the territory of modern Cambodia were united by Jayavarman II. He laid the foundations of what became the Khmer Empire, which was a major power in southeast Asia for five centuries . The Terrace of the Elephants, pictured, was constructed for King Jayavarman VII as a viewing platform for public ceremonies and military processions. Its walls are sculpted with parading elephants and huge mythical birds and lions . An eight-armed statue of Vishnu, pictured, carved from a single block of sandstone is located in the right-side tower at the western entrance . Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway, it actually consists of a series of elevated towers and covered galleries on different levels connected by stairs. The galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels, while the third level supports five towers - one in each corner, and one in the centre. Each tower features graduated tiers that create a cone shape, and the highest tower within the temple complex is 699ft (213m). The outer gallery of the temple contains bas-reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft (600m), including the Ramayana gallery in the western section. It is thought Angkor Wat was built as funerary temple for King Suryavarman II facing the west towards the setting sun – a symbol for death. The bas-reliefs were designed to be viewed from left to right in the order of a Hindu funeral ritual, and this supports the funerary claims. Angkor Wat is said to be a ‘miniature replica of the universe in stone’ and represents an earthly model of the cosmic world. The central tower was built to symbolise the mythical mountain of Meru, for example, at the centre of the universe, while the five towers correspond to the peaks of Meru. The outer wall is said to correspond to the mountains at the edge of the world, and the moat is symbolic of the oceans. Meanwhile, the Bayon is a Khmer temple built in the late 12th century as the official state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII. The temple stands at the centre of Jayavarman's capital, Angkor Thom. It consists of stone faces and towers built from upper terraces. These towers are built surrounding its centre and have two bas-reliefs that feature a mix of mythological, historical, and everyday scenes. Other images within Google's latest collection include monkey statues that sit in Banteay Srei - a 10th century Cambodian temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Different guardian figures, usually of a human body with an animal head, protect the six stairways leading up to the sanctuaries. The monkey-headed statues are replicas and were created when the originals were moved to the National Museum in Phnom Penh.","Over 90,000 panoramic images were captured as part of Google's latest Cultural Institute project in Cambodia .

"By . Rupert Steiner . A high street chain is testing an electronic price tag that alters the price of an item based on the profile of the customer. B&Q wants to use the technology to reward loyal shoppers with discounts and offers. The new Wi-Fi-enabled price tags will be put on the edge of shelves and will identify customers through a chip in their mobile phone. Brand loyalty: Home improvement store B&Q want to use the electronic price tags to reward loyal customer or to drop the prices at off-peak times . The high-tech system would then use data stored either from loyalty cards or spending habits to work out a price, which would be displayed next to the goods as the customer walks past. Some will see the innovation as an extension of the vouchers they receive at the checkout. But others may worry it is the start of a two-tier pricing system that favours the rich at the expense of the poor. Ian Cheshire, chief executive of B&Q owner Kingfisher said: ‘We have done various behind-the-scenes tests. It’s all about special offers for individuals where we are looking at bundling offers or giving discounts.’ The firm has installed electronic price tags in its French chain of Castorama stores and is now looking to introduce them in the UK.

"By . Emma Innes . A little boy who completed his bucked list by meeting Gary Barlow and receiving a video message from Dr Who star Matt Smith has died. Identical twin Jack Robinson, four, from Denmead, Hampshire, died of a brain tumour today. Jack had a day his family will never forget when the Take That singer Gary Barlow visited him in hospital in February. Jack Robinson died of a brain tumour after completing his bucket list which included meeting Gary Barlow . Jack (pictured in January) was diagnosed with a brain tumour in January and surgeons tried to remove it but they could not take all of it out so his parents were told it was not curable . Jack also received a comical personal video message from former Dr Who actor Matt Smith, had an early Christmas and birthday party and rode in a fire engine. The youngster was given only a five per cent chance of survival after surgery to attempt to remove the tumour. So his heartbroken parents Marie, 41, and Terence, 47, along with sisters Danielle, 21, Christina, 18, Natalie, 14, and identical twin Liam, worked hard to make all his final wishes come true. Post office supervisor Marie posted on his Facebook page ‘Jack’s Journey’: ‘I am totally speechless, my baby has gone but all I can do is cry. 'We will give my baby an almighty send off, the funeral of all funerals, he deserves the best.’ His sister Natalie added: ‘I just want . to say a massive thank you to my mum and my dad you made Jack’s months . happy and cheerful and he wouldn’t of wanted it no other way you two did . so much and none of us could thank you enough. Dr Who star Matt Smith sent Jack a personalised video message before he died . ‘Jack was an amazing little man, and everyone knows it. As you would say mum he is famous like Gary Barlow. 'But my main point is you two did so much for my brother and even if he was having a bad day you would have got a smile on his face. Well at least he is in peace.’ His other sister, Christina, wrote: ‘Rest in peace . Jackster, your time has come. 'You fought so well but you could not win! I . will miss you every day and love you so much, I will cherish every . moment I had with you, fly high jack.’ Jack (pictured with his identical twin brother, Liam) also rode in a fire engine before he died . Jack was rushed to hospital in January after he became extremely sleepy and one of his pupils enlarged abnormally. A CT scan revealed a tumour. He underwent a five hour operation to drain fluid from his brain and surgeons removed 40 per cent of the tumour. Following six agonising days of waiting, specialists concluded the rest of his tumour was inoperable. He had chemotherapy and radiotherapy but doctors were unable to save him. Friends and family rallied together and organised fundraisers to raise money to pay for his wishes to be granted. Jack's mother, Marie, said: 'I am totally speechless, my baby has gone but all I can do is cry, we will give my baby an almighty send off, the funeral of all funerals, he deserves the best.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Plenty of ancient animals that roamed the earth after dinosaurs became extinct look rather strange to our modern eyes. And a newly-discovered ancestor of the cow, which looks a little bit like a super-sized guinea pig with a quiff hairstyle, has been unearthed in China. Two fossilised skulls of the bizarre bovid . were discovered in Hezheng in Gansu Province, where a number of fossils . of ancient mammals between 23 million and 2.5 million years old have been . unearthed since the 1970s. Bizarre bovid: A newly-discovered ancestor of the cow, which looks a little bit like a super-sized guinea pig with a quiff hairstyle, has been unearthed in China (illustrated) Dr Shi Qinqin, of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing described the new species, called Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, in the journal of Science China. The genus has been discovered only once before, 70 years ago, in northwest China and the new discovery sheds light on the skull morphology of the group of species. Tsaidamotherium was a mid-sized late Miocene bovid living between 11 million and five million years ago. It’s most unique feature is a ‘horn-core’ apparatus that has only been seen in this area of China. It was first observed by palaeontologists in the 1930s when two bovid cranial fragments with the strange features were spotted among deposits in the Qaidam basin. The only ancient bovid in the basin: The sole example of the new species, Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, is a skull with the horn-core apparatus (pictured) that was collected in the Linxia Basin close to the village of Yancanping, as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn . The ‘absolutely exclusive horn-core apparatus’ of the skulls were deemed so strange they were assigned to a new genus and species in 1935. The sole example of the new species, Tsaidamotherium brevirostrum, is a fragment of skull with the horn-core apparatus that was collected in the Linxia Basin close to the village of Yancanping, as well as a practically full skull of a female with a broken horn. The creature has a short snout and a high nasal cavity, perhaps suited to living at high altitudes, analysis of the skeleton revealed. Although Tsaidamotherium fossils are ‘extremely scarce’ the area in which more could be found is large in the northern part of the Tibetan plateau and could stretch much further afield. No relative but a good lookalike: Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) which are native to South America bear some resemblance to the 'face' of the newly discovered ancient species, although they are not related as the capybara is the largest rodent in the world .","Two fossilised skulls of the bizarre bovid .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Dressing more casually in the office may be frowned upon in many workplaces, but it could actually be helping to tackle climate change. Researchers from Lancaster University found that as more people wear hoodies, jeans and warmer clothes, offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels they used to be. By reducing office temperatures, it will reduce the amount of energy that is wasted, and have a positive effect on CO2 emissions, and ultimately, global climates. Researchers claim workplaces are too warm. Office temperatures are designed for people wearing suits but as fewer people wear suits, and dress more casually in jeans and hoodies, stock image pictured, offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels. Reducing temperatures will help tackle climate change . Most people expect normal room . temperature to be about 22°C and around half the . energy used in buildings is used to maintain this temperature. This temperature comes from Professor Povl Ole Fanger's thermal comfort equation from 1970. Professor Fanger, . a Danish engineer, developed a method for working out how much heating . and cooling would be required to keep people 'comfortable' within . buildings. To come to this . conclusion, Fanger made assumptions about what people wore. Fanger's equation refers to a unit called the 'Clo', first developed in 1941. The . Clo represents the insulation value of clothing and a man's lightweight business suit, for example, is the . equivalent to one Clo. ‘Standard . room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default, buildings . are designed for people wearing suits,’ said Professor Elizabeth Shove. The DEMAND Research Centre, based at the university, said people should be adjusting their dress codes both at work and at home, rather than the dials on their heating systems, to combat rising global temperatures. Currently, heating and cooling systems in the office and at home are designed to provide 'comfortable' conditions for people wearing lightweight clothing, such as suits. As more people wear casual, thicker clothing, these buildings need less energy. ‘There is no doubt that the move away from formal office wear towards jeans, hoodies and more casual clothes is reducing the need for workplaces to be heated to the same degree,’ said Professor Elizabeth Shove from the research centre. ‘And in hot climates, why not change dress codes rather than cooling buildings to counter the effect of wearing a suit and tie? These are not entirely fanciful questions.’ She added: ‘Most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22°C, but very few know why this is the case. That figure is neither natural, nor inevitable, but is hugely important. Most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22°C, stock image of a heater pictured, and almost half the energy used in buildings is used to maintain this temperature. Researchers said much less energy would be needed if room temperatures swung with the seasons, and if people adjusted their clothing to suit . ‘Around half the energy used in buildings is used to keep them at this temperature, all over the world; whatever the weather outside.’ This temperature comes from Professor Povl Ole Fanger's thermal comfort equation from 1970. Professor Fanger, a Danish engineer, developed a method for working out how much heating and cooling would be required to keep people 'comfortable' within buildings. Professor Povl Ole Fanger, pictured, devised the thermal comfort equation in the 1970s, by assuming what people wore at work . To come to this conclusion, Fanger - as well as heating engineers and architects ever since – made assumptions about what people wear. Fanger's equation refers to a unit called the 'Clo', first developed in 1941. The Clo represents the insulation value of clothing and a man's lightweight business suit, for example, is the equivalent to one Clo. ‘Standard room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default, buildings are designed for people wearing suits,’ continued Professor Shove. ‘Many other standards follow; electronic technologies are typically designed to work best at 22°C. ‘Such devices are prone to fail if they overheat and this is especially important in justifying the spread of air conditioning where none existed before. ‘As more and more buildings are designed to provide 22°C, this becomes the norm. It becomes what people expect and when that happens, anything other than 22°C begins to seem uncomfortable. ‘From an environmental point of view and on a global scale, the massive energy demand that ensues is unsustainable. ‘Much less energy would be needed, if room temperatures swung with the seasons and if people adjusted their clothing - and their daily routines - to suit. In 2005, the Japanese government refused to heat or cool public buildings between 20°C and 28°C as part of its Cool Biz programme. ‘As the Cool Biz initiative demonstrates, room temperature can be redefined,’ said Professor Shove. ‘Looking forward, there is no reason to suppose that standards, which are normal, now, will remain so in the future.’","Lancaster University claims homes and workplaces are too warm .

"By . Mark Prigg . Psychology and security experts are trying to identify 'superpredictors' among the American population who can predict world events better than security experts.. The 'Good Judgement Project' has already enrolled over 3,000 people, who are asked their opinion on a range of events and to forecast outcomes. Experts say they have been 'surprised' by how accurate the predictions are - even though many of the participants admit they just use Google. Participants have been asked to predict the outcomes of a number of world events. here, including Egyptian soldiers with a tank are seen deployed next to the Presidential Palace in Cairo, Egypt. Users sign up online via the GJP web site . The site accepts any application, but say: 'Requirements for participation include the following: . 'A baccalaureate, bachelors, or undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university is helpful, but those without such a degree and those with more advanced degrees are welcome. 'The primary requirement is a curiosity about how well you make predictions about world events â€“ and an interest in exploring techniques for improvement.' If accepted, they are regularly asked to try and predict a range of events ranging from political visits to potential invasions. Predictions are entered online . Users then compete in prediction tournaments . Those found to be 'superpredictors' can be moved to special teams . Elaine Rich of Maryland has been taking part in the project, and believes the fact participants are under no pressure is the key. 'I'm just a pharmacist,' she told NPR. 'Nobody cares about me, nobody knows my name, I don't have a professional reputation at stake. 'And it's this anonymity which actually gives me freedom to make true forecasts.' According to one report quoted by NPR, the predictions made by the Good Judgment Project are often better even than intelligence analysts with access to classified information, and many of the people involved in the project have been astonished by its success at making accurate predictions. One participant even admitted 'I usually just do a Google search' to make predictions. The project is even believed to have a special team with superforecasters whose predictions are reportedly 30 percent better than intelligence officers with access to actual classified information. The Good Judgment research team is based in the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California Berkeley. It has been running for three years, but is still recruiting new members. The project is led by psychologists Philip Tetlock, author of the award-winning Expert Political Judgment, Barbara Mellers, an expert on judgment and decision-making, and Don Moore, an expert on overconfidence. Participants are asked to comment on a range of areas, including economic indicators . The site says: 'We will post new forecasting questions about every one to two weeks, each requiring a separate prediction, such as 'Will any country in the Euro zone default on bonds in 2014?' or 'Which party will win the most seats in the next parliamentary election in Egypt?'.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Dogs with OCD often over-groom, suck blankets jump repeatedly (pictured) and chase their own tails obsessively . Dogs have many medical conditions in common with humans and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of them. Canines with the condition often over-groom, suck blankets and chase their own tails obsessively. And while humans with OCD may not share the same repetitive behaviours as dogs, scientists believe that genes causing diseases or medical conditions in dogs may also be responsible for same conditions in humans. Helene Bäckman, the owner of a German shepherd called Texas, noticed that as a pup the dog started to jump up and bite the air repeatedly. ‘It’s like he sees something. He jumps and when he's biting, he bites hard. You can hear his teeth against each other,’ she told the BBC. 'He can do this for hours and he gets more and more stressed when he´s doing it. He never rests between jumps,' she added. Texas’ repetitive behaviour, which includes ‘fly-catching,’ where dogs snap at thin air as if they are catching flies, was diagnosed as OCD. Scientists think that dogs having medical conditions in common with humans meaning that they are one of the most important models for human hereditary diseases and by studying them, researchers could come up with new ways to treat human sufferers. Professor Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, of Uppsala University in Sweden and the Broad Institute in Massachusetts, explained that it is easier to identify genes in dogs than in people, because humans have been breeding canines with specific characteristics for centuries. Scientists think that dogs having medical conditions in common with humans - such as OCD, which is illustrated by obsessive hand washing -  mean that they are one of the most important models for human hereditary diseases and by studying them, researchers could come up with new ways to treat human sufferers . Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour. Unpleasant thoughts or urges can enter a person's mind and cause them anxiety, NHS Choices said. A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to prevent an obsession coming true - for example, someone who is obsessively scared they will catch a disease might feel the need to wash their hands repeatedly. OCD symptoms can range from mild to severe. For example, some people with OCD may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive-compulsive thinking and behaviour and for others, the condition can completely take over their life. A number of factors are thought to trigger OCD. Evidence suggests that in some cases the condition may run in families and is linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development. This means that disease–carrying genes are widespread in certain breeds and that they are similar genetically. ‘In . dogs we can find [disease-causing] genes with only a few hundred sick . and healthy dogs, whereas in people thousands of patients and controls . are needed,’ she said. In 2005 her team identified the genetic sequence for a female boxer dog and together with other researchers, they have found that the sequence is quite similar to humans so that genes responsible for diseases in dogs, might also cause the same conditions in humans. In a recent study in the journal Genome Biology, the scientists identified four genes that are associated with OCD in dogs and they are trying to work out if the same genes are involved in the human condition too. Professor Lindblad-Toh said: ‘Since the disease symptoms and medications used in dogs and people are similar, we expect that the same genes or other genes with similar functions will be responsible for the disease also in humans.’ Dogs are also susceptible to other human conditions, including epilepsy, narcolepsy, cancer, retinal degeneration and haemophilia. The identification of the genes responsible for narcolepsy in canines has enabled scientists to find an unknown pathway in the brain and another study has led to the development of a new gene . therapy for haemophilia. Helene Bäckman, the owner of a German shepherd called Texas, (a stock image of the dog breed is pictured) noticed that as a pup the dog started to jump up and bite the air repeatedly. Texas was later diagnosed with having OCD . Genetics researchers from the University of Helsinki examined OCD among 400 dogs in 2013. Breeds such as bull terriers and German shepherds (like Texas) were particularly prone to chasing their tails, which led the researchers to believe genetics plays a role. But then they noticed other connections. Dogs which were fed nutritional supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails, which suggested diet also figures in OCD. Dogs that were separated particularly early from their mother or had poor care from their mother also exhibited OCD-style signs of behaviour. However the researchers found that a lack of exercise did not make any difference with tail-chasing. The study found that dogs that were fed nutritional . supplements like vitamins were less likely to chase their own tails (illustrated), . which suggests diet figures in OCD . Researcher Katriina Tiira said: ‘Tail-chasing in dogs can be used as an animal model for studying the genetic background of OCD in humans.’ Compulsive tail chasing occurs in several dog breeds, but worldwide it is most common in breeds such as Bull Terriers and German Shepherds. The aim of the study was to describe the characteristics of tail chasing in dogs, to identify possible environmental risk factors and to find out whether a previously discovered gene region associated with compulsive behaviour is also linked to tail chasing. Blood samples were taken from the dogs participating in the study, and their owners filled out a questionnaire about their dogs' stereotypical behaviour. One of the most interesting findings of this study was the connection with behaviour and vitamins and minerals. Dogs that received nutritional supplements, especially vitamins and minerals, with their food, chased their tails less. ‘Our study does not prove an actual causal relationship between vitamins and lessened tail chasing, but interestingly similar preliminary results have been observed in human OCD’ said Dr Tiira. Scientists are looking at how certain vitamins and minerals in a human diet could help OCD sufferers.","Swedish researchers believe that genes responsible for diseases in dogs might cause the same conditions in humans .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Misunderstood? William the Conqueror's reputation might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding, a historian claims . He is known as a terrifying warrior and ruthless monarch who conquered the Saxon kingdom of England. But William the Conqueror’s fearsome reputation as a murderous tyrant might be unwarranted and borne out of a basic accountancy misunderstanding. One historian claims that the problem lies with the definition of the word ‘waste’ in the Domesday Book, which has been misinterpreted and used to tarnish the warrior king’s reputation. ‘In the winter of 1089, William gathered his troops for what would become known as the ""Harrying of the North"",’ said Dr Rob Wright, a historian at the Place charity in York. ‘Having already swept away the Anglo-Saxon nobility in the South, they hoped to do the same in the rebellious North and the theory goes that they arrived in Yorkshire with just one thing on their minds - mass destruction. ‘By the time they left a few months later, we have been left with a picture of an entire county devastated. ‘There's no doubt the Normans were a fearsome lot, but to blame them for reducing Yorkshire to a wasteland is wide of the mark. Dr Wright explained that much of what we know about the episode in Yorkshire comes from the Domesday Book of 1086. Compilers of the Domesday Book (pictured) have written 'waste' next to many of the Yorkshire landholdings and this had led historians to believe that the land was destroyed. However, Dr Wright claims this couldn't have been the case and that 'waste' simply meant the specific lands could not be taxed . William I was the first Norman king of England who reigned from 1066 until his death in 1087. He famously defeated king Harold at the Battle of Hastings, as depicted in the Bayeux tapestry. William's final years as king were threatened by rebellions including the invasion of England by the Danes, which led him to respond with violence. In 1086, William ordered the compilation of the Domesday Book, which was a survey of landowners in England as well as their holdings. His reign in England is marked by many castles and the settling of new Norman nobility on the land. In the famous book, which records the . great land survey of much of England and parts of Wales undertaken so the crown could collect taxes, compilers have . written ‘waste’ next to many of the Yorkshire landholdings and this had . led historians to believe that the land was destroyed. ‘However, it's actually much more likely that it means the compilers couldn't put a value on the holding,’ Dr Wright said. He explained that at the time, estates were merged and divided up again so that trying to trace the owner to collect taxes for the king was very difficult. ‘The entire invading Norman force numbered less than 20,000. In the four months they were here, it would have been logistically impossible for them to ravage such a large area. ‘To have destroyed the number of settlements listed as “waste,” the Normans would have had to pillage all day and all night.’ Another literary source further dented the king’s reputation a few decades later when scholarly monk Simeon of Durham wrote his own account of the conquest. Dr Wright is keen to restore the king's reputation and said that while he crushed a rebellion with force, he also left Yorkshire some of Western Europe's greatest monuments, such as Rievaulx Abbey, near Helmsley (pictured) The Harrying of the North was a series of campaigns by William the Conqueror that started in the winter of 1069 to put down revolts in the north of England. At the time, Sweyn II of Denmark invaded England to support Edgar the Atheling's claim to the throne as the last remaining member of the House of Wessex. Their combined army broke the Norman hold on the north and William responded by putting down the revolt. It is popularly claimed that he systematically set about destroying the countryside and villages of north Yorkshire, after sending the Danes home. It has been said that William slaughtered families and ruined homes, . crops and animals so that thousands of people died in a famine. A popular interpretation of the Domesday Book claims that much of Yorkshire was still a wasteland in 1086 - although this is now disputed. He wrote: ‘It was horrific to behold human corpses decaying in the houses, the streets and the roads, swarming with worms. ‘For no-one was left to bury them in the earth, all being cut off either by the sword or by famine...There was no village inhabited between York and Durham - they became lurking places to wild beasts and robbers.’ Dr Wright believes this account is more fiction than fact and is giving a series of public lectures to restore, or at least improve, the king’s reputation on behalf of the Yorkshire environmental charity, Place, which is based at York St John University. ‘These accounts were written many years after the Harrying of the North and need to be taken with a large pinch of salt,’ he said. ‘For centuries since the Normans have been cast as the villains of the piece and half-truths and suggestions have appeared as fact in encyclopaedias. ‘William did crush a rebellion with force, but we shouldn't forget what the Normans did for us. ‘It was down to them that Yorkshire was left with some of Western Europe's greatest monuments, such as Rievaulx Abbey, near Helmsley.’","William the Conqueror could not have reduced Yorkshire to a wasteland, according to York historian Dr Rob Wright .

The official WhatsApp handle tweeted: ‘New daily record: 20B messages sent (inbound) and 44B messages received (outbound) by our users = 64B messages handled in just 24 hours.’ The figures sent and received differ due to the way the app handles group messages. For example, a message sent to a group is counted as one sent item, but is then counted as received by each individual in that group. By comparison, WhatsApp's daily message traffic this time last year was around 27 billion a day; highlighting a significant increase in traffic.

A bright idea: One Dutch designer is involved in using the bio-luminescent qualities of jellyfish and fireflies to create glow in the dark trees (illustrated) to light up our cities, instead of electric street lamps . Daan Roosegaarde is interested in lighting streets without using electricity and is working with scientists at the State University of New York and a company called Bioglow to create glowing trees.

Alexander Krichevsky, of Bioglow, has already developed the plants by splicing genes from . bioluminescent bacteria with the chloroplast genome from a common pot plant to create 'Starlight Avater'. A project called Glowing Nature is designed to make ‘normal’ tress glow without using genetic modification. It would use a fine coating of ‘biological paint’ to make the trees glow at night. Engineering and design consultancy, Arup, believes the cities of the future will be covered in 'glow-in-the-dark dust' and fed by 'urban farms' growing both on and inside buildings. Spray-on light absorbing dust would give public buildings, roads and pathways a phosphorescent shine at night, helping to improve the safety of parks and alleyways.

Daan Roosegaarde is interested in lighting streets without using electricity and is working with scientists at the State University of New York and a company called Bioglow to bring his vision to life.

It is a genetically-modified version of a regular pot plant called Nicotiana alata and glows continuously during its lifetime. The firm is auctioning the first batch of glowing shrubs and taking pre-orders for further plants that it is currently nurturing. The phenomenon of living organisms glowing in the nature is called bioluminescence. There are over twenty independently evolved bioluminescent mechanisms found in nature as seen in glow worms, bobtail squids, deep-sea anglerfish and bacteria.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Serious sports injuries and disease can damage people's muscles and affect their quality of life. But now there is new hope as scientists have created living muscle that not only functions like the real thing but can heal itself too. The lab-grown tissue, produced from immature pre-cursor cells - which are blood cells not committed to a particular use - was demonstrated in mice. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created living skeletal muscle (pictured) that can heal itself. Here, long, colourful strands of engineered muscle fibre have been stained to allow scientists to observe growth after its implantation into a mouse. Native tissue appears green and engineered tissue red and yellow, because two molecular stains are used. The blue marks are the nuclei of cells that have been stained by another molecule . It is not the first time that muscle has been created, but it is the first time that it has contracted as strongly as native neonatal skeletal muscle. The new muscle contracts powerfully and rapidly, integrates into mice quickly and demonstrates the ability to heal itself in the lab and inside an animal for the first time. Every muscle has satellite cells on reserve, ready to activate upon injury and begin the regeneration process. The key to the team’s success was successfully creating the micro environments called niches, where the stem cells can work effectively. The scientists tested the muscle by stimulating it with electric pulses, deliberately damaging it with a toxin found in snake venom and watching it through a window on the back of a living mouse. They believe the technique is a step towards growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries. But researchers believe it marks a significant step towards growing viable replacement muscle in humans. Unlike previous examples of bioengineered . muscle, the artificially-constructed muscle fibres contract as strongly . as their natural counterparts. Satellite cells - dormant step cells that can be activated by injury to regenerate damaged tissue - were at the heart of the self-repair mechanism. The secret was supplying them with the right environment, the researchers wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ‘Simply implanting satellite cells or less-developed muscle doesn't work as well,’ said Mark Juhas, a graduate student and member of the team from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. This series of images shows the destruction and recovery of the engineered muscle fibres that were exposed to a toxin found in snake venom. The scientists proved for the first time that engineered muscle can repair itself after implantation into a living animal. Here, blue represents damaged muscle . ‘The well-developed muscle we made provides niches for satellite cells to live in and when needed to restore the robust musculature and its function.’ Stimulating the tissue with electric pulses to make it contract showed that the engineered muscle was more than 10 times stronger than any previous lab muscle produced. After damaging muscle with snake venom toxin, the satellite cells stepped in, activating, multiplying and repairing the injured muscle fibres. The scientists watched the muscle integrate and mature in a living animal through small glass windows inserted into the backs of mice. The scientists watched the muscle integrate and mature in a living animal through small glass windows inserted into the backs of mice. These images show the progress of veins slowly growing into the implanted lab grown muscle fibres . A genetic modification causing the muscle fibres to produce fluorescent flashes when they contracted made it possible to observe them growing stronger in real time. The stronger they got, the brighter they flashed. ‘We could see and measure in real time how blood vessels grew into the implanted muscle fibres, maturing toward equalling the strength of its native counterpart,’ said Mr Juhas. Both the lab-grown muscle and experimental techniques are important steps toward growing viable muscle for studying diseases and treating injuries, said Nenad Bursac, associate professor of biomedical engineering at the university.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Air passengers flying in Europe this week may find themselves hindered by industrial action – after one of the world’s biggest airlines announced a strike that could see almost 4,000 flights removed from the schedules. Not going anywhere today: Lufthansa pilots are staging a strike that could run until Friday . Lufthansa, Germany’s biggest airline, . has cancelled almost 900 domestic and international flights today . (Wednesday 2 April) as Germany’s pilots’ union launched a three-day . strike in a wage dispute. The carrier expects to cancel about 3,800 flights if the walk-out continues into Friday. This would affect over 425,000 passengers, airline spokesperson Barbara Schaedler says. Standstill: Whatever your language, the departures board at Frankfurt Airport makes for bleak reading . Lufthansa’s budget subsidiary Germanwings – as well as its cargo division – is also affected by the strike, which the company estimates will cost ‘tens of millions’ of Euros. The pilots’ union Vereinigung Cockpit announced the strike in advance, giving Lufthansa time to prepare by cancelling flights and offering passengers alternative arrangements. Some were rebooked on trains or different airlines, Schaedler says. ‘We sent out more than 200,000 text messages to inform our customers about the upcoming strike, and also increased our capacities at our call centres to help passengers rebook their trips,’ she says. Walk out: Lufthansa pilots stage their protest in Frankfurt (left) - and the knock-on effect in Munich (right) Lufthansa terminals in Frankfurt and Munich – the company’s hubs in Germany – have been mostly empty today. One of the pilots’ main demands is that Lufthansa continues to provide a transition payment for those who want to retire early at 55. The airline wants to cut those payments. The pilots are also asking for a 10 per cent wage increase. Manfred Weiss, a 60-year-old German chef, is unimpressed by the pilots’ demands. ‘They cannot let this happen, this should be forbidden,’ Weiss – arriving home in Berlin from holiday on Lufthansa competitor Air Berlin – says. ‘I also think they have sufficient salaries. You can’t just make the passengers pay for it.’ Parked up, in neutral: The Lufthansa terminal at Frankfurt Airport has been a picture of inactivity today . The carrier has been trying to cut costs in the face of tough competition from European budget carriers and the rising threat from government-owned airlines in the Gulf states. Lufthansa has called for fresh talks on the matter. ‘Our wish is that we start talking again as soon as possible, even during the strike, because I think that we can find a good solution,’ Schaedler adds. Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt has called on Lufthansa and the union to seek a quick resolution for the sake of travellers. ‘Every day of strikes limits the mobility of hundreds of thousands of people,’ he said today in German daily newspaper Bild.","Germany's biggest airline is at a standstill as pilots walk out in pay dispute .

"By . Helen Pow . Search: Police have launched a national manhunt for Adrian Navarro-Canales, pictured, who they claim stabbed to death his mother and younger brother . Police have launched a national manhunt for a Las Vegas teen they claim stabbed to death his mother and younger brother just a day after celebrating his 16th birthday with them. The bodies of Elvira Canales-Gomez and Cesar Navarro were discovered in the bathroom of their Henderson apartment on Friday - three days after detectives believe they were killed. Canales-Gomez still had a butcher's knife lodged in her chest, police said. Adrian Navarro-Canales was nowhere to be found, and police have been searching Nevada and surrounding states as well as the Mexican border for the teen since. Navarro-Canales initially was named by police as a possible victim, then identified Monday as the prime suspect in the slayings. An arrest warrant said he would be prosecuted as an adult. Henderson police investigators think the killings happened Tuesday, but the bodies weren't discovered until Friday — the fourth time a relative and the mother's boyfriend called to say they were worried about whether he, Elvira Canales-Gomez and Cesar Navarro were OK. Henderson police spokesman Keith Paul said officers 'found no cause to break in' during the first three visits. 'On Friday, we had family members saying they tried several times to contact (Canales-Gomez) and couldn't reach her,' he said. A Henderson police officer fetched a key from property managers and was hit as he entered the apartment by the pungent smell of decomposing bodies, the police report said. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Elvira Canales-Gomez, pictured front with Navarro-Canales, and younger son Cesar Navarro, left, were discovered stabbed to death in the bathroom of their Henderson apartment on Friday - three days after detectives believe they were killed . Happier times: Navarro-Canales, pictured center, initially was named by police as a possible victim, then identified last week as the prime suspect in the slayings of his mother, right, and brother, left . The mom was found dead on the bathroom floor with multiple stab wounds and Cesar, 9, was found in the bathtub. He had been stabbed once. Adrian Navarro-Canales — who celebrated his 16th birthday on September 16 with his mother, brother and mother's boyfriend at the apartment — was no longer at the home. Paul said investigators think Navarro-Canales acted alone, and authorities didn't know Tuesday where he was. Despite being a minor, Navarro-Canales has been named because of the seriousness of the crime and the ensuing manhunt for him. 'We're still searching,' Paul said. 'We are doing everything possible to find him.' The police spokesman said Navarro-Canales' name had been entered in a national crime database and authorities on the Mexico border were notified. Crime scene: Henderson police investigators entered the home, pictured, on Friday - after relatives had asked them to check on the family's welfare four times . Sad end: The mom was found dead on the bathroom floor of the apartment, pictured, with multiple stab wounds and a butcher knife in her chest. Cesar, 9, was found in the bathtub. He had been stabbed once . The police report said the teen's . passport and border documents were found in the apartment in the quiet . complex off Eastern Avenue and Sunridge Heights Parkway. The mother's . vehicle was found parked outside. Police went to the apartment Wednesday afternoon and twice on Thursday — after calls from Canales-Gomez's boyfriend, Carlos Rubio-Villanueva, and the niece, 23-year-old Ana Martinez. Paul said officers found the front door locked and windows secure. According to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez drove home from work about 3:40 p.m., and Cesar was last seen at school. Caught: Police arrested 16-year-old Navarro-Canales, left, last week. He is seen here with his mother, Elvira, and his brother, Cesar . Killed: According to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez, pictured, drove home from work about 3:40 p.m. Police said Navarro-Canales might have stayed in the apartment at least one night before fleeing.Rubio-Villanueva told investigators he noticed a kitchen light was off when he visited the apartment late September 17; when he stopped on his way to work Wednesday afternoon and summoned Henderson police to the apartment; and off again when he checked after work shortly before midnight Wednesday. Police said it appeared Navarro-Canales texted his father on Wednesday, telling him the others were fine and couldn't talk because they were asleep. The teen's father, Adrian Navarro Soto-Mayor, flew Friday from San Jose, California, to Las Vegas and issued a weekend plea in Spanish for his son to contact him or other family members. Martinez later told police she thought her cousin might have returned at least once to the apartment after the bodies were taken away on Friday.","Police have launched a national manhunt for Adrian Navarro-Canales who they believe killed his family on Tuesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . During its time in service this cargo ship played host to illustrious guests such as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. From the time it was built in 1924, the boat was also used to transport coal and iron ore across the American lakes. After being decommissioned in 1981 it was left to rust for four years before the front part of the ship was removed, sailed to Lake Erie, and perched on top of an 18 foot cliff to serve as a holiday home. Scroll down for video . The Benson Ford was originally a cargo ship for the Ford motor company, but has been converted into a holiday home hanging above Lake Erie . Looking over the bow, which dangles 18 foot above the Lake, it still looks as if the boat is sailing . The ship still contains wood paneled state rooms, dining room and lounge designed by Henry Ford . The boat was used by Ford himself to travel across the American Lakes and Thomas Edison also took a ride . The four-deck, 7,000 square foot getaway is made out of the ship's forecastle and includes the walnut paneled state rooms, dining room, . galley, and passenger lounge designed by Henry Ford for his own personal . use while on board. The ship-house was originally owned by Frank J Sullivan, but after trying and failing to turn it into a hotel in 1992, Sullivan eventually auctioned the building to father and son Jerry and Bryan Kaspar, who still like to relax there while taking time off work.However it has been modernised with a garage, a game room, bar, state-of-the-art kitchen and four bathrooms. Don't look down: Tourists may need a head for heights if they take a tour out onto the bow of the boat . The four-storey, 7,000sq ft home has kept the historic interior and updated it with some modern technology . Along with the original features the ship's forecastle now has a garage, kitchen, bar and games room .

Tourists are also able to take guided walks around the vessel which hangs 18 feet above the surface of Lake Erie. Bryan Kaspar said: 'Everyone that sees it is intrigued to look inside and I think everyone that looks inside is amazed at the woodwork throughout the ship. 'Also from the bow it almost feels like you are on the water because of its close proximity to Lake Erie. Frank J Sullivan, who first converted the vessel, tried to turn it into a hotel in 1992 but was denied permission . Sullivan sold it to father and son Jerry and Bryan Kaspar in 1999 who now allow guided tours around the house . The impressive getaway includes five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a captain's office and living room with panoramic views out across the Lake . 'I love the deck on the fourth floor - It's a great place to enjoy a cocktail overlooking the lake and the nearby cliffs and watching the sunset is amazing from there.' Videographer Nick James, who conducts tours of the hotel, said: 'The most incredible part is standing at the helm and the way the boat hangs over the cliff it actually feels like you are out on the open water. 'I love the history that is still all around in the Benson Ford. In the parlour you can just imagine Thomas Edison and Henry Ford sitting smoking their cigars.

"By . Sara Malm . A fourth book in the Millennium series will be published in 2015, despite author Stieg Larsson passing away nine years ago. The book will see a new writer taking on Larsson’s mantle to continue the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist and his sidekick Lisbet Salander - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. The Millennium trilogy was published posthumously and became a . world-wide success which made it onto the silver screen twice, both in . Sweden and Hollywood. The Girl Who Sold Out? Swedish publishers Nordstedt has announced that there will be a fourth book in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series which saw its heroine translated onto the screen by Noomi Rapace in 2008 . Publishers Nordstedt have chosen an . author for book four and is planning on releasing it in 2015, on the . tenth anniversary of the first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. ‘There will be a new novel. We have thought about it for a while,’ publishing manager Eva Gedin told Aftonbladet. All . three books in the Millennium series were published after Stieg . Larsson’s death and he never got to experience the immense success of . his work, which was turned into a Hollywood film in 2011 with Bond-actor . Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Eva Gabrielsson, Stieg Larsson's partner of 32 years, was shocked to find out about the new book. 'I think it is a bit greedy. It's already a billion-pound industry,' she told Aftonbladet. 'It is distasteful to try to make more money.' The Man With The Golden Pen: Stieg Larsson died in 2004 after suffering a heart attack walking up seven flights of stairs to his office and never saw his work published . The Millennium trilogy was published posthumously and quickly became a bestseller in Europe and the U.S. The Girl With The Actual Book: Eva Gabrielsson, Stieg Larsson's partner of 32 years, has hit back at the new book calling the publishers 'greedy' and maintain she still has Stieg's original script for a fourth book - which will not be part of the new release . Eva has previously confirmed that she . has the laptop which contains the first half of a fourth book, written . by Stieg Larsson before his death. However, . she says publishers Nordstedt have not had access to the original . script and will have to start from scratch with a new book. Ms . Gabrielsson and Stieg Larsson met as teenagers in their home town of . Umea during a protest against the Vietnam war. They were together for . more than three decades but although Stieg proposed in 1983, they never . married. As a result of the nature of his work as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo, Stieg and Eva both received death threats and not registering their partnership was a precaution to ensure their home would be harder to find in official records.

"By . Matt Barlow . For Jose Mourinho, it does not matter if his team summon a thrilling response in Paris in the Champions League or finish the Barclays Premier League campaign with a flourish. His mind is made up. Some of this Chelsea squad do not have the ‘personality’ required to perform at Stoke, West Bromwich Albion or Crystal Palace, according to a manager who promised to perform ‘surgery’ in the transfer market. After his strikers failed to score in the defeat at Palace on Saturday, Mourinho warned them that a new centre forward would arrive in the summer — Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa is thought to be the top target — and those not ready to compete can go. Surgery: Jose Mourinho has promised to make changes after blasting players without personality . Incoming? Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is widely believed to be Mourinho's top target . Stay or go! Chelsea's existing strikers, including Fernando Torres (C) have been told they can compete or leave . Firing blanks: The future of strikers Demba Ba (left) and Samuel Eto'o (right) also lays in the balance . ‘It is clear to everybody that Chelsea next year want to bring a striker,’ said Mourinho. ‘What’s the future for the others? The ones who are staying are competing with the striker we are bringing in. ‘It is normal at the end of the season if players who are not playing a lot or players who are not happy and prefer a change will go. That is also part of the market. ‘We want to improve the team and the players and make some surgical movements in the transfer window. It is also clear we want to improve our players. ‘I can’t and I don’t need to improve Ivanovic, Cahill or Terry, but there are others I need to improve. We are doing that step by step. But that’s not enough to be champions.’ Dream is over? John Terry's own goal against Crystal Palace condemned Chelsea to their fifth league defeat . Telling off! Mourinho was involved in an altercation with a ballboy over alleged time wasting . This was Palace’s first Premier League . win over Chelsea. Their last league victory over their London rivals was . in August 1990 in the old Division One. The Chelsea manager warned it would make no difference if his team win in France against Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. ‘Paris is the kind of match they feel comfortable to play,’ said Mourinho. ‘It is a big match in a great stadium against opponents of top quality and a referee who stops the game and doesn’t let aggression into the game. I prefer the English ones but normally this is the profile of referee in UEFA competitions. ‘I do not need to do a lot. They will be fine. They will be in their natural habitat in that match. They can do a good match there.’ Big game: Chelsea will not need motivating for their Champions League tie against Zlatan Ibrahimovic's PSG . Giant killers: It is against some of the lesser teams, including Stoke that Chelsea have struggled this season . As for the final six games of the season, he added: ‘The easiest thing to do is to perform when you are not playing for something big. If, in the last part of the season, we have an unbelievable performance and some player is going to perform in a beautiful way, that’s easy. ‘The difficult thing is to perform when you feel the heat. Because of that some are big and some are not so big.’ It will merely prove the manager’s point if his team react in Paris. He has written off the Barclays  Premier League title and believes Chelsea must add the fighting spirit they generated when he won the title in 2005 and 2006. Not in the bag! Chelsea have also twice dropped points to the likes of West Brom this season . Warriors: Chelsea's title winning sides of 2005 and 2006 arguably had more fighting spirit . After Saturday’s defeat at Crystal Palace, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta slumped on to the turf, dejected. John Terry looked distraught after heading in the own goal which settled the game. ‘It feels like the end, that it is over,’ said Cahill. ‘It is massively disappointing and at the end of the game, it was a horrible feeling.’ Mourinho marched on to the pitch, making a beeline for Cahill and hauled him up, put an arm around him and told him to leave with his head held high. ‘I told him he was one of the guys who should not be on the floor,’ said Mourinho. ‘I told him he was one of the guys who should walk to the dressing room with pride, that he had another performance where he gave absolutely everything. Support act: Mourinho picks a dejected Gary Cahill off the floor after Chelsea's title hopes were dashed . Die hard fan: Mourinho insists he has no problem with players like Cahill who give everything to win . ‘I don’t think it’s down to courage. It’s down to the qualities that make personality profiles. You have some players for everything and other players who are in their habitat in some circumstances. ‘So, Stamford Bridge is better than away. Playing away against Arsenal, City, United or Liverpool is one thing and another thing is to play at Crystal Palace, West Bromwich or Stoke City. Clearly, we have players who are up and down in relation to the profile of the match.’ This defeat was Chelsea’s fifth in the League this season. All of them have come away from home against teams outside the top four and — but for the one at Stoke in December — all without scoring a goal. Man in the mask: Ramires will return from domestic suspension to play against PSG in Europe . Despite Mourinho saying he has given up on the title, it remains tight at the top, unlike the last two seasons, when Chelsea trailed 14 points behind the champions last year and 25 points behind in 2012. The Chelsea boss said: ‘To be where we are is an important step and, when you are there, you have in the back of your mind the little feeling that you can still do it, but the reality is different.’ Mourinho does not expect Samuel Eto’o (hamstring) to make the Paris match and Ashley Cole is out with a knee problem. Ramires, banned against Palace, will return but Nemanja Matic and Mohamed Salah are ineligible. Jose Mourinho warned his team to prepare for surgery in the summer after concluding that some simply do not have the personality to compete for the Barclays Premier League title. Who’s for the chop? David LuizHooked after 45 minutes in midfield on Saturday. Mourinho prefers others and knows he can bank more than £30m for the Brazilian. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are interested. Fernando TorresNot scored a Premier League goal since January. Chelsea would accept offers close to £20m. Inter Milan are interested, but do not value him so highly.  Sky-high wages would be a problem too. John Mikel ObiAmong those Mourinho claims will probably want to leave if they are not in the team. Inter also interested in him. Demba BaDistant third among Mourinho’s three strikers this season. There won’t be a shortage of takers for a proven goalscorer. Ashley ColeOut injured and seems unlikely to be encouraged to stay. Mourinho has been using Cesar Azpilicueta at left back this season. Samuel Eto’oEto’o fits the profile of those Mourinho accuses of not turning up for humdrum fixtures ... but can Jose afford to let ALL his strikers go? Romelu LukakuYet to be told where he stands but Mourinho is not keen on his style. Spurs head list of Premier League clubs queueing up to sign him.","Jose Mourinho has warned he will begin a clearout of players after claiming Chelsea are out of the title race .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 25-year-old woman was charged Wednesday with the murder of a California woman who was beaten by a group of people while waiting in line outside a Santa Ana nightclub. Vanesa Tapia Zavala was arrested on Monday and is accused of taking part in the Saturday morning beating that left 23-year-old Annie Hung 'Kim' Pham brain-dead. Zavala, who pleaded not guilty to the murder charge, faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. She was ordered to remain jailed in lieu of $1 million bail and is due back in court January 30th for a pretrial hearing. Scroll down for videos . Charged: Vanesa Tapia Zavala, 25, of Westminster, was charged with one felony count of murder for her alleged role in the death of Kim Pham, according to the Orange County District Attorney¿s Office . Behind bars: Vanesa Tapia Zavala was charged with one felony count of murder for her role in the death of Pham, who was beaten early Saturday morning outside the The Crosby club in downtown Santa Ana. Bail was set at $1 million . Zavala is a woman with only a traffic ticket on her record. Pham was beaten about 12:20 a.m. Saturday outside the Crosby Bar and Nightclub. She was declared brain-dead Sunday, but was kept on life support so her organs could be harvested. She was taken off life support Tuesday and died around midday, police said. Four other suspects - two women and two men - are still at large, police said. Pham was waiting to get into the nightclub with friends when an argument started with another group of club-goers, escalating into a fight, according to police. Killed over a photo? Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and savagely beaten by a group of men and women after a friend said she may have accidentally ruined their picture by walking in front of the camera . Plea: Posters have been put near the crime scene appealing for information about the attackers . Zavala was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones. The . argument that sparked the fight may have started over an accidental . “photobomb,” which refers to when someone messes up a photo being taken. A . friend who wanted to remain anonymous told the LA Times that Pham . accidentally walked into one of the photos being taken by a group of . three women and two men. An argument started between that group and Pham and her friends. Pham was beaten and left unconscious at the sidewalk. Zavala's . attorney, Kenneth Reed, told reporters after his client's arraignment . that she was knocked down during the melee, and he doubted reports that . it was a beat-down. 'I . refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman . stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything,' Reed . said. The lawyer characterized it as 'a melee, a bunch of people . fighting.' Reed says he’s . been contacted by one of the potential suspects – and friends of Pham . who say they’ve spoken with people involved in the incident – said the . violence outside the club was chaotic and involved at least a half-dozen . other people. Zavala lost . her phone in the brawl, and it was recovered later by police, according . to Reed, who said she is 'devastated' by the violence. 'Your . day is fine, your life is fine, you have a 5-year-old son, you go out . one night on a Friday with your boyfriend and then your life is turned . upside down and you find out someone is killed,' Reed said. 'No matter what the situation is, you're going to be devastated.' Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime . A . second attorney, Michael Molfetta, a criminal defense lawyer who said . he’s been contacted by a potential defendant, said “there is a lot more . to this.' 'Nobody deserves . the fate Pham got. But it was not race related or a photo bombing. It . was simply a stupid argument over somebody inadvertently bumping into . somebody else that escalated very, very quickly and very, very . violently.' The charge against Zavala carries a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Patrol officers called to the scene found Pham unconscious on the sidewalk. Police . on Wednesday continued their investigation into what prompted the . deadly assault, which began with an argument among people waiting in . line to get inside the popular nightspot. The . fight that ended with Pham unconscious has drawn national attention as a . short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub . attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd . of about 50 people. In the video, one person is visible crouching to . take another cellphone video. A bouncer from the club appears to try to . intervene, well after the violence began. Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground . Annie . Pham, 23, graduated from Chapman University last year with a psychology . degree and had worked to raise money for breast cancer awareness. Downtown . Inc., a coalition of Santa Ana businesses, offered a $5,000 reward for . information leading to the attackers. The city matched the reward, . bumping it up to $10,000. In her personal blog, titled: ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid . Having In Your Twenties’ on the website Elite Daily, Miss Pham calls on . people her age to stop being fearful. On . the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote: . ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when . we choose to do another. ‘We may even choose to justify it by . announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted . comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out . studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’ She . tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to . the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of . ‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your . time’. On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her . missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours . stalking people online is pointless. ‘We are taught that with photos, . we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is . often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the . most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The . elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on . social media is quite unnecessary.’ She explained that in ‘Fear of . the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to . ourselves is to not take the chance’. Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’ ‘Perhaps . in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe . around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she . concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not . paralyze us from feeling, living and loving. ‘If you are forthright . in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry . about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’ Scene: Investigators swarm the scene after the fight on Saturday morning. Police are looking for four suspects, while one has been arrested .

The deal signed by the eurozone countries still faces huge hurdles, because of simmering tensions between the member states – and growing disenchantment within their own borders. A startling poll last night showed that only a third of French people believed that their country should stay in the euro indefinitely. The situation in Germany was scarcely better with support for staying in the single currency long-term standing at just 41 per cent. Divided: A survey has suggested that only a third of French people and 41 per cent of Germans support staying in the single currency long-term . The figures were revealed in a ComRes survey for CNN last night. It shows how the leaders pressing for closer integration are dangerously out of touch with their own people. The poll was conducted across seven eurozone countries. It also found that only 38 per cent in Greece and 37 per cent in Ireland and Portugal wanted to remain in the euro. The study found that almost half of the French and Germans believe they would be better off outside the euro. Some 42 per cent in both countries said they should never have joined the currency. Just 37 per cent of people in Germany and 35 per cent in France believe their economies are in better shape because they are in the euro. Sorry, didn't see you: Sarkozy eases past Cameron as ministers gathered this morning for further discussions on the Euro crisis . EU leaders stand together after the country signed the European Union accession treaty, which has divided opinion among natives in the respective European countries . In Germany about 40 per cent were . also opposed to the idea of closer European integration as championed by . Angela Merkel. Only 15 per cent thought EU officials could be trusted . to run Germany’s economy. In France, just 20 per cent of people thought . EU officials should be handed sweeping powers over the economy. The . financial markets gave a muted welcome to the new agreement. Italian . bond yields remained close to the critical 7 per cent figure. The . credit rating agency Moody’s reacted by downgrading three major French . banks. Moody’s downgraded BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit . Agricole by one notch, saying the ‘severity of the euro crisis has . increased’. Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe, said the deal failed to tackle the fundamental debt problems that had brought the single currency to its knees. Mr Persson said: ‘This was meant to be the summit to solve the eurozone crisis, but fundamentally little has changed. ‘The fiscal sanctions lack teeth and credibility, huge questions remain unanswered over the role and firepower of the bailout funds, and the fundamental problems owing to a lack of competitiveness and growth prospects are only superficially addressed. ‘The failure to address these substantive issues has nothing to do with the UK veto.’ Bill Gross, head of the world’s biggest bond investor Pimco, also gave the deal a far from ringing endorsement. In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Oh what a tangled web the EU has weaved. Never ending story – hard to trust.’  France and Germany, who have forced the deal through, are also still divided on several key details, such as the extent to which sanctions for countries that breach the new budget limits should be automatic. Mrs Merkel had been keen to persuade David Cameron to sign up to the deal – seeing Britain as a counterbalance to French protectionism which now threatens to dominate the EU. British officials question whether the deal is focused on the right issues. A government source said it was unclear if new rules on budget deficits would be adhered to when similar rules in the original deal to set up the euro had been flouted. Britain wants the eurozone to focus on improving competitiveness. The deal will face significant democratic hurdles in some countries – potentially slowing it for years. Ireland’s minister for Europe, Lucinda Creighton, said there was a ‘50-50’ chance that Ireland’s constitution would require a referendum. Prime minister Enda Kenny said he would need legal advice before deciding whether to call a referendum. ‘Every country has to do its own thing,’ he said. ‘In our case, the attorney general will have to analyse that and give formal advice to the government.’ A referendum in Ireland could prove extremely difficult to win. That prospect diminished further when it emerged Paris and Berlin are pressing for corporation tax to be ‘harmonised’ across the EU. German Chancellor Angela Merkel studiously ignores the Prime Minister as leaders get ready for a group picture at the EU headquarters in Brussels, Belgium . With corporation tax at just 12.5 per cent, Ireland has the lowest rate in the EU – a status it guards jealously as an incentive for foreign firms to invest. Hungary, the Czech Republic and Sweden said they would need to consult their parliaments before signing up. There are also doubts about whether the Danish government will survive if it tries to push the deal through. In some of the EU’s smaller countries there is growing resentment at the idea of Berlin taking charge of their economies. Last night General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was ‘extraordinarily concerned’ over the potential for civil unrest in Europe. He warned: ‘We are extraordinarily concerned by the health and viability of the euro because in some ways we’re exposed literally to contracts but also because of the potential of civil unrest and breakup of the union that has been forged over there.’",Only a third of French and four in ten Germans support single currency .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Baltimore man dubbed the 'Dine and Dasher' who fakes seizures to avoid paying his bill has finally been arrested after another spree of runaway meals. But restaurant owners and cops fear Andrew Palmer, 46, will soon be back on the run to short-change more Baltimore eateries. The Baltimore Sun reports that Palmer was arrested on Monday after he refused to pay a $50 bill at Viccino Jay's Italian Gourmet on Charles Street, Baltimore. Andrew Palmer, 46, is the Baltimore man dubbed the ""Dine and Dasher"" by police. He has become notorious for racking up food and drink tabs at area restaurants, then faking seizures to get out of paying the bill . On Saturday night, Palmer faked a seizure at barbecue restaurant Oliver Speck's in the city's Harbor East section when he was presented with a bill for $90 tab. 'The paramedics showed up and said, ""Looks like our guy's back,""' Oliver Speck's chef Jesse Sandlin told The Sun. 'He would not wake up, and they were like, ""Come on Andy, stop faking.""' Palmer, who is listed as homeless, has been arrested on more than 90 occasions and found guilty of petty theft at least eight times in the past year, The Sun reported. The problem facing prosecutors is that theft under $100 comes with such a comparatively small penalty that there is no effective deterrent for someone willing to run the risk of getting caught. The Admiral's Cup restaurant, seen here in an image from Google Street View, was targeted by Palmer. Police say the scammer had three Stoli Oranges here then went into the back of the Fells Point restaurant where he appeared to have a seizure . Palmer's crime spree reads like a Zagat's review of Baltimore's best restaurants. In December, police say Palmer had the $24.99 shrimp platter and four alcoholic drinks at the Inner Harbor's Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory. In January, Palmer ate at Sullivan's Steakhouse, and ordered the chicken piccata with a lobster add-on, a 22-ounce ribeye steak, four Blue Moon beers, three Bacardis and coffee. He faked a seizure to avoid the $160 check and was arrested. Palmer was arrested early on Monday after restaurant owners said he refused to pay a $50 bill at Viccino Jay's Italian Gourmet on Charles Street, in Baltimore, pictured here. The notorious Baltimore dine-and-dasher has more than 90 arrests on his record . A police statement read: 'Palmer's seizure occurred when he was confronted about his unpaid bill as he exited the restaurant. [Palmer is] well known to local restaurants and members of the Baltimore Police Department.' Palmer was sentenced to one year in jail for that incident but was released in July. He celebrated his early release by drinking at the Union Brewing Company where he had three Blue Moon drafts, an espresso martini, and two more beers plus three Stoli Oranges at the Admiral's Cup. He then faked a seizure in an attempt to avoid a $72 check. 'If this guy came up and mugged me on the street and took $90 from me, he would've gotten arrested,' Jesse Sandlin, chef at Oliver Speck's, said.","Police appear powerless to stop Andrew Palmer, 46, from returning to Baltimore streets and ripping off more restaurants .

"By . Ben Spencer . The EU has scrapped rules that bind countries to renewable energy targets, lifting demands that Britain build more wind and solar farms. The change paves the way for the Government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source. Britain will still have to provide 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020, but after that there will be no target. Instead, the EU as a whole will have to produce 27 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030. All change: Britain will no longer have to build more wind and solar farms after the EU scrapped rules that bind countries to renewable energy targets. Fracking can now be developed as a major energy source . The policy is a defeat for major European nations including Germany, France and Italy which had demanded a target to drive the development of wind and solar power. They were opposed by Britain, which argued for a broad target in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, leaving individual countries to decide themselves how they would meet it. The European Commission set an EU-wide target of a 40 per cent cut by 2030, but that is less ambitious than Britain’s aim of 50 per cent by 2025. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the new rules provide flexibility in tackling emissions in a cost-effective way ‘so that British consumers aren’t paying over the odds to go green’. ‘This is a really good package,’ he said. ‘It’s what we’ve been arguing for.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the new rules ensure Britain isn't paying over the odds to go green . He said it allowed Britain to use a mix of energy sources, including nuclear, wind, solar and, potentially, shale gas. ‘If you want to do this in the most cost-effective way, then you allow technologies to compete,’ he said. ‘Having a technology-neutral approach means having the market get the most cost-effective way of going green, and that is the whole premise of our policies. If you set rigid, inflexible targets that is likely to result in greater cost [for the consumer].’ Mr Davey has announced plans to build the first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point, Somerset. The £16billion plant will be developed by two Chinese companies and run by French energy firm EDF. On the development of fracking, Mr Davey said: ‘It’s good for Britain’s energy security and it is good for our carbon footprint, because shale gas will replace liquid gas that is coming from the other side of the world.’ The UK is currently on a building drive to meet the existing target of 15 per cent of energy output by renewable sources by 2020. It stands at less than 5 per cent. There are currently 120 solar farms of more than ten acres and the number will more than double this year. Green taxes on energy bills will more than double by the end of the decade, according to Npower, one of Britain’s biggest suppliers. Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that is sceptical of climate change, welcomed the move. ‘Today is a big day in Brussels as the EU has begun the gradual process of rolling back its bankrupting climate and green energy policies,’ he said. The change in regulations paves the way for the Government to expand its use of nuclear power and develop fracking as a major energy source . Manufacturing leaders said the EU’s 40 per cent target in cutting emissions should serve notice that Britain is over-reaching itself for seeking higher cuts. ‘It has been clear for a while that others in Europe have little appetite to match the UK’s binding 50 per cent target and this announcement merely serves as confirmation,’ said Richard Warren, of the EEF, which represents manufacturers in the UK. He added that the target was deterring investors. Green bodies opposed the move. Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at wildlife charity WWF, said: ‘Today’s announcement is at the low end of what one can consider to be a credible EU response to the risks caused by climate change.’","EU countries will no longer have to hit individual renewable energy targets .

"By . Alex Greig . In celebration of the first anniversary of Washington state's legalization of marijuana, a festival for up to 500 people will be held at the Seattle Center's Fun Forest amusement park. Pot advocate Ben Livingstone lobbied for the festival, which will include food, music and of course, marijuana, for three months before city officials approved the plan. Livingston said Seattle Center officials initially rejected the idea because marijuana remains federally illegal. December 6 2012: Voters approved an initiative to decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana in Washington state, an event being celebrated this year with a 'pot festival' He refused to accept the first rejection he was handed, citing two previous events in the city where public consumption of marijuana was legal, and finally prevailed. Pot party: John 'The Freak' smokes a cigar-sized marijuana blunt after the Cannabis Freedom March in Seattle, on Saturday, May 11, 2013 . A spokesman for Mayor Mike McGinn told . the Seattle Times that the city wanted to support a legal activity, but . Livingston’s party marked new ground for Seattle Center. First-time event: Officials say Livingston's festival at Fun Forest is a trial that they will monitor closely . 'We’re working to create best practices for private events where you can smoke marijuana,' said Aaron Pickus. Livingstone had to overcome two laws in gaining permission for the party, according to the Seattle Times. First, it's illegal in Washington to smoke marijuana in view of the general public. Second, the clean-air act does not allow employees to be subjected to marijuana smoke. To address the first, Livingstone plans to install two fences to shield the general public from the view of people smoking marijuana. Second, he will use volunteers instead of Seattle center employees at the event. Livingston forked out $1,900 to use . part of the 74-acre Seattle Center on December 6, the anniversary of the . day Washington’s recreational pot law took effect, between 3pm and . 11pm. Noting . that Pearl Jam's tour will end in nearby KeyArena that night, he told . the Seattle Times he'd like to extend an invitation to the band. 'Hey, if they want to come over,' he said, 'we could bill them as ""Heady’ Vedder,"" ""Stoned"" Gossard and Mike ""McWeedy.""'","Pot advocate is holding a celebration of Washington state's legalization of marijuana .

"By . Joel Christie . The title company executive who committed suicide with a nail gun in the wake of investigations into his alleged financial mismanagement had a $1 million life insurance policy that named his business as its beneficiary. But the insurance company holding the policy says it learned after Richard Talley's death that the beneficiary had changed — from American Title Service, now in bankruptcy, to his wife, Cheryl Talley, who co-founded the company and was its majority owner. It remains unclear ow close to the 56-year-old's suicide the switch was made. However filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court show that Talley had a $1 million policy with Transamerica Insurance Co. in which he named American Title as the recipient upon his death, The Denver Post reported. Richard Talley, pictured with his wife of 25 years Cheryl, committed suicide with a nail gun at his home in Colorado on February 4. It has now emerged Talley's life insurance policy was transferred into his wife's name before he killed himself . 'However, subsequent to Mr. Talley's death, Transamerica received notice of change of beneficiary to Cheryl Talley,' according to an inventory of American Title's personal property in a bankruptcy filing. Transamerica was listed among the company's unsecured creditors, indicating the company was paying the premium. American Title also listed the Denver Broncos, the Colorado Rockies, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame, and Valley Country Club among 62 pages of unsecured creditors. American Title filed for bankruptcy shortly after Talley was found dead in his Aurora home on Feb. 4, the result of six finishing nails fired into his chest and head from a nail gun. The company on Thursday changed its bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 liquidation, citing assets of just $100 and the $1 million life-insurance proceeds. Other assets might exist, but American Title's underwriter, Title Resource Guarantee Service in Texas, seized its bank accounts. Mr Talley, 57, was found dead in his garage from the self-inflicted wounds in Centennial, Colorado . Mr Talley had allegedly been having trouble with his business before he took his own life in Colorado . The company's lawyer firm, hired to 'wind-down' its operation in bankruptcy, has said in court filings that it is unable to complete many of the required documents because they were confiscated by investigators. The attorney general's office has refused to turn over any of more than 100 boxes of records it raided from American Title's headquarters in Greenwood Village last month. Title Resource has alleged American Title's books were doctored to cover up about $2 million in missing funds, mostly escrow payments for real estate transactions. Investigations have been launched by the Attorney General and the state division of insurance. Former employees of the company have also filed claims for missing retirement contributions, with several saying the matter is under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor.

"By . Dan Bloom . For centuries only the light of Rudolph's red nose could guide Santa's sleigh, and perhaps that's why he avoided being spotted for so long. But with the march of modern technology, it was only a matter of time before he was caught on film. Finally he has been captured - by the thermal imaging camera of a police helicopter above Leicester. Could it be? Santa may visit the world's population of seven billion in just one night, but the Husbands Bosworth police helicopter crew apparently managed to spot him doing his rounds above Leicester . The image, which the crew confirmed was a bit of fun Photoshop trickery, showed the legs of two reindeer . The image was apparently taken at 1.44am on Christmas Day, a time consistent with when Father Christmas might have reached the East Midlands. It appears to show a contraption being pulled by at least two deer- or horse-like creatures. The photo prompted amusement after it was posted to the Twitter feed of the National Police Air Service helicopter at Husbands Bosworth airfield, south of Leicester. The crew wrote: 'We picked up an unusual heat source on the last flight? Santa? Could it be? #999Crimbo' Chief Constable of Leicester Police Simon Cole seemed unfussed about the potential danger from a UFO, however. He Tweeted: 'What a great heat source shot. Thanks for getting #Santa round.' Hoax: The image by the East Midlands police helicopter, pictured, prompted chuckles among Twitter users . Amusing: This clearly Photoshopped image by the Met Police helicopter was a more obvious hoax . Twitter user Gordon Farmer added: 'I was trying for four years in security to get an image of the big man on CCTV. I'm jealous now.' But not all were so positive. One, @Dan_Infidel, said: 'Pull him for drink driving'. Sadly, the crew have since confirmed it was a hoax created on Photoshop for fun. It is thought it may have been adapted from a colour image which was claimed to have been taken in Mexico in October 1998. It came after the Metropolitan Police's helicopter crew also took a few minutes out of their day for a Christmas hoax. Last night they posted a clearly manipulated photo showing a flying sleigh in front of their helicopter, with the Tweet: '#Santa Collision Avoidance System working well, according to the night crew.'","Thermal image was apparently taken at 1.44am on Christmas Day .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Perched on the edge of a small ravine shrouded by luscious green forest, this magical Scottish hideaway is where JM Barrie retreated to write part of Peter Pan. Dhivach Lodge, which lies near Loch Ness, was originally built as a stop-over for shepherds on their way to market at nearby Glenmoriston in the early 1800s. With few paths and acres of wild woods, it was a haven for men trekking miles to sell their wares. Hideaway: Dhivach Lodge, a former Highland bothy near Loch Ness, became the home of JM Barrie . More than 100 years later, it became a welcome pit-stop for a very different kind of work. Over one long summer in 1910, Barrie decided to escape the buzz of Edinburgh with the three children that inspired the Lost Boys after their mother, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, died of cancer. Lost in mourning, they turned the bothy into their own version of Neverland - and as the children played, Barrie is said to have finalised the character of Peter. Now the sprawling estate - which sits in over nine acres of ground - is on the market for offers £1million. Inspiration: The writer holidayed here with the children that inspired the Lost Boys after their mother died . Magical: The bothy was originally built as a stop-over for shepherds on their way to the market up the mountain . The building began with just two tiny rooms, which are now part of the sitting room in the west end of today's Lodge. It now has five bedrooms, two bathrooms, an artist's studio, a kitchen and a dining room. There is also a cellar and a coach house. Loch Ness lies on the Great Glen fault line and is one of the three lochs joined by canal to form the coast to coast connection of the Caledonian Canal. Iconic: JM Barrie's summer here would inspire some of the qualities of the iconic character of Peter Pan . Lost boys: The five sons of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (pictured left with one of them, George) inspired the magical characters of Neverland. Barrie's notes about Michael (right) while at Dhivach contributed to Peter's character . Though still surrounded by mountainous hills, the hideaway is now catered for by local shops, restaurants and schools nearby. In the mid-19th century Dhivach Lodge became best known as being a hotspot for both the rich and famous - first being leased by Queen Victoria's favourite portrait painter, John Phillip. After his death in 1867 the lease was snapped up by his friend and fellow artist Arthur Lewis and went on to be owned by Victorian stars such as actor Henry Irvine and actress Dame Ellen Terry. In his 1881 novel Ayala's Angel, author Anthony Trollope - who also stayed in the property at one stage - wrote: 'You might perhaps travel through all Scotland without finding a more beautifully romantic spot in which to reside.' Popular: Now on the market for £1million, it was once a popular holiday spot for poets such as Trollope . Celebrities continued to be associated with the property into the 20th century and when JM Barrie took it over in 1907 one of his first visitors to the house was Captain Scott, following his first trip to the Antarctic. Dhivach Lodge now has four bedrooms, consisting of three double rooms and one single. Kevin Maley of selling agents Strutt & Parker's Inverness office said: 'Dhivach Lodge is a completely charming house which is both quirky and homely. 'It isn't difficult to see why the various owners and tenants over the years have been inundated with visitors.'","Nine-acre estate near Loch Ness was built as a stop-over for shepherds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two turkeys spared a certain death last year by President Obama who pardoned them in an annual ceremonious event are dead. Cobbler and Gobbler, two 40-pound birds from Rockingham Country, Virginia, were sent off to live a charmed life on the sprawling historic estate of George Washington. Sparing turkeys is a tradition that dates back to 1963, when President John F Kennedy sent that year’s gift from the National Turkey Federation back to the farm, declaring ‘we’ll just let this one grow’. 'Be free': President Barack Obama, with daughters Sasha (3rd left) and Malia (right), pardons the 2012 National Thanksgiving Turkey, Cobbler. It died in August . Tradition: Sparing turkeys started in 1963, when President John F Kennedy, pictured 2nd from left, sent that year¿s gift from the National Turkey Federation back to the farm, declaring 'we'll just let this one grow' President George H.W. Bush was the first to grant a turkey an official presidential pardon in 1989, according to ABC News. At last year’s ceremony, Obama said: ‘From here these two lucky birds will be swept up in a whirlwind of fame and fortune that will ultimately lead them to Mount Vernon, where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington.’ But their freedom was short lived. Cobbler, who, according to the White House, loved cranberries and the musical stylings of Carly Simon, was reportedly euthanized in August. The official beginning: President George H.W.

Obituary: Cobbler loved cranberries and singer Carly Simon, while Gobbler, who dropped dead in February, was a 'patient but proud bird'. Both were spared by President Obama last year . And Gobbler, described as ‘a patient but proud bird’, passed away suddenly of unknown causes in February. All of the eight turkeys pardoned by Obama have reportedly moved on to greener pastures. But that’s not necessarily the president’s fault. The average turkey lifespan is roughly three to four years and Obama is not the first with a poor track record in this department. George W Bush’s chosen birds also died in 2001. Greener pastures: The two birds were sent to live out their retirement at George Washington's Mount Vernon sprawling estate, but they didn't last long . A farmer at the time told the ABC that the birds are bred for eating and not retirement. ‘Their flesh has grown so fast, and their heart and their bones and their other organs can’t catch up.’ President Obama will continue the tradition on Wednesday, when he will grant two more turkeys their freedom. Only time will tell if they will manage to enjoy their freedom more than their predecessors.","Cobbler and Gobbler, two 40-pound birds from Virginia, were pardoned by President Obama last year at an annual ceremony .

"By . Associated Press . Trying to appease many angry parishioners, the archbishop of Atlanta said Saturday that he will sell a luxury $2.2 million mansion built using church funds, just three months after he moved in. Archbishop Wilton Gregory announced the decision following a closed-door meeting with members of several church councils at his headquarters north of Atlanta. He publicly apologized Monday for building the Tudor-style residence and will move out in early May. 'I have decided to sell the Habersham property and invest the proceeds from that sale into the needs of the Catholic community,' Gregory told The Associated Press after the meeting. He declined to take questions. Rev. Wilton Gregory, the Archbishop of Atlanta, has apologized for building a $2.2 million mansion for himself, a decision criticized by local Catholics who cited the example of austerity set by the new pope. He will now sell the sprawling house . Controversial: The new $2.2 million mansion that is the residence of Atlanta Archbishop Wilton Gregory stands in the upscale Buckhead neighborhood in Atlanta. Gregory apologized for his spending and will now sell the house . Gregory, who has been criticized for lavish spending of church money, on April 5, 2014, said he has decided to sell the $2.2 million mansion he has been using as his official residence. Money from the sale of the Tudor-style home in an exclusive neighborhood will be used for 'the needs of the Catholic community' Sprawling: A safe room is seen in an original floor plan for the residence of Atlanta Archbishop Wilton Gregory . Interior decorating samples for the residence of Atlanta Archbishop Wilton Gregory is seen inside a conference room during an interview with Gregory on Wednesday, April 2, 2014. He has now promised to sell the house . It was not immediately clear where Gregory will live next. He will not return to his old residence, which was sold for $1.9 million to Christ the King Cathedral. The cathedral plans to expand the archbishop's former home and house its priests there. Gregory said this week that if the church sold the mansion, he would seek to live in a setting more modest than his current mansion or his previous home. A group of Catholics in Gregory's diocese had asked since January that he sell off the more than 6,000-square-foot home in keeping with the tone of austerity set by Pope Francis. Elected last year, Francis said he wants a church for the poor, drives in an economy car and lives in a guestroom instead of a Vatican palace. He has denounced the 'idolatry of money' and warned against ""insidious worldliness"" within the church. Laura Mullins, one of several Catholics who asked Gregory to sell, praised the archbishop for making a quick decision and ending the controversy. The mansion was made possible by a generous multimillion dollar gift to the archdiocese. 'He is the person we follow locally,' she said. 'He sets the mood. He sets the example for all of us to follow. If he is choosing to use a gift so personally, what does that tell the people sitting in the pews?' Gregory thanked parishioners for raising the issue, and he acknowledged earlier this week the importance of Francis' example. On a mission: Pope Francis has made a point of . living a more humble life than some of his predecessors, and even fired a . German Bishop called the 'Bishop of Bling' Roman Catholic Archbishop of Atlanta Wilton Gregory has apologized for building a $2.2 million mansion to use as his home, a move that made him the object of derision and complaint, and said he will sell it . 'He's called us to live more simply,' Gregory said in an interview Wednesday, prior to announcing the decision to sell the residence. 'He also has encouraged bishops to grow closer to their people, to listen to their people. And that, I take as a pretty serious admonition. I'm disappointed in myself ... because in my nine years, I do believe that I've grown very close to the people of the archdiocese. And I think this decision is an aberration rather than a pattern.' Even before the new pope's election, top-ranking Catholics were selling off luxurious homes, most built decades or a century ago by their predecessors seeking to demonstrate the growing clout of the Catholic church. The downsizing by archbishops in Boston and Philadelphia was also symbolically important during a period when church officials were closing parishes, schools and paying big settlements over clergy sex abuse. A generous gift from a wealthy donor in Atlanta made the luxurious residence possible. Joseph Mitchell, the nephew of the author of Gone With The Wind, left an estate worth more than $15 million to the local church when he died in 2011. Mitchell asked in his will that the proceeds be used for 'general religious and charitable purposes'. He also requested that his parish, Christ The King Cathedral, get primary consideration. The archdiocese gave $7.5 million to the cathedral, and cathedral officials bought Gregory's old home. By moving its priests into Gregory's former residence, the cathedral can free up space on its crowded campus. After the sale, Gregory needed a new home. He demolished Mitchell's old home and replaced it with an expansive mansion.  It has an upper-level safe room, an eight-burner kitchen stove, an elevator, public and private offices and two dining rooms. Architects initially planned space for a wine room and wanted an antique chandelier in the foyer, though those plans were later dropped.","The 6,000-plus square foot .

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 08:35 EST, 26 January 2012 . A pensioner who plunged 40ft down a ravine into a river owes his life to his faithful dog who led him to safety before running to a nearby pub and barking until he raised the alarm. Maurice Holder, 73, says he was knocked unconscious when the ground gave way beneath him as he walked along a steep river bank with his labradoodle Monty. When he regained consciousness 15 minutes later he was lying in water up to his chest with a serious head wound and six broken ribs. But Mr Holder said 11-year-old Monty had stayed loyally by his side and helped him struggle up the ravine from the River Camel in Bodmin, Cornwall. 'My dog saved my life': Maurice Holder, 73, said his dog Monty led him to safety after he fell 40ft down a ravine into the River Camel in Bodmin, Cornwall . When they got to level ground Monty left his owner and ran to the nearby Borough Arms where he barked until he attracted the attention of a regular, who followed him back to where Mr Holder lay in agony. Mr Holder, a grandfather of eight who lives in Newquay, said: 'We were walking along the river. I was literally standing still with my hands in my pockets listening to the silence and the sound of the river, when suddenly the earth moved. 'There was a tremendous rumble and the whole lot came down with no warning, nothing. 'I just went down - it felt like going down in a lift really fast. I fell about 40ft and landed on a great slab. I don’t know how long I was out for, it could have been around ten to 15 minutes. Plunge: Mr Holder fell around 40ft down this embankment. When he came round 11-year-old Monty was still by his side and helped him struggle back up the ravine . 'I woke up and the tidal water had come up to my chest and I was aware that I was bleeding from my head. I looked around and saw Monty sitting next to me. 'I knew I was in a situation, there was only one way out and that was the way I came in. 'It was very steep. Because all the ground had fallen it was loose, but Monty found a way back up on to firm ground.' Mr Holder, a retired sales director, said he knew it was critical he got help quickly because he had suffered a head injury. He added: 'I find it a nice area as you don’t get hordes of people there. But after the fall I had six broken ribs and I thought I could be here for hours or days. 'Monty got me to level ground and then I just lay down to get my breath back and as I did Monty ran away. Help: A regular at the Borough Arms called an ambulance after Monty ran to the pub, barked until he raised the alarm and led the rescuer back to his owner . 'He came back around 15 minutes later with a nice gentleman who helped me back to the car and an ambulance came.' Mr Holder was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital where he stayed for two days and was treated for head injuries, broken ribs and cuts and bruises to his back. He added: 'I was a bit of a fright with blood from my head down to my waist. I think the broken ribs were more painful than anything else. 'I have been back a couple of times and when I saw where it happened and how far I fell I couldn’t believe it. 'Monty is absolutely the perfect pet. I wouldn’t say he is always the best behaved but he is loyal and that is what matters - man’s best friend.'","Pensioner lay unconscious in water for 'around 15 minutes' after ground gave way .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Two legal highs linked to a string of deaths in Britain are to be banned. The government’s official drugs advisers said NBOMe would be outlawed permanently as a class A substance, meaning dealers could face up to life in prison. It also recommended that Benzo Fury - once marketed as a legal form of ecstasy – be controlled as a class B substance. Deadly: A sample of 251-NBOMe - a recently discovered psychedelic substance which is to be banned . Both drugs have been subject to temporary bans after concerns about their health effects. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker, who recently took up the post in the last coalition reshuffle, said: ‘I am grateful to the ACMD for its advice on Benzofury and NBOMe and we will respond in due course.’ NBOMe, known on the street as N-Bomb and Smiley Paper, is a popular club drug mainly bought over the internet. Its effects, which can last six to 10 hours, include euphoria and feelings of love but also confusion, shaking, nausea, insomnia and paranoia, the ACMD said. Last week an inquest heard how . father-to-be Jake Harris died after slitting his own throat with a . broken wine glass when he suffered a devastating reaction to the drug. The 21-year-old is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb. Jake Harris, 21, is said to have gone 'crazy' at an all-night party after taking a mind-bending drug known as N-Bomb. As . he was suffering terrifying hallucinations, Mr Harris, a leisure centre . lifeguard, was heard shouting and pleading: 'I want it to stop.' He then broke a wine glass on a bedside cabinet and used a thick shard to slice his throat open. An inquest heard that Mr Harris and . friend Steven Higgins, 27, had gone to a party at the luxury flat of . Heather Turner, 28, near Manchester city centre. The . court was told she had already picked up some cocaine and vodka to . share with revellers but Mr Higgins supplied the N-Bomb drug to his . friend. He believed it was LSD and said he wanted to 'test' its effect . before visiting the Glastonbury festival. N-Bomb is also known to have killed at least five people in US states including Arizona, North Dakota and Louisiana. NBOMe was temporarily banned in the UK just days after the incident and has also been blamed for half a dozen deaths in the US. Surrey Police reported the death of an 18-year old man in February, which is thought to be related to NBOMe although this is awaiting confirmation, while Avon and Somerset Police have reported a death where a 22-year old man drowned after taking the drug. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has recommended that compounds of the drug, seen as an alternative to the hallucinogen LSD, are controlled as class A substances. This is the most serious category with possession punishable by a jail term of up to seven years. Earlier this year, seven intoxication cases linked to NBOMe were identified in hospitals across the north east of England, including two patients who needed intensive care. Evidence from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which was recently taken into the new National Crime Agency (NCA), suggests large amounts of the drug have already arrived in the UK for distribution in blotter and powder form. The substance appears to have arrived via a well-established link to producers of the drug in China, the ACMD said. NBOMe is also potentially a highly profitable drug, the drug advisers said, since a relatively small amount of powder can generate many doses at prices between £2 to £4 - with up to 20 million doses available from just 1kg. The ACMD also recommended that BenzoFury be banned as a class B drug. It is often sold as powder or as tablets, known as pellets, with powder sold at GBP35 a gram and pellets GBP10 each. Earlier this year, psychology graduate Jennifer Whiteley, 27, died after she took ‘bombs’ of BenzoFury at her family home. Ten ‘legal highs’ were identified last year for the first time in the UK by a specialist Government system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops. A total of 27 new psychoactive substances - also known as legal highs - have now been detected by the Home Office's Forensic Early Warning System (FEWS) since it was set up in January 2011. Official figures also showed the number of deaths involving legal highs soared by 80% last year to 52, from 29 in 2011. Earlier this year, ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen warned Britain is being swamped by a 'potentially dangerous’ influx of new legal highs. And a United Nations report found the UK to be the largest market for legal highs in the European Union. Tragedy: Jennifer Whiteley died of an accidental drug overdose while celebrating her new NHS job with boyfriend Andrew Tunnah . A psychologist who was celebrating . the offer of a job working with drug addicts died after taking a legal . high bought from a notorious website. Jennifer Whiteley, 27, took Benzo Fury with her boyfriend, which he had bought on online drugs marketplace The Silk Road. At . an inquest into the death of the former A-star pupil’s death, . her parents said they were shocked she had taken drugs as it was . completely out  of character. Her mother, Claire Whiteley,  condemned those who peddle legal highs. ‘I . just want to publicise as much as possible as to how dangerous it is . and that people who are selling them don’t give a toss,’ she said. ‘All . they want to do is make more money. They’ve made millions out of these. People now think that it’s not going to happen to us. It obviously . happens to us.’ The . inquest heard Andrew Tunnah, Miss Whiteley’s boyfriend of eight years, . bought the drug legally on The Silk Road in January. Web users could . purchase any kind of drugs on the website, which was shut down by the . FBI last month. Mr Tunnah . bought 5APB and 5MAPD – 5APB is also known as Benzo Fury. Miss Whiteley – . who was working as a mental health carer and had seen her articles . published in the Journal of Health Psychology – received a job offer . from the Pennine Trust in Lancashire in July. She . decided to spend the weekend celebrating at her parents’ house in Sale, . Greater Manchester, with Mr Tunnah while her parents were away. Miss . Whiteley consumed both 5APB and 5MAPD as well as cocaine and a small . amount of alcohol.

"By . Sean Poulter . Campaigners are calling for a  ban on the E numbers that give  children’s medicines such as Calpol their bright colours. They have identified 52 products – including teething gels and painkillers designed for babies as young as two months – which contain additives linked to hyperactivity. The artificial colours have effectively been banned from children’s food following research at the University of Southampton in 2005. The E number medicines: There are 52 remedies that make children hyperactive, campaigners claim . But the ‘Southampton Seven’ additives – six artificial colours and one preservative – still appear in medicines aimed at youngsters. Calpol, for example, gets its distinctive pink shade from carmoisine (E122). Now health campaigners at Action On Additives are calling for the use of the additives in medicines to be outlawed. Co-ordinator Lizzie Vann Thrasher said: ‘Some of our most trusted children’s medicines contain unnecessary colourings that have been linked to hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders. ‘Manufacturers should follow the example of the food and drinks industry and remove these colourings from children’s medicines.’ The suspect colours are tartrazine (E102); quinoline yellow (E104); sunset yellow (E110); carmoisine (E122); ponceau 4R (E124); and allura red (E129). The seventh additive is the preservative sodium benzoate (E211). The campaign group’s study, released today, reports that four of the six E numbers were found in 19 children’s medicines, including Calpol Paracetamol Infant Suspension, Boots Paracetamol Oral Suspension, Anbesol Teething Gel and some prescription drugs. Food colourings linked to hyperactivity should be banned from children's medicines, the charity Action of Additives has warned . The Calpol product is designed for babies as young as two months, the Boots product for those three months and up and the Anbesol for teething babies. The preservative was in 37 children’s medicines, including a Boots cough syrup, Tixylix and six different Benylin cough mixtures or syrups. Four medicines contained both a colouring and the preservative. Vyvyan Howard, professor of bio-imaging at Ulster University and an expert on child brain development, backed the call for a ban, while public health nutritionist Dr Helen Crawley urged manufacturers to remove the additives from medicines ‘as a matter of urgency’. Currently, under EU law synthetic colourings are banned from food and drinks targeted specifically at children under 36 months. Separately, Britain’s Food Standards Agency has successfully put pressure on manufacturers to remove the artificial colours identified in the Southampton research from food for older children. But there is no law stopping their use in medicines. Action on Additives said 19 children's medicines sold in the UK contain colourings linked to hyperactivity . Industry watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is encouraging firms to remove the colours from medicines but has no legal powers to go further. Action On Additives said it is time for a legal ban on use of the E numbers both in food and in medicine. It is calling on parents to protest directly to the manufacturers and the MHRA to demand action. Johnson & Johnson, which makes Calpol, confirmed it contains carmoisine and sodium benzoate, but said both had been approved by the MHRA and insisted there was ‘no evidence to suggest additives … are associated with hyperactivity when present in children’s medicines’. It added: ‘The consumption of food and drink is very different to the consumption of medicines. Over-the-counter medicines are only intended for occasional use in small quantities over a very short period of time.’ It argued the colours are important because they allow patients and healthcare professionals to identify a medicine on sight. Alliance Pharmaceutical, which  makes Anbesol Teething Gel, said it complied with MHRA and European Commission guidelines.","Action on Additives said 19 children’s medicines sold in the UK - including Calpol infant suspension - contain colourings linked to hyperactivity .

"Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel, 35, was born in Yemen . He was allegedly a member of Osama bin Laden's security detail . He has been at Gitmo 11 years after he was captured crossing the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . By . Daniel Bates . A hunger striking inmate who has . been held at Guantanamo Bay for 11 years has written a horrific first person . account of life inside the prison in which he vowed never to eat again until . his captors ‘restore my dignity’. Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel told . of his ‘agony’ at being force fed twice a day by guards who have forced a pipe . so far down his nose it has gone into his stomach. On one occasion he was strapped . to a bed for 26 hours so they could feed him during which time he was not . allowed to go to the toilet. Protest: Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel is on hunger strike inside Guantanamo Bay. He has been held for 11 years accused of being a guard for Osama Bin Laden . In an opinion piece in the New . York Times, al Hasan Moqbel demands that he be returned to his native Yemen - . and blames President Obama personally for failing to let him go free. He has been in Guantanamo since 2002 having been accused of being a guard for the late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, a charge he dismisses as ‘nonsense’. Now aged 35, al Hasan Moqbel is among at least 40 Guantanamo inmates who have been on hunger strike since February in protest at their treatment. Last weekend dozens of detainees staged a mini riot armed with batons, broomsticks and plastic water bottles after the military authorities decided to end communal housing on one of the blocks. Guantanamo, a US military base in Cuba, has previously been criticized as being a legal black hole where inmates have fewer rights than those who are held on mainland US soil. 'Inhuman': Al Hasan Moqbel claims he is not being treated like a human by being held in Guantanamo . 'Pain': The prisoner claims he is painfully forcibly fed twice a day - tied down for hours at a time and attended to by nurses how are too busy to give each patient proper attention . Al Hasan Moqbel’s opinion piece appeared in the New York Times after he spoke to his lawyers at legal charity Reprieve. He writes: ‘The only reason I am still here is that President Obama refuses to send any detainees back to Yemen. ‘This makes no sense. I am a human being, not a passport, and I deserve to be treated like one. ‘I do not want to die here, but until President Obama and Yemen’s president do something, that is what I risk every day.' On March 15 al Hasan Moqbel was sick in the prison hospital when a team from the Extreme Reaction Force, which was eight military officers in riot gear, came into his room. He writes: ‘They tied my hands and feet to the bed. ‘They forcibly inserted an IV into my hand. I spent 26 hours in this state, tied to the bed. During this time I was not permitted to go to the toilet. 'Agony': The inmate claims he has 'never experienced such pain before' and says he wouldn't wish it on anybody . Undignified: The inmate claims he is forced to stay in soiled clothes because food is spilled by nurses . ‘They inserted a catheter, which was painful, degrading and unnecessary. I was not even permitted to pray. ‘I will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can’t describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn’t. ‘There was agony in my chest, throat and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone.’ Al Hasan Moqbel writes that he is still being force fed two times a day and that his arms, legs and head are strapped down each time they come, which can be as late as 11pm when he is asleep. He also claims that because there are so many on hunger strike there are not enough medical personnel to keep up. 'The situation is desperate now. All of the detainees here are suffering deeply. At least 40 people here are on a hunger strike. People are fainting with exhaustion every day. I have vomited blood,' he writes. As a result al Hasan Moqbel says that the few nurses available are so rushed they spill the ‘food’ onto the prisoners’ clothes which he claims denies him ‘last shred of my dignity’ He writes: ‘During one force-feeding the nurse pushed the tube about 18 inches into my stomach, hurting me more than usual, because she was doing things so hastily. ‘I called the interpreter to ask the doctor if the procedure was being done correctly or not. It was so painful that I begged them to stop feeding me. The nurse refused to stop feeding me. ‘ . Al Hasan Moqbel is one of the more obscure of the 166 detainees still being held at Guantanamo. The United States alleges he worked security for Osama bin Laden but he denies knowing the former terror leader. He claims that he is not a terrorist and that he only traveled from Yemen to Afghanistan in 2000 when a childhood friend told him he could earn more than the $50 a month he was earning in a factory. When he got there there was no work and after the Americans invaded in 2001 he left for Pakistan where he was arrested and sent to Guantanamo. He writes: ‘I could have been home years ago - no one seriously thinks I am a threat - but still I am here. ‘Years ago the military said I was a 'guard' for Osama bin Laden, but this was nonsense, like something out of the American movies I used to watch. ‘They don’t even seem to believe it anymore. But they don’t seem to care how long I sit here, either.’","Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel, 35, was born in Yemen .

"By . Tara Brady . Lynette Brimble suffered severe head and other injuries when she was hit head on by a car along the dark road . A pensioner was killed when she tried to 'shoo' away an injured goose from a country road, an inquest has heard. Lynette Brimble, a former professional actress and health service accountant, suffered severe head and other injuries when she was hit head on by a car along the dark road. A coroner said the mother-of-two, originally from St Andrews, in Scotland, died as a result of a road traffic collision and said: 'It is one of the most unusual cases I have heard of.' The Plymouth inquest heard that 67-year-old Mrs Brimble was driving home after watching a play with her neighbour Ann Clough when they spotted the Canadian goose in their lane on the A377 near Crediton, Devon, last July. Mrs Clough said in a statement to Plymouth and south Devon coroner Ian Arrow that they saw a large brown mottled Canadian goose sitting on their side of the road which appeared to be injured but alive. They turned around and the goose was still sitting in the lane of the 60mph road. She said Mrs Brimble, who lived in Lapford, Devon, repeatedly flashed her headlights at an oncoming car which she had seen in the pitch black road where there were no street lights. She then got out of the car while Mrs Clough stayed in the passenger seat. Her neighbour said Mrs Brimble was ‘half in, half out’ of her Citreon Zara car as she flashed the lights three times. 'The next thing I knew the oncoming car had hit Lynette. I heard a bang and saw her flying down the road.' Mrs Brimble was seriously hurt and lying in the road while Mrs Clough held her hand and talked to her as police and ambulance crews arrived at the scene. She said a policeman shooed away the goose but she added that she could not say how quickly the black Ford Focus was being driven. The car driver, grandmother Ellen Pope, said she only saw the victim in front of her saying: 'I knew I was going to hit her, I had nowhere to go.' The coroner heard she donated some of her organs which her son said had helped three other people . The traumatised driver said she could have done nothing to avoid the collision. Mrs Pope told Mrs Brimble’s son Alastair: 'I am so sorry for your pain. She was a really lovely lady.' Mr Brimble replied that they all had to ‘find a way through these things’ and said it was an accident. MPC Marcus Rowe told the inquest that the car was on the proper side of the road and Mrs Brimble was in the car’s carriageway when she was hit. He said: 'She was nearer the white line than the verge.' He estimated her speed at between 25mph and 39mph at the time of the impact. Motor Patrol Sergeant Richard Newton said Mrs Pope did not see Mrs Brimble’s stationary car flashing its headlights and said she had not committed any offences. He said: 'It was something she could not avoid.' The coroner recorded a verdict of a road traffic collision saying Mrs Brimble was ‘endeavouring to move the goose from the road’. He said as she ‘tried to shoo the goose off the road, aware of the oncoming car, unfortunately the driver of the black Ford Focus was unable to reach fast enough once she had seen her to stop. 'It is extremely sad. It is one of the most unusual cases I have heard of.' The inquest heard Mrs Brimble was transferred to a Plymouth hospital where she died five days after the collision. The coroner heard she donated some of her organs which her son said had helped three other people.","Lynette Brimble suffered severe head injuries when she was hit by the car .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Oregon woman who pled guilty to driving under the influence with a hamster on her lap has completed a diversion program. Nicole Elizabeth Huey, 29, was stopped with the furry animal on her lap by Beaverton police officers shortly after 12:30am on October 16, 2012, The Oregonian reports. Huey reportedly told officers she was going to a local store. When she got out of the car, Huey left the hamster on the dashboard. Huey was arrested and taken to Washington County Jail. Nicole Elizabeth Huey, seen in this mugshot, reportedly told cops they 'should just kill' her hamster when she was arrested for DUI in October 2012 . An earlier report by the paper says that Huey told officers she didn't have anyone who could claim the animal -- and that they 'should just kill it.' However, three police officers reportedly chased the hamster before one trapped it. The hamster was not harmed during the incident. 'It took three officers to capture the furry little passenger,' Mike Rowe, a Beaverton police spokesman, wrote on department's Facebook page at the time. 'It appeared that the hamster wanted to stay in the vehicle and it put up a good fight trying to avoid capture.' Three cops reportedly tried to catch the hamster at the time of Huey's 2012 DUI arrest -- and it was temporarily placed in 'protective custody' at a clinic . Police then placed the animal in 'protective custody' at the Emergency Veterinary Clinic of Tualatin. Huey received contact information for the clinic and claimed the pet later that day. Huey later pled guilty to one count of DUI and entered a one-year diversion program on November 7, 2012, the paper says. She paid the state program fee as well as other assessments, it says, costing $500. The judge signed an order dismissing the conviction on December 10, 2013, court records reportedly show.","Nicole Huey was stopped by police for a suspected DUI in October 2012 with a hamster on her lap .

"By . Richard Spillett . A thug who brutally attacked six women - including his own sister and a girl who refused to kiss him at a party - has got off with a 14-month sentence. The judge said Sam Brownless, 22, deserved longer behind bars but he was restricted by official sentencing guidelines after the attacks were charged lower-level common assaults. Victims groups have criticised the sentence, saying it shows how rules need to be changed to allow the justice system to impose the punishments criminals deserve. Thug Sam Brownless (left) attacked six women in a spate of assaults - but was only jailed for 14 months today. Judge David Hatton (right) agreed that the sentence was too soft, but said he was bound by sentencing guidelines . The court heard Brownless, of Hartlepool, County Durham, attacked four women in a late night attack in September, before beating up his sister in November, and punching another victim at a party in February this year. He admitted six counts of common assault and breaching a suspended sentence. But Judge David Hatton said Brownless could only be jailed for a maximum of six months for the attacks as they were classed as low level 'summary offences', which he pleaded guilty to before magistrates. Brownless was only jailed for the longer term of 14 months because the judge activated a previously suspended prison sentence from when Brownless crashed a car into a care home. Sentencing rules also mean that, . providing he behaves behind bars, Brownless could be released on licence . after serving just half of his prison term. Domestic violence charity Harbour hit . out at the sentence and called for the system to be changed so the . punishment can fits the crime. Teesside Crown Court heard that the judge was limited in the sentence he could impose because the attacks were charged as 'summary' common assaults . Spokesman Denise Chadwick: 'It is really worrying. The justice system needs to be reviewed in individual cases like this so the courts can actually give out sentences that reflect the catalogue of abuse that he has obviously carried out.' Guidelines state that the 'summary offence' of common assault has a maximum sentence of six months. They encourage judges to impose a community order unless the offence involves a 'greater degree of harm'. Longer sentences of up to five years can only be imposed if the attack is charged as an 'assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH)'. Guidelines tell prosecutors to decide upon a charge based on ' the level of injuries that have resulted'. Last September, Brownless lashed out at four young women at 3am after a run-in with one of the group. He landed punches on each of the women's faces, leaving them with nosebleeds, swelling and pain which lasted for several days. One said she was 'shocked that such a large man would assault girls in such a way'. He had previously attacked his sister when she and his mum refused to hand over his six-month-old baby when he came home drunk from the pub. Sue Jacobs, prosecuting, said: 'He grabbed his sister from behind and dragged her to the floor by her hair. 'He punched and kicked her about the body and stamped on her several times.' Brownless' final attack was committed on a girl he tried to kiss at a house party. When she rejected him, he ran at her and punched her to the mouth, nose and forehead causing her to fall to the floor, the court heard. She suffered a burst lip, black eye and bruising around her mouth. One of his victims said in a statement: 'I think it's disgusting that he would do that to girls. He's a bully and needs to learn he can't do that.' Paul Cleasby, mitigating, said: 'When sober he's straight forward and rational. His family speak well of him when he is not in drink.' Judge David Hatton said: 'I'm limited in the sentence that I can impose unfortunately because the appropriate sentence would be considerably higher and greater than that which I'm allowed to impose.' Brownless's case is just the latest in recent weeks to spark anger among campaigners. Earlier this month, killer Colin Noddings (pictured) walked free from court despite threatening the son of his former wife, Deana, after he was released from prison having served less than four years for her manslaughter. Campaigners Civitas branded the six-month suspended sentence the 63-year-old was given 'a scandalously feeble response.' The group's David Green said: 'The suspended sentence might as well have been an absolute discharge.' It came after a judge apologised to the latest victims of armed robber Derek Rossi after he was released on licence from a second life sentence. Rossi was given his third life term for a robbery of a London bookmakers last month, but Judge Peter Clarke admitted she should never have been freed at all. He said to the victims: 'I wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position.' Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said of the judge's comments: 'This is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk.' It was also revealed last month that four out of five serial burglars now avoid prison or get off with short sentences. Of the 993 serial burglars who were dealt with by the courts in 2011, only 214 were jailed for three years or more, figures show . The soft punishments were handed out despite a statement by then-Lord Chief Justice Igor Judge in 2009 urging judges to recognise the seriousness of burglary. He said: ‘Something precious is violated by burglary of a home and those who perpetrate this crime should be sentenced and punished accordingly.'","Sam Brownless assaulted a group of women in a late-night attack .

"By . Joel Christie . Nearly one year after they were both seriously injured in the Boston Marathon attack, Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino were married on Friday, following many tough months of recovery. The couple said 'I do' on a 19th-century estate in North Carolina, with the bride slowly walking down the aisle using a special crutch for her left leg, which may soon be amputated due to the severity of her wounds. She was guided by her father, Tim, and son Noah, six, down a bed of pink-and yellow-hued rose petals to her awaiting groom, NBC News reported. Sniffles were heard throughout the short ceremony, though the crowd laughed when the officiant asked Rebekah if she would take DiMartino as her husband: ""Absolutely!"" she replied. Scroll down for video . Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino both suffered serious leg injuries in the Boston Bombing attack, but after becoming engaged after the incident, they are now officially husband and wife . The couple were at Boston’s iconic road race as spectators, waiting to see DiMartino’s mother cross the finish line, when two bombs blasted through the crowd on April 15. Though they’d only known each other about a year, the attack made them realize how short life can be, Rebekah says, and DiMartino, 29, proposed in October. 'We really appreciate each other so much more. I’ve fallen deeper in love with Pete every single day,' Rebekah (now Mrs. DiMartino), 26, told NBC News. The couple’s big day was in many ways organized by everyday Americans voting via wedding planning website, TheKnot.com, who awarded them the dream wedding free of charge. The catch was that readers of the site selected Rebekah’s dress (Sophia Moncelli), the location (Biltmore Estate) and their rings. On the morning of the Boston Marathon, Rebekah Gregory, her son Noah, and boyfriend Peter Dimartino were waiting for Dimartino's mom to cross the finish line when the blasts happened . Nearly one year after they were seriously injured in the Boston Marathon attack, Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino wed on Friday on a 19th-century estate in North Carolina . While DiMartino is from Rochester, New York, and Gregory is from Richmond, Texas, North Carolina was chosen as the location because it was the couple's favorite vacation spot. The wedding photos were taken by Allan Zepeda. During the Boston bombing, Rebekah's son was with the couple. When the blast detonated - killing three people and wounding 275 others - Rebekah's body acted as a shield to her son. Noah . suffered injuries to his lungs and scrapes and bruises, but DiMartino . and Gregory both required multiple surgeries and both continue to . undergo rehabilitation. Joy: Boston bombing survivors Rebekah Gregory and Pete DiMartino show off her engagement ring after he proposed in October. The couple  won their dream wedding from website The Knot . Joy: Rebekah said she screamed 'yes!' before Pete could even ask her to marry him last October . Strong: The couple, who both suffered serious leg injuries in the April blast, are pictured together before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in May . On the mend: Rebekah was only able to stand on her own two . feet just before Christmas following the April attack . Rebekah underwent a staggering 14 surgeries following the blast and told The Knot that her leg still might need to be amputated. As well as a ruptured eardrum, DiMartino lost 90 per cent of his right Achilles' tendon and suffered broken bones in his ankles and it has taken him months of physical therapy to learn to walk again. But the couple has leaned on each other for support during their recoveries. One day in October, Rebekah told Pete she needed him. He jumped in his car, with a custom-made ring in his pocket. 'I was having a rough day and I called Pete and told him, ""I just need you here right now"",' she told The Knot. 'I was in complete shock when I saw Pete. He got down on one knee and before he could even ask, I said, ""yes!""' Happy: They had been dating for a year before their engagement and said the tragedy brought them closer . Hurt: The couple was standing at the marathon finishing line when the bombs detonated last April . She added: 'Being able to show people that you can take something so horrible and turn it into something so beautiful has been such a blessing to us.' Just before Christmas, a device that . had been drilled into Rebekah's bone was removed and replaced with a . cast - allowing her to stand again for the first time since the tragedy. ‘To put two feet on the ground again was the most amazing feeling,’ she told NBC News at the time. ‘And just right before Christmas, too. It’s like, what an amazing present this year.’ But Gregory still has a long way to go, and she has described the moment she put her foot down in the boot as extremely painful. ‘It . was awful. It was the worst pain all over again,’ she said. ‘Putting it . on the ground doesn’t feel right and it feels like it’s just crushing . what bones I have left.’ Her doctors estimated that it would be another six months to a year before she is walking more freely. She said she is so motivated by the achievement. Blast: An image shows the first of two bombs that detonated at the Boston marathon finishing line last year . ‘It . just hit me: I’ve come such a long way and even though I have such a . long way to go, I’m so blessed for this journey and to be able to help . people and inspire people along the way,’ she said. The . couple met on a work trip. 'Going through an experience like the . marathon makes you realize how short life really is and how we don't . really know how much time we have left,' Gregory said. 'And I know that with my time . there is nobody else I would want to spend it with. It made me . realize how much I cared about him and how much he was the only person . for me.'","Pete DiMartino, 28, and Rebekah Gregory, 26, both suffered serious leg injuries as they watched the marathon with Rebekah's son Noah last year .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Labour of wanting the recovery to not recover . The Labour party has been 'praying' the economic recovery does not recover so it can continue to attack the government, Nick Clegg claimed tonight. The Deputy Prime Minister accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of wanting the recession to continue so voters would fee poorer at the time of the general election. But Mr Clegg insisted Labour was to blame for the economic 'mess' left by the last government, and wages were now rising. Mr Miliband will use a speech tomorrow to warn Britain faces another five years of squeezed incomes. He claims the middle classes are missing out on the benefits of a return to growth, with wage rises outstripped by soaring prices. Mr Miliband has rejected calls from within his own party for a more upbeat message to voters, instead claiming ‘millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost of living crisis’. But Mr Clegg hit back at the Labour leader, insisting the opposition had been 'wrong' on all the big economic judgements and had helped to bring 'the country to its knees'. Speaking at City Network, a business forum reception in Central London tonight, Mr Clegg said: 'The Labour leadership has spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise. 'For a long time they insisted that the Coalition’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth. Wrong: the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back. 'Then they claimed unemployment would rise by a million. Wrong: unemployment is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work. 'Now, having decisively lost these . arguments, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have settled on a different refrain: . blaming the Coalition for a crisis in the cost of living.' Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg . Labour has seen its poll lead wither as . the economic recovery has built momentum. Some surveys have put the . party just one point ahead of the Tories, with more people trusting . David Cameron and George Osborne to run the economy. After . predicting that austerity would lead another 1million out of work, . Labour has been stung by figures showing there are 1.2million more . people in jobs than when the coalition was formed. More . recently Mr Miliband has accused the government of overseeing a cost of . living crisis, with people in work seeing small pay rises dwarfed by . increases in food, energy and household bills. However a new study today claimed middle class families weathered the . recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for . free childcare and taking on extra jobs. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed middle class families were not enjoying the benefits of a return to growth . Mr . Clegg admitted it is 'certainly true' that many households have been . under considerable pressure, with some families struggling to make ends . meet. But he added: 'We . mustn't forget what got us here in the first place. In 2008 we . experienced a crisis in our banks which brought the country to its knees . and which damaged our economy in ways which were deep and profound. 'Labour . were the authors of that crisis and yet they now seek to deny any . responsibility for it.  They still do not understand that healthy . household budgets flow directly from a healthy economy - you cannot . divorce the two. 'When . Labour were in government they made each family £3,000 worse off by . overseeing a recession that wiped £112bn from our economy.' He said the coalition was taking . action to help create greater confidence, more jobs and further growth . and helping families by easing childcare costs, freezing fuel duty and . keeping council tax bills down. Official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row . Middle class families weathered the . recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for . free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today . reveals. Households in the . social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and . employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a . think-tank. Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn, the Social Market Foundation said. More . women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the . proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per . cent. An analysis of . household income also found that the middle classes became bargain . seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 . per cent increase in food prices. And . there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the . generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to . cut the cost of a childminder or nursery. Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report. Around . one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income . of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result . of the financial crisis. But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets. Millions of people will be better off by not paying tax on the first £10,500 they earn, Mr Clegg added. He went on: 'Ed Miliband is clutching at straws and now he’s down to his last one. 'Instead . of making specious claims, the Labour party should take responsibility . for the past: apologising to the British people for presiding over the . biggest economic crisis in living memory and pursuing a credible . economic strategy to prove that they have learnt from their mistakes.' Experts . expect wage increases to overtake inflation in the next few months, but . Mr Miliband has made clear he will not abandon the line of attack. He . will use a speech tomorrow to set out what is being bill as ‘the next . big economic reform of One Nation Labour’s plan to tackle the cost of . living crisis’. Tomorrow Mr Miliband is expected to signal action to tackle low pay, increase house building and encourage firms to hire more workers. He will also back a plan for Britain’s great cities and towns to become ‘engines of growth’. Ahead of the speech Mr Miliband warned that the return to economic growth does not mean the financial pain is over. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility predict that real earnings will increase at only half the level of GDP growth in 2015 and will continue to lag behind at least until 2018 - breaking the pattern of decades before the 1990s which saw middle-class living standards improving in line with the economy as a whole. In an article for The Independent, the Labour leader wrote: ‘Millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost-of-living crisis: a few people at the top scoop more and more of the rewards; markets such as energy have become uncompetitive, allowing huge prices to be imposed on consumers; and many of the new jobs being created require fewer skills, pay lower wages and offer less security. ‘This Government cannot deal with these problems because lying beneath its claims of being converted to full employment is an economic ideology built on low pay, low skills, low prospects and low productivity. ‘We can and must do better than this. Labour knows that if Britain stays in this race to the bottom, the cost-of-living crisis will continue - unaddressed and unsolved - for the five years of the next Parliament too. ‘Wages for most people will continue to lag far behind the wealth being created and middle-income families will still be locked out of the benefits of growth.’ But Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband was talking about a problem ‘created by the Labour government’. He said: ‘Labour's Great Recession made people who work hard poorer, and their unbalanced economy saw just one job created in the North and Midlands for every 10 created in the South. ‘Our long-term economic plan to secure a better for the whole of Britain is about creating jobs in every part of our country - meaning more people having the security of a regular pay packet. That's the only way to raise living standards for everyone. ‘But Ed Miliband has no plan. All he offers is short-term quick fixes, and more spending, more borrowing and more taxes. That's exactly what got us into a mess in the first place, and hardworking people will pay the price with a less secure future.’","Lib Dem Deputy PM steps up call for apology from Labour for the crash .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . 'Calculating': Liam Ryan, 21, posed as a medical researcher the Gumtree website to lure women to his flat and sexually assault them . A 'calculating sexual predator' posed as a gynaecological researcher to lure young women to his flat and sexually assault them. Student Liam Ryan, 21, posted an ad on the Gumtree website calling for female volunteers to take part in 'global medical research', in exchange for £500. More than 200 women, mainly cash-strapped students, responded to Ryan's online advert, but only two - including a 19-year-old - agreed to be examined. The women were promised £500 for undergoing an invasive internal examination at Ryan's flat in a tower block in Birmingham. But when the former business management student failed to hand over the cash, the police were informed. Ryan pleaded guilty to two charges of assault by penetration and three charges of engaging in sexual activity without consent at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday. He was jailed for four and a half years, ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life and was made the subject of a ten-year sex offender prevention order. Detective Constable Susan Mabbett of West Midlands Police said after the sentencing: 'Liam Ryan is a calculating sexual predator who deliberately targeted vulnerable women via the internet. 'If it had not been for the courage of these women who contacted us, I have no doubt that he would have continued to offend. 'I commend their strength of character which has resulted in this man being jailed. When released he will be closely monitored. 'Of course, all of this comes too late for them. They will forever be haunted by their attacker’s depraved acts.' 'Predator': More than 200 women responded to Ryan's call for volunteers posted on the Gumtree website . The court was told that Ryan, who ran his scam from his flat in Highgate, Birmingham, claimed to be carrying out international medical research for a Canadian university. One 19-year-old victim was subjected to a degrading 40-minute attack that Ryan claimed was important scientific research, the court heard. She returned home to Manchester but only realised she had been sexually assaulted when she received no cash after the so-called examination. She reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police who contacted West Midlands Police. Ryan was arrested last December on suspicion of sexual assault. Officers swooped on Ryan’s home where they discovered thousands of pages of mobile phone records and emails from 200 women. All the women were contacted by police but only a handful came forward to say that they had realised the project was a scam and had not pursued Ryan’s offer. Others could not be traced. They discovered Ryan had targeted a 24-year-old PhD student from Birmingham who became suspicious and refused to take part in the examination. When officers quizzed Ryan he initially claimed the project was legitimate but later admitted he had invented the story in order to abuse women.","Liam Ryan posed as a medical researcher in online advert to lure vulnerable women to his Birmingham flat .

"By . Daniel Martin . Plea: Norman Lamb, the care services minister, has written to NHS England to demand assurances that GPs are not making referrals for gay conversion therapy . NHS family doctors may be referring gay people for controversial treatments designed to change their sexuality, a minister said last night. Norman Lamb, the care services minister, has written to NHS England to demand assurances that GPs are not making referrals for gay conversion therapy. He said it would be ‘entirely wrong’ for GPs or mental health professionals to do so, and that if any evidence comes to light he would act quickly to ‘eradicate’ it. However, he ruled out a complete ban on gay conversion therapy in the Health Service, saying he did not want doctors to fear prosecution merely for counselling someone coming to terms with their sexuality. The vast majority of health professionals say the so-called ‘therapy’ belongs to a past when homosexuality was illegal and when people believed sexuality was a choice. The most recent survey of psychotherapists, in 2009, found that 17 per cent of the 1,300 who answered admitted trying to help at least one client reduce the attraction felt for someone of the same sex. A third of these people had been referred from within the NHS by their GP.Around 40 per cent were apparently treated within an NHS practice - although it is not known whether this means their treatment was paid for by the NHS. Mr Lamb spoke out after 15 MPs from all parties wrote to him to demand a ban on NHS gay conversion therapy. Campaigners want statutory regulation of psychotherapists, with disciplinary action against anyone involved in gay conversion therapy. He told The Guardian: ‘It is based on the completely false premise that there is something wrong with you if you happen to be gay. I certainly want to do what I can, as a Liberal Democrat, to eradicate this. Support: In a debate on the issue on the Commons in November, Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert said: 'In the 21st century, no lesbian, gay bisexual or transgender individual should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology' ‘I don’t think there should be referrals to professionals in the NHS. I haven’t seen evidence of referrals, but in a vast system [like the NHS] one imagines that could happen. So we have to be clear about the inappropriateness of that.’ He has written to NHS England to stress that NHS money should not be spent in this way. ‘There are steps we can take to make sure it has no place in the NHS,’ he said. ‘We can also send a clear signal that health professionals within the NHS should not be referring people - it would be entirely wrong to make referrals.’ Mr Lamb said an outright ban on the practice would be unworkable. ‘There will be people who want help with coming to terms with their sexuality and need to be able to seek support from a professional,’ he said. It was important to avoid a situation where a doctor or therapist felt they could not counsel someone in that situation. ‘We must not end up with a situation where we end up with people fearing they will be prosecuted.’ In a debate on the issue on the Commons in November, Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert said: ‘In the 21st century, no lesbian, gay bisexual or transgender individual should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology. ‘Instead we should be providing services which help them give confidence and support them with their sexuality.’","Norman Lamb asked whether GPs are making gay conversion referrals .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . She has worked in farming for almost four decades - and is patron of nearly 50 organisations in the British countryside. But tonight, Princess Anne was happy to speak out about gassing as the most humane way to cull the badger population. The Princess Royal said she supported the controversial method - deeming it a 'much nicer way' to kill badgers than shooting. Voicing her opinion: Princess Anne has cited gassing as a 'much nicer way' to cull badgers than shooting . In an interview with BBC's Countryfile programme, she said: 'Most of the people who did [badger culling] in the past will tell you that gas is a much nicer way of doing it, if that's not a silly expression, because of the way it works. 'And how it works is that you go to sleep, basically. I don't believe that shooting was ever a particularly good . way of dealing with it.' Princess Anne runs the sprawling Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, where bovine TB has wiped out a third of one of her herds in the past two years. She said she thought badgers were a 'source' of the TB outbreak due to their increasing population - adding that the rise in numbers could cause problems for other species such as hedgehogs, bees . and ground-nesting birds. Interview: The Princess Royal told BBC's Countryfile that the gassing method was like 'going to sleep, basically' Health risk: She said she thought badgers were a 'source' of bovine TB due to their increasing population . Appearing on the BBC One show, the Princess Royal also said genetically . modified crops 'have a role to play' in helping feed the world, putting . her at stark odds with her older brother Prince Charles. The Queen's daughter admitted she seldom discusses the issue with the Prince of Wales, who once . suggested the method risked creating ‘the biggest disaster . environmentally of all time’. She said new methods were needed to ensure the world's population is . adequately fed, adding that those who are opposed to the idea have to . accept GM crops will be cultivated. Speaking out: Appearing on the BBC One show, she also suggested that eating horsemeat is 'worth looking at' as a way of reducing the numbers of neglected or abandoned horses. Above, Princess Anne with her horse . On camera: 'The meat trade adds value to the animals so there is some point in keeping it healthy,' she said .

She said: 'The meat trade adds value to the animals so there is some point in . keeping it healthy if there's an end point it can go to.' She added that she had tried eating horse meat in past - and had found it tasted 'very good'. Home: Princess Anne has run the sprawling Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire for nearly 40 years . Princess Anne's comments about gassing badgers came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson . refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls. An . independent report found that the ‘controlled shooting’ used so far has . not been an efficient or humane way to reduce the number of badgers in . the South West. Her remarks have been met with fury from animal rights campaigners and zoologists, who argue that gassing - which was banned in 1982 - is inhumane. At odds with Charles: The Princess Royal also said GM crops 'have a role to play' in helping feed the world . An . independent report published on Thursday found that the badger cull in . Somerset and Gloucestershire had been marred by poor marksmanship. Badgers had in some cases taken longer than five minutes to die and far too few animals were killed. Controlled shooting - the shooting of free-running badgers - was not an efficient way of killing the animals, the report found. Princess Anne's comments about gassing badgers came after Environment Secretary Owen Paterson refused to scrap the controversial pilot badger culls . Professor . Rosie Woodroffe, senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of . London, said: ‘Gassing badgers was government policy in the 1970s, and . reports of the time are full of frustration about how it just wasn’t . very effective. ‘Sub-lethal concentrations of gas were inhumane. That’s why gassing was banned by ministers in 1982. ‘The . problem seemed to be that badger setts are built to hold warm air in . and keep cold drafts out - so it was very difficult to achieve lethal . concentrations of gas.’ She added: ‘Culling works against the grain of badger ecology and behaviour. ‘It’s . much more promising to explore the possibilities for vaccination, which . could potentially exploit the same aspects of badger biology to improve . the effectiveness of TB control.’ Meanwhile, Mark . Jones, of Humane Society International, said: ‘It is extremely . disappointing that a prominent member of the royal family should endorse . the gassing of a supposedly protected indigenous wild mammal. ‘Gassing . experiments carried out at Porton Down in the early 1980s were . abandoned because of the appalling levels of suffering to which the . badgers were exposed. ‘Any . attempt to reintroduce gassing would doubtless result in a slow and . painful death for many badgers, and potentially other non-target . animals.’ But tonight, the Princess Royal backed the gassing method - and claimed that she did not think her willingness to cull badgers was incompatible with her passion for wildlife. She also advocated the use of land for smaller rural developments, built in groups of 'about ten' with proper telephone and internet access.","Princess Royal described gassing as 'much nicer way' to cull badgers .

"Asbo: Aaron Knowles, 14, has been banned associating with his own brothers after leading them into a gang of youths who terrorised their neighbourhood . A baby-faced teenager who terrorised his neighbourhood has been banned from hanging around with the rest of his gang - including two of his own brothers. Aaron Knowles, 14, was handed an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) after leading a gang of youths aged nine to 19 on a campaign of vandalism and abuse in Preston, Lancashire. He and his gang, whom residents compared to the pint-sized mobsters of Bugsy Malone, would regularly throw stones at people, hurl abuse at passers-by and were even involved in assaults. Residents in the Broadgate area of Preston were left 'frightened and intimidated' by the boys, whom police said had their lives 'made a misery' by the gang. The order bans Knowles him from visiting his usual haunts, and also from being in the company of nine other gang members - including his younger siblings Marcus Knowles, 13, and Jamie Knowles, nine. The brothers will not be allowed out together unless their parents or another family member is looking after them. Police said fed-up residents were 'practically queuing up' to make complaints against Knowles and his gang when a police officer was sent to patrol the area. The officer compiled a dossier of evidence against Knowles and his accomplices and persuaded magistrates in Preston to grant a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) against him. The courts also ordered that Knowles should be publicly named and shamed. Under the conditions of the order, Knowles is banned from the Broadgate area, and faces a five-year prison sentence if he is caught using foul language or being abusive towards people in the nearby Riversway area of the city. Aaron Knowles was banned from associating with nine boys, including two of his brothers. Two members of the violent and abusive gang are still at primary school: . Keaton McMillan, nineJamie Knowles, nineAndrew Aspden, 11Marcus Knowles, 13Connor Silcock, 14Adam Clayton, 15Declan Caroll, 15Marvin Wiltshire, 16Conor Walmsley, 19 . Police will also distribute leaflets to residents and shops featuring Knowles's police mugshot and warning people of the conditions of his ban. One local said: 'Those boys are nothing but a menace and Aaron is the worst of the lot. He may look like butter won’t melt but he’s got a mouth on him that will shock anyone. 'They go round thinking like they're something out of Bugsy Malone but they’re not loveable at all. 'They must be to blame for half the vandalism and graffiti in the area and those lads would be jostling the residents whenever they went to the shops or out an errands. 'Some people dreaded going out for fear of bumping into them. Most of us blame the parents but I bet they must be mortified too.' The Knowles brothers live their mother Michelle Riding and father Mark Knowles. At their Victorian terraced home in Preston a man who answered the door said: 'We don’t want to talk about this.' But a relative said: 'We believe this is all down to parenting more than anything else. They could be nice boys but we never see them and it’s such a shame.' Another said: 'We heard Aaron is regularly seen out about smoking and causing trouble. There’s no point beating around the bush - they haven’t had much parenting. 'The fact is if they are allowed to do what they want then they are going to go out and do it if the parents aren’t going to stop them.' Ban: Knowles is banned by his Asbo from going to the Broadgate area of Preston in Lancashire . In a statement Lancashire Police said: 'Knowles was part of a group that had been blighting the lives of residents in the Broadgate area and was involved in several incidents which police responded to, including assaults, stone throwing, criminal damage, loitering around local shops and businesses, and being abusive towards people living in the vicinity.' Broadgate Community Beat Manager PC Carl Ingram added: 'Aaron Knowles has been making life a misery for a large proportion of the Broadgate neighbourhood. 'Residents were practically queuing up to make complaints as I patrolled the area. 'People were saying that the noise and the abuse was making them ill to the point where they were wanting to move away from the area. 'We are committed to making sure Preston is not blighted by this type of behaviour and we will continue to use tactics such as Asbos to improve the quality of life for local residents.'","Aaron Knowles, 14, led a gang who threw rocks and hurled abuse at locals .

"By . Wills Robinson . Supermarket giant Asda have apologised to a pensioner after they charged her more than £50 - for a cabbage. Jean Hudson, 61, thought nothing of the sky high food bill from her shop at the store in Tipton, West Midlands, and initially blamed the rising cost of food. But it wasn't until she scrutinised the receipt that she realised that instead of paying just 30p for the item, she actually shelled out £53.55. Rip-off: Jean Hudson, 61, from Sedgley, West Midlands, was charged over £53 for a cabbage at an Asda supermarket in nearby Tipton. It should have cost just 30p . Expensive: She took the cabbage back to the store where an employee crossed out the value . While husband Graham had grumbled over the sky-high fees Mrs Hudosn from Sedgley, West Midlands, thought nothing of it and carried out of the store and she didn't notice the mistake until she reached her car . Speaking yesterday the grandmother-of-four said: 'We were at the checkout and we went to pay and my husband said that the bill was a little steep, but I didn't think anything of it to be honest. 'It's not unusual for us to spend a little more if there is a deal on. 'We had bought extra items including biscuits and a few items for the Tipton Food bank and coffee for my son, so I thought nothing of it, but my husband kept grumbling about the amount all the way out of the shop and across the car park. 'I wasn't angry, more amused at first, it won't stop me from going back to the store. 'We went back to the customer services and showed the lady my receipt. She was more shocked than I was and seemed very concerned. Shocked: Mrs Hudson's husband said the bill was a little steep, but she did not realise the error until she got into her car . 'Although I found the whole thing rather humorous, some people may not have noticed and could have paid over the odds.' The store gave Mrs Hudson a refund and a £2 voucher as a gesture of goodwill. A spokesperson for Asda said: 'A system glitch meant that the cabbage was scanned at the wrong price. We're sorry for any inconvenience caused and we'll ensure this doesn't happen again.' This is the second time the supermarket chain has been caught out by a pricing error in recent weeks. Last month Warehouse worker John Brown, 37, revealed he had been charged over £400 for a loaf of bread - which should have cost under a fiver from a branch in nearby Wolverhampton.

Burberry’s former high flying boss Angela Ahrendts will be made an honorary dame today for services for business. But it is unlikely to be a glamorous affair for the woman credited with turning the British fashion house into one of the world’s most coveted luxury brands. Instead of a trip to Buckingham Palace to receive her gong from the Queen, the 53 year old American will have to make her way to the non-descript headquarters of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills in Westminister. The master of ceremonies at the event will be business secretary Vince Cable, not Her Majesty. Sources said the ceremony will be ‘very low key’. Non British citizens are not entitled to receive their honour from the Queen at Buckingham Palace and are instead presented with their awards by the relevant secretary of state. Mrs Ahrendts will be allowed to use the letters DBE – Dame of the British Empire – after her name. But she will not be entitled to use the title Dame. Mr Cable will pay tribute to the mother of three, from Indiana, describing her as a ‘landmark figure in business’ and a ‘powerful role model to the next generation of young British talent.’ He will say:  ‘She has revitalised this iconic British brand with flair and cutting edge innovation, allied with sound commercial acumen.’ Angela Ahrendts hired a string of A-listers, to flaunt Burberry’s wares, including most recently supermodel Cara Delevingne . Mrs Ahrendts, who was the highest paid . FTSE 100 chief executive last year with a £16.9million pay package, is . credited with transforming Burberry  into a global powerhouse since she . took the helm in 2006. Vince Cable will pay tribute to Mrs Ahrendts during the low key ceremony . She quit in October last October to head up Apple’s retail operations this month and was replaced by top Burberry designer Christopher Bailey. In the noughties the distinctive beige Burberry check had become closely associated with so-called ‘chavs’, inlcuding minor celebrities, and was widely counterfeited. But Mrs Ahrendts is credited with moving the brand upmarket, hiring a string of A-listers so flaunt Burberry’s wares, including most recently supermodel Cara Delevingne. Sales during her tenure have tripled to more than £1.8billion, with the Kensinton Long Heritage trench coat coming with a hefty £1,195 price tag. Mrs Ahrendts has come a long way since her childhood in the remote outpost of New Palestine, Indiana. One of six children, she sewed her clothes, and has described how her home was so cramped she created a ‘bedroom for herself under the stairs.’ Her success at Burberry has seen her appointed to be a member of the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Group.  Since 2006 she has been named one of the 100 Most Powerful Women in the World by Forbes magazine five times.","Businesswoman Angela Ahrendts will receive honour from Vince Cable .

"By . Tara Brady . David Cameron is under pressure to allow billions of pounds in military spending to count toward his controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid. Senior ministers are backing plans to overhaul the rules governing what can count as aid spending, arguing that Ministry of Defence spending on things such as police training in Afghanistan and support to stabilise Libya should be included. Defence ministers and senior officers have privately been seething at the ring-fencing of the foreign aid budget while spending on the Armed Forces is being squeezed. David Cameron (left) is under pressure to allow billions of pounds in military spending to count toward his commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid and (right) Tobias Ellwood MP . Tobias Ellwood MP, the Prime Minister’s envoy to Nato, has now drawn up detailed proposals for Downing Street suggesting that there is an overwhelming case for military spending to count toward the 0.7 per cent target – set to cost £12billion this year. ‘It is immaterial who signs the cheques, but the nature of the work undertaken,’ the MP writes in a paper seen by the Daily Mail. ‘The current system (or lack thereof) inhibits some departments, notably the MoD, from claiming against millions of pounds worth of stabilisation/post-conflict activity.’ Mr Ellwood said ‘billions’ of the £29billion spent by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan should have counted toward official development assistance (ODA) commitments. Critics of the existing international rules say it is absurd that they rule out most kinds of military expenditure. For example, ministers point out that when HMS Daring was despatched to deliver supplies to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last year, the MoD was allowed to class only the cost of the ship’s fuel as foreign aid. When HMS Daring was dispatched to deliver supplies to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan, the MoD was allowed to class only the cost of the ship¿s fuel as foreign aid . The MoD has already been pushing for the Department for International Development to pay when RAF transport aircraft and helicopters are used for humanitarian work, disaster relief and peacekeeping operations. If more defence spending on such efforts was regarded as foreign aid, Britain would much more easily meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income – criticised by many Tory MPs at a time of domestic austerity. Nato’s Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has also said allies need to modernise their armed forces and spend more on defence as Russia tries to ‘carve up’ Europe. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which monitors nations’ efforts to meet foreign aid targets, is due to meet this weekend in New York to begin work on a potential overhaul of the system. Britain could back a move led by the Netherlands to allow more defence spending to count as aid, according to Government sources. But Justin Forsyth of the Save The Children charity, which works in 120 countries, said he was against changing the way aid spending is measured. ‘Not every country arguing for reform is doing so because they want to maximise the impact on development spending on the poorest people,’ he added. It is not clear whether Mr Cameron will back the call for a fundamental shake-up.","Ministers privately seething at the ring-fencing of foreign aid budget .

"By . Joel Christie . He was a contentious euthanasia activist who claimed to have assisted in the suicides of more than 130 patients, spending eight years in prison on murder charges as a result of one case.Now the secret artworks of the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian - a Michigan-based physician who bore the notorious nickname 'Dr. Death' - have gone on display at a Los Angeles gallery and are available for purchase, with some costing up to $45,000 each.It was little-known that the pathologist was an amateur painter, with his career solely focused on inflaming a nationwide debate in the 1990's about a terminally ill person's right to die.Among the 11 unsettling pieces that make up the exhibition at the Gallerie Sparta in West Hollywood is one depicting an elderly patient slowly being pulled into the mouth of a desk mask, which has been painted to resemble a CAT scan machine. Euthanasia advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- who died in 2011 -- was also an avid painter. Eleven of his works, as well as his 'Thanatron' suicide machine, are on display and for sale this month at Gallerie Sparta in Hollywood, California. This piece is called 'Coma' Kevorkian served eight years in prison for second-degree murder after administering a lethal injection rather than helping the patient do it himself . 'Fever' is meant to depict 'the great discomfort of intense bodily heat,' Kevorkian said. 'The inferno is internal, and in some tragic cases even the will to live is charred.' The work of Jack Kevorkian signified much of what he thought was wrong with modern medicine . His artwork represents his fascination with the intersection between physical and spiritual suffering, like this piece titled 'Paralysis' The painting is called 'Coma', according to CNN.The exhibition also includes the assisted suicide machine that Kevorkian designed and built, the 'Thanatron.'.The contraption helped inject a series of drugs into terminal and incapacitated patients who wished to end their lives.It too is for sale to the highest bidder, at a starting price of $25,000.

This 1999 painting called 'Chromatic Fantasy' is displayed with the Bach portrait and 'Fugue', which displays a bass clef . 'Fugue' is part of the trio of 1999 paintings displayed with the Bach portrait and 'Chromatic Fantasy' Kevorkian created this portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach as an expression of his love for the German composer's music . Kevorkian's medical career ended in 1999 when he was convicted on charges of second degree murder for administering a lethal injection to a patient who was suffering Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, which attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal chord.He spent eight years in prison.In 2011, he died peacefully and pain-free from ongoing kidney disease.He was 83.Efforts to sell the paintings following Kevorkian's death were hampered by a legal dispute over their ownership. For many years, they were housed in the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts, near Boston. Eleven of artworks from Dr. Jack Kevrokian as well as his 'Thanatron' suicide machine, are on display and for sale this month at Gallerie Sparta in Hollywood, California .

"By . Lucy Osborne . Call for action: Fast response officers want to be moved from the top floor of Newtown Police Station in Birmingham - because they keep injuring themselves running down three flights on stairs . A team of fast response officers want to be moved from the top floor of a Midland police station – because they keep injuring themselves when running down three flights of slippery stairs. In what has been compared to a Keystone Cops comedy sketch, three constables have suffered serious injuries in the past year alone trying to get down the old Victorian tiled staircases. Officers at Newtown Police Station in Birmingham claim they have to race down three flights of stairs covered in glazed tiles each time they answer an emergency call. One constable, who is part of the 30-strong response team, said that his colleagues now lose vital minutes by having to walk slowly down the stairs to avoid injury. The officer, who did not want to be named, said: ‘There is a Keystone Cops element to it with officers tumbling down a flight of steps and injuring themselves before they’ve even got out of the building. ‘But on a serious note it’s a real health hazard. ‘It’s daft to have a fast response team located on the top floor of an old Victorian building which has no lifts, just a shabby staircase which is covered in shiny old glazed tiles.’ In the past year alone the station stairs have accounted for a dislocated shoulder, a twisted knee and a sprained back, all of which required hospital treatment and led to numerous days off work. Every police station houses a fast response team of officers, who are usually first to the scene of an emergency incident. Newtown police station on Bridge Street West is one of the force’s busiest hubs, covering the city centre and immediate surrounding areas. Station: Three constables have suffered serious injuries in the past year alone trying to get down the stairs . The response team can be called out dozens of times each shift and such teams are normally located close to station exits for a quick getaway. But at Newtown the team, which includes officers armed with electronic Taser guns, are housed on the top floor with no means of getting to the exits apart from a ‘crumbling’ staircase. ‘It’s just plain stupid for us to be in the most inaccessible part of the station when we are the ones who need to exit it the fastest,’ said the officer. ‘The last thing they need is a Krypton Factor-style assault course to negotiate before they’ve even got outside.’ Taking care: One constable, who is part of the 30-strong response team, said that his colleagues now lose vital minutes by having to walk slowly down the stairs to avoid injury. 'It's a real health hazard,' he said (file picture) Tom Cuddeford, of the Police Federation, said: ‘I’ve not been contacted about these particular incidents but I would urge any officer who has concerns about health and safety issues to bring them to our, or a senior officer’s, attention.’ But Superintendent Rich Baker, from Birmingham West & Central Policing Unit, confirmed: ‘There have been two reported incidents at Newtown Police Station over the last 12 months, involving police officers falling or slipping on stairs as they respond to calls for service. ‘As a result of this, we are in the process of fitting grip strips to all the stairs at the location which will hopefully prevent any further incidents such as this.’","Officers are based on top floor of Newtown Police Station in Birmingham .

"By . Amanda Williams . Under-fire MP Maria Miller has bought a countryside Tudor barn worth £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made from the sale of her taxpayer funded home. The Culture Secretary's new . 16th-century home comprises of a main barn with four bedrooms, three reception . rooms and a study, with an annexe barn with another bedroom and living . area. The Grade II-listed property is set in . 1.6 acres of private gardens, has a large cart shed and a range of outbuildings . including a summer house. Mrs Miller was ordered to pay back just £5,800 pounds after overclaiming £45,000 pounds in expenses for mortgage interest payments and council tax on the south London property where her parents lived, while designating her main home as a rented property in Basingstoke. Under-fire MP Maria Miller has bought a countryside Tudor barn worth £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made from the sale of her taxpayer funded home. The Parliamentary Standards committee heard Mrs Miller, who has three children, bought her three-bedroom London property for £237,500 pounds in 1996 with a 90 per cent mortgage. Having extensively renovated the house, it was then remortgaged to a value of £575,000 pounds. She later sold the home for £1.47million pounds . Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit has become the most senior Conservative to call for Mrs Miller to resign as Culture Secretary, amid controversy over her response to an investigation into her expenses claims. Lord Tebbit said that the Culture Secretary's 'arrogant' handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over MPs' expenses and undermined the Government's message that 'we're all in it together', adding: 'The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.' His call came as Labour promised to reform Parliament's standards system in the wake of controversy over the decision of a panel of MPs to overrule a watchdog's judgment on Mrs Miller. Pressure on the embattled Mrs Miller has also been ramped up by a poll suggesting a large majority of voters think she should be dropped from the Cabinet, stripped of her responsibility for press regulation and thrown out of the House of Commons. It comes after her apology in Parliament which lasted just 32 seconds. A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that almost three-quarters of voters (73 per cent) thought her 32-second apology was inadequate, and similar numbers (75 per cent ) felt David Cameron was wrong to offer her his support. Mr Cameron has twice publicly voiced his support for the Culture Secretary, but yesterday omitted her from a list of several Cabinet ministers who he singled out for praise in a speech to the Conservative Spring Forum. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggested that she was suffering a backlash for being the minister responsible for the same-sex marriage Bill, which was deeply unpopular with many grassroots Tories. Culture Secretary Maria Miller, pictured leaving Parliament after her 32-second apology, is under pressure over the investigation into her expenses . Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit has become the most senior Conservative to call for Mrs Miller to resign as Culture Secretary . Lord Tebbit said that the Culture Secretary's 'arrogant' handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over MPs' expenses and undermined the Government's message that 'we're all in it together' Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'I think she has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances, with the Leveson Inquiry, which has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her. And also the gay marriage stuff - there's a lot of Conservatives out there who perhaps weren't necessarily supportive, who also feel rather bitter about that.' Asked if she should rethink her position, he replied: 'No, I don't think so.' And he warned: 'My view generally is that I'm supportive of Maria, because if we are not careful we end up with a witch-hunt of somebody.' A member of staff at Savills estate agency, which sold it, said: 'It was sold at the beginning of March, it went quite quickly in the end.' The firm's website shows the property as being under offer at £1.2million pounds, with a note stating it may have been sold or removed from the market. The impressive home is described as having: 'A classic 'A' framed oak structure, believed to date back to the 15th or 16th centuries. 'Much of the oak timber was originally reclaimed from older structures some as far back as the 12th century. The barn was sympathetically restored following gales in 1984.'

'I . wish to make a personal statement in relation to today’s report. The . report resulted from an allegation made by the Member for Bassetlaw. 'The . committee has dismissed his allegation. The committee has recommended . that I apologise to the House for my attitude to the Commissioner’s . inquiries, and I of course unreservedly apologise. 'I fully accept the recommendations of  the committee, and thank them for bringing this matter to an end.' Mrs Miller said she spent the majority of her time in her constituency home, but tended to spend three nights per week at her London home when the Commons was sitting. The committee ruled that she should have made a formal arrangement to reduce her mortgage claims in 2008 when the base rate dropped, so her parents, who lived with her, were not benefiting from expenses claims. It found that her parents' living costs were not being paid by the taxpayer and cleared her of making false expenses claims, but said her submission of 'incomplete' evidence to the inquiry had breached the MPs' code of conduct. The Department for Media, Culture and Sport's Twitter feed was hacked on Saturday, with the rogue poster tweeting: '@Maria-MillerMP is like a modern day Robin Hood, she robs the poor to help the rich' and 'Seriously though guys, which one of us hasn't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer?' Mrs Miller could not be reached for a comment. Miller bought her house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000 in 1995 . Many . of the questions raised over Maria Miller’s expenses claims centred on . the Wimbledon property that she designated as her second home. Critics . felt that because her parents  lived in the house, it should be . designated as her main residence – not the rented  cottage in her . Hampshire constituency. The . Culture Secretary bought the property with her solicitor husband Iain . for  just £234,000 in 1995 – while she still  worked as an executive for . London agency Grey Advertising. Taxpayers . were billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – . the year Mrs Miller became MP for Basingstoke – because she designated . it as her second home.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Grave charges: Laurel Schlemmer, 40, has been charged with homicide after telling police that 'crazy voices' told her to drown her two sons in the bath . A six-year-old Pennsylvania boy whose mother allegedly held him underwater in a bathtub died on Saturday, four days after his younger brother drowned. The boy, Daniel Schlemmer, had been declared brain dead after authorities say he and his three-year-old brother, Luke, were submerged underwater by their mother at their McCandless home on Tuesday in western Pennsylvania. Laurel Michelle Schlemmer, 40m is being held in the Allegheny County Jail without bond on criminal homicide and other charges in the death of her younger child. With Daniel's death, the charges against her are expected to be amended. County detectives say the mother told them she tried to drown both boys by sitting on them in the tub after a third son left for school. They say she told investigators she heard ""crazy voices"" telling her to push the boys underwater. Daniel had been on life support at a Pittsburgh hospital, according to the prosecutor's office. Schlemmer didn't speak during a short video conference earlier this week, and her attorney, Michael Machen, declined to comment afterward. Machen got court permission to have Schlemmer evaluated by a psychiatrist hired by her family. She appeared in a special vest that is designed to prevent inmates from tearing off their clothes and is on suicide watch at the jail. County detectives said Schlemmer told them she tried to drown both boys after her 7-year-old son left for school that day. Schlemmer told detectives she thought she could be a better mother to her oldest son 'if the other two boys weren't around, and they would be better off in heaven', a police complaint said. She also told police she got into the tub, fully clothed, and sat on the boys because 'crazy voices were telling her to push the boys down into the water'. The boys' father, Mark Schlemmer, was at work at the time. Scroll down for video . Family tragedy: Mrs Schlemmer confessed that she told her two younger sons, three-year-old Luke (far left) and six-year-old Daniel (far right) to get in the tub and then sat on them, believing she could be a better mother to her older son (center) with them gone . Tight-knit community: The deadly drowning took place in the Schlemmers' home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive in upscale bedroom community of McCandless, Pennsylvania . Child welfare officials are scrutinizing the drowning and the family's contact with Allegheny County's Office of Children, Youth and Families. The deadly incident comes less than a year after Schlemmer was questioned for nearly running over the two boys. She was never charged. North Park Church Pastor Dan Hendley said that the van incident happened in the driveway of the boys' grandparents in a town near McCandless, where Schlemmer had been living with her sons. ‘There was no concern that there was anything but a terrible accident that occurred in that situation,’ Hendley said. Schlemmer also received a citation for leaving a toddler unattended in a parked car September 5, 2009, in nearby Ross Township. Court records don't indicate which child was in the car, but police said the car's interior was 112 degrees when officers arrived. Family torn apart: Mrs Schlemmer worked as a teacher until 2004, while her husband of nine years, Mark, is an actuary. Her two youngest sons Luke, 3 (center) and Daniel, 6, (left) were drowned to death on Tuesday . Memorial: A stuffed leopard sits next to a votive candle  Wednesday along a walkway outside the home in McCandless, Pa., where two children were found unresponsive in a bathtub Tuesday . Tragedy struck Tuesday morning after Mrs Schlemmer's seven-year-old son left . for school. She put the . older boy on the bus at around 8.40am, then told the younger boys to . take off their pajamas and get into the bathtub. 'Schlemmer . said after the boys got into the tub she got into the tub ""fully . clothed"" and ""crazy voices"" were telling her to push the boys down into . the water,' the complaint said. 'Schlemmer explained that at one point she [was] sitting on top of boys while they were under the water in the tub.'. Red flags: Mrs Schlemmer was suspected of trying to back over her children with her car last year, and in 2009, she was cited for leaving one of her kids in a hot car unattended . Schlemmer . pulled both unconscious boys out of the tub and laid them on the . bathroom floor while she called 911. She told police she never attempted . CPR because she did not know how to do it . Paramedics who responded to the colonial home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive rushed Luke and Daniel Schlemmer to UPMC Passavant Hospital, where the younger boy was pronounced dead at around 10.50am. His brother . was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's . Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC, where police said he remained in . critical condition. On a 911 call placed just minutes after Schlemmer had . allegedly drowned her children, the mother sounded halting but calm and extremely . polite, reported the Pittsburgh Post--Gazette. 'Um, my two sons,’ Schlemmer said, ‘I think that they’ve, they’ve drowned in our bathtub.’ During the five-minute conversation with the dispatcher, Schlemmer explained that she let her sons to play in the bathtub while she went to the restroom, and by the time she returned to check on them, both children were unconscious. Later, the operator asked if the boys had anything in their mouths. 'Just water,' the mother replied. Spiritual adviser: Pastor Dan Hendley (left), who has known the Schlemmers for years, said the family appeared to be doing very well since last year's incident when the mother backed over her sons with her van . Word that the two little boys were found unresponsive stunned neighbors in the quiet, upscale bedroom community a few miles north of Pittsburgh. They described the family as religious and said Schlemmer was a stay-at-home mom. According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the couple got married in 2005. Mr Schlemmer is employed as an actuary, while his wife worked as a teacher at Kerr Elementary School and Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel School District from 1999 until 2004. The Schlemmers have been long-time members of the North Park Church congregation, where the wife had been attending Bible studies since her 20s. ‘They were a wonderful couple, strong Christians,’ Rev. Bob Shull, a former associate pastor at the church who officiated the Schlemmers’ wedding ceremony in 2005, told Pittsburgh Tribune Review. Two bouquets of flowers were tucked Wednesday into a bush at the front of the family's home on a winding street of tidy split-level houses and manicured yards. Mourners also left a small stuffed leopard and a burning votive candle. Exemplary family: Neighbors described  the Schlemmers as religious and the wife was a stay-at-home mother . Schlemmer . faces a preliminary hearing April 11. Other charges against her include . reckless endangerment, aggravated assault and tampering with physical . evidence, for allegedly hiding her wet clothes in a trash bag and then . hiding that bag under three other bags. Pastor . Hendley and other friends at the evangelical Presbyterian congregation . were working to help Mark Schlemmer, who is currently staying with a friend. The pastor said the husband was distraught but what happened, but not hostile toward his wife. ‘I'd question whether they're ever going to go back to that house given what's occurred,’ Hendley said.","Laurel Schlemmer, 40, said she wanted to drown her youngest children so she could be a better mother to her seven-year-old son .
