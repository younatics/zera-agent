"Miami (CNN) -- The University of Miami announced Sunday that it is barring its football team from bowl consideration this year as it remains under investigation by the NCAA over allegations that a booster showered dozens of players with cash and jewelry, and supplied prostitutes for players. ""We understand and share the disappointment that our student-athletes, coaches, staff, supporters and fans are feeling but after lengthy discussions among university leaders, athletic administrators and outside counsel, it is a necessary step for our university,"" a statement released by the school said. With their sixth win Saturday against the University of South Florida, the Hurricanes became bowl-eligible under NCAA requirements. However, as a result of the self-imposed ban, the team will play its final game of the season Friday vs. Boston College. The Hurricanes community has been rocked since August by allegations leveled by Nevin Shapiro, a onetime Miami businessman serving a 20-year federal prison term for fraud. Shapiro told Yahoo Sports this summer that he showered dozens of Miami players with cash and jewelry, paid restaurant and nightclub tabs and supplied prostitutes over an eight-year period -- and that several coaches were aware of the activity. Shapiro was arrested in 2010 on charges of overseeing a Ponzi scheme that prosecutors determined totaled $930 million. He pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in September, and his accusations against Miami were part of his agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, his lawyer told CNN in August. The statement released Sunday said the university will ""continue to work cooperatively with the NCAA on the joint inquiry to determine the true facts.""","The team is under investigation by the NCAA .

"(CNN) -- A New York man authorities say once pondered changing his name to Osama Hussein to honor his personal heroes -- Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein -- remained jailed Monday on bomb-related charges in what police described as a plot to attack police, military personnel and postal facilities. Police arrested Jose Pimentel, 27, on Sunday at the apartment of a confidential informant in the case when a video camera showed him drilling holes in pipes that would become the casings for bombs, according to a criminal complaint. Pimentel allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested, according to the complaint. ""Pimentel's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely, bomb making,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. While serious, the charges against Pimentel are a far cry from the mass-casualty attacks that have been al Qaeda's hallmark, and his case may reflect the weakened nature of the terrorist organization in the wake of the death of many top leaders, CNN security analyst Peter Bergen said. ""If this is the big threat that we face, lone wolves using Internet recipes, we're in a pretty good place,"" Bergen said. Pimentel was arraigned Sunday night in a New York court on state charges of possession of a bomb for terrorism, conspiracy as a crime of terrorism, soliciting support for a terrorist act, being a felon in possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and arson, according to the criminal complaint. He planned to attack police officers, patrol cars and service members returning from service abroad, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. ""The suspect was a so-called lone wolf, motivated by his own resentment of the presence of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as inspired by al Qaeda propaganda,"" Bloomberg said. ""He was not part of a larger conspiracy emanating from abroad."" New York authorities have communicated with federal authorities, but even though Pimentel's alleged targets were federal troops and facilities, his case will be handled in New York courts, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said. Pimentel's attorney, Joseph Zablocki, said the case against his client is nowhere near as strong as authorities say. ""As they admit, he has a very public online profile, and that flies in the face of everything that they've said,"" Zablocki said at the hearing. ""This is not the way you go about committing terrorist attacks."" Pimentel, also known as Muhammad Yusuf, according to the criminal complaint, had a ""very active and very public online profile,"" prosecutors said. They cited the website TrueIslam1. After his arrest, Pimentel told police that he believes Islamic law requires Muslims to wage war against the United States, including assassinations, according to the criminal complaint against him. Pimentel's mother, Carmen Sosa, said her family is in shock over the allegations. ""I'm upset about what my son did, but on the other hand, he's my son,"" she said. ""I still love my son. I love the son I know, maybe a lot of people don't know."" A neighbor, Simon Islam, said Pimentel was nice but ""didn't seem like normal."" Still nothing stood out to make him or his wife particularly suspicious of Pimentel, he said. ""It's really shocking because I have two daughters in the building. It's like making me think that this is an unsafe place,"" he said. Pimentel's uncle Luis Saverino told CNN affiliate WABC-TV that his sister's son lived with him and that he had no idea what his nephew was up to inside his bedroom, which he always kept locked. Kelly said Pimentel is a follower of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who rose to become a top figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula before a U.S. drone strike killed him this year in Yemen. He allegedly tried to contact al-Awlaki directly before the cleric's death, but never got a response, according to officials. In August, the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot, Kelly said. He ""jacked up his speed"" after al-Awlaki's death on September 30, according to the police commissioner. ""We knew for the last two years, he's been reading a lot of jihadist information and talked a lot of inflammatory rhetoric,"" Kelly said of Pimentel. ""But it appears at this juncture the death of Anwar al-Awlaki motivated him and made him increase his tempo."" He had also sought to visit Yemen for training, according to authorities. Pimentel bought ingredients at Home Depot and other stores for the three bombs that he was working to make, mindful to shop around so as not to ""raise red flags,"" according to the police commissioner. He allegedly planned to test an explosive device in a mailbox before using it against other targets. His aim, the police commissioner said, was to show there were ""mujahedin"" -- or Islamic militants -- in the city ready to wage ""jihad."" At the news conference announcing Pimentel's arrest, authorities showed a video of a car being destroyed by a bomb they built according to the instructions the suspect allegedly was following. But Bergen said it's not clear that Pimentel could have built a device that would have exploded with the same force, given that several would-be bombers failed to build devices that successfully detonated. ""Building a bomb from a recipe off the Internet doesn't mean you're going to build a bomb that does what we saw on the video,"" Bergen said. An unemployed native of the Dominican Republican and a U.S. citizen, Pimentel had lived most of his life in Manhattan, except for five years in Schenectady, New York. Authorities had monitored him since 2009, and his extreme positions ""made even some of his like-minded friends nervous,"" said Kelly. The commissioner said Pimentel even talked about changing his name to Osama Hussein -- in honor of his now deceased ""heroes"" bin Laden and Hussein, the Iraqi dictator. He allegedly learned how to make a pipe bomb after reading an article entitled ""How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom"" in Inspire, an online English-language magazine published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The issue that came out just before al-Awlaki's death emphasized that al Qaeda supporters in the West should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves. ""He was a reader of al Qaeda's slick online magazine Inspire -- and inspire him it did,"" Vance said. ""His stated desire to attack our servicemen and women ... could have come from an al Qaeda playbook."" CNN national security analyst Frances Townsend said it seemed odd that federal authorities were not involved in the case, particularly given the targets. ""The feds may have been able to help here,"" she said. ""That being said, they had a successful arrest, and we'll see what we can learn from it."" CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Catherine Shoichet and Hussein Saddique contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect's family shocked by allegations, his mother says .

"(CNN) -- For most of the year London's O2 Arena, located on the south bank of the famous River Thames, plays host to the world's biggest music acts. But since 2009, the venue has also spent one week in November staging tennis' season-ending showpiece -- the ATP World Tour Finals. The event pits the world's top eight male tennis players and doubles pairings against each other in a round-robin contest, with an unbeaten winner pocketing a check for $1.63 million. But before the elite of the game can do battle on the court, the O2 must be transformed from a concert venue to a world-class tennis facility. That's where World Tour Finals tournament director Chris Kermode and his team come in. Can Federer make World Tour Finals history? ""The build time that we have is very short,"" Kermode told CNN. ""Rihanna was here on Tuesday night until midnight and we moved in at 1am in the morning on Wednesday. ""We had two days to turn the O2 Arena from probably the greatest music venue in the world into the greatest sporting venue in the world."" The electric blue court, neon digital displays and dazzling lights give the 17,500 fans packed into the O2 an experience which is poles apart from the regal aura which surrounds the grass courts of Wimbledon -- located just 10 miles away. ""The O2 is pretty much a music venue,"" explains Kermode. ""Laying the court might sound quite basic but it's actually quite time consuming. ""We stage it in a very different way. So there's big screens, there's light shows, lots of digital boarding around the court. ""We build a 7,000 square meter fanzone, we also build a sponsors village with a practice court in the middle. So there's a lot to do in a very short space of time."" The work done transforming the O2 is certainly appreciated by the fans who flock to the week-long tournament. The 2010 event saw over 250,000 spectators come to see the action across the seven days of competition. Tennis fan Thav Phouthavong was taking in the action on Thursday and was struck by the transformation the venue had undergone. ""It's my first time here at the O2 (watching tennis) but I've been to music gigs here,"" he said. ""It's completely transformed with the tennis memorabilia, practice courts and fan zones. Normally it's an empty space."" Spanish spectator Luis Rodriguez was also impressed with the arena, saying it surpassed previous tennis experiences in his homeland. ""It's my first time here,"" he said. ""I've been to the Barcelona tournament before, I prefer this. The size of the O2 is a lot bigger and better. They've got restaurants, it's really spacious and there's a lot more to do."" Prior to the event moving to London in 2009, Shanghai served as the location for what was then called the Tennis Masters Cup. Kermode explained how the timing was perfect for the O2 to take on the mantle from the Chinese city. ""The chairman of the ATP was looking where to take it from Shanghai and decided bringing it to the UK, and London, was a good move. The O2 was just about to be opened; it was a perfect synergy to match the two together."" In addition to giving tennis a futuristic face-lift, Kermode also believes hosting the World Tour Finals at a venue such as the O2 opens the sport up to a wider audience. ""Where the O2 has been so successful is the acts that they've had over the years has made this venue a destination venue in it's own right,"" he said of the arena which has been converted from the Millennium Dome attraction. ""So what we've managed to create here is almost attracting a new audience to tennis that historically maybe couldn't get tickets to Queens and Wimbledon. People who had maybe never seen live tennis before. So we've got the core tennis fans and we've got sporting fans who are seeing the game for the first time."" Neil Harman is the tennis correspondent for British newspaper The Times. He is full of praise for the show put on by the O2, saying the way in which tennis has flourished at the arena is reminiscent of when the finals were played at New York's Madison Square Garden between 1977 and 1989. ""To my mind it's a very natural venue for tennis, much like Madison Square Garden was in terms of an indoor venue,"" said Harman. ""The way it's set up, the way the tennis court itself is spot-lighted ... There are certain places you feel tennis was made for and I think this is definitely one of them."" Harman is also convinced the event is creating new fans for the sport, with tickets more obtainable than they are for one of the tennis' four grand slams. ""Very few people get to go to Wimbledon. Here, there's more of a sense of the general population getting in and being able to feel the pulse of the sport. ""To get that close to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal is something special. The whole thing is designed to draw people into the sport and I think that's what we need to do. ""It's not a surprise to me that places like Madison Square Garden, like the O2, although they are ostensibly concert venues, with a bit of imagination, a bit of thought and a bit of foresight, can be transformed into great sporting venues."" The O2's deal to host the World Tour Finals expires in 2013, with the ATP yet to make a decision on where the event will move onto next. Wherever the tournament ends up, Harman believes the O2 Arena has raised the bar and helped increase tennis' global profile. ""It's setting a benchmark; the next venue has got to step up. When it moves from here, and I'm sure it will because the message of tennis has to be global, it's going to be a very tough act to follow. ""Everywhere across the world we have to portray the message that tennis is a superb sport to come and watch, but very few do it as well as this.""","Since 2009, London's O2 Arena has hosted the ATP World Tour Finals .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A 14-year-old accused of ruthless killings on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel boss is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Monday. Gini Staab would not provide any further information. ""We have confirmed the boy's U.S. citizenship but can't say  anything more about the boy's situation in the absence of a (provisional arrest warrant) signed by at  least one of the parents,"" Staab said. Earlier, Staab said that the boy, once his citizenship was confirmed, would be given ""all appropriate consular assistance, just like we would for any U.S. citizen arrested and incarcerated overseas."" Assistance would include prison visits, information on local attorneys and checks on his welfare, she said. The teen -- reportedly carrying a birth certificate issued in San Diego  -- and two of his sisters were detained Thursday at an airport in central Mexico after an anonymous tip alerted authorities he was heading to Tijuana, Mexico, local media reported. A spokeswoman for the Mexican attorney general's office said authorities detained the 14-year-old Thursday evening on suspicion of working as a drug-cartel hit man, but declined to provide details. But the boy faced a battery of questions from reporters after he was detained, answering questions point-blank as camera flashes lit his face. ""I slit their throats,"" he said, describing what he said was the killing of four people. The teen told reporters after his capture Thursday night that he was an orphan who joined the Pacifico Sur drug cartel when he was 12. He said Julio ""El Negro"" Padilla, one of the group's alleged leaders, threatened him. ""I either work or he'll kill me,"" the 14-year-old said. With his hands shoved into the pockets of his cargo pants, the 14-year-old told reporters that he was paid weekly in dollars and pesos. But in answering questions about whether he knew what he was doing when he allegedly participated in the killings, the teen said he was under the influence of drugs and unaware of his actions. ""No, I didn't know,"" he said. Troops standing beside the teen while the youth was interviewed wore masks to hide their faces -- a common sight in Mexico, where clashes between authorities and cartels have intensified since President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown shortly after he took office in 2006. But the teen's face was clearly visible. Martin Perez, director of Mexico's Children's Rights Network, said late Friday that authorities should not have given television cameras and newspaper photographers access to the 14-year-old. ""It was completely inappropriate, the form of presenting him in front of the media,"" he said. ""Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent,"" he said. ""Also, it could put his life at serious risk. We have to remember that this is a fight between criminal organizations."" CNN's Claudia Dominguez, Rey Rodriguez, Nick Valencia and Krupskaia Alis contributed to this report.","State Department confirms the boy's citizenship, but offers no further information .

"(CNN) -- The photographer who took images of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto moments before her assassination Thursday told CNN he was ""surprised"" to see her rise through the sunroof of her vehicle to wave to supporters after delivering her speech. Getty Images photographer John Moore captured Benazir Bhutto waving, moments before he heard gunshots. ""I ran up, got as close as I got, made a few pictures of her waving to the crowd,"" Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore told CNN's online streaming news service, CNN.com Live, in a phone interview Thursday from Islamabad, Pakistan. ""And then suddenly, there were a few gunshots that rang out, and she went down, she went down through the sunroof,"" he said. ""And just at that moment I raised my camera up and the blast happened. ... And then, of course, there was chaos.""  Watch Moore describe Bhutto's final moments » . Moore said he was about 20 yards away from Bhutto's vehicle when he took his photographs. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Moore said he had been following Bhutto's story since her return to Pakistan in October. He was present October 19 when a terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi killed 136 people. In the aftermath of that attack, ""the rallies had been very small,"" because of high security, Moore said. However, the Rawalpindi rally was announced beforehand, he observed. ""Whoever planned this attack -- they had time on their hands to plan everything properly, and you saw the results today,"" he said. Between 5,000 and 8,000 were at the Rawalpindi rally, which was held at a parkground, he said. ""We [the news media] all expected it to be filled ... but there were less people there than most of us expected to see,"" he said. ""When I talked with a number of people, they said that people were just afraid to come out, for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi."" Moore said he himself expected there could be another attack following the Karachi massacre. He said he stayed away from gates at the Rawalpindi parkground, where police were searching people, because he suspected that's where a bomb would go off. Moore said it was obvious that Bhutto enjoyed being with her supporters. ""She was clearly in her element,"" he said. ""She just wanted to get close to the people, and obviously whoever was after her -- they saw that coming."" E-mail to a friend .","John Moore took images of Benazir Bhutto moments before death .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has leapt to the defense of the Italian Formula One team following Fernando Alonso's controversial win at the German Grand Prix on Sunday, accusing its critics of hypocrisy. Ferrari was fined $100,000 by motorsport's ruling body the FIA, and referred to the World Motor Sport Council for further investigation after race stewards deemed it had breached rules banning team orders to drivers at Hockenheim. Brazil's Felipe Massa, who was leading Alonso at the front going into lap 49 of 67, appeared to allow his Ferrari teammate to pass him to win the race. But Montezemolo told Ferrari's official website: ""Enough of this hypocrisy. The result is down to the efforts of all our people, who never give up. ""Now we have to continue working like this, to improve the car so that it is competitive at all the circuits we will encounter."" Ferrari fined as Alonso denies Massa in Hockenheim controversy . Montezemolo said the move was common practice within the Italian team. ""I simply reaffirm what I have always maintained, which is that our drivers are very well aware, and it is something they have to stick to, that if one races for Ferrari, then the interests of the team come before those of the individual,"" he said. ""In any case, these things have happened since the days of [1930s driver Tazio] Nuvolari, and I experienced it myself when I was sporting director, in the days of Niki Lauda and not just then."" Alonso's win put the two-time world champion back into contention for this year's title. The 29-year-old is now within 34 points of championship leader Lewis Hamilton of McLaren while Massa, who finished second on Sunday, remains eighth with eight races left. Alonso, who also won in Bahrain, secured his second win of the F1 calendar after Massa let him pass shortly after receiving a coded message by race engineer Rob Smedley via his car radio. Smedley was heard saying to Massa: ""Alonso is faster than you. Can you confirm you understand?"" Once Alonso overtook him, an apologetic Smedley added: ""Good lad -- just stick with it now, sorry."" F1 championship standings after Hockenheim . The incident seemed to be a tactical decision by Ferrari, with Alonso leading  Massa by 31 points in the overall standings before the race. Despite the Italian team claiming it was not a team order, race stewards decided Ferrari was in breach of Article 39.1 which states that ""team orders which interfere with a race result are prohibited"". It has since instigated widespread criticism within the sport, with Red Bull boss Christian Horner telling UK race broadcaster the BBC afterwards that ""it's wrong for the sport.""","Ferrari president accuses critics of Fernando Alonso's German GP win of hypocrisy .

"(CNN) -- It would be no exaggeration to say that we spend the 89 minutes of ""Paranormal Activity 3"" waiting -- taut with tension -- to see a face. Not just any face, mind you. A face of nightmare terror and shivery awe, one that will shoot a scary volt of revelation right through us. We're never entirely sure if that face is going to arrive, but the anticipation is everything. The movie sets us up for it early on, with an amazing shock as a closet door is opened. Of course, we're also waiting because, with two other ""Paranormal Activity"" films behind it, ""Paranormal Activity 3"" implicitly understands that we've been through enough tricks in these movies -- the doors that open and slam shut, the thuds and booms and scratchy skitters on the soundtrack, the kitchen utensils that fall with a crash, the spectral shapes that you can almost make out -- to now want to see something more. ""Paranormal Activity 3"" features variations on every one of the tricks I just mentioned, and a few additional ones (they all work), but more than the first two films, it tweaks our desire to put a face on evil. The movie is a prequel, set in September 1988, though it doesn't exactly look like an '80s period piece. The spacious, high-ceilinged Carlsbad, California, tract home in which it takes place looks a lot like the one in the more contemporary ""Paranormal Activity 2,"" with tastefully bland furniture that might have come out of the Raymour & Flanigan suburban-gothic collection. This time, the family consists of Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith, who's like a skinny young Gary Dell'Abate), a wedding videographer who has banks of monitors and editing equipment in his home studio; his big-haired sexy wife, Julie (Lauren Bittner); and her two preteen daughters from a previous marriage. They are Katie (Chloe Csengery), who will grow up to be the Katie Featherstone character in the first film, and angel-faced Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown), from ""Paranormal Activity 2,"" here an enigmatic child who can communicate with the spirit world. It's one of this haunted-house movie's best jokes that the ghost on hand is Kristi's invisible friend, ''Toby,'' whom she talks to with a mixture of intimacy and intimidated formality. As soon as the family begins to hear mysterious sounds in their new home, Dennis insists on rigging up a handful of video cameras as makeshift surveillance devices. We get time-coded views of the parents' and kids' bedrooms -- and, most cleverly, there's a camera mounted on the base of a rotating fan that pans back and forth, with fearful deliberation, from the kitchen, with its pristine white cabinets, to the living room, with its creepy looped lamp in the foreground. The directors, Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, are the fascinatingly deadpan pranksters who made ""Catfish,"" last year's is-it-a-documentary-or-a-rigged-stunt? investigation into the fake identities that people can forge on the Internet. They turn out to be the perfect filmmakers to create a banal surface reality that's just warped enough to keep us on tenterhooks. The bottom line, for me, is this: I don't scare easily at horror films (that's one of the reasons I tend to pan them), but I watched ""Paranormal Activity 3"" in a state of high anxiety. Schulman and Joost have fun with the archetypal image of a white-sheeted costume ghost, but mostly what they're aces at is timing. They know just how to thread a handheld camera up the stairs, down a hallway, and into the scattered bric-a-brac of a middle-class children's bedroom, settling at just the right moment upon a talking teddy bear that plays as a joke, even as a part of you momentarily thinks: Is that bear possessed? They also make terrific use of characters like Dennis's assistant, a Napoleon Dynamite type, played with an infectious spark by Dustin Ingram, who ends up huddling in a darkened bathroom with young Katie for a scary game of ''Bloody Mary'' (say it three times and wait to see what happens). There's no denying that the ""Paranormal Activity"" films adhere, by now, to a formula; this one, almost by definition, lacks the originality that made the first one so startling. But when you consider how the grimy, mangle-fest ""Saw"" sequels have ruled the Halloween season in recent years, it's refreshing to think that the spook-show franchise that has now caught the popular imagination has replaced depravity and sadism with a 21st-century, video-reality version of old-school campfire shivers. In her review of ""The Shining,"" Pauline Kael asked -- derisively -- ''Who wants to see evil in daylight, through a wide-angle lens?'' The answer, it turns out, is everybody. EW.com rating: A- .

"(CNN) -- David Hall thought that he'd been careful, working diligently in his job as an Air Force sergeant, and staying quiet about his outside life, including his sexual orientation. Then, a female cadet went to his commander, with the revelation that Hall -- who had been first in his ROTC pilot's training class and long aspired to a military career -- was gay. Soon thereafter, in 2002, he was discharged, the life-long military brat's dreams of being a pilot suddenly dashed. ""It was stunning, disappointing,"" Hall said of being outed, and ousted, despite ""doing everything that the Air Force had asked of me."" ""I lost everything that I had been working for."" But starting Tuesday, Hall's future could take another turn. That's when the U.S. Defense Department is set to formally repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that has been in place since 1993. Advocates for the change overcame intense opposition from some who claimed allowing gay men and women to serve openly would hurt the military by making other troops uncomfortable and less effective, hurting morale and the military as a whole. And it also survived a last-minute push by two of the most powerful Republicans on the House Armed Service Committee to keep the policy in place. ""There were many times when we thought it wasn't going to happen,"" said Brian Moulton, chief legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign. ""(Tuesday) is a tremendous day for (gay rights advocates)."" So, too, will be the days to follow. Hall, who joined the Air Force in 1996, said he's already been in touch with a recruiter, as he's actively considering returning to the military. ""My views of the military have never changed, I've always loved the military,"" he said. ""It is great (the law is no longer in effect), because it is going to make the military stronger."" The policy, which became known as DADT, was extremely controversial when it first took shape. During his presidential campaign, Bill Clinton had vowed to let gays fight alongside straight people. But under intense pressure from conservatives fearful that such a policy would hurt the military's effectiveness, the compromise was crafted. Under it, military officials could not ask a soldier, sailor or airman about his or her sexual preferences. But if the troop's orientation came to light, it could lead to their discharge from the military. Some, like Hall, claim they never brought anything up themselves to their superiors, but still were forced to leave. Since its inception, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network -- which Hall now works for -- estimates more than 14,000 people were kicked out of the military due to ""don't ask, don't tell,"" with the highest rates occurring in 2000 and 2001. The advocacy group said that its figures come from Defense Department statistics, obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests. Efforts on Monday to reach several organizations that opposed the policy's repeal were unsuccessful. But those on the other side of the debate described DADT as discriminatory. ""This is one of two remaining federal laws where the government says, in point-blank terms: Gay people are treated one way, and straight people are treated another way,"" said James Esseks, direction of the American Civil Liberty Union's LGBT project, adding that the other law is the Defense of Marriage Act. ""Discrimination is written right into the face of law."" While serving, Hall said that it became ""a game"" for him and many other closeted military personnel, realizing ""at work, I don't talk about my personal life."" But in time, and after his discharge, the ex-Air Force sergeant said that he came to the realization that ""the military was behind on this issue."" ""They don't like change, and they don't want change unless they have to do it,"" he said. Still, Clark Cooper, the executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans -- a gay rights group, doesn't expect the change to create major ripples. ""Sure there's going to be some homophobia here and there, but at the end of the day, if you're a service member, you are expected to be a professional,"" he said. ""Misbehavior won't be tolerated and it won't be allowed."" Racial integration and the inclusion of women in the armed forces were bigger cultural steps, Cooper said. By 2011, the militaries of several countries -- including Israel and NATO allies like England, Germany and France -- allowed gays to serve openly. And public opinion began to shift as well. In a Gallup poll from December 2010 -- the same month a lame-duck Congress approved the repeal -- 67% of respondents favored a similar policy in the United States, with 28% dissenting. ""Over the last 17 years, the country has learned a lot more about gay people,"" said Esseks. ""As a whole, it is much more comfortable with the fact that gay people exist."" Even so, the effort led by President Barack Obama to repeal the law wasn't without roadblocks. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and former war hero, was among those opposed, saying at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, ""At this time, we should be inherently cautious about making any changes that would affect our military, and what changes we do make should be the product of careful and deliberate consideration."" Yet the Defense Department, despite reported dissent within its ranks, pushed for the change. On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the repeal into law. But this didn't set off an instantaneous change. Instead, the Pentagon rolled out a months-long process that would involve new training and rules, as well as a confirmation that it would not harm ""military readiness."" Until that time, the policy officially remained in effect. Last week, Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, the chairman of the committee's personnel subcommittee, hoped to keep it that way when they wrote Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asking him to ""take immediate action to delay the implementation of repeal."" They claimed Congress has not been adequately informed of policy changes that will accompany the repeal. A defense official who handles questions about the policy said that the department would not respond to a congressional letter via the media. But a spokesperson sent CNN a statement that read, in part, ""The repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' will occur, in accordance with the law and after a rigorous certification process, on September 20."" The statement added that ""senior Department of Defense officials have advised Congress of changes to regulations and policies associated with repeal"" -- including offering specific regulations and new policies in meetings with House Armed Services Committee staff. Moulton, while claiming that gay, lesbian and transgender people still face ""a great deal of legal and cultural discrimination,"" nonetheless called the law's formal repeal ""a tipping point in the movement for equality."" Esseks agreed, even as he predicted that the concept that people couldn't fly planes, sail on Navy ships or fight in battle just because of their sexual orientation will seem antiquated in a few decades. ""There will be a lot of people who will look back and scratch their heads, and say why were people so worried?"" he said. ""It doesn't mesh with their experience of America.""

"(Mashable) -- Facebook is working with HTC to develop a phone that has a much deeper integration with the social network than any previous ""Facebook phone."" That's according to a report from All Things D, which says the phone is probably 12 to 18 months away from hitting store shelves. Codenamed ""Buffy"" after the vampire slayer of the same name, the phone will run a modified version of Google's Android, but Facebook is reported to be tweaking the system ""heavily."" HTC is known for modifying Android on its phones with its HTC Sense interface, and both Amazon and Barnes & Noble have created tablets with highly customized versions of the Android, so it's possible that Facebook is adopting a similar strategy. Part of the package would be serving up Facebook apps via HTML5 support. This would allow users to play games like Farmville and Poker directly from the Facebook app. While most developers offer their apps as separate downloads from Facebook, that prevents them from tapping into active Facebook users, while cutting Facebook off from potential revenues. Buffy would presumably bridge the gap. Buffy will be far from the first Facebook phone. Earlier this year INQ Mobile released two phones, the Cloud Touch and Cloud Q that put the service front and center. Then HTC took it a step further with the Status, which came to the U.S. on AT&T this summer and featured a prominent dedicated Facebook button. Finally, Facebook released an app designed specifically for the iPad in October. Apple, however, hasn't played as nice with Facebook as the service might have liked, however. When Apple unveiled iOS 5, the latest major update to the software on iPhones and iPads, it featured deeper integration with Twitter -- letting users share photos directly from the phone's camera app, for example. An option for sharing to Facebook was noticeably absent. Both HTC and Facebook told Mashable that they don't comment on rumor and speculation, though the Facebook spokesperson added, ""Our mobile strategy is simple: we think every mobile device is better if it is deeply social. We're working across the entire mobile industry; with operators, hardware manufacturers, OS providers, and application developers to bring powerful social experiences to more people around the world."" The collaborative picture Facebook paints is a far cry from the ultra-competitive war among mobile platforms with Google, Apple, Facebook, and others vying for consumers' hearts and minds. Perhaps the most telling aspect of the rumored phone is the codename. With a name like Buffy, the Facebook phone's mission is clear: slay all comers.

"(CNN) -- Six people, including three children, were killed when their plane crashed into rugged mountains east of Phoenix on a Thanksgiving eve trip, authorities said Thursday. Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu identified the dead as a father and his three children, plus two other men. All were Arizona residents and knew each other well, he said. The twin-engine Rockwell 690A airplane slammed into a steep cliff near the top of the Superstition Mountains at 6:31 p.m. on Wednesday, strewing debris for hundreds of yards down the 80-degree incline, Babeu told reporters. Recovery efforts by more than 50 deputies and volunteers involved collect and preserving the remains, the sheriff said. ""No one could survive that crash,"" he said. The plane had flown from Safford to Mesa, where it picked up the siblings -- ages 9, 8 and 6 -- for the Thanksgiving holiday, Babeu said. ""All of these families are just obviously heartbroken, traumatized over the loss of their loved ones so suddenly here on Thanksgiving,"" he said. Federal officials were expected to begin their investigation as soon as Thursday, according to Babeu. A man who said he witnessed the impact told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Kevin Cunningham, 44, of Apache Junction, said he was talking on the phone from his back porch and saw the crash a few miles away. ""The flames lit up the mountain,"" said Cunningham, adding the plane appeared to be flying level before the crash. ""I didn't see where it was in distress.""

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Dolores Hope, the widow of actor-comedian Bob Hope, died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Monday, her family said. She was 102. ""I had such a huge admiration for both of them,"" actress Julie Newmar said. ""The quality it takes to get just one year older, says a lot about that fact that she lived to 102. What a glorious woman and life!"" Although she put her singing career on hold after her marriage to Hope, Dolores Hope was active as a philanthropist, involved in her own causes as well as her husband's. Military troops entertained by her husband's USO shows knew Dolores Hope because she would usually close the shows with a rendition of ""Silent Night,"" according to a biography provided by her family. ""She was the First Lady of the USO,"" Carol Channing said. ""They didn't come any more patriotic, caring or talented than Dolores."" Her last USO show performance came at age 84, when she sang ""White Christmas"" to Operation Desert Storm troops from the back of a truck in the Saudi desert. She restarted her singing career at the age of 83 by recording several albums. She performed with Rosemary Clooney at Rainbow and Stars in New York for several weeks. Born in Harlem in New York on May 27, 1909, Dolores DeFina was a singer at Manhattan's Vogue Club when she met Bob Hope in 1933. It was ""love at first song,"" the biography quotes Bob Hope as saying. The couple married the next year and later adopted four children. The couple moved in the late 1930s from New York to California, where he pursued a movie and radio career. Bob Hope was 100 when he died July 27, 2003. ""Dolores once said that their longevity could be credited to laughter and they certainly had a lot of that in their lives,"" said actress Alison Arngrim. The family will hold a private funeral at burial at the Bob Hope Memorial Garden, San Fernando Mission, California, where her husband was interred.","NEW: ""She was the First Lady of the USO,"" Carol Channing says .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Angry workers beat to death a human resources vice president after he laid off 42 employees at an auto-parts manufacturing company in southern India, police said Wednesday. Roy George was vice-president for human resources at Pricol, the auto-parts company. Some four to five workers, belonging to a union not recognized by the company, barged into his office and beat him up with iron rods, said N. Kannan, a police superintendent of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu state. George, 47, died from his head injuries Tuesday, Kannan told CNN. Police have arrested nine people and are expected to round up more. Last year the Indian head of an Italian company died after allegedly being beaten by a mob of sacked employees. More than 60 people were charged with the murder of the chief executive of Graziano Transmissioni near New Delhi. Earlier this month, India's Jet Airways had to cancel hundreds of flights after pilots struck work over the sacking of two of their colleagues in August. Companies in the South Asian nation, despite its rapid economic growth in recent years, have often been faced with tough labor issues because of archaic laws and company policies on hiring and retrenchment. Business consultants in India blame such labor standoffs on what they call lack of transparency in retrenchment or layoff policies. Hiring and firing conditions are often not explained to workers by their companies, said Rajeev Karwal, founding-director of Milagrow Business and Knowledge Solutions. Issues could spiral out of control if the businesses and bureaucrats are seen in a ""corrupt nexus"" by the employees seeking reprieve from labor authorities, he said.","Roy George was vice-president for human resources at Pricol auto-parts company .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- When you're dining at a revolving restaurant 250 feet above Cape Town, you expect the views to be fantastic. The real surprise is when the food appears -- and it's excellent. What better way to savor a beautiful city than from this vantage point: a window seat at a revolving restaurant where the shifting views complement the gourmet courses. At Cape Town's Top of the Ritz, that means pairings of just-caught mussels with a view of iconic Table Mountain, spicy curry-butternut soup with the sandstone Twelve Apostle peaks, rack of lamb with beaches, and dessert with the sunset dipping below the Atlantic. Travel + Leisure: America's rudest people . Over the past 50 years, revolving restaurants have opened in more than 50 countries on six continents, from Colombia to Nepal to Canada. Along the way, the concept has gone from futuristic novelty to often-tacky tourist traps. But set aside that skepticism: we've pinpointed select revolving restaurants that are worth the price of admission. The revolving restaurant trend took flight in 1961, when Seattle architect John Graham built one on top of a shopping center in Hawaii. A year later Graham was commissioned to design the Space Needle for the upcoming World's Fair in his hometown, and brought the idea with him. The resulting ultramodern tower not only became an enduring icon of this Northwest city, it brought 20,000 awed visitors to the Space Needle restaurant each day of the World's Fair, setting off a global craze for revolving restaurants. Far too many successors get by on their looks alone, serving generic, overpriced dishes that typically invite the harsh review: ""killer views, mediocre food."" Munich's Restaurant 181 rises above that revolving restaurant reputation and has become one of the city's most coveted dining spots. It even earned a Michelin star for chef Otto Koch's concoctions, such as morel-crusted veal and langoustine tartare on a bed of caviar. Koch introduced airplane-esque classes of dining, from the First (eight courses, including the caviar, for $209) to the Economy Sunset Menu, a three-course prix fixe at a down-to-earth $52. That's about as frugal as you get at these revolving restaurants, which each deliver a once-in-a-lifetime meal that can't be duplicated anywhere else. Give them a spin. Travel + Leisure: World's most beautiful subway stations . Perlan: Reykjavik, Iceland . Built above a geothermal spring, Perlan serves a practical function -- storing the city's water tanks -- and the indulgent one of fine dining in its giant glass dome. Enter, and you're greeted by sweeping views of the deep-blue ocean and volcanic mountains surrounding Reykjavik. Get your fill of fresh local seafood such as sous vide smoked trout ($20) and, in autumn, a special wild game buffet ($73) of Icelandic delicacies like wild goose, reindeer, and puffin. Heads Up: Strókur, a geyser right outside the restaurant, can provide quite the mealtime show, shooting white plumes of steam high into the air. Top of the World: Las Vegas . Every glittering light of the Las Vegas Strip can be seen from this 844-foot-high restaurant—the crown of the Stratosphere Casino, Hotel & Tower. The extravagant four-course tasting menu mixes classics such as lobster bisque and filet mignon with more inventive dishes like roasted miso Mediterranean loup de mer with shoyu ginger glaze, followed by crème brûlée and cheesecake lollipops. Heads Up: Don't be alarmed if you see a person propel past your window -- the new SkyJump thrill ride leaves from right above the restaurant. Summit Restaurant: Sydney . Red carpets, pink-tinged lighting, and sleek lounge furniture create a sultry vibe within this dining room, which revolves past the Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge, and Olympic Park. Australian TV chef-lebrity Michael Moore put local reef snapper and pan-fried quail breasts on the two-course dinner menu ($89). For a more low-key meal, head to the Orbit Lounge Bar and pair an Aussie craft beer like Lord Nelson Old Admiral Strong Ale ($10) with small bites such as deep-fried whitebait -- small and savory herring-like fish ($16). Heads Up: On a clear day, you can see the lush Blue Mountains surrounding the city. Drehrestaurant Allalin: Saas-Fee, Switzerland . The world's highest revolving restaurant is on top of a glacier 11,000 feet above sea level, reached by a remarkable alpine subway. A dozen of the highest peaks in the Swiss Alps slowly swirl by as diners warm up with hearty Swiss-German fare like kalbsbratwurst (veal sausage) with hash-brown-like rösti ($32), and Älplermakkaroni: macaroni in a creamy cheese sauce with ham, bacon, potatoes, and stewed apples ($32). If you're still frostbitten, a glass of mulled glühwein wine ($9) should do the trick. Heads Up: Look southeast toward Italy; if visibility is good, you can see as far as Milan. Restaurant 181: Munich . Chef Otto Koch's acclaimed restaurant inside the Olympic Tower was recently awarded its first Michelin star. Named for its placement 181 meters above ground, the restaurant has three airplane-esque options. In 181 First, the opulent eight-course tasting menu ($209) starts with langoustine tartare on a bed of sevruga caviar; 181 Business offers à la carte dishes like morel-crusted veal ($43); while the best value is 181 Economy's Sunset Menu, serving a three-course prix fixe ($52) from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Heads Up: Don't get lost in the long view of the Bavarian Alps; one of the city's architectural triumphs, the canopied Olympic Stadium inspired by Alpine peaks, is directly below. Travel + Leisure: America's most scenic roads . Top of the Ritz: Cape Town . Wedged in between the Atlantic Ocean and towering Table Mountain -- with the new World Cup Stadium to the north and posh Camps Bay beaches to the south -- this dining room showcases Cape Town's main attractions in one gradual revolution. The menu, meanwhile, covers traditional South Africa fare, dishes like ostrich carpaccio ($7) and a salad of biltong (beef jerky) and goat cheese ($7), plus plenty of wine from the vineyards of nearby Stellenbosch. Heads Up: Robben Island, the offshore prison where Nelson Mandela was held for 18 years, is immediately to the north. SkyCity: Seattle . Atop the Space Needle, in the space that ignited the revolving craze decades ago, SkyCity remains the best place for panoramic views of Seattle, Puget Sound, and snowcapped Mount Rainier. Fortunately, the menu is not stuck in the '60s. Chef Jeff Maxfield puts creative twists on Northwest classics, from Dungeness crab cakes with apple-fennel slaw and herbed aioli ($13) to grilled wild king salmon with blueberry butter, wilted pea vines, and micro herbs ($47). Heads Up: It's hard to beat a multicolored sunset over the Olympic Mountains across the sound. Restaurant Näsinneula: Tampere, Finland . A hundred miles north of Helsinki, this 550-foot lakefront tower in quaint Tampere is hardly a tourist trap; its restaurant is consistently mentioned as one of the best in Finland. Local, seasonal ingredients such as just-picked morel mushrooms in spring or vendace roe from Lake Näsijärvi (right outside the windows) in winter are incorporated throughout the menu. You'll just have to trust that some items -- such as parfait of white chocolate with juice of sea buckthorn shrub ($16) -- are more delicious than they sound. Heads Up: When the seasons change in October, the red-orange-yellow leaf-peeping here is as good as in Vermont. Brasserie Le Phare de la Méditerranée: Palavas-les-Flots, France . Down the coast from the glitzy resorts of the French Riviera, this quaint former fishing village lies on a strip of sand dunes that separates two saltwater lakes from the Mediterranean. Atop an old water tower converted into a cultural center, Le Phare overlooks area lakes and beaches, while serving dishes that emphasize local bounty -- from mussels and oysters to shrimp and lobster -- to the mostly French vacationers. Heads Up: In spring and summer, the lagoon directly below the tower is often dotted with pink flamingos. The Sky at New Otani Tower: Tokyo . It's hard to know which way to look when Tokyo's skyscrapers are spinning by on one side and an array of master chefs are working at lightning speed in the giant stage kitchen on the other. The dinner buffet highlights fresh seafood from Tokyo's famed Tsukiji Market, which you can request sautéed, grilled, steamed, or cooked tempura in front of you ($108). Additional stations prepare sushi and teppanyaki -- prime Japanese beef grilled on a hot iron plate at your table. Heads Up: After dinner, head higher up to the 40th-floor bar for an even more impressive view of Mount Fuji and the Eiffelesque Tokyo Tower. Travel + Leisure: World's coolest helicopter rides .

"Anatalya, Turkey (CNN) -- Lapped by the pristine waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Turkish coastal city of Antalya attracts millions of sun-seeking tourists each year, beguiling them with its sweeping scenery, picture-perfect beaches and blazing sunshine. It is this abundance of sunlight -- Turkey receives greater annual solar radiation energy than Spain and Germany according to estimates by the Joint Research Center of the European Commission -- that has prompted Antalya's local authorities to push ahead with plans to harness the city's solar potential. ""We aim to make Antalya the leader of solar power generation of Turkey and to promote it to the world as 'The Solar City,'"" says Antalya's mayor Mustafa Akaydin. The declaration comes as the sun-soaked city, located some 700 kilometers south of Istanbul, starts rolling out its ambitious plans to use solar power to generate electricity, emulating the successful example of cities like Barcelona, Spain, which has put in place regulations requiring solar panels to be fitted to all large new buildings. In April, the city opened the ""Antalya Solar House,"" an ecological research and educational center designed by architectural firm Temiz Dunya to raise awareness about the benefits of renewable energy and promote eco-tourism. The zero-emission structure, which was built with ecological materials, generates most of its energy using photovoltaic panels (22kW in total) as well as a windmill and heat pumps. 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions . These systems are supplemented with gray-water recycling -- re-use of used water from bathtubs, showers and so on. -- and passive solar heating features such as a greenhouse to collect heat during the winter months. It also has a green roof that facilitates rainwater harvesting and acts as heat insulation. ""The building is also very significant because it is Turkey's first energy positive building,"" says architect Mehmet Bengu Uluengin, the designer behind the Solar House. ""It actually produces more energy than it consumes."" The architect says the structure has fascinated the local population while helping to change perceptions that buildings can only be big energy consumers. ""The idea that having a building that not only provides its own energy but actually gives some back is a totally new phenomenon for Turkish people,"" says Uluengin, who is also a professor at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University. ""They like it, they find it very intriguing."" Local authorities expect around a thousand people to visit Solar House each month, including students, green investors and hotel owners. They say the project is just the first part of a long-term initiative to turn Antalya into a climate-friendly city -- other initiatives include a waste management facility that will convert the city's sewage into biogas. ""Antalya has already been the pioneering city of green energy (in Turkey),"" says Akaydin. ""We are trying to make Antalya the leader of agriculture, tourism, park and garden lighting, energy generating and (solar) panel producing."" While educating the local population about achieving energy efficiency, Uluengin says the technology used in the Solar House can also help Antalya -- Turkey's biggest coastal resort and home to several five-star hotels -- to become an ideal destination for eco-conscious tourists. ""There are several hotels which are considering green energy to attract customers,"" he says. ""A hotel which can say that ... if you're staying here your carbon footprint is zero for the duration of your stay -- this is becoming very interesting for people worldwide,"" he adds. For the moment, however, sunny Antalya is still far from being branded a green resort -- local authorities estimate that eco-visitors account for just 1% of the city's tourism. Mayor Akaydin says that Turkey is missing a trick by failing to exploit its clean energy capabilities. ""Turkey has a very big potential in solar and wind energy. Unfortunately, the insufficient and wrong policies of the government prevent the promotion of them,"" he says. Turkey's geothermal potential . Despite receiving plenty of sun, Turkey has been remarkably sluggish in developing a sound solar industry. The country still depends heavily on oil and natural gas, most of which is imported from abroad. In 2008, oil provided 37% of Turkey's total final consumption of energy, natural gas and electricity 18% each, coal 17%, biomass and waste 7% and other sources 3%, according to figures by the International Energy Agency. At the same time, limited government subsidies, coupled with high costs for green energy equipment, have further impeded the market's growth, leaving little incentives for households to go solar. Yet, Uluengin is optimistic that green initiatives like the one in Antalya can help Turkey's green energy sector to take off in the coming years. He notes that the lack of government incentives has bolstered Turkey's fledgling renewable energy industry by creating a solid and growing grassroots movement -- that, he says, is in contrast to the top-down approach that was implemented in other European countries, where the sector grew after governments started offering subsidies and incentives for green energy usage. ""The way we are going through it in Turkey is more painful but is also healthier because it is growing out of real demand,"" says Uluengin.","Antalya has launched a long-term initiative to become a climate-friendly city .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Seven crew members from a South Korean cargo ship remained missing Tuesday after the boat sank Monday in the South China Sea, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said. Fourteen people have been rescued, according to the ministry. The ship was headed from Penang, Malaysia, to China and disappeared after sending out an emergency signal Monday afternoon. While six South Koreans and eight crew members from Myanmar were rescued by nearby vessels, seven seamen are still missing. The Foreign Ministry said it is still hopeful, as one crew member was rescued at noon on Tuesday -- almost 20 hours after the ship requested assistance. Hong Kong rescuers have deployed two helicopters and seven ships to help with the search and rescue operation, while two Chinese naval vessels were en route to the scene, according to the Foreign Ministry. The 15,000-ton sunken vessel is the same ship that was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2008 when eight sailors were held captive for 37 days, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

"(CNN) -- Gian Piero Gasperini has paid the price for Inter Milan's poor start to the season, being sacked as coach following the 2010 European champions' 3-1 defeat by newly-promoted Novara on Tuesday. The 53-year-old took charge in June, but under his guidance the 18-time Italian Serie A titleholders earned just one point from their opening three league matches to languish in 17th position in the table -- one place outside of the relegation zone. Inter also lost to arch-rivals AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup in August and to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor in their opening European Champions League match. ""F.C. Internazionale announces that this morning's training session at the Centro Sportivo Angelo Moratti in Appiano Gentile was run by [assistant coaches] Daniele Bernazzani and Giuseppe Baresi,"" Inter's website reported on Wednesday. ""The club would like to thank Gian Piero Gasperini for the dedication he has shown in his work and regret having to end the relationship with the coach."" Inter slump to defeat against Novara . Inter president Massimo Moratti appeared to confirm that Gasperini faced the ax when questioned about the former Genoa boss on Wednesday before meeting with the coach. Asked if Gasperini would remain with the Nerazzurri, Moratti replied: ""I don't think so. We'll decide what to do today but he seems to be in a very difficult situation, whichever way you look at it."" On Tuesday's defeat, Inter's second in three league matches, Moratti said: ""When you lose in such a way, there's nothing you like."" Gasperini replaced Brazilian coach Leonardo at Inter, having been sacked by Genoa in November 2010. During a four-year spell with Genoa, Gasperini led the club to a fifth-place finish in Serie A in 2009 and qualification for the Europa League. ""Results are what decide everything, I'm very disappointed,"" he told journalists on Wednesday, AFP reported. ""I had a great relationship with the directors and it's a shame that it's had to come to an end. Everyone feels regret.""

The award, which was established in 1998, honors comedians who have shaped American society with their work, as Mark Twain once did. Ferrell himself commented on the importance of the prize, telling CNN it's ""the only legitimate award that recognizes comedy,"" and he was honored to receive it. Fellow comedians Jack Black, Tim Meadows, Ed Asner, Paul Rudd, Andy Samberg, Conan O'Brien and Molly Shannon showered Ferrell with praise at the ceremony. ""When you see Will Ferrell on a marquis, he's going to give you 90 minutes to two hours of fascinating entertainment,"" said Asner, who worked with Ferrell in the movie ""Elf.""

"(CNN) -- Another University of California official expressed dismay about the recent use of pepper spray by police on Occupy Davis protesters. UC Board of Regents chair Sherry Lansing said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by images of police actions during the protest last week on the campus of University of California Davis. ""We regents share your passion and your conviction for the University of California,"" Lansing said in a video statement released Monday. ""And we want all of you to know we fully and unequivocally support your right to protest peacefully."" Lansing's statement came the same day that the chancellor of UC Davis made a public apology for the incident. ""I am here to apologize,"" were the first words Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi said through a microphone after climbing onto a small stage erected on the university's ""quad"" for Occupy supporters. ""I really feel horrible for what happened on Friday."" Video of police pepper-spraying nonviolent demonstrators at a sitting protest Friday on the UC Davis campus has sparked widespread criticism, including calls for Katehi's resignation. ""If you think you don't want to be students in a university like we had on Friday,"" Katehi said, ""I'm just telling you I don't want to be the chancellor of the university we had on Friday."" The statement triggered cries of ""Resign!"" from the crowd. Occupy roundup: A fallout, a silent protest and a new encampment . The university said it has placed two police officers and the police chief on administrative leave in the wake of the incident, while officials investigate officers' use of pepper spray against protesters. Time: Watch video of police pepper-spraying and arresting students . A group of about a dozen protesters sat on a path with their arms interlocked as police moved in to clear out a protest encampment affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement Friday. Most of the protesters had their heads down as a campus police officer walked down the line, spraying them in their faces in a sweeping motion. ""I was shocked,"" Sophia Kamran, one of the protesters subjected to the spray, said Saturday. ""When students are sitting on the ground and no way of moving to be violent, being totally peaceful, I don't understand the use of pepper spray against them."" The school said 10 protesters arrested were given misdemeanor citations for unlawful assembly and failure to disperse. Eleven were treated for the effects of pepper spray, which burns the eyes and nose, causing coughing, gagging and shortness of breath. The Davis Faculty Association, citing incidents at other campuses, demanded ""that the chancellors of the University of California cease using police violence to repress nonviolent political protests."" It called for greater attention to cuts in state funding to education and rising tuition. Its board demanded Katehi resign, saying she exhibited ""gross failure of leadership."" On Saturday, Katehi called the officers' actions ""chilling"" and said the video ""raises many questions about how best to handle situations like this."" But she refused calls from faculty members and others for her to step down, saying she did not violate campus policies.

"(CNN) -- Ohio's governor on Friday signed an executive order covering ownership of dangerous wild animals, which will strengthen enforcement of existing laws, and said he will push for tighter regulations through legislation. Gov. John Kasich spoke to reporters just days after authorities in his state used lethal force against exotic animals on the loose. Police believe the animals' owner, Terry Thompson, 62, freed the animals -- lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears -- at his preserve near Zanesville before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. ""Fortunately, today, I'm able to sign an executive order that will have teeth, that is founded in the law, and gives power to people,"" the governor said. Among other directives, the executive order instructs the departments of agriculture, natural resources and health to work with local health officials, humane societies and law enforcement to identify locations where dangerous animals might be, investigate and enforce laws that are already on the books, Kasich said. It also directs agencies to work with the zoos to safely house animals that are captured or confiscated, and orders the agriculture department to identify unlicensed auctions of dangerous animals and take appropriate action. Finally, the order instructs the state's department of natural resources to develop a framework for legislative change by the end of November. According to the governor, state officials do not currently have the authority to track down exotic and dangerous animals that are not native to Ohio. ""Let me be clear on this. We will seek statutory authority. Changes must be made in the law,"" said Kasich. Ohio authorities were called to the area around Thompson's house Tuesday night. Of the 56 animals released, only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive, Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said. Killed were two wolves, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight lionesses, one baboon, three mountain lions, and 18 Bengal tigers. One monkey remained unaccounted for Wednesday night, though Lutz, and conservationist Jack Hanna, said the animal may have been eaten by one of the big cats. The Humane Society of the United States has said it does not fault authorities for using deadly force in such a situation. However, on Friday, the group criticized the governor's response by saying the order he signed ""is inadequate and sidesteps the central problems created by the exotic animal trade in Ohio. ""The Humane Society of the United States agrees with him (Kasich) that the legislature should enact a statute that addresses the problem, but in the interim, we need an executive order that bans the sale and acquisition of dangerous wild animals as pets or roadside attractions,"" said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the group.","Humane Society calls the governor's response ""inadequate""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- An English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort is being held by pirates in a remote corner of Somalia, according to experts and security analysts in Nairobi. ""Gangs from Southern Somalia took her up the coast and then moved her several times,"" said Andrew Mwangura, a piracy expert and maritime editor of Somalia Report, an independent online publication. Judith Tebbutt was abducted by armed men from a remote safari lodge near to the Somali border earlier this month. Her husband, David Tebbutt, was killed in the attack when he resisted, according to Kenyan police. A Kenyan man has been charged in connection with the attack, a lawyer familiar with the case told CNN Monday. Ali Babitu Kololo, who worked at the luxury resort in Kiwayu where the attack took place, was charged with robbery with violence and abducting with the intention to murder, according to a lawyer present at the hearing at the Lamu law courts. Kololo pleaded not guilty to both counts. A second man, Issa Sheck Saadi, is expected to appear in court at a later date. Details of the incident are still sketchy and the British government has asked journalists not to reveal the exact location of Tebbutt to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. Initially, it was feared that al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group, had conducted the operation as a revenge attack against the British nationals. But a security analyst based in Nairobi, who tracks piracy operations but is not authorized to speak to the media, also believes this is the work of pirates. ""This is not the work of al-Shabaab,"" he said, ""this is the work of southern armed gangs and pirates."" No ransom demands have been made yet, says Mwangura. But if Somali pirates carried out the operation, it represents a marked departure in tactics. For years, pirates have attacked commercial ships in the busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia. A cargo ship has insurance, and after months of negotiations pirates can often clear several million U.S. dollars. Some analysts believe that Somali pirates are now moving onto land because it's getting harder out at sea. ""Their inability to operate freely in the waters is forcing them onto land,"" says Andrews Atta-Asamoah, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. ""It's significant if you place it in the context of the struggle against piracy. Since the whole push against piracy by international navies, the pirates have been looking for new territory and new frontiers."" Atta-Asamoah says that Kenya is a natural target because if its porous border with Somalia and a high number of foreign visitors and workers. The Kenyan government, prompted by their reliance on tourism for foreign exchange, says they are making every effort to secure the border with Somalia. Others say that, rather than a trend, this is a one-time attack caused by a more prosaic fact: the weather. Monsoon rains off the coast of Somalia at this time of year makes operating offshore difficult. ""This incident is a special case,"" says Mwangura.","NEW: A Kenyan man is charged in connection with the attacks .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Republican presidential debate on Tuesday focused on national security issues exposed deep fault lines within the GOP over how to grapple with the nation's challenges overseas. The eight Republican candidates who took to the CNN debate stage in downtown Washington differed on a range of issues confronting the United States, including the war in Afghanistan, aid to Pakistan and cuts in defense spending. The issue of illegal immigration also arose again as the newest Republican front-runner, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, called for a ""humane"" approach to immigration policy, a position at odds with many conservative activists who dominate key nominating contests in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida. Gingrich stressed the importance of securing the United States border with Mexico and penalizing employers who hire illegal immigrants. But he expressed sympathy for people who entered the country illegally and since became contributing members of society. Blog: The CNN debate as it happened . ""I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families which have been here a quarter-century,"" Gingrich said. ""And I am prepared to take the heat for saying, let's be humane in enforcing the law without giving them citizenship, but finding a way to give them legality so as not to separate them from their families."" The answer was reminiscent of Texas Gov. Rick Perry's response to a question about a 2001 bill he signed that granted in-state college tuition to the children of illegal immigrants. In a September debate, Perry said Republicans who oppose the legislation ""don't have a heart"" -- and his standing in the polls plummeted in the following days. Romney, the party's de facto front-runner for much of the year, pounced on Gingrich's remarks. ""Amnesty is a magnet,"" Romney said. ""When we have had in the past programs that have said that if people who come here illegally are going to get to stay illegally for the rest of their life, that's going to only encourage more people to come here illegally."" iReport: What makes a good presidential candidate? Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who had one of her strongest debate performances of the cycle, also chided Gingrich. ""We need to move away from magnets, not offer more,"" said Bachmann, who is in single digits in the polls and pegging her candidacy to a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses. The debate was held at Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall in downtown Washington and was co-sponsored by the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, two conservative think tanks. Gingrich entered the debate with fresh momentum in the Republican race and found himself in the spotlight for much of the evening. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released on the eve of the debate, 24% of Republican and GOP-leaning independent voters said they are most likely to support Gingrich for their party's nomination, with 20% saying they back Romney, who is making his second bid for the presidency. Gingrich's four-point margin over Romney is within the survey's sampling error. A CNN poll released one week ago had Romney at 24% and Gingrich at 22%. Gingrich was at 8% in a CNN poll in October. The new front-runner got the first question of the night, which sparked a feud with the libertarian-leaning Texas Rep. Ron Paul over the USA Patriot Act. ""I would look at strengthening it because the dangers that are posed are so great,"" Gingrich said about the legislation. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the Patriot Act since it was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in October 2001, called it ""unpatriotic"" because it ""undermines our liberty."" Paul took on the role of the lonely isolationist throughout the debate, calling on the administration to withdraw American troops from commitments overseas as a way to slash government spending. He also questioned the point of humanitarian aid, including money to combat AIDS and other diseases in Africa. ""I think the aid is all worthless,"" Paul said. ""It doesn't do any good for most of the people. You take money from poor people in this country and you end up giving it to rich people in poorer countries."" In the night's sharpest clash, Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman battled over the American military presence in Afghanistan. Huntsman, a former ambassador to China and the sole candidate with diplomatic experience, said he wants to withdraw most American troops from the country and instead rely on Predator drones and a small contingent of forces to fight terrorists. ""Are you suggesting, governor, that we just take all our troops out next week?"" Romney asked. ""Did you hear what I just said?"" Huntsman fired back. ""I said we should draw down from 100,000. We don't need 100,000 troops, many of whom can't even cross the wire."" When Romney said the president should rely on the generals on the ground, Huntsman again responded aggressively. ""At the end of the day the president of the United States is commander-in-chief,"" he said. ""Of course you're going to listen to the generals. But I also remember when people listened to the generals in 1967 and we heard a certain course of action in Southeast Asia that didn't serve our interests very well."" The candidates were also pressed on how they would change airport security measures if elected president. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would privatize the Transportation Security Administration. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said his administration would apply ""more scrutiny"" to Muslim passengers in airports, as did former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain. ""If you take a look at the people who are trying to kill us it would be easy to figure out,"" Cain said. Later, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann dueled with Perry over his proposal to scrap all funding for foreign governments like Pakistan, which may not agree with American interests, and ask them to make the case for American funding. Perry said the government should stop writing ""blank checks"" to Pakistan, but Bachmann called that proposal ""naÃ¯ve"" because the country has nuclear weapons that must be protected. ""Al Qaeda could get a hold of these weapons,"" Bachmann said.","GOP candidates debate national security, foreign policy .

"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama declared his nine-day Asia-Pacific trip a success on Saturday, returning to the trip's domestic impact after focusing for days on the United States' role in the region and its relationship with China. In his weekly address, delivered from Bali, Indonesia,Obama said the trip helped cement trade deals that will support nearly 130,000 jobs. Agreements announced to export Boeing aircraft and G.E. engines to the region could increase U.S. exports by up to $39 billion, he said. ""These agreements will help us reach my goal of doubling American exports by 2014 -- a goal we're on pace to meet,"" he said. Obama was flying back to the United States on Saturday. He was scheduled to be back in Washington early Sunday. The administration advertised the trip, which began with a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Hawaii, primarily as an effort to shore up to United States' role in the economically important region as a means of helping boost the ailing U.S. economy. Secondarily, White House officials characterized the trip as an effort to demonstrate its commitment to the region and its allies there as the United States winds down its military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan and China begins to exert its own rising influence. During the trip, Obama announced an agreement to station U.S. Marines in Australia and held face-to-face meetings with Chinese officials and other leaders on economic and security issues, in addition to participating in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic summit and the East Asia Summit in Indonesia -- a first for a U.S. president, according to the White House. During the summit, Obama and his counterparts discussed economic issues, disaster response and territorial disputes over the South China Sea, an area critical to maritime shipping and one rich in oil and fish. China has claimed a significant portion of the South China Sea as its own territorial waters, putting it in conflict with other nations that have made claims on portions of the region. Sixteen of 18 leaders present at the meeting spoke out strongly against China's stance in what was a productive, but not confrontational meeting, according to a senior administration official. Premier Wen Jiabao told the group that China wants to see the issue resolved peacefully, according to the official. ""I think it was constructive, and one has to believe that the Chinese premier will go back to Beijing with the sense that the center of gravity in the Asia Pacific area is around the adherence to the principle of the rule of law, peaceful resolution, and a constructive, rules-based approach to the resolution of territorial disputes,"" the official said. Obama later met with the Chinese premier in a hastily-arranged meeting to continue their discussion on economic issues and the territorial dispute. Those talks occurred against the backdrop of Chinese consternation over the United States' increasing assertiveness in the region. An editorial published Friday by the state-controlled Xinhua news agency chided the United States for what it called a willingness to flaunt international rules, even as it insists other countries follow them. It highlighted the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. ""Today, when the world is still facing many difficult global challenges, the United States needs to first revisit its double standards on international rules and start observing them itself instead of lecturing China."" Xinhua said in the editorial. Obama's last appointment Saturday before leaving for Washington was a meeting with Thailand's first woman prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra. Obama congratulated Shinawatra on her ""inspirational"" election win, and offered condolences and assistance to those affected by the flooding in Thailand. He also described Thailand as one of America's oldest allies and spoke of the two nations' great friendship. When Shinawatra expressed her regret at not having visited the United States, Obama responded by inviting her to Hawaii.","NEW: President Barack Obama declares Asia-Pacific trip a success .

"County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- The mayor of a town in Ireland has resigned and faces a possible police investigation after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin. Councillor Darren Scully was Mayor of Naas in County Kildare, near the Irish capital, Dublin. Interviewed on local radio Tuesday morning, Scully said he had decided not to represent black Africans because of their ""aggressive"" attitude to him. ""I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,"" he claimed. ""I have also been played the race card - it's been said 'Oh yeah, you will help white people, but you don't help black people'."" The then mayor continued: ""After a while I made a decision that I was just not going to take on representations from black Africans, that I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their query to other public representatives who would take their concerns."" Members of other political parties called for Scully to resign and Tuesday evening he did just that. He issued the following statement: ""I wish to apologise unreservedly for my remarks on 4FM and KFM. I realise they have caused deep hurt and offence in all communities and in all sectors of society. ""I have been proud to be Mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position."" Earlier, political rivals Sinn Fein had accused him of being racist, but in his statement Scully denied the claim. He said: ""I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend. I abhor racism in all its forms."" Naas Town Council had called a special meeting for Tuesday evening to discuss the controversy, but Scully resigned just ahead of it. The now ex-mayor is a member of the main party in the Irish coalition government - Fine Gael - but said he was expressing personal views. The party agreed - Fine Gael issued this statement: ""The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael and they are not party policy. ""Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all."" A lawmaker with the junior partners in the coalition government, Aodhan O Riordain of the Labour Party, said he had reported the matter to Irish police with a view to prosecution. O Riordain branded Scully's comments ""outrageous"" and said they could be considered as incitement to hatred. The Irish census of 2006 showed there were 1,862 people of African origin living in Kildare out of a population in the county of 186,335, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. Naas has a total population of just over 20,000. Local people told CNN Tuesday that race relations in the town are good and they were ""really surprised"" a local representative would make such comments.","Irish Mayor Darren Scully resigns after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin .

"(CNN) -- Napoli stunned Manchester City 2-1 Tuesday to leave the English Premier League leaders struggling to qualify from Group A of the European Champions League. Edinson Cavani put Napoli ahead in the first half before Mario Balotelli equalized for Roberto Mancini's men, who have failed to repeat their sublime domestic form in European competition. Cavani scored the eventual winner just after the break to leave Napoli second in the group behind Bayern Munich, who beat Villarreal 3-1 to clinch their passage to the last 16 knockout stage. It was a pulsating encounter in Napoli's San Paolo stadium, with the most intense drama reserved after Uruguay's Cavani, a reported transfer target for big-spending City, had beaten Joe Hart with a low shot to put his side 2-1 ahead. City pushed forward in desperate hope of an equalizer but a mistake by Aleksandar Kolarov let in Marek Hamsik. His shot beat Hart, it thumped the post and bounced clear. Real Madrid hit Dinamo for six in Bernabeu . Yaya Toure played in the ever dangerous Balotelli but Morgan De Sanctis did superbly to block the shot, while at the other end Hart denied Christian Maggio, who was clean through. Finally, a brilliant move between David Silva and substitute Samir Nasri gave Balotelli a further opportunity, but he headed over. City, who were beaten 2-0 by Bayern Munich in the infamous match in which Carlos Tevez allegedly refused to come on as a substitute, must now beat the German giants in their final group match at the Etihad Stadium to have any chance of going through. But a Napoli victory over Villarreal in their last fixture would see the Italian club advance with Bayern regardless of that result. Bayern made no mistake in their Allianz Arena as Franck Ribery and Mario Gomez put them 2-0 up inside 24 minutes. Jonathan De Guzman pulled one back for the visitors before Ribery, with his second, wrapped up the win. City's illustrious city neighbors Manchester United are also making heavy weather of qualifying from Group C as they were held 2-2 at home by Benfica. They fell behind to a Phil Jones own goal at Old Trafford before a neat header from Dimitar Berbatov, playing in place of the injured Wayne Rooney, saw the home side level. When Darren Fletcher put Alex Ferguson's men ahead in the second half after a spell of intense pressure they looked set to wrap up the victory to take command of the group. But a casual clearance from United goalkeeper David de Gea led to Benfica's equalizer as Bruno Cesar's cross slammed into Rio Ferdinand and fell to Argentina veteran Pablo Aimar, who gratefully accepted the chance. Benfica and United are level on nine points, but the Portuguese side will go through as the group winners if they beat Romanian minnows Otelul Galati in their final group game in Lisbon next month. They have a better head-to-head record with United, who must gain at least a point at Swiss side FC Basel to qualify for the last 16. Basel, who beat Otelul Galati 3-2 on Tuesday, will go through with a win over United.","Napoli beat Manchester City 2-1 in Champions League Group A .

"(CNN) -- In an upstate New York town ravaged by the wrathful remnants of Hurricane Irene in late August, 12 displaced families will break bread together at Thanksgiving dinner. ""We are trying to rebuild,"" said Ken Aurigema, who with the help of his family will be cooking for at least 30 people Thursday at the Catskill Christian Assembly, one of the few structures in the small town of Prattsville to survive the devastation of the storm and its enduring aftermath. Upstate New York faced some of the worst and most extensive amount of flooding in Irene's fury, along with New Jersey and Vermont, said Chris Vaccaro spokesman for the National Weather Service. Over 7 million homes and businesses from North Carolina northward up the Eastern Seaboard lost power in the record-setting 10th billion-dollar disaster for the United States this year, Vaccaro said. Irene broke the previous record of nine billion-dollar disasters set in 2008. The estimated damage is more than $7.3 billion dollars total. ""Wind is not the only threat -- inland flooding can be one of the deadliest hazards within a tropical storm,"" Vaccaro said. Most of the families dining together Thursday previously lived in one of the 15 now-unoccupied houses along Main Street, where creek swelling and flood damage turned those structures into wrecked skeletons of homes that need rebuilding, or that have been condemned. The dinner invitation extends across Greene County to neighboring towns including Lexington and Windham, where countless homes and businesses also were destroyed. This was the first time a hurricane made landfall in the New York area since Hurricane Gloria struck Long Island in 1985. Hurricane Bob in 1991 came just shy of touching down east of the Long Island's twin forks. What began as a Category 1 hurricane in North Carolina had weakened into a tropical storm when it made a second landfall in New York's Coney Island, and continued northward through Connecticut, Massachusetts and then Vermont. ""The Northeast is prone to witnessing a tropical storm system, it's not just Florida the Gulf or (the) Carolinas. If you live along (the) coastline east or south, you are susceptible,"" Vaccaro told CNN. ""Irene was a reminder of that,"" he said. Thanksgiving dinner host Aurigema, an electrical contractor who lost his truck, tools, and customers to Irene, had been living in Greene County with his wife and son for 16 years before the storm slashed through his tiny town. Irene demolished the first floor of his Prattsville home, drowned his foundation in creek backwash and waterlogged his floor with three feet of flooding that soon after became caked mud. Having also directed the Catskill Christian Academy for 16 years, Aurigema is grateful the ministry has let him and his family take solace on their grounds for the past two months. He hopes to be out during December, by the 15th or by Christmas. When he drives down Main Street, Aurigema said, ""It's hard to comprehend how you are going to rebuild the town."" ""When I leave at night, it's sad to see none of the stores being open. I think for the most part we are on the mend; I am worried about how many people are going to move back here."" Some 20 mom-and-pop businesses, even the grocery store, were out of commission for weeks after Irene shredded the edges of nearby Schoharie Creek, Prattsville town spokesman Al Creazzo told CNN. Shaun Groden, Greene County administrator said, ""There was complete devastation, the entire village, there was not a single building in the entire town that went unscathed. Most were half knocked off (their) foundation, or worse, collapsed."" ""There are still houses boarded up, probably just awaiting the wrecking ball,"" said Groden. Groden explained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has categorized most of the damaged structures as being in what are now deemed flood zones, and that banks are reluctant to finance rebuilding in these zones, for fear of future flooding. ""The question is, can you literally pick up a home and move a quarter mile back to get it off the bank?"" Groden asked. From a municipal planning standpoint, he said, the reconstruction could take months. According to spokeswoman Rachel Racusen, FEMA has approved a total of more than $93 million in assistance to individuals affected by Hurricane Irene, to date. Creazzo said FEMA would be ""rolling in houses"" in about two weeks, with between 20 and 22 temporary homes arriving for Prattsville residents. He explained that in the meantime, displaced families have been staying with relatives and friends. ""In these towns, the families go back generations on generations. There is always someone living close by."" Slowly but surely, Creazzo said, businesses are beginning to show signs of life. ""First the supermarket, then Beth's CafÃ©, and Kenny opened up the Tavern last week,"" he said, with the ring of small-town familiarity in his words. As it does every year, the town is working hard to finish projects before the winter. The asphalt contractors are closing up shop in time for Thanksgiving, and all roads left unpaved will be gravel through the winter months. They have already replaced six of the eight bridges lost in the flood with temporary structures that Groden anticipated will hold through spring. Aurigema told CNN he is impressed by how the people of the Prattsville community have come together. ""That's why we decided to stay up here,"" he said. Since day one, facing the aftermath of the devastating storm, family, friends and neighbors lent their hands and their shovels to clear the mud out of his family's home. ""We are coming back to life, little by little,"" Aurigema said. On the more immediate topic of side dishes, table fixings and how to prepare a meal for 30 or more hungry mouths, Aurigema said, ""Well, we don't know!"" ""We are a big family and we are used to cooking for large groups. We are just grateful to give back to the community we love."" On the menu for Thanksgiving in Prattsville are turkey, corn, beans, potatoes, stuffing, yams, pies and cookies and -- Aurigema's brother's favorite -- macaroni and cheese.","The small town of Prattsville in upstate New York was ravaged by Irene .

""Business tourists prefer two- to three-star facilities because it's convenient -- they don't want to waste money on facilities they won't use,"" says Gavin Faull, president of Swiss-Belhotel International. International Air Transport Association and Smith Travel Research also anticipated higher growth in business travel compared to leisure travel in the upcoming year, according to a report from Ernst & Young -- ""Global Hospitality Insights: Top Thoughts for 2011.""

Global business travel spending is projected to grow 34 percent in four years, from US$896 billion in 2010 to US$1.2 trillion by 2014, with Asia, Latin America and the Middle East expected to grow faster than the current recovering economies of the United States and Europe, according to Ernst & Young's report. Fewer frills, more savings . Much of the growth will be driven by the increased demand for economy hotels, which cost less than full-service hotels because guests pay only for basic amenities. For example, a one-night weekend stay in November at a standard Holiday Inn Express in Hong Kong costs 20 percent less than a room at the full-service Holiday Inn Golden Mile, Hong Kong. ""[Express hotels are] everything you need and nothing you don't,"" says David Anderson, vice president at InterContinental Hotels. And the strategy for no-frills, but decent, rooms is working. Revenue per room grew 15 percent in Asia-Pacific during 2010, while the United States saw about 7 percent growth, as reported by Ernst & Young. ""This growth [in the Asia-Pacific travel industry] is a complete reflection of domestic economy strength,"" says Evan Lewis, Accor's VP for Asia-Pacific communications.

"(CNN) -- A cadaver dog searching the home where a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl was reportedly last seen indicated a positive ""hit"" for the scent of a body, according to documents released Friday. The information was included in an affidavit, dated Tuesday, police filed to request a search warrant of Lisa Irwin's Kansas City home. Baby Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. Lisa's mother, Deborah Bradley, said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. ""The cadaver dog indicated a positive 'hit' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of Bradley's bedroom near the bed,"" the affidavit read. It also said that interviews with people involved in the case ""revealed conflicting information"" and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she ""was afraid of what she might find."" A judge approved the search warrant, which allowed investigators to comb the house and barred the family from returning home. The warrant was executed on Wednesday. Police took clothing, blankets, a toy, rolls of tape and a tape dispenser from the home, documents showed. The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was ""unfortunate,"" as it could derail the search for the missing girl. Joe Tacopina described his clients as ""very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive."" He said Lisa's parents are ""terrified, not for themselves, but for the welfare of their daughter."" The attorney also stressed cadaver dogs are just meant to be an investigative tool, and cannot be considered a basis for legal action against his clients. The family's private investigator, Bill Stanton, called the information contained in the affidavit ""interesting."" ""I'm eager to get the facts (and) I hope it leads to finding baby Lisa,"" he said. Earlier in the week, Bradley said in an NBC interview that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported. Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested. Police have accused her of killing Lisa, she said, and told her that she failed a lie detector test. ""I was the last one with her,"" a tearful Bradley said. ""And from judging on how the questioning went, that's kind of a fear that I have. And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her. And then I'll never see her again, and I'll never know what happened."" Asked how much she had been drinking that night, Bradley said, ""enough to be drunk."" But she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol. ""No, no, no,"" she told NBC. ""And if I thought there was a chance, I'd say it. No. No. I don't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that."" Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, ""No. There's no question to be had there. I know who she is. I know the kind of mother she is."" Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair, according to police. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh, police said. At the time of her disappearance, she had a cold with a cough.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Dressed in black, evoking her trademark style, Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner addressed cheering crowds after preliminary vote counts on Sunday showed her heading toward re-election. ""I have come to places in my life I have never thought I'd arrive. The honor of not just being the first woman elected president but re-elected president ... my partner served as president... what else could I want?"" said Fernandez, amid fireworks, car horns and celebratory music. Continuously weaving her role as the nation's leader with being the widow of former president Nestor Carlos Kirchner, who died in 2010, Kirchner said she carries her husband's ideals as she returns to office. Fernandez, 58, has said her second presidential term will be dedicated to her late husband's memory. ""Today is a rare day for me, because there are too many feelings,"" said Kirchner in her trademark dramatic tone. ""If I tell you I am happy, I lie, if I tell you I am sad, I lie...I am not speaking as his widow but as his partner in militancy for the rest of my life,"" she said. Thousands crammed into Buenos Aires' Plaza de Mayo waving flags and shouting ""Viva Cristina, Viva Peronismo!' to welcome back their charismatic leader, the second woman to serve as president of Argentina. Entire families and groups of activists cheered as results trickled in showing the incumbent president with a considerable advantage over her opponents. Activist groups, unions, farmers, laborers and groups of indigenous Argentines waved their flags in a passionate display of support for their candidate. While official results will be announced on Monday, preliminary results showed the incumbent with 52.7% of the vote. Some analysts in Argentina said this is a historic victory for Argentina, propelling Fernandez as one of the nation's most popular leaders in recent history. The same analysts also show concern for what has become known as the new ""Cristinismo"", a populist pro-Fernandez fever which, according to La Nacion writer Luis Majul, leaves very little room for checks and balances. ""Tomorrow, or when the struggle for succession begins, and we become informed of the true cost-of-living indices, poverty and unemployment, some 'soldiers of Cristina' will recognize that their idolatry was exaggerated by the model,"" Majul wrote . Fernandez, a center-left member of the Peronist party, handily won the primary. Fernandez garnered more than half the country's votes, making her the undisputed front-runner going into Sunday's election. Among her closest competitors in the presidential election were Hermes Binner, Ricardo Alfonsin and Eduardo Duhalde.Alfonsin is a member of the opposition Radical Party and the son of the late Raul Alfonsin, who became Argentina's president in 1983 following seven years of military dictatorship. Duhalde is a long-time Peronist party leader who ruled Argentina from 2002 to 2003 in the wake of the country's $95 billion debt default, which ushered in historically high levels of crime, unemployment and poverty. He was succeeded in May 2003 by Nestor Kirchner, a relatively unknown governor from Patagonia who championed human rights causes and implemented unorthodox financial policies that many credit with helping to bring the Argentine economy back from the brink. In 2007, Kirchner stepped aside so his wife, Fernandez, could run. She was elected with 45% of the vote, becoming Argentina's first elected female president. Under Fernandez's leadership, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. The president points to this expansion and a low debt load as examples of how Argentina is well-positioned to weather the uncertainty in the current global markets. In an August speech, the president said strong economic growth and human rights advances are key to her past and future mandates. ""Strength Argentina! Forward Argentina! We will continue growing, with social inclusion, with justice, memory and truth,"" she said. However, her critics contend the economy is only booming because of high commodity prices and have repeatedly accused her government of tampering with economic statistics. Argentina's official annual inflation rate is around 9%, but most analysts and consumers suspect it is really three times that number. Kirchner died suddenly from a heart attack in October 2010, and Fernandez has benefited politically from an outpouring of sympathy. Over the past year, she has worn only black in public, and repeatedly refers to ""him"" in fiery -- and sometimes teary -- campaign speeches. Fernandez, who voted in the city of Rio Gallegos, said this vote evoked memories of her late husband, Argentina's official TELAM news agency reported. ""I happen to be the wife of a very special man, who had great impact on Argentine politics and is already a part of history"", she said. Voting is obligatory in Argentina and some 28 million people were eligible to vote in Sunday's election. CNN's Brian Byrnes, Claudia Dominguez and Helena de Moura contributed to this report.","NEW: Preliminary results give the incumbent a comfortable lead .

"(CNN) -- What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. Here is a roundup of some of the movement's recent developments: . DAVIS, CALIFORNIA . The University of California at Davis placed two police officers on administrative leave after video of them pepper-spraying non-violent protesters at point-blank range sparked outrage at school officials. The chancellor of the University of California, Davis, established a task force Saturday to look into an incident in which a police officer sprayed seated protesters with pepper spray at point blank range. See full story on UC-Davis incident . Lida Katehi told CNN's Don Lemon that she considered the police action on Friday ""unacceptable,"" but stressed she has no plans to step down. ""We really want to look into this very carefully and take action ... make sure that it will never happen again on our campus,"" she said. One of the protesters hit by the spray told CNN's Lemon that she was still feeling some after-effects Saturday evening. ""I was shocked,"" said Sophia Kamran. ""When students are sitting on the ground and (have) no way of moving to be violent, being totally peaceful, I don't understand the use of pepper spray against them."" On Saturday evening, as Katehi left campus, dozens of students sat cross-legged and with their arms linked in a silent protest. A reporter asked Katehi, ""Do you still feel threated by the students?"" ""No,"" she said. ""No."" Photos: Navigating a mob on a 'day of action' DES MOINES, IOWA . The crowd at the Family Leader Thanksgiving forum in Des Moines erupted in applause as GOP president contender Newt Gingrich said the Occupy protesters need to ""Go get a job, right after you take a bath."" ""All the Occupy movement starts with the premise that we all owe them everything,"" he said. ""They take over a public park they didn't pay for, to go nearby to use bathrooms they didn't pay for, to beg for food from places they don't want to pay for, to obstruct those who are going to work to pay the taxes to sustain the bathrooms and to sustain the park, so they can self-righteously explain they are the paragons of virtue to which we owe everything. ""Now, that is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country, and why you need to reassert something by saying to them, 'Go get a job right after you take a bath.'"" OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA . Oakland police on Sunday cleared an encampment set up by Occupy protesters a day earlier in a vacant city lot. The removal took place without incident. No arrests nor injuries were reported, according to a city news release. ""Oakland, not unlike many cities across the country, supports upholding free speech and peaceful forms of expression, but the cost of the encampments is growing and putting a strain on our already fragile resources -- police, public works, and other City staff,"" Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said in a statement. The encampment was set up Saturday night when protesters tore down a chain link fence surrounding the lot and put up tents as police watched, but did not intervene. The lot is in a district of shops and nightclubs, and the new Occupy venue did not sit well with some residents. ""I don't want it in my front yard, my backyard nor my side yard,"" resident Toni Vasquez told CNN affiliate KGO. ""This is not the way to do it. This is not the way to do it at all."" WASHINGTON . Protesters unfurled a black banner from the roof of the historic Franklin School building Saturday that said, ""Public Property Under Community Control."" They vowed to would stay inside until the vacant building was converted for community use. The school, built in 1869, served as a homeless shelter in recent years until it was shuttered in 2008. Protesters say they are against a city plan to sell it for private use. Officers later led the demonstrators out and placed them in police vans.","NEW: Oakland police clear city lot of encamped protesters .

"(CNN) -- Pitcher Derek Holland restricted St. Louis Cardinals to just two hits in eight and a third innings to help Texas Rangers record a 4-0 win Sunday night to level the World Series at 2-2. The Cardinals had hit 16 runs in a comprehensive victory in game three on Saturday, with Dominican Albert Pujols smashing three home runs, but Holland was instrumental as the Rangers scored a shut-out success. ""Our pitcher was in complete control of the game,"" Rangers designated hitter Michael Young told Major League Baseball's (MLB) official website. ""That was the story of the game. ""Every game in the postseason is huge -- every game is massive, and rightfully so -- but Derek pitched a great game tonight."" Young's view was echoed by the Cardinals' designated hitter, Lance Berkman, who conceded Holland had been the difference between the two teams. ""He was on,"" said Berkman, 35. ""The story of the game, for me, is Derek Holland was better than the St. Louis Cardinals tonight. He just was. He was great."" The Rangers' manager Ron Washington was full of praise for the left-hander, saying the 25-year-old showed his game-winning quality. ""We needed him to go out there and pitch well and he did,"" Washington said. ""He showed the world what he's capable of doing."" The Rangers' first run came at the bottom of the first, with Elvis Andrus running in from first base to score off the batting of Josh Hamilton. The game's deciding moment came at the bottom of the sixth, when Mike Napoli went deep off pitcher Mitchell Boggs to score three for Texas and cement their winning lead. The Rangers are searching for the first World Series triumph with Game Five in the best-of-seven series Monday night in Texas.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Troops loyal to Libya's new leaders maintained strong momentum Tuesday against pro-Moammar Gadhafi holdouts as they planned an assault on one loyalist city and moved into another without resistance. A National Transitional Council official said fighters were planning a major assault on Bani Walid, a northern town still held by Gadhafi loyalists. ""Our fighters are planning a massive attack today to bring the siege to an end,"" Abdallah Kenshil said. Meanwhile, NTC fighters moved into Sabha, a southern town long regarded as a pro-Gadhafi stronghold, and have met no resistance so far, according to a CNN team that accompanied the forces. This comes as an audio message purported to be from the deposed Libyan leader said the Gadhafi political system represented the people's will and could not be overthrown. The message -- broadcast Tuesday on Al-Rai TV, a Syrian-based, pro-Gadhafi television station -- said Gadhafi supporters are mocking the belief that the longtime ruler and his government can be overthrown. ""This wonderful system is impossible to be overthrown,"" the speaker said. ""There is a regime that is being forced on the Libyan people by air and naval bombardment. This is a joke, and its legitimacy is hanging in the air, tied up with bombs and NATO planes that will not last."" In Bani Walid, forces loyal to the deposed Libyan leader are creating a humanitarian disaster, the NTC said. Col. Ahmed Bani told reporters Monday that Gadhafi forces are robbing food stores, leaving civilian residents to starve. He also charged that Gadhafi loyalists are shooting everyone trying to join the revolution, including men, women and children. ""They are carrying out mass killings,"" said Bani, the NTC military spokesman. ""This proves they are trying to destroy the town before it is liberated,"" he added, calling the Gadhafi forces ""criminals"" and ""killers."" Asked by CNN why, if there is such a humanitarian disaster, NTC forces do not immediately enter the city, the colonel said the problem is ""geography."" There are tactics the forces must follow to reduce casualties, he said. Bani Walid is surrounded by anti-Gadhafi forces, he said. Asked to comment on assertions by Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim that loyalist forces in Bani Walid had captured a group of 17 mercenaries fighting for the NTC, including some British, Qatari, French and Asians, the spokesman dismissed the claim, saying, ""Don't listen to him, he's from another planet."" The rebel spokesman's remarks at a news conference came after rebel fighters suffered a sizable blow. More than 20 were killed in the northern city of Sirte on Sunday, the country's transitional government said Monday. Another 31 fighters were injured, said Abdel Rahman Busin, an NTC spokesman. Sirte, Gadhafi's hometown, is among a handful of pro-Gadhafi strongholds left in the country. ""The injured revolutionaries in Sirte have all been hit with RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) fired from areas congested with civilians where Gadhafi loyalists are hiding,"" Adel Ghulaek, spokesman for the NTC in Misrata, said Monday. ""Our men are not even firing back because they do not want to kill any innocent people. Two helicopters evacuated the injured fighters last night."" Dibeh Fakhri,a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, called the situation in Bani Walid and Sirte ""deteriorating."" ""We have not been able to enter yet,"" Fakhri said. ""We have surgical and medical supplies ready in Misrata in case we are able to deliver them into Sirte shortly. Our teams have positioned supplies in the town of Tarhuna close to Bani Walid but we have not been able to contact the authorities to be able to enter the town itself. Our teams are monitoring the situation very closely.""","NTC fighters move into Sabha without resistance .

"Washington (CNN) -- Alabama now has the toughest immigration law in the nation. The law went into effect on September 29, prompting hundreds of families to pull their children from school and workers to disappear from Alabama farms. A federal appeals court has blocked some provisions, including the one requiring state officials to check the legal status of students in public schools. No doubt, the issue is far from being settled. Alabama is just one state where an uproar over immigration has been heard. The rapid growth in Alabama's immigrant population, a large proportion estimated to be mostly present illegally, was the impetus behind the law. But the reality of immigration is more complex than the perception. You wouldn't know it from the rhetoric the last few years, but immigration nationally over the past decade was slower than in the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the United States gained 11.3 million immigrants, the largest increase this country has ever experienced, a growth rate of 57%. The 2000s, by contrast, witnessed an 8.8 million increase in immigrants, a 28% growth rate. An estimated 40 million foreign-born individuals now call the United States home, according to Census Bureau data released in September, which we analyze in a new report. So why the ruckus now? The context for immigration has changed considerably since 2000. Economic times were good at the beginning of the decade, so immigrants, legal and illegal, were drawn by plentiful jobs in an expanding economy. Back then, they were viewed as assets to our labor force and society. Today, amid economic distress, unemployment and shrinking public coffers, immigrants are more likely to be viewed as a drain on resources and as competitors for jobs. During the economic expansion of the late 1990s, immigrants found new opportunities in some unexpected places. This trend continued in this decade as immigrants dispersed to new metro areas and suburbs within metro areas. The five metropolitan areas with the largest foreign-born populations -- New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Houston -- housed a smaller share of the nation's immigrants, just 38% in 2010, compared to 43% in 2000. Meanwhile, immigrants have increasingly settled in the suburbs, so by 2010 a majority of the nation's immigrants are suburban residents. Nine metropolitan areasâ€”from Scranton, Pennsylvania to Indianapolis, Indiana to Nashville, Tennesseeâ€”experienced at least a doubling of their foreign-born populations between 2000 and 2010. This rapid change did not come without resistance. In the eight states represented by these metro areas, restrictive immigration legislation was introduced, if not passed. Florida, Tennessee, and Alabama all participate in the 287(g) program, an agreement between state and local law enforcement with Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) delegating authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions. The friction in places unaccustomed to or unprepared for new inflows of foreigners, particularly those who are assumed to be present illegally, manifests itself in different ways. In Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina, where metro areas experienced some of the fastest or largest growth in their foreign-born populations over the decade, state legislatures passed laws in 2011 to crack down on unauthorized residents. Not every region is reacting in this way. Metro areas that want to stem their population loss and boost economic growth -- such as Detroit and Cleveland -- are devising ways to woo immigrants. These areas experienced the slowest growth of their immigrant populations among all metropolitan areas -- Detroit at 9% and Cleveland at 6% -- well below the 26% growth across the 100 largest metro areas. Dayton, Ohio, where the tiny immigrant population grew by 57% over the past 10 years, is the most recent place to buck the ""stay out"" trend. The city council agreed to a new plan, crafted by 130 community members from all segments of Dayton's communities, outlining a framework for new policies to make the city more open and supportive of immigrants. Dayton's Mayor Gary Leitzel emphasized, ""This is not a city of Dayton government program. For this effort to be successful, it will take the support and active participation of businesses, schools, institutions and organizations throughout the Dayton area. The Welcome Dayton plan represents an attitude we all must adopt to take advantage of the brainpower, energy and resources available through the various immigrant groups coming to Dayton."" Even as Alabama state legislators were passing their restrictive legislation, city council members in Birmingham voted unanimously on a resolution condemning the law when it was passed in June, calling for a commission to figure out better ways to address the issues. There is widespread agreement that the national immigration system is broken, but no consensus on how to fix it. Given an acrimonious Congress, the emotional nature of the immigration issue -- especially in tough economic times -- and the looming presidential campaign season, federal reform is an unlikely prospect in the near future. In the meantime, a patchwork of state and local approaches will continue to address the benefits and challenges of immigration that confront people where they live, where they govern, and where budgets are made. In other words, don't expect the uproar to die down anytime soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Immigration actually slowed down in the last decade despite the uproar, authors say .
They say the immigration issue is much more contentious because of a poor economy .
Some areas have seen immigrant population more than double, prompting controversy .
Authors: While some pass laws to curb immigrants, other places welcome them ."
"(CNN) -- Dan Wheldon brought a bit of England with him when he began driving extremely fast cars in the United States. ""When I first started racing, a lot of the guys said that I raced with a lot of heart, occasionally not my head, but always with a lot of heart, like the way that Richard the Lionheart fought in battle,"" Wheldon wrote on a sponsor's blog in 2010. Wheldon placed a small mural of the 12th-century warrior king on his helmet in 1995, before he competed in America and eventually released ""Lionheart,"" a biographical photo book. Wheldon's fellow IndyCar drivers remembered the heart, competitiveness and growing maturity of the two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, who died in a horrific multi-car wreck at a Las Vegas event on Sunday at age 33. ""Dan came over years ago as a young, brash kid from England,"" former IndyCar driver Lyn St. James said Monday, ""and we watched him mature into being this absolute, consummate professional ... He touched so many people."" A shaken Dario Franchitti, speaking after the canceled Las Vegas Indy 300, said ""one minute you're joking around ... the next, Dan's gone."" ""We can put so much pressure on ourselves to win races and championships and it's what we love to do,"" said Franchitti, who knew Wheldon since he was a child. ""And it's what we live for. And then on days like today, it doesn't really matter. I lost, we lost ... a good friend."" Franchitti recalled Wheldon's early IndyCar years. ""He was kind of brash, but he was a charmer,"" Franchitti said. ""He became this loving family guy. He was still charming, but he had this whole new side to him."" Wheldon, 33, left behind his wife, Susie, and two young boys, Sebastian and Oliver. They live in St. Petersburg, Florida. Born in Emberton, England, Wheldon raced go-karts at the age of 4. His father was a go-kart racer and his mother was the timer at a local track. He was an IndyCar rookie in 2003 and won his first Indianapolis 500 two years later. Superstitious, the driver as an adult would tap his race car three times before getting in on the non-gear stick side, according to his IndyCar bio. After his second Indy 500 victory in May, Wheldon talked with CNN's ""American Morning"" about serving as a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Association. His mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2009. After his win, however, he found himself unemployed. ""This time off that I've had has truly made me understand and really grasp how much I love driving the cars themselves,"" he told CNN World Sport in June. ""Indy cars are fantastic to drive ... I want to be part of that, there's no doubt about it."" At that time he said he wasn't sure what the rest of the year would hold as far as sponsorship. ""If it means me sitting out the rest of the season in order to have a positive ride in 2012, then that's the best thing for me,"" he said. Sunday, drivers in Las Vegas did a five-lap salute in Wheldon's memory. ""Amazing Grace"" played as the drivers slowly wound their way around the track. The driver's father-in-law, Sven Behm, told CNN North Carolina affiliate WGHP that he had told Wheldon to have a safe race. The competitor assured him vehicles, which routinely reached speeds in excess of 225 miles per hour, had been made safer in recent years. ""He wasn't just a great driver,"" said Behm. ""But he was a great human being. He was always very positive."" He said Wheldon's sons are age 2 1/2 and 7 months. CNN ""World Sport"" anchor Patrick Snell said ""Dan Wheldon is a character. ... Extremely popular. Huge respect from his peers."" There is no question that the world of motorsports has lost one of its favorite sons,"" Snell said Sunday night.","The two-time Indy 500 winner was killed Sunday at a Las Vegas race .

"(EW.com) -- Enough with the chains and whips already. Ever since 2009's ""Rated R,"" the relentlessly dark, blood-on-your-hands record she released after being assaulted by her then boyfriend Chris Brown, Rihanna, 23, has equated falling for someone with feeling tortured. On last year's ""LOUD,"" she even tried to make pain seem empowering with the hard-pounding single ''S&M.'' But between ''Love the Way You Lie,'' a domestic-violence saga played out with Eminem, and ''Man Down,'' a ragga-tinged murder ballad, she just sounded like she needed a hug. So it's a relief to find that on her blissed-out sixth album, ""Talk That Talk,"" she's stopped trying to play it so tough. ''I'll let you in on a dirty secret,'' she purrs on ''Roc Me Out,'' ''I just want to be loved.'' And apparently, love's never come so easily to RiRi, whose new song titles include ''We Found Love,'' ''We All Want Love,'' and (yes) ''Drunk on Love.'' Is she finally admitting that being young and crushed-out on someone might feel, y'know, kind of fun? AMA adult rating flat, but a hit with teens . True, she's still got two token I-like-it-rough tracks -- ''Birthday Cake'' and ''Cockiness (Love It)'' -- but they're just filler on an album that's all about dragging you out of the bedroom and onto the dance floor. U.K. club king Calvin Harris trades Rihanna's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on ''We Found Love,'' a song that builds and builds to a climax that's so arena-ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela. Teaming with pop vet Dr. Luke, Harris offers up more house-DJ bait with ''Where Have You Been,'' which begins with a cold-pulsing 4/4 beat before falling into a rapturous Daft Punk-style breakdown. Kelly Clarkson, Bruno Mars on 'X Factor' There's an international appeal to these songs, which were recorded in luxury suites across France, Germany, and Sweden. (For the aspirational traveler, room numbers are cited in the credits.) When Rihanna's not singing over Euro-friendly thumps, she's bouncing to a Caribbean melody, or dipping into dubstep; ''Watch n' Learn'' begins with a reggae drum fill straight out of Bob Marley's ''Buffalo Soldier.'' Jay-Z even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can ''fly out to Ibiza/Just to get some pizza.'' Even with all those options, RiRi's ready to settle down on album highlight ''We All Want Love,'' which begins with a Red Hot Chili Peppers-echoing guitar riff and expands into a soaring sing-along. And the heartfelt power ballad ''Farewell'' finds her pledging loyalty to a guy who takes almost as many business trips as she does: ''Even though it kills me that you have to go/I know I'd be sadder if you didn't hit the road,'' she wails, with just enough of a wink to make him wonder what she'll do while he's gone. Smart girl. Let him get his pizza from Ibiza, but never let him forget what he's missing back home. B+ . See full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- A racially-charged word with many meanings may be at the root of a dispute between two sports rivals that reaches far beyond the soccer field, analysts say. Manchester United's Patrice Evra, who is black, says the word Uruguayan Luis Suarez shouted repeatedly during a match last month was a racial slur. Evra demanded that Suarez be held accountable for the controversial exchange, which erupted as authorities investigate other accusations of racism in soccer. Suarez, a striker for Liverpool, hasn't specified what he said, but he argues that it wasn't offensive. ""I didn't insult him. It was only a form of expressing myself. I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him,"" Suarez said, according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais. British media reports have suggested Suarez used the Spanish word ""negrito."" If that's the case, whether Suarez's remark was racist is a complicated question that doesn't have a black-and-white answer, according to scholars who've studied race issues in Latin America. Leading figures call on soccer chief to step down . ""It's about questions of translation or context,"" said Mark Sawyer, director of the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics at the University of California Los Angeles. The word's literal translation is ""little black man."" But generally, negrito is not considered a racial slur in Latin America, Sawyer said. In fact, it frequently has a positive meaning. ""It's often a term of endearment,"" he said. But what the word means also depends on where -- and how -- it's said. ""In Puerto Rico, it has one meaning. In Cuba it has a slightly different connotation and in the Dominican Republic it has a slightly different connotation,"" said Jorge Chinea, director of the Center for Chicano-Boricua Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. Blatter a controversial figure . Chinea said his mother and stepfather, both of whom were light-skinned, frequently used the word. ""When they talked as a couple, my mother would say, 'negrito, I love you.' ... I grew up listening to those expressions commonly being used by a lot of people in my community in Puerto Rico. And it was never associated with any color,"" he said. After he moved to the United States in the 1960s, Chinea said, the word took on a different meaning. Many of his acquaintances used racial nicknames, he said, but there was no harm intended. ""It was always more like a quick way of acknowledging the distinctiveness of that person in a very friendly way,"" he said. But Chinea said one of his Cuban colleagues in graduate school who employed the word drew criticism. ""When he used it and other people heard it, people came to me to complain. ... In the United States, it sounds offensive to some people,"" Chinea said. In Uruguay, the meaning is clear, said U.S. radio talk show host Fernando Espuelas, who originally hails from the South American country. ""It's not a slur whatsoever,"" said Espuelas, whose show often addresses racism in the Latino community. ""It's a term of endearment. You definitely would not use that if you were angry. It would sound ridiculous."" Blatter comments spark Twitter storm . Several scholars said the word's meaning could be connected with complicated racial politics in different Latin American countries, which each had unique historical experiences with colonization and the slave trade. Uruguay, Chinea noted, has a smaller population of African descendants than some other Latin American nations. In 2006, about 9% of the population declared ""Afro or black"" roots, according to Uruguay's National Statistics Institute. ""If I were of African descent and someone from that part of the world was to use the word toward me, I would probably think twice about what the intentions are, whereas if the person who was saying it was from Cuba you'd probably take it as a joke. And if you said it to a Puerto Rican, they'd just love it,"" Chinea said. Using the word negrito to describe U.S. President Barack Obama got a Honduran government official into hot water in 2009. Then-Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez was forced to resign after he called Obama a ""negrito who does not know where (the Honduran capital of) Tegucigalpa is."" But analysts said without hearing exactly what Suarez shouted in the October football match, or how he said it, it's impossible to know what he meant. ""It's a very interesting case. It will be interesting to see if the English Football Association actually consults experts on this,"" Sawyer said. ""If you want to charge someone with racism or making a racial slur, the person should at least have the intent of making a slur. It's not necessarily clear that Luis Suarez had that intent."" The association said Wednesday that it was charging Suarez, but did not provide details about what transpired. ""It is alleged that Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behavior towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules,"" the association said in a statement. ""It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or color and/or race of Patrice Evra,"" the statement said. Liverpool said in a statement that the club expects Suarez to request a personal hearing on the issue and ""remains determined to clear his name of the allegation made against him by Patrice Evra."" In a post on his Facebook page shortly after the October match, Suarez said the accusations of racism upset him. ""I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody,"" he said. ""We are all the same. I go to the field with the maximum (enthusiasm) of a little child who enjoys what he does, not to create conflicts."" Evra, in an interview with France's Canal Plus, said evidence would support his claim. ""There are cameras. You can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times. There is no place for that in 2011,"" he said. Issues of racism have repeatedly surged on the soccer field in recent years, despite efforts to combat it. Chelsea and England captain John Terry is at the center of a investigation by London's Metropolitan Police and the English Football Association after allegedly making racist remarks to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during an October game. Former Brazil defender Robert Carlos walked off the field during a Russian league match in June after a banana was thrown at him from the stands, while the Malaysian Football Association was forced to apologize to Chelsea in July when their Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun was subject to racial slurs during a pre-season encounter. But FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN this week that he believes there is no on-field racism in the sport. ""Maybe one of the players towards the other, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one. But also, the one who is affected by that, he should say, 'It's a game.' We are in a game. At the end of the game, we shake hands, this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination,"" he said. Blatter's comments provoked an immediate response from some players, including Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, Anton's brother. ""Your comments on racism are so condescending (it's) almost laughable. If fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok?"" he wrote in a Twitter post. Blatter later took to Twitter to explain his comments, posting: ""Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, things are said and done on the field of play which are wrong. This does not mean that, in general, there is racism on the field of play. Football unites people more than it divides them.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The suspects charged with imprisoning four mentally disabled people in a Philadelphia boiler room may have been holding seven other people, including the accused ringleader's 19-year-old niece and six children, police said Wednesday. The niece, Beatrice Weston, had been kept in a closet in an upstairs apartment in the same building where the first four were found Saturday afternoon, police said. She was being treated for ""horrific"" injuries after being found beaten, malnourished and covered with scars Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. ""I've been a police officer for more than 40 years, and I've never seen injuries like this,"" Ramsey said. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter added, ""I'm not sure horrific covers it. This is sheer madness."" The owner of the northeast Philadelphia apartment building found the original four victims locked in a dank sub-basement chamber that reeked of urine and excrement. Authorities are investigating whether Beatrice Weston's aunt, 51-year-old Linda Weston, and three others now charged in the case had been stealing the victims' Social Security checks. The 19-year-old was being held in the apartment rented by Linda Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, who became the fourth person charged in the case Wednesday afternoon, Philadelphia police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers told CNN. ""Jean was a cooperating witness. We didn't know she was a defendant,"" Evers said. ""But after talking with the captives and others, we discovered Jean was lying."" When police returned to the building Tuesday with a warrant to search McIntosh's apartment, Beatrice Weston had been moved. But they found evidence she had been there, and convinced McIntosh to produce her, Evers said. Beatrice Weston had burn marks on her body and marks on her ankles as though she'd been struck by pellets, Ramsey said -- injuries that clearly had been inflicted over some length of time. ""This girl was beaten and tortured. It makes you want to cry when you see her,"" Ramsey said. Beatrice Weston, who had been reported missing in 2009, and the six children were taken into protective custody at various locations around Philadelphia as the investigation spread, Evers said. In addition, McIntosh's 8- and 10-year-old children were also placed in protective custody, he said. McIntosh, 32, was charged with kidnapping, conspiracy, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary and trespass, the Philadelphia district attorney's office said in a statement. A judge set her bail at $1 million Wednesday, office spokeswoman Tasha Jameson said. Bail has been set at $2.5 million apiece for Weston and the two men charged in the case, 47-year-old Gregory Thomas and 49-year-old Eddie Wright. ""I'm feeling sick to my stomach,"" Danyell Tisdale, a neighborhood block captain who alerted landlord Turgut Gozleveli to suspicious activity, told CNN on Wednesday. ""I was speaking so highly for her. She was a nice neighbor and didn't bother anybody. It's shocking to me that she had anything to do with it. My sister's children played with her two children."" Police believe two of the six children placed in protective custody Wednesday -- ages 2 and 5 -- are the children of Tamara Breeden, one of the four people found in the boiler room. Authorities did not divulge how Breeden became pregnant. Investigators took DNA samples from Breeden and the three men held with her to determine whether any of them are fathers of the children, Evers said. Breeden, Edwin Sanabria and Herbert Knowles were found locked in the pitch-black, 15-by-6-foot room with no food and only a bucket for a toilet. A fourth man, identified as Derwin McLemire, had been chained to the boiler, police said. McLemire, Breeden and a Knowles, told CNN affiliate KYW that their Social Security information was taken from them, that they had been beaten and that they lived in fear of their alleged captors. ""That was real dirty of you. That was wrong,"" a tearful McLemire told KYW. He said he is from North Carolina, that he met Weston on an online dating site and had once he attempted to escape, only to be recaptured. The FBI joined the probe after detectives discovered one of the accused had traveled to at least two other states with the people found in the boiler room. Weston served eight years in prison for killing her sister's boyfriend in the early 1980s, Ramsey said earlier. In that case, the victim ""was held captive for an extended period of time, locked in a closet and he literally starved to death,"" he said. ""You would think that someone who's committed a crime that horrific would still be in jail,"" he said Tuesday. ""But she wasn't, and obviously she wasn't fully rehabilitated, either.""

"(CNN) -- The body of Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the heir to the Saudi throne who died in New York on Saturday, arrived Monday in the Saudi capital, greeted by crowds of people, authorities and troops. The body was flown into Riyadh Air Base, according to two Saudi government officials. The death of Sultan, the half-brother of King Abdullah, raises succession questions in the key oil-producing country at a time of turmoil in the Arab world. Sultan was thought to be in his 80s. He had been ill for some time -- various reports indicated he was battling cancer -- and was receiving treatment in a New York hospital at the time of his death. His burial is scheduled for Tuesday, officials have said. Sultan had served for decades as the Saudi defense minister. President Barack Obama called him a ""valued friend"" of the United States. Ascension to the Saudi throne does not pass from father to son. Instead, it's a complex process, and decisions in the conservative kingdom are often cloaked in secrecy. King Abdullah set up the Allegiance Council in 2006 to allow for more transparency in the succession. It was unclear when the group, made up of members of the royal family, will be employed to make a decision on the next crown prince. Sultan's death leaves his brother Nayef, a reputed conservative, as the likely successor. Nayef has served as the Saudi interior minister since 1975 and oversaw the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. Sultan took a leading role in Saudi Arabia's involvement in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq, heading a coalition of about half a million troops from more than 30 countries. Abdullah left a hospital in Riyadh on Saturday following successful back surgery, the Saudi Press Agency reported. It was the third back surgery in the past year for the 87-year-old king. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","The crown prince's burial is scheduled for Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Three gone (Gadhafi, Mubarak, Ben Ali), two holding on in the face of daily protests (al-Assad, Saleh), two more (Kings Abdullah of Jordan and Mohammed of Morocco) trying to stay ahead of the curve of protest: After 10 months of the Arab Spring, the region is still in the throes of a heady and unpredictable transformation. Moammar Gadhafi's demise, after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, means that three rulers in power collectively for 95 years are gone. Scholar and author Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, says that 2011 ""is to the Arabs what 1989 was to the communist world. The Arabs are now coming into ownership of their own history and we have to celebrate."" Protesters in Yemen and Syria may be re-energized by the pictures from Sirte, Libya, showing the almost pathetic end of a ruler whose flowing robes and uniforms had long given him an aura of invincibility. Demonstrators in Syrian cities celebrated Gadhafi's death and warned President Bashar al-Assad that he would be next. As one Syrian activist told CNN: ""The clear fate of all who kill his people is to end up under the feet of the nation."" Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri (no friend of the Syria regime) said: ""Any Arab citizen, watching the course of events in Libya, cannot but think of the popular revolutionary movement that is taking place in Syria."" There has been one refrain common across the Arab world this year -- from the dusty streets of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia, where it all began, to the barricades that litter Homs in Syria today: ""The fear is gone, the people have put away their fear."" Those words, spoken by Tunisian activist Sana Ben Achour in January, have echoed across the region ever since. It was quickly followed by a chant: ""The people want the downfall of the regime."" Even so, it took U.N. resolutions and thousands of NATO sorties to degrade Gadhafi's forces. And that's unlikely elsewhere. The United States and Western Europe are applying economic sanctions against the Syrian regime but have persistently discounted military intervention. President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen seems impervious to outside pressure and even his own injuries as he maneuvers back into the game. And in a majority of Arab countries, the power of the state remains formidable if not overwhelming. In 1989, the people of Eastern Europe shared a continent with developed democracies; they had a model to copy -- and considerable help in shaking off the legacy of communism. The Arab states, which did not even draw their own borders, each have different dynamics. Explosive sectarian and regional divides have enabled authoritarian rule in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Like the Gulf states, Jordan and Morocco are monarchies and their kings at least have the legitimacy of succession. Egypt and Tunisia have by Arab standards a large and capable middle class; Yemen does not. The Gulf states are enriched by massive oil and gas reserves; countries such as Jordan have little or none. The attitude toward women's rights varies widely; Islamists are stronger in some countries than others. Perhaps most importantly, security forces are in some places loyal to the flag, in others bound to the regime, or split down the middle. The military in Tunisia and Egypt would not defend leaders who became liabilities; the military in Syria has remained cohesive and loyal to al-Assad. But one of the few characteristics Arab states have long shared is the ""freedom deficit,"" the product of decades of authoritarian rule. A landmark report on Arab societies by the U.N. Development Program in 2002 concluded: ""This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development."" The situation changed little in the following decade, but other forces were at work. The pan-Arab satellite television networks -- so different from the sclerotic state broadcasters -- gave Arabs a new window on the world. The educated young began to harness the power of the Internet, outflanking the ability of bureaucracies to control it. They saw their contemporaries in the rest of the world -- Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe -- gaining new skills and opportunities, while they remained out of work. At the same time, unemployment in the Arab world, especially among graduates, remained high; corruption and nepotism were rampant. Time and again U.S. diplomatic cables sent from Arab capitals noted a growing tide of popular resentment toward their rulers. The 2009 edition of the U.N. Development Program report wrote: ""The result is an all-too-common sense of limited opportunities and personal insecurity, witnessed in the world's highest levels of unemployment, deep and contentious patterns of exclusion, and, ultimately, strong calls from within for reform."" Ultimately, those calls spilled onto the streets in spontaneous and chaotic fashion. Now, in three countries that between them occupy 2,000 miles of Mediterranean coastline, the hard work has begun of shaping what's next. Revolutions are invariably messy affairs whose outcomes are never guaranteed, whatever the ideals of their leaders. The French historian Alexis de Tocqueville wrote: ""In a revolution, as in a novel, the most difficult part to invent is the end."" Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics, said that in Libya's case ""the cleavages that we have seen in Sirte and Bani Walid that have resisted the new government are extremely alarming. We shall see whether out of this particular turmoil will emerge a unified government with a unified leadership or the political struggle will escalate and intensify."" This weekend Tunisians will become the first Arabs to elect a constituent assembly, which in turn will draw up a new constitution. But there is no path to follow. What should be the powers of president, prime minister and parliament? How is power shared between the center and regions? How are minority rights protected and the independence of the judiciary guaranteed? What is the role of Islam in society? That last question has already made its way to the top of the agenda in Tunisia, with the Islamist Ennahada party leading polls. Its leader, Rachid Ganouchi, accuses opponents of scare tactics to frighten businesses and women. But the leader of one secular party says the Islamists pose a threat to the country. As Arabs scour the horizon for templates, some look to Turkey, where a moderate Islamist party has been elected three times in a decade and presided over an economic renaissance. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan even embarked on a tour of Arab states last month (and in most places was greeted rapturously) to promote the Turkish model. ""A secular state does not mean that the people are atheists,"" Erdogan told a television show in Cairo. ""It means respect for all religions and each individual has the freedom to practice his own religion."" But even in Ankara, tensions persist between the government and a military command that sees itself as the guardian of a secular state, and the government is accused of stifling and harassing its critics. The overthrow of three men does not change the basic dilemmas faced by the Arab world: illiteracy, unemployment, a youth bulge (the United Nations estimates that Arab countries will need 50 million new jobs by 2020), chronic water shortages, a lack of women's rights, the legacy of the ""freedom deficit"" -- to which perhaps add now a burgeoning crisis of expectations. If the Arab Spring were on a calendar, we would still be in the first week.","Scholar says 2011 ""is to the Arabs what 1989 was to the communist world""

"(CNN) -- South Korean golfer K.J. Choi has pledged $100,000 to the Japan disaster relief fund through his personal charity foundation. The 40-year-old, who won two tournaments on the Japanese circuit before becoming the first from his country to qualify for the U.S. PGA Tour, will give the money to the American Red Cross. ""It is shocking and terribly sad to see what is happening every day in Japan and the difficulty they face in overcoming this disaster. The situation in Japan impacts us all on a global level,"" Choi said in a statement on Friday. ""This is the time for us to join our hands together and do all we can to help our friends in Japan. I have special memories of playing in Japan as it set the stepping stone in helping me to become the first Korean to earn a PGA Tour card. ""Through the K.J. Choi Foundation, I want to implement projects that can attract continuous interest and support to help our neighbors in Japan."" Choi has followed the example set by Japanese golfer Ryuji Imada, who is also playing at the Transitions Championship in Tampa Bay, Florida. Imada wrote a note on Wednesday stating that he would donate $1,000 for every birdie score he makes at the tournament this week, and left copies in the media room and players' locker area asking for similar contributions. The Hiroshima native, who moved to the U.S. in 1990 at the age of 14 to pursue a career as a golfer, carded no birdies in his opening round of 74 on Thursday but managed two in his 75 on Friday. He was 16 shots behind American leaders Chris Couch and Garrett Willis as he missed the halfway cut along with 19-year-old compatriot Ryo Ishikawa (73) and seven-time PGA Tour winner Choi (75). Spain's Sergio Garcia made a welcome return to form with a 66 that left him tied for third with American Webb Simpson, a shot behind the leaders. World No. 1 Martin Kaymer was five shots off the pace, tied for 26th in a group including last weekend's WGC-Cadillac Championship winner Nick Watney. Meanwhile, English golfer Anthony Wall has credited a cheap mobile-phone application for the form which has taken him to the top of the leaderboard at the halfway stage of the European Tour's Sicilian Open. Seeking to follow up his maiden victory 11 years ago, the 35-year-old carded a bogey-free four-under-par 67 in Friday's second round to claim a two-shot lead at Donnafugata Golf Resort. He said tips from former European Tour player Tony Johnstone had helped his putting stroke, but an iPhone application about reading greens by noted short-game specialist David Stockton -- who has helped the likes of three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson -- had really paid off. ""That is the best 59 pence (95 cents)  I have ever spent because his tips have really simplified a few things for me,"" Wall told the European Tour website. ""I have just been looking at the low side of every putt for the last two days -- really concentrating on the last third of the putt as opposed to the whole putt -- and that has definitely helped me. I haven't holed everything but I have hit my putts a lot better. ""It was a bargain, I have to say -- you don't get many valuable lessons for 59 pence these days! The thing about Dave Stockton is that he is and always was an amazing putter, and you tend to listen to those guys a bit more."" Wall, ranked 206th in the world, is being chased by Australia's No. 64 Richard Green and France's Raphael Jacquelin, both on seven-under 135. Left-hander Green, at 64th the top player in the field, bounced back from a double-bogey at his opening hole to card 67, with birdies at two of his last three greens. They are followed by a group of five players tied for fourth on 137, while former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie was in a bunch of six another shot back after his second successive 69.","K.J.

"(CNN) -- This may be the last time Los Angeles Lakers forward Ron Artest will answer to that name. The NBA star, who is known for his defense and unpredictable behavior, will now be known by a different name. On Friday, the basketball player formerly known as Ron Artest will officially become Metta World Peace, his publicist says. ""Metta is his official first name; which in the Buddhist tradition means loving-kindness and friendliness toward others and his last name is World Peace,"" his publicist said. The basketball star is scheduled to be at the Los Angeles County Superior Court at 8:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) where he will officially become Mr. World Peace. Artest (World Peace) joins a fraternity of sports stars who have changed their names. Kareem Abdul-Jabaar and Ahmad Rashad changed their names for religious reasons. Chad Ochocinco changed his name because .... maybe he likes incorrect Spanish versions of his jersey number? Artest's (World Peace's) reason for changing his name seems similar to the reason that former NBA player Lloyd Bernard Free changed his name to World B. Free in the 80s. ""Ron Artest, (World Peace) has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace but it took many years of research and soul searching to find a first name that was both personally meaningful and inspirational,"" his publicist said. Artest (World Peace) first announced that he was seeking the name change in the summer. At that time, some said seeing the name World Peace on the back of his jersey would be ironic given that he is known for thrashing fans in an infamous 2004 brawl during a game against the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Artest (World Peace) was suspended a record-setting 86 games for jumping into stands and punching fans during that incident when he played for the Indiana Pacers. But the new name may speak to his new reformed image. In recent years, Artest (World Peace) has shed his bad boy image and is more known for his basketball skills and his random acts of kindness. Recently, he raffled off his 2010 NBA Championship ring to help youngsters with mental illnesses and he won the NBA's citizenship award for his philanthropy in that field. He will also be in the upcoming season of ""Dancing With the Stars."" CNN's Alan Duke and Eliot C.

"Washington (CNN) -- Americans don't usually pay a lot of attention to Spanish politics, but the election of 2004 proved an exception. The election that occurred Sunday should be a second. The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war. Sunday's election could be seen as a referendum on the euro-elites who so strongly opposed that war. The conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks. In 2003-2004, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar gained the limelight -- and endured abuse -- as George Bush's most prominent ally on the European continent. Aznar joined the Iraq war and cooperated strongly with U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Aznar was swept from power in the election of March 2004, in an election overshadowed by a terrible terrorist attack three days beforehand: a bombing of Madrid's central railway station that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States. He introduced same-sex marriage to Spain and granted amnesty to 750,000 illegal aliens. He engaged in flashy diplomatic maneuvers with Turkey and against Israel. Yet even as he jabbed aggressively at hot-button issues, Zapatero was visibly befuddled by Spain's gathering economic challenges. Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all. I made a couple of visits to Spain during the early Zapatero years. The officials I talked to then seemed almost giddy with optimism. For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically. Now at last the economy was surging. In the early 2000s, average living standards caught up to those of Italy; if Spain (they said) continued to grow at current rates, it would catch up to France within the decade. Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005. How? Now we come to the fine print. If you looked closely, the Spanish economy of the 2000s was a very sick puppy. Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s. The currency launched in 2002. Signing up for a monetary union with Germany created a temporary illusion of wealth for the people of Spain. The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy. One way a less productive economy can adjust its trade is by allowing its currency to depreciate. The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option. Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain. Result: Between 2002 and the onset of recession in 2008, the Spanish trade deficit tripled, from 3% of GDP in 2002 to more than 10% in 2008. You might wonder: wait a minute! If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans. So how did Spain finance its German buying boom? Answer: The same currency union that cut the cost of buying goods from Germany also cut the cost of borrowing money from Germany. The euro did to the German-Spanish economic relationship exactly what China's currency manipulation has done to the U.S.-China relationship. Between 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge. They used the borrowed money to build and buy new homes. Through the 2000s, Spain built houses at a rate of 700,000 a year - more than Britain, Germany and France combined. Spain built shopping malls and office buildings to match. By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy. And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed). Americans well-understand how this game ends. One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise. The bubble pops. Asset values tumble. The debts remain. As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services. That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds. Spain now faces nearly 22% unemployment -- Great Depression levels -- and staggering government deficits. The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts. Zapatero slunk out of town a little while ago. Good riddance to the man who boorishly insulted the American flag at the Spanish National Day parade in 2003 to score a point with the left wing of his political party. Spain's conservatives scored a crushing victory in the Sunday vote, as the Spanish people try any desperate measure to restore their lost prosperity. But it will take more than an election to do the job. It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project, a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Elections in Spain were a victory for conservatives .

"(CNN) -- A warrant has been issued for a New Jersey man who is suspected in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, authorities announced Wednesday. Multiple law-enforcement agencies are searching for Arthur E. Morgan III, authorities said at a news conference. A group of boys discovered the child's body partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. She was strapped into her car seat, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni said. When he didn't return the girl, prosecutors in Ocean County on Tuesday morning charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody. The girl was found dead about 20 hours later, WABC reported. Police say Morgan was last seen between 7 and 8 p.m. Monday on the Asbury Park train platform. A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting that Morgan might try to leave New Jersey, where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said. ""Police are working with every ounce of their being to locate him,"" Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said. CNN's Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","Multiple law-enforcement agencies are searching for Arthur E. Morgan III .

"(CNN) -- Dutch striker Robin van Persie continued his superb scoring streak this season, netting another double as Arsenal beat German champions Borussia Dortmund 2-1 in the European Champions League to clinch top spot in Group F and secure qualification for the last 16. Captain Van Persie had already found the net 15 times for Arsenal this season, and he added another one to his tally in the 49th minute when he headed home after some superb individual play on the left from Alex Song. And Van Persie wrapped up a comfortable night for the Gunners when scoring his 17th goal from just 18 matches, tapping home from close range after Mikel Arteta's corner had been flicked on at the near post by Thomas Vermaelen. Dortmund did pull one back through Shinji Kagawa with the final kick of the game, but it was too late to make a difference as Arsenal made it eight wins and a draw from their last nine matches, following a poor start to the season. Andre-Villas Boas needs to be given more time . Arsenal are on 11 points, four clear of Greek champions Olympiakos, who stunned Marseille 1-0 in France. Koannis Fetfatzidis netted a late winner to leave Olympiakos third on six points, one point behind Marseille, with Dortmund bottom of the table on four points. However, there is a scenario that could see all those teams finish on seven points, if Olympiakos draw with Arsenal and Dortmund defeat Marseille in the final group matches in a fortnight. Meanwhile, there was drama in Group E, with Bayer Leverkusen scoring a last-gasp winner against Chelsea to virtually secure their place in the last 16 with a 2-1 victory. An injury time header from defender Manuel Friedrich saw the home side fight back from going a goal down, to inflict Chelsea's fourth defeat in seven matches and increase the pressure on under-fire manager Andre Villas-Boas. The visitors went ahead three minutes after the break when Didier Drogba turned smartly in the area before firing into the bottom corner of the net. But the German side levelled in the 73rd minute when substitute Eren Derdiyok headed into an empty net after goalkeeper Petr Cech came off his line to try and intercept Sidney Sam's superb cross. And Friedrich rose highest from a corner in the dying stages to secure a stunning comeback for Leverkusen. That result leaves Leverkusen on nine points, one clear of Chelsea and Valencia, who crushed Genk 7-0 at the Mestalla stadium. Roberto Soldado scored a first-half hat-trick for the Spanish side to leave qualification finely poised. If Chelsea beat Valencia, or draw 0-0 at Stamford Bridge in their final match, they will qualify, while Leverkusen need to avoid defeat against Genk to also go through. Defending champions Barcelona had already secured qualification, but a 3-2 victory over Milan at the San Siro ensured they will go through as Group H winners, with Milan in second place. Barca took a 14th minute lead when Mark van Bommel turned Seydou Keita's cross into his own net but Milan leveled six minutes later when Barca old boy Zlatan Ibrahimovic's shot crept under goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Lionel Messi restored Barca's lead from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Alberto Aquilani had fouled Xavi in the area, but once again Milan equalized with a superb individual goal from Kevin-Prince Boateng. However, Barca were not to be denied and they clinched the win when Messi picked out Xavi, who expertly slotted home. In the other group game, Czech side Viktoria Plzen secured their first-ever competition win with a 1-0 success at BATE Borisov, to move onto four points, while BATE remain bottom on two points. Meanwhile, outsiders APOEL Nicosia have become the first Cypriot club to reach the last 16 after a 0-0 Group G draw at Russian side Zenit St Petersburg. APOEL, who were completely unfancied going into the group stage, held their nerve in a highly-charged atmosphere, which saw play halted twice when smoke bombs covered the whole pitch making it impossible to carry on. The result means APOEL have nine points from their five matches, one ahead of Zenit and two clear of Porto, who won 2-0 at Shakhtar Donetsk in the other group match. Porto entertain Zenit in their final group game, with the winners going through alongside APOEL, although a draw would also see Zenit go through.","Arsenal reach Champions League knockout stage after 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party in the soldier's honor faces one count of attempted murder, the spokesman for the San Bernardino, California, district attorney said Tuesday. District Attorney Michael Ramos filed the charge Tuesday against 19-year-old Ruben Jurado, spokesman Christopher Lee said. He also filed ""four special allegations involving premeditation and the use and discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury,"" the DA's office said in a statement. Jurado was being held at the West Valley Detention Center and was expected to be arraigned Wednesday or Thursday. Jurado is accused of shooting Army Spc. Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan's native San Bernardino. Sullivan was there celebrating his recent return to California from Kentucky, where he was stationed while recovering from wounds sustained in a suicide bombing a year ago in Afghanistan. Sullivan narrowly survived the attack, which killed five members of his unit and left him with a cracked collar bone and brain damage, according to the San Bernardino County Sun. Sullivan was awarded the Purple Heart after the incident. He was shot at the party after an ""argument and physical confrontation"" with Jurado, San Bernardino Police Department Sgt. Pete Higgins told CNN. Accompanied by an attorney, Jurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills early Monday afternoon, said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters. The fight at the party broke out after Jurado and Sullivan's younger brother began arguing about football, the brothers' mother, Suzanne Sullivan, told CNN. Jurado ""pulled out a gun and shot him twice,"" she said. Higgins said Jurado fled the scene after the shooting. Sullivan was rushed to a hospital, where he was being treated, officials said. ""Right now, my son is hanging in physically,"" Suzanne Sullivan told CNN. ""He's on 100% life support. He can move his head and he responds through nodding and blinking to us. His eyes aren't always open, but we try to encourage him to do so as often as possible."" She said her son tried to ask what happened to him at the hospital and when they told him he wanted to know, ""Why?"" ""We told him what it was about and he just closed his eyes,"" Suzanne Sullivan told CNN. She said she was told that the suspect and her son might have gone to school and played football together. She also said she couldn't believe what had happened to her son, who she said joined the Army to try and help her out. ""He's a wonderful son. ... the best person you could meet on this Earth,"" she said. ""He's a giver, not a taker, and just wants to be there for and help people. He was so happy when he joined the Army, because he really wanted to defend his country."" The mother and her family have been at her son's hospital bedside. A fellow soldier from Christopher Sullivan's 101st Airborne Division brought the infantry's flag to the hospital, Suzanne Sullivan told CNN. ""He loved his platoon. He loved his fellow soldiers,"" she said as she began to sob. ""He was so proud to serve our country."" Tears rolled down Christopher Sullivan's face when he saw the flag of the Screaming Eagles, the nickname for the division, his mother said. ""I asked Chris if he wanted to me to hang it on the wall or cover him in it,"" Suzanne Sullivan said. ""He nodded that he wanted me to cover him with it. Once I did that he started to cry, which made me start to cry. It's been really hard on all of us."" She said she was distraught over the news that her son, who was already recovering from injuries sustained during his tour abroad, had returned to the United States only to be paralyzed during a party. ""He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it,"" she said. ""But to see he survived that, and now for this to happen to him, just breaks my heart."" Suzanne Sullivan said her family is having a difficult time coming to terms with what happened. ""We just want justice to be done,"" she said. CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","NEW: The DA also filed special allegations including premeditation .

"(CNN) -- At least 361 people have died and 600,000 were living in refugee camps because of flooding in Pakistan, the country's national disaster authority said Tuesday. The flooding in Sindh and Balochistan provinces has destroyed 1.5 million homes in 41,000 villages, the government said. The United Nations World Food Program has been distributing food, starting in the hard-hit city of Badin. As of Friday, more than 15,000 people have received assistance, the agency said. The agency estimated that 73% of food crops in the flood zone and 36% of livestock were lost or destroyed. The United Nations said Monday that it is seeking donors to build a $357 million fund to help the Pakistani government's flood response efforts. It is meant to provide food, water, sanitation, health care and shelter for some flood victims for up to six months. ""More than five million people are struggling to survive massive flooding across southern Pakistan, and the rains continue to fall,"" said Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Last year, Pakistan was also the site of massive and deadly flooding. In August 2010, weeks of flooding caused $9.7 billion in damages to homes, roads and farms in southwest Pakistan. More than 1,700 people died in the 2010 flooding, and more than 20 million were displaced. CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","More deaths are reported from the flooding, officials say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Buddhist nun in southwest China has died after setting herself on fire, the 11th Tibetan -- and second nun -- to self-immolate since March. The death of the nun, identified as Qiu Xiang, was reported by state-run Xinhua and confirmed by exile groups. The 35-year old set herself on fire at a road crossing in Dawu County, in the Ganzi region of Sichuan Province, the South China Morning Post said, citing Xinhua. It was unclear why she killed herself, though Tibetan campaign groups say it was in protest against Chinese rule. But China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed the incident related to ""pro-Tibetan independence forces"" overseas. ""Everyone knows that nowadays, except for the very few evil cults and extremist forces, all religions advocate respect for human life and oppose violence,"" said spokesperson Hong Lei. ""It is a challenge to the moral bottom line of all human beings if, instead of condemning the extreme act of self-immolation, some people are hyping or instigating it."" According to the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT), which advocates Tibetan independence, Palden Choetso -- Qiu's Tibetan name -- called for freedom and the return from exile of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, as she was burning. London-based Free Tibet also confirmed the incident. Her body was then taken by fellow nuns into the Ganden Choeling nunnery in Tawu, the ICT said. Six of the 11Tibetans -- all monks or former monks -- who have set themselves ablaze died from their injuries. Most of the suicide attempts occurred in Aba Prefecture and the Kirti monastery, also in Sichuan, which has become a focal point for ethnic Tibetans angry at the erosion of their culture. Last month, a nun in Ngaba County, Sichuan Province, became the first Tibetan woman known to have killed herself. Free Tibet said Tenzin Wangmo, 20, died outside the Dechen Chokorling Nunnery. The State Administration for Religious Affairs in Beijing told CNN they were not aware of the incident. Activists and exiled Tibetans say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under Beijing's control. ""The incidents are a clear indication of the genuine grievances of the Tibetans and their sense of deep resentment and despair over the prevailing conditions in Tibet,"" said new Tibetan leader in exile, Lobsang Sangay, in quotes carried by Free Tibet. ""It is therefore of the utmost urgency that every possible effort be made to address the underlying root causes of Tibetan grievances and resentment."" A statement from the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala, India read: ""The Kashag (Cabinet) would like to make it clear that it stands in solidarity with the Tibetan people in Tibet who endure continued suppression under the Chinese authorities, whose short-sighted policies have driven till now eleven Tibetans to set themselves on fire. ""Instead of addressing the real problems that drive Tibetans to commit self-immolation, Xinhua, the official news organ of the Chinese government, blames the Tibetans-in-exile for instigating such desperate and despairing acts. ""The Kashag strongly urges the Chinese government to stop hurling baseless allegations and to start solving the real problems. (The) People's Republic of China can do this by stopping its repressive policy on Tibet and allowing more freedom of religion and speech."" Prominent Tibetan writer and activist Tsering Woeser told CNN this kind of protest will continue as long as the Chinese government's Tibet policy remains the same. ""If there is no improvement Tibetans will feel it's better to die than be alive. They commit suicide to protest,"" she said. ""The international community should impose pressure and condemn the Chinese government,"" she added. ""But so far, the pressure is not enough, the international community only appeals to Chinese government but there are no real actions such as economic boycott."" In an interview with CNN last month, Woeser said Tibetan Buddhists can't use violence against others to protest, so they harm themselves to people pay attention to their plight. ""This is not suicide. This is sacrifice in order to draw the world's attention,"" she said. China rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying its rule has greatly improved living standards for the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama's representative signed an agreement with Beijing in 1951 to affirm China's sovereignty over Tibet but also grant autonomy to the area. A failed uprising against Beijing's rule in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama into exile. The Dalai Lama denies seeking independence for Tibet, saying he wants genuine autonomy, under which Tibetans can make their own policies on key issues, such as religious practices. In a 2008 uprising, violent unrest in Tibet and the subsequent military crackdown left at least 18 dead, and activists say tensions have remained high in many areas since then. CNN's Haolan Hong and Xiaoni Chen contributed to this report.","Death of the nun, identified as Qiu Xiang, was reported by state-run Xinhua and exile groups .

"(CNN) -- I've been a trend spotter for almost 20 years, and people have asked me -- some joking, some not -- if I foresaw that I'd be identifying cultural trends this long. Trend spotting and ESP: not the same thing. Nobody can foresee something that precise that far ahead. But I love using my background in sociology, marketing and PR to dig deep, looking for social patterns. Plus, trend spotting is huge on so many levels, especially for anybody in any industry who needs to be thinking ahead. (And isn't that everyone today?) So while other people make holiday wish lists, my tradition is making my annual trends list. While other people browse through malls, I sift through movements, mindsets and moods to come up with a rundown of what will be trending in the next 12 months. What I find doesn't always make people happy. In 2008, for instance, a controversy erupted after I was accused of attacking baby boomers when I predicted the rise of the cuspers (the age group between Gen Xers and boomers). This year, anger actually tops my list. There's plenty to be angry about in 2011; is overdosing on Sarah Palin what makes you full of rage? The economy? Airport frisking? See if that trend and my 10 others for 2011 ring true throughout the coming year: . Mad as hell, and only getting madder In the U.S., expect the prevalent mood to grow angrier, with men at home angry at their wives and the economy, women at work angry that they're the sole breadwinners, and everyone angry about taxes, reforms, individual freedoms and more. Talk to the hands In today's rebooting world, people are re-evaluating what jobs and activities are worth something deeper than the next bonus, promotion, gadget or status symbol. It grows from a yearning for an era when ordinary Americans were practical people who looked after themselves with their own hands. Net gain People worldwide are losing faith. Many Americans, for example, have lost trust in their politicians, their institutions, their media and the direction of the nation. To compensate (because they haven't lost trust in self-reliance and faith in technology), they are looking to their networks, turbocharged by computers and the internet. Public mycasting system In the emerging world of mycasting (individually curated interactive content), each individual expresses his or her worldview through what they write, the images they upload, the ""share this"" links they create, the tweets they retweet. Booting up Watch out for the return of boot camps to toughen up kids and employees for the rigors of the 21st century. Imagine manners classes and empathy workshops being replaced by emotional-resilience-conditioning workouts. Yes, we can -- reinvent ourselves ""Change"" has faded as a political slogan, but it's becoming a way of life for many. Some people are volunteering for a change in their lives; others are being forced into it. Whether the changes are voluntary or mandatory, it's time to tap into that legendary can-do spirit and remember that America is the land of second chances. Reinvention, Part II The fires of public anger burn very intensely but then hop to the next tinder. With the right timing, the right words, the right attitudes and behavior, and enough money to pay for top-class professional advocacy, even the most egregious corporate and celebrity wrongdoers might get a second chance. Separated at worth In a world where pay and compensation have become confused, and big money has begun to smell rotten, emotional wealth -- the love and respect of others -- looks like a much better bet. The extreme-cash bling of luxury objects will be overtaken by the extreme emo bling of adoring friends going the extra 10 miles. Gender bender Women are growing into new roles, and men are growing out of the traditional male roles that gave them their top-class swagger; no longer are they automatically the head of household, the sexual initiator, the protector, provider and decision maker. Who's in control? The demand for greater control is a trend that unites Americans of all persuasions. What divides them -- and what will raise passions in the near future -- is what should be controlled, how and by whom. One of the fault lines is between those who demand more self-control and those who demand more regulatory control. Tapping minitrends Some trends start small and inevitably grow huge with their own momentum; others spell opportunity for innovators. Next year, the latter includes the rise of African consumers, small-scale solar energy, mobile money-transfer services and mobile health care.

"(CNN) -- Supporters of the rulers of Bahrain threatened about 5,000 university students protesting against the government at Bahrain University Sunday, eyewitnesses said. The government denied that unjustified force was used. Elsewhere in the strategically important kingdom, riot police fired tear gas at protesters to break up the blockade of a highway, the government said. A video posted by an opposition party showed police appearing to fire two tear gas canisters at a man standing only a few feet from them. He doubles over after the first shot, and drops to the ground after the second, which appears to hit him in the face. The man is not obviously threatening the police in the video, which was posted Sunday by Wefaq. The opposition party told CNN it was filmed Sunday near Pearl Roundabout, the center of month-old protests in the kingdom. About 150 supporters of the royal family tried to get onto Bahrain University campus during the protest there, but only some managed to get in. An unknown number of people were injured, but it's not clear how many or how badly. Security forces tried to prevent the regime supporters from entering the campus, and allowed people to leave the grounds but not to enter. According to the state-run Bahrain News Agency, security forces intervened for the safety of students after clashes broke out. ""Some of the university's facilities have been vandalized by the demonstrators in breach of the allegedly claimed peaceful nature of the protests,"" the news agency reported. The tense standoff was one of at least three protests Sunday against the rulers of the small Gulf kingdom triggered by popular demonstrations that brought down the long-time presidents of Tunisia and Egypt earlier this year. The latest protests came a day after America's defense secretary said he's ""convinced"" that Bahrain's royal leaders are ""serious about real reform and moving forward,"" but emphasized that they must move quickly. Defense Secretary Robert Gates was visiting the restive island kingdom, where he huddled with King Hamad and Crown Prince Salman and talked about the importance of engaging with opposition forces. ""I think that the concern now is that it's important that they have somebody to talk to and that the opposition be willing to sit down with the government and carry this process forward,"" he said. Sunday, the United States again called the government to pursue talks with the opposition and to refrain from using force. ""In particular, we urge our GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) partners to show restraint and respect the rights of the people of Bahrain, and to act in a way that supports dialogue instead of undermining it,"" said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. The crown prince similarly renewed his call for dialogue Sunday, calling on the opposition to negotiate. He said talks could include discussion of parliament and corruption and that any decision reached could be put to a vote in a special referendum. The crown prince also stressed, however, the significance of Bahrain's security. ""Bahrain's security and the safety of its people have never been, and will never be, negotiable,"" he said in a statement. Also Sunday, some 250 young people organized a protest in front of Bahrain Financial Harbor in the capital Manama, witnesses said. Text messages exchanged between them and others in the area warned of regime supporters approaching from Muharak, another island, but it's not clear whether the warnings were accurate. Police and anti-riot squads stationed near the harbor  fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, leaving 20 injured, according to Salmanya Hospital. Al Wasat cameraman Mohammed Al-Mukharaq was among the seriously injured, his editor said. The government says protest camp tents were ""removed,"" but did not say how. Many protesters mobilized to block off King Faisal highway to prevent the pro-regime groups from entering Bahrain's main island. The government and eyewitnesses disagree about how the blockade ended. Eyewitnesses and journalists say security officers asked them to disband and open the highway, and they complied. The government said attempts by uniformed police officers to persuade the protesters to re-open the road reached an impasse and that a group of protesters attacked unarmed police officers, resulting in one police officer being stabbed and another sustaining a serious head injury. Police then sought to disperse approximately 350 protesters by using tear gas in order to clear the road, the government statement said. ""The Ministry of Interior is currently undergoing operations to reopen the King Faisal Highway and advised all protesters to return to the Pearl Roundabout for their own safety,"" the government statement said. The roundabout has been the center of protests in the kingdom for a month. Bahrain, which sits in the Persian Gulf and is the base of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, has been wracked by anti-government protests since mid-February. Sunni Muslims -- a minority in the kingdom -- dominate the government of Bahrain. The Shiite Muslim majority has staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address. Many of them are in the anti-government coalition that has been demanding reform as part of the eruption of discontent sweeping across the Arab world for the past several months. They have staged dramatic protests and camped out in the capital's Pearl Roundabout . Initially, protesters took to the streets of Manama to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some are now calling for the removal of the royal family that has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. Bahrain is in the shadow of Iran, a predominantly Shiite country and antagonist of Bahrain's close ally, the United States. But Gates told reporters Saturday he ""expressed the view that we had no evidence that suggested that Iran started any of these popular revolutions or demonstrations across the region."" However, he said, there's evidence that Iranians ""are looking for ways to exploit"" the protracted processes unfolding in the region, ""particularly in Bahrain."" Three hard-line groups in the Gulf kingdom -- the Haq, Wafa and Bahrain Freedom Movement -- have united and called for the ruling family to step aside. The new coalition is calling for a democratic republic with no ruling family -- a step further than other opposition groups, which are calling for a constitutional monarchy. It appeared the hard-line groups represented a minority of the protesters at the roundabout. In response to the protests, the government has promised to build 50,000 new housing units and hire an additional 20,000 . police officers, roughly doubling the size of the force. Members of Bahrain's majority Shiite Muslim community are not allowed to join the force. Bahrain's king reshuffled his Cabinet last month as protesters continued to call for reforms. He has also touted a ""national dialogue"" and urged Bahrainis ""to engage in this new process"" and ""move away from polarization."" Journalist Mansoor Al-Jamri and CNN's Christine Theodorou, Dominique van Heerden, Mohammed Jamjoom and Jenifer Fenton contributed to this report.","NEW: Bahrain's crown prince says security is not negotiable and calls for dialogue .

"(CNN)  -- Following the World Health Organization's announcement that radio frequency emissions from cell phones may increase the risk of some kinds of brain cancer, what do you need to know about the radiation coming from your phone? How can you protect yourself? And should RF emission information be listed on cell phone packaging, and in stores? First things first: The WHO study did not say ""cell phones cause brain cancer."" Rather, there is some evidence indicating a possible connection -- and while not conclusive, it warrants further study. Consequently, WHO has now categorized radio frequency electromagnetic fields as a ""group 2B"" possible human carcinogen. Here's how Ed Yong, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, explained it in his detailed analysis of the WHO announcement: . ""Group 2B means that there is some evidence for a risk but it's not that convincing. This group ends up being a bit of a catch-all category, and includes everything from carpentry to chloroform."" Dr. Gupta: Cell phones, brain tumors . So it's worth being aware of this classification -- just as you should be mindful of your intake of coffee, another group 2B carcinogen. But this announcement is not a reason to panic. Would labels help? San Francisco has been wrestling with whether to require cell phones to be labeled for their RF emissions. Last year, the city tried to mandate cell phone radiation labeling in stores, originally to take effect February 2011. But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, ""implementation was delayed until May 1, then June 15. There now is no proposed start date."" The city backtracked on this partly out of concern over a lawsuit filed by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association -- but also because officials didn't know how to ensure the accuracy of the labels. Scientists aren't sure what's the most realistic, intuitive way to communicate cell phone RF emissions to consumers. Specific absorption rate, a measure of the rate of RF energy that your body absorbs from the phone, is the most commonly cited benchmark. For a phone to be certified by the FCC and sold in the U.S., for example, its maximum SAR level must be less than 1.6 watts per kilogram. But Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at University of California, Berkeley, told the Chronicle that ""specific absorption rate isn't a very useful measure because it's the peak reading on a variety of tests conducted on cell phones to measure their radiation, but doesn't indicate the average amount of radiation a user would generally be exposed to."" He likened it to a car's gas mileage being reported only based on driving it up a steep hill. Such a measurement could actually make a car shopper avoid a hybrid because it doesn't perform well on hills, even though it would generally consume less gas. CNET recently updated its guide to cell phone radiation levels, which ranks phones according to SAR. Cell phones and radiation: The 10 highest- and lowest-emitting models . What cell phone users can do . If you are concerned that cell phones might increase your cancer risk, probably the best way to put the WHO announcement to good use is to minimize how much you hold your cell phone next to your head. More tips on minimizing cell phone radiation . Your best bet is to use a headset that physically plugs in to your phone, such as earbuds with a microphone attached. Unlike Bluetooth headsets, this entails no additional RF exposure near your head -- although it may take a moment to connect your headset to your phone. While the WHO examined only the possible risk of brain cancer, you can further reduce your cell phone RF exposure by placing your phone a few inches away from your body while using it -- such as in a purse or on the table. Or whenever possible, talk via your phone's speaker function, or send a text message instead of placing a call.

"(CNN) -- A prominent group of Muslim American and Christian leaders are scheduled to return to Washington Monday, following a six day visit to Iran where top government and clerical officials indicated to them that two American hikers would be released. ""Our goal has been to foster interfaith ties, build a system of understanding and ask the Iranian leadership to show compassion and mercy for the American hikers by allowing them to come home,"" said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) who went to Tehran last week as part of a religious delegation. The American delegation included Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick, Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, the Rt. Rev. John Bryson Chane, Episcopal Bishop of Washington, and Interim Dean of Washington National Cathedral, and former North Carolina State Sen. Larry Shaw, said Awad. ""The delegation was informed by the Iranian authorities that its work prior to this trip and during its current stay in Iran was very helpful and important in the decision to release the hikers,"" according to a CAIR statement released Sunday. Awad told CNN the delegation traveled to Tehran at the invitation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The appeal for the release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal began with a series of personal letters addressed to Ahmadinejad and other Iranian leaders in September 2010, CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. In May, boxing legend Muhammad Ali joined more than a dozen prominent Muslim American and various interfaith leaders -- including CAIR -- at a news conference in Washington to publicly ask for the release of the two hikers. Their appeal to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khameni, was endorsed by the group, which has maintained a dialogue with clerical leaders in Iran, said Awad. Last week, Awad and three other members of the delegation, boarded a flight to Tehran with a stop in Istanbul, Turkey. Their visit this week included meetings with Iranian religious scholars and leaders in the holy city of Qom and a meeting on Saturday with Ahmadinejad, said Awad. ""We can only hope the two men are freed soon on humanitarian grounds and that our visit fosters a better dialogue between Iranian and American leaders of faith,"" he said. The delegation was granted permission by government officials to visit Baur and Fattal in prison on Sunday but their request was postponed, said Awad. The delegation also met with family members of Iranian citizens held in the United States adding that government officials there emphasized the need to work more effectively at ""securing the freedom of Iranians in American jails,"" Awad said. The two men, along a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were arrested and taken into custody along the Iran-Iraq border in July 2009 and charged with espionage. Bauer and Fattal, both 29, were tried and sentenced last month to three years each for illegal entry into Iran and five years each for spying for the United States. The Americans say they accidentally crossed into Iran when they veered off a dirt road while hiking near a sight seeing venture in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. They have denied the charges and appealed the sentence while serving time in Tehran's Evin prison. Ms. Shourd, was released last year on humanitarian grounds. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer have been held as spies for more than two years .

"(CNN) -- Unsanitary conditions at a Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Centers for Disease Control official said it is too early to declare the outbreak over, but the number of new cases appeared to be diminishing. ""The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September,"" said Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC, who added that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks. The FDA said it was unable to pinpoint the definitive cause of the outbreak, which has been linked to 25 deaths so far. An FDA letter to Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, however, cited violations in sanitary conditions that must be addressed. It said tests showed ""widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."" The agency cited several likely causes of the spread of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria at Jensen Farms. The likely causes included packing equipment that ""was not easily cleaned and sanitized"" and the use of washing and drying equipment for cantaloupe packing as well as other raw agricultural commodities. In addition, the agency said in a statement, the facility lacked a ""pre-cooling step"" to remove field heat from the cantaloupes before cold storage, possibly leading to condensation in the cooling process that promoted growth of the listeria bacteria. A letter dated Tuesday from the FDA to Jensen Farms cited violations in sanitary conditions. The letter said tests at the facility found listeria bacteria contamination. ""These positive swabs were taken from different locations throughout the washing and packing areas in your facility, all of which were either food contact surfaces or areas adjacent to food contact surfaces,"" the letter said. ""This significant percentage of swabs that tested positive for outbreak strains of Listeria monocytogenes demonstrates widespread contamination throughout your facility and indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."" According to the letter, the company has 15 days to document steps it has taken to correct the problems. The letter also said the company notified the FDA on Monday that it agreed to inspection by the agency of its growing, packaging, and cold storage operations before it resumes food harvesting, packaging, or processing. Jensen Farms also agreed to correct all objectionable observations noted during said FDA inspections, the letter said. A total of 123 people in 26 states have been infected by the listeria outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Additionally, a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage, the agency said. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. Jensen Farms issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC has said. Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been eaten, the agency recommended. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out. Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.","The outbreak is not over, but new cases are on the decline .

"Plano, Texas (CNN) -- Texas police are hunting for a man they believe broke into the homes of four former members of the same sorority, then sexually assaulted them. The alleged attacks took place over a span of months, and occurred in the Texas cities of Plano, Coppell and Corinth, according to police. No one has been named yet as a suspect, though Plano police last week released a video -- dated in April -- showing a man they believe is responsible for all four assaults. The alleged victims -- all black females in their mid-50s to mid-60s -- offered similar descriptions of their assailant as a stout, black male in his late 30s to mid-40s. And all were alumnae of the same sorority: Delta Sigma Theta. ""He made it obvious to our victims that he knew information ... about them personally,"" said Plano police spokesman Andre Smith, adding that none of the women believe they knew their attacker in advance. While ceding the sorority membership is a ""common denominator"" of all four cases, Smith cautioned against assuming that the accused attacker had only targeted this sorority's alumnae. ""We don't want to give a false sense of security to any other group that's out there,"" he said. According to Corinth Police Capt. Greg Wilkerson, all the assaults occurred in ""residential settings"" between 9:15 p.m. and 4 a.m. when the victims were alone. The alleged attack in his city, 35 miles northwest of Dallas, took place on October 14. The late-night setting, the fact the victims were often asleep and the alleged assailant's ""attempts to conceal his identity"" make it challenging to definitively identify the attacker, said Wilkerson. He noted that the Corinth police department is currently processing DNA evidence, as are other police departments. Still, Wilkerson said that the suspect's physical traits -- weighing from 275 to 300 pounds and between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-9 tall, in his department's estimation, and balding or with a close-shaven head -- were common, as were other characteristics like what he called the man's distinctive ""swagger"" as shown in the video. Police described the video as coming from a surveillance camera, but they did not describe the specific source or location. ""There are some things ... that stick out -- his size, the glasses, the mannerism with which he walks,"" added Smith. ""We know somebody knows (him) ... We just hope that they give us a call, so we can put a stop to this."" Wilkerson said that the nature of the assaults suggests the assailant was ""possibly suspecting surveillance, spending some time around the areas ... prior to the attacks."" The police captain added authorities do not know how the suspect learned details of the victims, speculating it may have been over the internet, by accessing an old directory or noticing would-be victims with Delta Sigma Theta jewelry, placards or other paraphernalia out in public. ""We want them to understand that their group is being targeted,"" Wilkerson said of the sorority's alumnae, urging them ""not to advertise"" their affiliation with Delta Sigma Theta and advising those who live alone to stay with a relative or friend until the case is resolved. ""(But) we don't want to create any pandemonium."" The sorority's Washington-based headquarters, in a statement Monday, urged all its members in the Dallas area to take precautions. ""To think that our members are being targeted is disturbing and extremely disheartening,"" said Cynthia M.A. Butler-McIntyre, Delta Sigma Theta's president. ""Until the individual responsible for these crimes is brought to justice, we will continue to remain in close communication with one another and law enforcement officials.""","4 black women in their 50s and 60s were allegedly attacked while at home alone, police say .

"London (CNN) -- Graphic photos of the violent death of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi dominate most front newspaper pages on Friday, amid a sense of relief that an end to the conflict in the North African country is in sight. Some tabloids effectively dance on Gadhafi's grave. The headline in The Sun tabloid in Britain has the headline: ""That's for Lockerbie."" In an editorial, the paper adds: ""British forces should be very proud today as a liberated Libya celebrates the death"" of Gadhafi. ""Our brilliant troops spearheaded the operation to end the dictator's tyranny. ""Revenge is sweet. The architect of Lockerbie, who supplied the IRA with bombs and had London WPC (policewoman) Yvonne Fletcher murdered, died like a rat after being cornered in a drain. ""Six months after the killing of Osama bin Laden, the world is rid of another madman."" Even the left-leaning Guardian recognizes the success of NATO's military campaign in Libya. ""After all the waiting, the killings and the tears, the wheel of history turned inexorably, and all who watched knew it would never turn back,"" wrote the paper's Simon Tisdall. ""The Arab Spring had claimed another infamous scalp. The risky western intervention had worked. And Libya was liberated at last."" France's Le Figaro reports the events of Thursday as ""Mission Accomplished"" for NATO after a seven-month-long campaign which has seen 26,000 sorties flown over Libya. But it warns that Libya's new leaders, the National Transitional Council, must do all they can to avoid the country falling into the same state of chaos and anarchy which hit Iraq in 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein. ""The National Transitional Council has an obligation to put an end to the ragtag bands of rebels, to protect those Libyan residents with darker skin than others, to forbid any wild behavior; in short it must ensure the spirit of justice and reconciliation prevails over that of revenge."" In Germany, Die Welt ponders the question of how exactly Gadhafi's end came about, reporting on the conflicting information about his capture and subsequent killing, and questioning whether he died ""in the crossfire or at the hands of a lynch mob."" The Berlin-based daily reports on the bizarre combination of character traits that made up the ""poet and butcher"" Gadhafi, reporting that with his death, ""the world has one less mass murderer and brutally inhuman dictator, but also one less paranoid 'bird of paradise.'"" The Financial Times also hints at a sense of unease over the killing, commenting in an op-ed that ""it might perhaps have been better"" if Gadhafi had been captured alive and put on trial. However it added that his death ""has the merit of depriving the remnants of the old regime of a figurehead to rally round."" The European edition of the Wall Street Journal reflects on what the Western intervention in Libya shows us about the contenders for the White House in next year's presidential election. ""Mr. Obama's decision to keep a political low profile during the war -- to 'lead from behind' -- hurt the cause. NATO was left without a political general, and at times it wobbled. The U.S. was too late to recognize the Benghazi government, and Mr. Obama's calculated reticence invited a backlash in Congress over war powers. ""Yet the president was a statesman compared with some GOP pretenders to the commander-in-chief's chair. Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman and Newt Gingrich opposed U.S. participation as a high-risk intervention, a claim that now looks strategically mistaken and politically opportunistic. John McCain, a Republican who never wavered on Libya, yesterday offered adult advice for the U.S. now 'to deepen our support' for Libya's coming move from dictatorship to something new."" It concluded by saying the world's sole superpower ""can still shape events for the better."" ""Libya's successful revolution is the latest proof that liberating the world of a dictator can serve America's strategic interests and its moral principles."" In Britain's Independent newspaper, Robert Fisk, who met Gadhafi 30 years ago, recalls how the former Libyan strongman was alternately feted, then demonized by the West -- often with confusing haste. ""We loved him. We hated him. Then we loved him again. Blair slobbered over him. Then we hated him again. Then La Clinton slobbered over her BlackBerry and we really hated him even more again. Let us all pray that he wasn't murdered. 'Died of wounds suffered during capture.' What did that mean? ""He was a crazy combination of Don Corleone and Donald Duck ... and we who had to watch his ridiculous march-pasts and his speeches bit our lips and wrote about Libyan tanks and marines and missiles that were supposed to take this nonsense seriously. His frogmen flipped and flapped through Green Square in the heat and we had to take this rubbish at face value and pretend that it was a real threat to Israel; just as Blair tried to persuade us (not unsuccessfully) that (Gadhafi's) pathetic attempts to create 'weapons of mass destruction' had been skewered. This, in a country that couldn't repair a public lavatory."" Finally across the Atlantic, another of Rupert Murdoch's tabloids, the New York Post managed to produce one of the most bizarre front pages on Gadhafi. Alongside a photo of one of Gadhafi's alleged captors wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap, the paper got in a cheeky critique of star player Alex Rodriguez's recent performances, with the sub-headline: ""Gunman had more hits than A-Rod.""","Graphic photos of violent death of Moammar Gadhafi dominate Europe's newspapers .

"(CNN) -- A couple years ago, a Microsoft researcher named Gordon Bell embarked on a personal experiment: He would wear a video camera around his neck all the time and keep this ""life recorder"" always turned on, so it would record everything he did. It was like an external memory drive for his brain, he wrote in a book called ""Total Recall."" Sounds pretty sci-fi, right? Not so much. The ""real-time sharing"" updates Facebook announced Thursday aim to do something quite similar -- only for the Internet instead of in real life. Before we get into the details and implications, here's a ""real-time"" example of how the updates, which are rolling out in the coming weeks, will work: As I write this, I'm listening to the band LCD Soundsystem on an Internet music service called Spotify. Because I've updated my Facebook page (here's a TechCrunch article on how to do that if you're interested) and because I've logged in to Spotify with my Facebook identity, every song I listen to is automatically shared to Facebook. Suddenly, my listening experience isn't private. It's public. All my Facebook friends are watching. And judging. Chances are this will affect people's behavior online. If you're a closet fan of Lady Gaga or Bjork or Enya (I'm all three), then you'll just have to stop listening to those potentially mockable artists -- either that, or all your Facebook friends will be chiming in with comments: . ""OMG, you're listening to that?!"" In the old world of Facebook, I would have to click that I ""liked"" a song for it to show up on my Facebook profile page. That's something you have to think about: ""OK, I really like this song, and I really want all of my friends to know that I'm listening to it right now."" Now, sharing is both passive and automatic. It's a choice you make in advance -- one time -- and never again. And so it goes with all kinds of the new ""real-time"" apps. Since I've logged in to Yahoo! News with Facebook, every time I read an article on that site, it goes to my Timeline. The same is true for Hulu and TV shows. And for the Internet game ""Words with Friends."" When I play a Scrabble-style word in that game, it will show up on Facebook, along with an image of the current playing board. For Facebook, this is obviously a good thing. The site's goal -- as postulated in ""Zuckerberg's Law"" -- always has been to get people to share more and more information about themselves. That's bound to happen in this new auto-share era. It's also ostensibly good for makers of Facebook apps. In a presentation in San Francisco on Thursday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said he was initially skeptical of the deal, since it would give Facebook so much information about Netflix's customers' preferences for movies and TV shows. He decided it was smart, however, after he used the real-time app integration for himself and decided it was so addictive that it would doubtlessly result in more people watching more videos on Netflix -- a good thing for him, of course. But the benefits for Facebook users are less clear. Tech bloggers and analysts worry these automatic, real-time updates will kick off a new level of oversharing. If you were sick of hearing about what your aunt had for breakfast and who your co-workers had ""friended"" on Facebook, wait until you know every single song they've listened to and every single movie they've watched. ""It's not hard to imagine Facebook sharing more than doubling after the f8 launches,"" Liz Gannes wrote at the blog AllThingsD. ""Millions of tiny little actions are going to move from implicit to explicit. You can start to see why Facebook enabled its 'ticker' news feed earlier this week (that's the dizzying real-time stream that many users have been complaining about). There's going to be a ton of information flying by."" With every one of these ""passive"" shares, users are teaching Facebook a little more about themselves. That's incredibly valuable to advertisers, who can use that data for target marketing. It's also a potential invasion of privacy, Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology writes at The Daily Beast. ""Since a one-time click will grant a persistent permission to any app to collect and disclose personal information on your behalf, Facebook will have to make sure its users fully understand the implications of these new apps before roll-out, or risk another round of privacy backlash,"" he says. Brookman sides with Facebook on the changes, though. ""For Facebook, of course, the point is for you to provide them more data about your life, which they can use to serve you ads you'll be more likely to engage with (which makes them more money). But there's potentially real value here too, if people can discover ways to share their music-listening and cooking habits with friends in a perhaps lighter-touch way."" Passive sharing isn't a privacy invasion, but it is ""killing taste,"" Farhad Manjoo wrote at Slate. ""Why do you share a story, video, or photo? Because you want your friends to see it. And why do you want your friends to see it? Because you think they'll get a kick out of it,"" he says. ""I know this sounds obvious, but it's somehow eluded Zuckerberg that sharing is fundamentally about choosing. You experience a huge number of things every day, but you choose to tell your friends about only a fraction of them, because most of what you do isn't worth mentioning."" The MIT Technology Review notes that Facebook tried something like this in 2007. It failed. ""The new features may prove controversial,"" Tom Simonite says. ""In some ways they resemble Beacon, a failed project from 2007 in which sites like Amazon automatically posted updates to Facebook when a person bought something. Beacon was canceled after public protests over a lack of privacy controls."" We'll see how the public reacts to what Zuckerberg calls ""real-time serendipity"" when these changes launch in a few weeks. But if these changes stand, and if people do sign up for these new-new Facebook apps with auto-share built in, then all of us may soon have a semi-public record of everything we do online. Just like Bell, the researcher with a camera around his neck.","Facebook unveils ""real-time"" features .

"Washington (CNN) -- The 17-year sentence given to convicted terrorist plotter Jose Padilla was ruled too lenient by a federal appeals court on Monday, a legal victory for the Obama administration. A divided 2-1 panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said the federal judge presiding over the 2007 conspiracy trial did not properly take into account the former gang member's past criminal history when sentencing him. Padilla and two others were found guilty of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens and provide material support to terrorists. ""Padilla's sentence is substantively unreasonable because it ... does not adequately account for his risk of recidivism, was based partly on an impermissible comparison to sentences imposed in other terrorism cases, and was based in part on inappropriate factors,"" said the majority. ""First, the district court acknowledged that Padilla had a criminal history but then unreasonably discounted this criminal history when it imposed a sentence. The presentence investigation report classified Padilla as a career offender, pursuant to [federal law] because of his extensive criminal history, which included 17 arrests and a murder conviction."" Padilla was originally arrested nearly a decade ago on accusations he planned to set off radioactive ""dirty bombs"" in the United States. He had been held for 3 Â½ years as an ""enemy combatant"" in military confinement, without being charged in that alleged plot. His later convictions were not related to those accusations, and prosecutors did not present the ""dirty bomb"" plot to the jury. He and co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifan Jayyousi were also found guilty of the three counts charged: conspiracy to murder, kidnap, and maim people in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support for terrorists; and providing material support for terrorists. The appeals panel upheld the convictions and sentences of the other two defendants but said Padilla's prison term was too light, ordering the trial judge to resentence him. The judges supporting the tougher sentence were Chief Judge Joel Dubina -- a George H.W. Bush appointee -- and William Pryor, a George W. Bush appointee. The order did not include a deadline for resentencing. A federal court jury in Miami in August 2007 had deliberated for just under two days before handing down the guilty verdicts. Padilla received a ""fair trial and a just verdict,"" the Bush White House said in a statement at the time, but the administration decided to appeal the sentence. The Obama administration picked up the case in 2009. There was no immediate reaction to the appeals ruling from either Padilla's legal team or the Justice Department. During the trial, prosecutors played more than 70 intercepted phone calls among the defendants for jurors, including seven that featured Padilla, now 40. He is a Brooklyn-born convert to Islam who also is referred to in court papers as Abu Abdullah al Mujahir. FBI agent John Kavanaugh testified that the calls were made in code, which Padilla used to discuss traveling overseas to fight with Islamic militants, along with side trips to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Padilla's lawyers had argued he never spoke in code. His voice is heard on only seven of 300,000 taped conversations. In dissent in Monday's ruling, Judge Rosemary Barkett questioned Kavanaugh's testimony, saying his ""opinion testimony should have been excluded because he was never qualified as an expert and did not have the requisite firsthand knowledge to offer his lay opinion."" She also said the appeals court should not have questioned the trial judge's discretion over the sentence. The Supreme Court in 2004 had heard Padilla's original appeal over his former enemy- combatant status, claiming he deserved a chance to contest his prior military detention on constitutional grounds. He was arrested in May 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as he returned from overseas, where he had been living. He was detained as a material witness in the September 11, 2001, attacks investigation. President George W. Bush designated him an ""enemy combatant"" the following month and turned him over to the military. He was one of the few terror suspects designated by the U.S. as an enemy combatant since 9/11. Padilla was held in a South Carolina naval brig for 3 1/2 years before the government brought criminal charges against him. In November 2006, he was added to an existing indictment in south Florida, which said Padilla and his co-defendants belonged to a North American terrorist support cell and intended to carry out jihad, or holy war, in foreign countries. He was originally accused of, but never charged with, being a potential ""dirty bomber,"" allegedly plotting to detonate a crude explosive device laden with radioactive materials in the United States. Those allegations were not included in the criminal indictment. Two other enemy combatants eventually were sent overseas to the custody of other nations. The Obama administration has since abandoned using the term ""enemy combatant."" The current White House has been criticized for continuing many of the anti-terror policies of the Bush administration, including military prosecutions of high-value suspected terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay. But some conservatives have also slammed President Barack Obama for his previous desire to close the prison facility in Cuba and prosecute terrorists in civilian federal courts in the United States. That policy has since been abandoned."" Those three cases that include Padilla, as well as other appeals from foreign nationals held as enemy combatants overseas at a U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have tested the government's power to interrogate captives without allowing them regular access to a lawyer or the judicial system, on the grounds that they may pose a future threat or know about pending terrorist attacks. The current ruling is U.S. v. Padilla (08-10494).","17 years too little time for convicted terror plotter, federal appeals court rules .

"(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 23, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Wednesday. At least 116 cases of listeria have been reported in 25 states, the agency said. The two latest fatalities came in Louisiana. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals confirmed this week that an 87-year-old Baton Rouge woman died earlier this month. Last week the department also indentified a Shreveport-area woman, 81, who died from the same strain. Health officials have said the number of cases could continue to grow, citing reporting lags and the fact the disease can develop slowly in some people, taking up to two months. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Five people each have died in New Mexico and Colorado from consuming the tainted fruit, along with two people each in Kansas, Texas and now Louisiana. One has died in Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma and Wyoming, the CDC said. In addition, one woman who was pregnant at the time of the illness had a miscarriage. Cases have also been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Illinois, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women, officials have said. The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC said. Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been eaten, the CDC said. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out, officials have said. Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, authorities have said, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.","At least 116 cases have been reported in 25 states .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- In October 1991, I came to America with my wife, my 6-year-old son and my mother-in-law. Last month, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of our life in this country. I remember the journey from what was then the Soviet Union vividly. Being driven to Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, the long goodbyes with my family and friends. I remember the faces of my crying mother, my puzzled father. They were afraid of what would happen to their son and their grandson in a strange land. As we were leaving, I had to brace myself for the possibility that I would not see my family again. After all, the Iron Curtain, although rusty and crumbling, was still around. The unknown lay ahead, and it was scary. Thirty-three years in the Soviet Union were over. I felt like our lives were about to start anew. For us, life in Moscow was actually not bad at all. Family and numerous friends always compensated for living behind the Iron Curtain and numerous day-to-day shortcomings. My generation grew up in a culture of near-deprivation, constant shortages of everything imaginable. But that was nothing compared with the lives of my parents and especially my grandparents'. I recall how people used to stock up on everything. Everyone's refrigerators were actually packed with food. And, as I said, we made it through with the support of friends and family. But since my early childhood, I had heard about the ""Zapad"" -- the West, in Russian. And the older I grew, the more attractive Zapad seemed. I can still visualize my grandfather opening a package from his brother, who lived in New York. Unheard-of luxuries: Parker pens and Gillette razors wrapped in glitzy plastic. We were asked to get off the plane for the layover at Gander airport. Sunny skies, fall colors, very warm compared with slushy Moscow. That's how I remember our arrival in North America. At JFK International airport, we were told to follow the line for new immigrants. We then stayed with my friend's parents in New Jersey. We experienced hospitality and goodwill like we never had before. My friend's parents gave our family of four shelter and fed us for nearly two months. Once, they had been new immigrants, too. When we came to Atlanta, we were surprised. Everyone was driving cars, and there were no sidewalks to walk on. Once, when we walked on a street looking for an apartment to rent, a friend from CNN pulled up and offered us a ride. He ended up driving us around for the rest of the day. A lot has changed since then. I have been working for CNN since 1992. My son is a young man who lives in New York City, where he works in book publishing. My wife is an IT specialist whose long working hours are hard to be envious of. Last year, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I had to undergo surgery and have been monitored and given treatment since. But, for now at least, I like to consider myself healthy. I am in good physical shape, and I continue to work full time at CNN. I see friends and enjoy a bottle of fine wine. I rejoice when I listen to music in my car. My illness taught me to appreciate life. I feel grateful every day: for a beautiful day, for what I have. That's why Thanksgiving is so meaningful to me. In a way, I feel like every day is Thanksgiving. But on Thanksgiving Day, the last Thursday in November, everyone in America feels the same way -- I hope. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Igor Krotov.","Twenty years ago, I moved to the U.S. from the Soviet Union with my family, says Igor Krotov .

"(CNN) -- Many leading brands, including Cadbury-Schweppes, Tropicana and Tesco, have begun introducing ""carbon labeling"" on products to give customers an idea of the environmental impact of the food that they are buying. How much carbon has that created? Food with CO2 emissions labels can be confusing. CNN spoke to Tara Garnett, director of the UK-based Food Climate Research Network, an initiative committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the food chain, about the pros and cons of the system. CNN: How do carbon emissions arise in food production? Garnett: Only talking about carbon emissions is actually a bit of a misnomer. We should be looking at the full spectrum of greenhouse gases produced during food production. Once food has left the farm gate, then we are mainly dealing with carbon dioxide from transport and packaging. But while on the farm it's nitrogen oxide and methane. They are present in smaller quantities but are much more potent in terms of the effect they have. CNN: What proportion of our carbon emissions come from food? Garnett: Estimates vary. For the UK it's around 19 percent, but one EU report puts European emissions at 31 percent. The thing to understand is this is a relative statistic, so if you're talking about a society where people don't have many cars and TVs, then the proportion will be quite high. It may actually be lower in countries with a high material standard of living. Also, the estimates differ depending upon the boundaries they use, what's included and what's not included in the calculations. CNN: Do you think food-miles are a useful measure of the environmental impact of food? Garnett: They have been useful in raising awareness of where food comes from and how it is transported, but in real environmental terms it's more useful to look at total greenhouse emissions. When we do that then there are often quite counterintuitive results. For example, it might be more environmentally friendly to truck tomatoes from Italy to northern Europe rather than grow them in heated greenhouses closer by. Also, different modes of transport have different footprints; sea freight is better than road, for example. CNN: What does carbon labeling hope to achieve? Garnett: Well, it's predicated on the assumption that it will persuade consumers to make the right choice to cut their emissions, and I'm not sure it will. That would depend on having the time to construct a very consistent, clear message, and I'm not sure we do. Carbon labeling could be very good for manufacturers, to help them understand the wastage and unnecessary expense in their business, but if it's left to consumer choice I'm not sure it will achieve the wholesale shift towards more sustainable living that we need. Just buying low carbon chips won't change anything; we need to reduce the overall percentage of the high impact foods -- meat and dairy -- in our diet. CNN: Is there a global standard of labeling? Garnett: There are a plethora of different labels in Europe and the U.S., and at present there isn't a global standard. It would certainly be a good idea, and at the European level it looks quite likely. But I'm not sure about the U.S. My impression is that they are quite behind on food awareness. CNN: Do you think labeling can reduce carbon emissions in the food production system? Garnett: That depends on significant interest from consumers in their carbon emissions, which I'm not sure exists. But even if it does, shaving 10 or 20 percent off certain products doesn't create a different mind-set. Low carbon snacks won't change the world. We need to be asking: do we need all this stuff? The science says we need to make 80 percent cuts in emission by 2050, and we just don't have time to be trimming the edges. CNN: Do you think labeling could damage developing world economies that are based around exports? Garnett: Possibly. When the Soil Association (a British organic certification body) had a consultation on whether they would certify air freighted products, there was an outcry from the UK Department for International Development as well as producers overseas. But they might find if we looked at total carbon emissions rather than food miles, they might do better, with hours of free sunshine and long growing seasons reducing the need for heating and other inputs. CNN: Do you think labeling will change consumer behavior? Garnett: We need a far stronger steer from government on what a low-impact lifestyle looks like. Tinkering around with elements of consumer behavior won't deliver the changes we need. The government needs to be involved. We need to work on choice editing, and make sure products are sending the right signals to consumers about the kind of diet they need to adopt, but they are very scared of doing this. There are certain synergies with health that could be exploited -- less meat and dairy is better for us as well as the environment. We need to be looking at the portions of meat and dairy in ready meals, and getting people used to a different way of eating. I think a lot can be achieved in quite subtle ways, as well as with more gung-ho regulation. Ultimately, this is a systemic problem. Of course public awareness and information is important, but to get the change we need we will have to take drastic action. We just haven't got time to woo people for years. We need to act right now.","Food and climate expert Tara Garnett talks to CNN about carbon labeling .

"(CNN) -- In a case that drew national attention because it was to be videotaped, convicted murderer Andrew Grant DeYoung was executed by lethal injection Thursday night, a corrections department spokeswoman said. DeYoung was declared dead at 8:04 p.m. at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, said Joan Heath, the spokeswoman. His last words were: ""I'm sorry for everyone I've hurt,"" according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which was one of the media outlets granted access to the execution.  The execution occurred after the state Supreme Court denied DeYoung's motion to take another look at a lower court judge's decision Tuesday allowing the state to replace sodium thiopental with pentobarbital as the anesthetizing agent in the execution, the court's statement said. That lower court judge's ruling, however, did approve the rare videotaping of the execution at the request of DeYoung's attorneys, who argued that the substitution of drugs would cause needless pain and suffering. For the first time in Georgia, a videographer was present in the execution chamber to document DeYoung's death and his reaction to a new three-drug lethal injection that anti-death penalty activists said caused unnecessary pain and suffering, according to reports in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.  On October 13, 1995, DeYoung was convicted in Cobb County of fatally stabbing his parents, Kathryn and Gary DeYoung, and his 14-year-old sister, Sarah. His final meal was an institutional one -- chicken and rice, Heath said. DeYoung's special request for pizza, breadsticks, all-fruit strawberry preserves, Concord grape juice and vanilla ice cream was carried out on Wednesday, Heath said. With Thursday's execution, Georgia has put to death 51 men since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1973. DeYoung was the 28th inmate put to death by lethal injection, the state corrections department said. CNN's Bill Mears and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Andrew Grant DeYoung is executed by lethal injection .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Under heavy criticism for a telling cell phone carriers to ban certain words in text messages, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority went into damage control mode Wednesday. PTA spokesman Mohammed Younis Wednesday denied the existence of the plan, which has met with derision from mobile phone users in the country. ""If at all we finally decide to go for this process, then we will prepare a list in consultation with the mobile operators,"" Younis told CNN. In another conversation with CNN two days earlier, however, Younis acknowledged that the telecommunications authority had sent out a notice to carriers -- but said that the agency was giving the operators more time to come up with a shorter list. Earlier this week, three carriers -- Mobilink, Warid and Telenor -- received the notice, officials there confirmed. In it, the PTA , which regulates cell phone and internet carriers in Pakistan, called on them to implement the ban within seven days. This would mean blocking text messages containing the offending words. Most of the 1,500 banned words were deemed sexually explicit or obscene by the PTA, the officials said. The words include ""taxi"" -- often used to refer to prostitutes in Pakistan -- ""gay,"" ""tongue,"" ""homosexual,"" ""intercourse,"" ""condom"" and ""hole."" CNN has obtained a copy of the list. In the notice, which is available online, the PTA cited a law that bans the transmission of indecent and obscene messages. The notice says the banned words are part of an effort to cut down on spam and unsolicited text messages, the officials said. Last month, the PTA banned thousands of websites containing pornography. But the latest about face on text messages appears to mean the PTA will not act on the notice -- at least, any time soon.","Pakistan tells phone companies to block 1,500 words from text messages .

"(CNN) -- Odds are a lot of people who find gambling winnings stuffed into two envelopes would pocket the cash and move on. Not Mitch Gilbert. ""Some people thought I was crazy to give it back,"" the Greenwood Village, Colorado, real estate businessman, told CNN on Tuesday. ""I had to give it back. It wasn't my money to start with."" ""It"" was $10,000 held in two sealed Caesars Palace envelopes and left December 6 by a passenger at the airport in Las Vegas. Gilbert said he had an inkling the envelopes carried money, but he hesitated to give it to someone he saw a few feet away because he wasn't sure the person was the rightful owner. Gilbert waited about 40 minutes for someone to come searching for the money. He flew home with the envelopes, and found they each held $5,000 in cash. KUSA reports: Colorado man returns envelopes of cash . Gilbert said he called McCarran International Airport and was told it could not put third parties together. He vowed to follow up and about two weeks later was told an El Paso, Texas, man had reported losing the money. KUSA reached Ignacio Marquez, who said he dropped the envelopes as he was running to catch a flight. ""Relief is an understatement. Cash money is very difficult to get back. I'm very appreciative to Mitch and his family. You do not find people like this,"" Marquez said. McCarran International Airport released a statement to CNN thanking Gilbert, who got the cash to Marquez late last week. ""We appreciate Mr. Gilbert's honesty and willingness to set a great example for others, and we are pleased our Lost and Found staff was able to assist in his efforts to track down the money's owner,"" the statement said. Gilbert, who won some money of his own at Vegas, told KUSA he would want someone to do the same thing for him, even if the cash could go toward a mountain of bills. ""I wanted to show my kids the right thing to do,"" he said.","Mitch Gilbert found two envelopes, each containing $5,000, at Las Vegas airport .

"(CNN) -- Brad Drewett is reluctant to divulge exact numbers, but the ATP World Tour Finals is a big deal for men's tennis. The season-ending event, worth $5 million in prize money this year, is the tour's marquee event -- an elite eight-man showpiece that attracts top sponsors and acts as a massive advert for the game. ""It's one the of the ATP's biggest assets,"" longtime tournament director Brad Drewett told CNN during this week's round-robin matches. ""For it to be a commercial success is extremely important for us."" Drewett, a 58-year-old former tennis prodigy, has been running the finals for more than a decade now. It came to London's glitzy O2 Arena -- best known as a concert venue -- in 2009 after Drewett took it back to Shanghai for three years. Rihanna to Rafa: Tennis gets popstar makeover . ""The actual financial structure is a bit different. We have a partnership here with AEG, the owners of the O2, whereas in Shanghai we had a partnership with the municipal government who were very keen to have the event for the purpose of promoting China and Shanghai and also promoting the sport of tennis in China,"" he said. ""Here it was us wanting to bring the event back to the traditional market of Europe, and in particular London."" The UK capital has a contract until 2013, but doubts have been raised about the event's future on the banks of the River Thames due to complaints about British laws which require players to be taxed on all endorsements during the time they are in the country. The Lawn Tennis Association, which runs Wimbledon and is also an event partner of the ATP finals, is lobbying the government for an exemption. ""If we lose events like this it will have a big impact not just on the economy but also on sponsors and television and in other areas,"" LTA chief executive Roger Draper told the UK Press Association. Can Federer make finals history in London? Drewett said the ATP is happy for the event to stay in London, which is one of the ruling body's global headquarters alongside Florida, Sydney and Monte Carlo. ""That decision won't be made until the second or third quarter of next year. That's a decision for our board. We're very happy here,"" he said. ""We have every reason to believe that next year and the following year will be just as popular."" More than 250,000 people attended the 17,500-capacity arena over eight days in the first two years, and sponsorship has ""sold out"" with title partner Barclays bank joined by luxury-goods brands such as Rolex, Lacoste and Moet & Chandon along with the likes of FedEx, South African Airways, Nissan, Ricoh and Italian power giant Enel. It is broadcast in the UK by public and subscription channels, and in more than 150 countries around the world. ""It's our marquee event and it generates a significant amount of money for us,"" Drewett said. ""And from a promotional point of view this week is the event that everyone is talking about."" The 2009 rebranding from the Masters Cup has also given the tournament a distinct identity from the four grand slam events of the tennis calendar. ""A grand slam has two or three major courts, men and women, plus the outside courts over 14 days. To have quarter of a million in that time frame on one court is testament to the strength of the event and the players we have right now and their popularity,"" Drewett said. ""I personally like the rebranding. It tells a good story, it's pretty clear what it is. The message is very clear to the consumer. ""We're not looking to compete in any way with the grand slams. This event is what it is -- the format being eight players, only men, indoors, round-robin -- it speaks for itself as being totally different from a grand slam. The public understand that."" Drewett was one of the most promising young players of the 1970s, winning the Australian Open junior title twice, but was not quite so successful on the senior circuit as he reached a career-high ranking of 34. However, he did appear at the season-ending event once, in the doubles at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1988 when it was a separate tournament -- now both formats are run during the same week. At that time, Madison Square Gardens was nearing the end of a 13-year run of hosting the singles -- and Drewett believes that the O2 is taking on a similar status to the iconic New York venue. ""In its time it was one of the special ones, like here. The finals was a very special event. People still talk about playing at Madison Square Gardens, and this is going to be the same,"" he said. ""When you go out there, the court, the crowd -- there's a certain atmosphere you don't get very often at sporting events."" After ending his career, Drewett became involved in businesses before being asked to run for a place on the ATP board to represent the players. He did so for five years before taking on the role of chief executive of the ATP's International Group. ""I was always interested in the politics and business. I was interested in what made the tour tick even as a player,"" Drewett said. ""Tennis has been, in relative terms, pretty big business for a long time. In terms of professional sport it's one of the most mature. ""Tennis was one of the first where pro athletes could make a serious living from it, back in the 1950s. The business has got bigger and more mature, and it's as strong as it's ever been 60 years later.""","ATP World Tour Finals is the marquee event of men's tennis .

"(CNN) -- Left-leaning Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, leading the polls in a three-man race, looked poised to win re-election on Sunday. Ortega cast his ballot shortly after polls opened. They closed at 7 p.m. ET , with early results expected Sunday night. Nicaragua's constitution bars presidents from being re-elected, but that did not stop Ortega from running in his sixth straight presidential race. He was first elected as president in 1985, and ran unsuccessfully in 1990, 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006. Ortega is known as an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and was a public supporter of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi during the uprising there. But recently, he has reached for the middle, making overtures to the business class and promising to lure foreign investors into the country. ""Our government program is the one in practice now and the one we have to improve, strengthen (and) develop,"" Ortega said recently. For Ortega's backers, continuity will guarantee that social and economic programs will keep on. They want to see more investment in infrastructure, technology and more public housing, projects often financed through Venezuela. He came to power as part of the Sandinista rebels who overthrew the Somoza dynasty in 1979, and he represents the Sandinista National Liberation Front. His detractors accuse Ortega of having too much influence over the Supreme Electoral Council and the Supreme Court of Justice, which allowed for his candidacy. Yet his popular support remains high. ""From my point of view, it has been a good government and we hope to keep working in this way,"" said one voter, Julio Lara, ahead of the election. Another voter, Magdalena Miranda said, ""I think he has done much to help the poor."" Ortega's closest challenger is Fabio Gadea, who until recently was known as a radio-station owner and journalist, and as creator of the popular Nicaraguan radio character ""Pancho Madrigal."" Gadea ran on the Independent Liberal Party, which includes support from former Sandinista backers who in the past may have supported Ortega. ""We have proclaimed that we are going to make an honest government, a revolution of honesty that will end corruption, and with the end of corruption we can start to fix all the problems,"" Gadea said before the vote. Those who consider Ortega's candidacy unconstitutional say they found a strong candidate in the 80-year-old Gadea. ""He is the man who all Nicaraguans can confide in to defeat"" Ortega's party, resident Marlene Castillo said. ""He is the one who respects our rights, now we don't have fear like before,"" said Wilfredo Treminio. Running third in polls ahead of the election was Arnoldo Aleman, a former president who represents another liberal party. But some of those supporters have joined the ranks of Gadea's party. After leaving office, Aleman was convicted of corruption during his term and sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2003, but in a controversial 2009 decision, the nation's top court overturned the conviction.","NEW: Early results are expected quickly .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Former baseball great Lenny Dykstra reached a deal with prosecutors, pleading no contest Wednesday to three counts of grand theft auto and filing a false financial statement, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Dykstra, a three-time Major League Baseball All-Star who led the New York Mets to a World Series championship, was released pending sentencing Jan. 20, 2012, the office said in a statement. The former athlete, who faces up to four years in prison, admitted the loss was more than $100,000, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. In exchange for Dykstra's plea, 21 charges against him, including attempted grand theft auto, identity theft, possession of a controlled substance and unauthorized possession of a syringe, will be dismissed at sentencing, according to the statement. Beginning in January, Dykstra, 48, and two co-defendants tried to lease various high-end automobiles from several area dealerships by providing fraudulent information and claiming credit through a phony business, prosecutors said. A criminal complaint contended that Dykstra and Robert Hymers, 27, his accountant, provided information from a man they claimed was a co-signer, but who had not authorized his name to be used. Leases were not approved at two dealerships, but the pair and Christopher Gavanis, 30, a friend of Dykstra's, drove off with three cars at one company by providing fraudulent information to a dealer, Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen said. When Dykstra was arrested in April, Los Angeles police detectives allegedly found cocaine and ecstasy along with somatropin, a synthetic human growth hormone, when they searched his Encino home. In September, Hymers pleaded no contest to one felony count of identity theft. Gavanis pleaded no contest to one felony count of filing a false financial statement, prosecutors said. In a separate case, Dykstra was indicted in May on federal charges, including obstruction of justice for allegedly taking more than $400,000 in property that should have gone to his bankruptcy creditors and then lying about it under oath, prosecutors claim. Dykstra's stellar professional baseball career began in 1981, when the New York Mets drafted him out of high school. During his second year in the majors, the player nicknamed ""Nails"" for his tenacity, hit a lead-off home run in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series at Boston's Fenway Park, after the Mets lost the first two games. That spark rallied the Mets to a seven-game series victory over the Boston Red Sox. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","Former baseball star pleads no contest to several charges .

"Washington (CNN) -- Disturbed by the news that Moammar Gadhafi's wife and three children, along with some grandchildren, were able to flee over the Libyan border to Algeria in spite of a U.N. travel ban, the U.S. State Department nonetheless is taking a low-key approach. ""There are concerns that this isn't in keeping with the travel ban restrictions,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday but, defending the administration's response, she said the United States is reviewing Algeria's explanation for why it let the family into the country. Gadhafi's two sons who fled, Hannibal and Mohammed, along with his daughter, Aisha, are specifically named in the U.N. travel ban for ""closeness of association with (the) regime."" ""We care, in terms of the fact that under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, the Gadhafi family was subject to a travel ban,"" Nuland said. ""So, they have now traveled. The government of Algeria has now sent a letter to the UN. We are reviewing that letter now in New York but, clearly, there has to be an international community decision and response in regard to the travel ban restrictions that (the resolution) imposes."" The Algerian representative to the U.N. said Monday that his government let the Gadhafis into the country on ""humanitarian grounds."" Aisha Gadhafi gave birth to a daughter at the border. Algeria's Ambassador to the U.N., Mourad Benmehidi, told CNN, ""The wife of someone who has grievances with the international community is not necessarily subject to the same grievances."" The U.N. resolution does allow exceptions to the travel ban resolution: ""Where the Committee determines on a case-by-case basis that such travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligation."" It requires a state to inform the United Nations within 48 hours of any such decision. ""We have said that members of Gadhafi's family should be held accountable,"" the State Department's Nuland said, but added: ""...we need to review the Algerian government explanation, so does the (National Transitional Council), and we need to see where we go from there."" Algeria's decision to accept the family, however, has infuriated the rebel National Transitional Council. The council is demanding that Algerian authorities hand the family over to be tried by Libyan courts, calling Algeria's decision an ""act of aggression."" Rebels who picked through Hannibal Gadhafi's seaside villa in Libya on Sunday introduced CNN's Dan Rivers to his family's badly scarred former nanny, who said she had been doused with boiling water by Hannibal's wife, model Aline Skaf, when she refused to beat one of their crying toddlers. The abuse was corroborated by another member of the household staff.","U.N. Security Council resolution forbade travel to the Gadhafi family .

"(CNN)  -- World Player of the Year Lionel Messi grabbed his second straight hat-trick in Spain's La Liga to power Barcelona to a 4-2 in over Real Zaragoza on Sunday night. Messi, who scored twice in the midweek Champions League defeat of Stuttgart, has scored eight goals in a week and 11 of Barca's last 14. He is also he leading scorer in the league with 25. The away victory sees the reigning champions draw level on points with leaders Real Madrid in the Spanish title race. They are a staggering 18 points clear of third placed Valencia, who won 2-0 against Almeria earlier in the day. It was Argentine star Messi's fifth hat-trick while at the Catalan giants and followed his triple in the 3-0 win over Valencia last weekend. Barcelona were playing catch up after Real's 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon the day before and were given the ideal start as Messi headed them in front on four minutes. His second goal came midway through the second half after a typically incisive run as the beat two players before scoring. Messi soon completed his hat-trick before a double from home substitute Adrian Colunga gave Zaragoza late hope. But Messi was not to be denied after his earlier heroics and won a penalty which Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted in injury time, his first league goal since February 14. ""Messi did well, I'll leave it for others to find the adjectives to describe him,"" Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola told AFP.. Valencia recovered from their drubbing against Barcelona and a midweek Europa League outing to post an easy win -- their first in three games. Almeria keeper Diego Alves kept them in the match which was scoreless at halftime, but he was beaten after the break as a fine pass from David Silva set up Juan Mata for the opener. Silva sealed the win as he scored from close range. Real Mallorca continued their fine form at home with a 4-1 thrashing of Atletico Madrid to stay in the fourth and final Champions League slot. Victor Casadesus scored their opener but Diego Forlan equalized for Atletico. But within two minutes Aritz Aduriz headed Mallorca in front again. Atletico had Raul Garcia sent off in the second half to seal their fate as a Luis Perea own goal and Felipe Mattioni strike made the game safe for Mallorca. ""We showed that we are a strong and ambitious side who are candidates for a place in Europe,"" a delighted Mallorca coach Gregorio Manzano told AFP. ""In the first half we were very good and then after the sending off we were able to control the play more easily.""

"Washington (CNN) -- If the government does not take drastic steps, another deepwater oil spill like the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico could devastate the coastal areas of the United States, an oversight commission warned Tuesday in a long-awaited report to the president. More research, funding and oversight are needed to help prevent another disaster, concluded the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. ""As drilling pushes into ever deeper and riskier waters where more of America's oil lies, only systemic reforms of both government and industry will prevent a similar, future disaster,"" said William K. Reilly, the commission co-chairman. Halliburton criticized the report's conclusions, saying the commission selectively omitted information it submitted. The disaster ""was almost the inevitable result of years of industry and government complacency and lack of attention to safety,"" Reilly said. The disaster led to the worst maritime oil spill in U.S. history. That was ""indisputably the case"" with BP; Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig; and Halliburton, which installed a cement casing for drill operations, he said. It also was the case with the government agency charged with regulating offshore drilling, Reilly said. The report, ""Deep Water: The Gulf Oil Disaster and the Future of Offshore Drilling,"" proposed ""comprehensive"" government and industry actions ""to overhaul the U.S. approach to drilling safety and greatly reduce the chances of a similar, large-scale disaster in the future."" Over the past 20 years ""we became lulled into a sense of inevitable success,"" which masked the heightened risk in deepwater drilling, said the commission's co-chair, former Sen. Bob Graham. Advances in science, both in drilling offshore safely and in containing a spill, are vastly inadequate and must be improved, Graham said. The commission faulted the government for passivity, saying regulators were outmatched, underfunded and had conflicting responsibilities that kept them from effective oversight. They called for a new regulatory office headed by a scientist with a fixed term that would be created under the Interior Department. The position would be designed to remain more immune to industry pressures than current oversight agencies. Since the spill, there have already been reforms and new rules requiring companies to strengthen safety practices and modernize equipment, said Kendra Barkoff, deputy communications director for the Interior Department. ""Over the last eight months, the Department of Interior has undertaken an aggressive overhaul of the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing offshore oil and gas operations, increasing safety and ensuring oil and gas development is conducted responsibly,"" she said. The commission, convened by the president this summer, cited a systemic failure in the oil industry, blaming all three companies -- BP, Transocean and Halliburton -- involved in constructing the Deepwater Horizon rig. ""The industry needs to pick up its own game,"" said Reilly, who said the industry was already considering the commission's charge that it form a self-policing ""safety institute."" Halliburton spokeswoman Cathy Mann criticized the report's conclusions, saying the commission ""selectively omitted information provided to it by Halliburton in response to its numerous inquiries."" Mann specifically noted what she described as a mischaracterization of the February and April foam stability tests related to the cement pumped at the deepwater well, according to a company statement Tuesday. Transocean spokesperson Samantha Cohen blamed BP for the incident, lauding the Transocean crew who ""took appropriate actions to gain control of the well."" She added that ""it would be premature to draw final conclusions at this juncture,"" according to a written statement. In contrast, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said his organization commends ""the oil spill commission for its thorough and thoughtful examination of the worst environmental disaster in our nation's history."" ""This report is very timely, following a severe Alaskan pipeline leak this past week that reinforced the need for us to take a hard look at safety standards and our nation's addiction to oil,"" he said in a written statement. To help fund some recommendations, the commission suggested both raising fines on oil companies and charging them for a lease to drill off the U.S. coastline. BP said Tuesday it cooperated fully with the commission. ""Given the emerging consensus that the Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes involving multiple parties, we support the commission's efforts to strengthen industrywide safety practices,"" BP spokeswoman Ellen Moskowitz said. ""We are committed to working with government officials and other operators and contractors to identify and implement operational and regulatory changes that will enhance safety practices throughout the oil and gas industry."" The commission recommended lifting the $75 million liability cap for offshore facility incidents, but said the members could not agree on whether an oil company's liability should be unlimited. Reilly said it would be unreasonable to expect the bill to be sent to the public if the companies cause billions in dollars of damages. He suggested smaller independent oil companies could join an insurance pool to cover their risk. The commission found several ""preventable human and engineering failures were the immediate causes"" of the BP disaster. However, the commission did not weigh in on whether BP, Transocean or Halliburton broke the law in developing the Deepwater Horizon rig, and deferred the question of criminal charges to the Department of Justice. Members answered media questions Tuesday about contentious debates over drilling near Florida and Alaska. Graham referenced former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's call to ""drill, baby, drill,"" a battle cry co-opted by proponents of drilling off Florida's coast. ""The numbers are not sustainable,"" Graham said when asked about drilling off Florida. ""We need to be holding back some areas that have potential for future generations."" However, members did not object to continued drilling off Alaska, instead calling for more safety research, funds that would allow for more training for the Coast Guard in the state and new organizational structure that would allow for input from local communities. The American Petroleum Institute, which represents more than 400 oil and natural gas companies, said the group is pleased with the commission's recommendation to increase funding for more federal inspection and monitoring of offshore activity. However, API Upstream Director Erik Milito said the group is concerned that the report reflects negatively on an entire industry based on a single incident. ""This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety,"" Milito said. The commission met with President Barack Obama Tuesday before presenting its report to Congress. The commission emphasized its message was clear and unanimous, and was delivered on time -- a rarity in Washington. ""Drilling offshore is inherently risky and we can never reduce the risk to zero,"" Graham said. ""But we can mitigate the risk.""","NEW: Halliburton says the report unfairly criticizes them .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Cuban man arrested in Spain this week for alleged ties to al Qaeda was released Friday on provisional liberty, but must report daily to police, a National Court spokeswoman told CNN. The 24-year-old suspect, identified only by his initials J.E.F.M., was released after a 45-minute closed-door arraignment before Judge Fernando Andreu at the National Court, which handles terrorism cases. The court-appointed defense lawyer, Francisco Fernandez Castan, told CNN after the hearing that he argued for all charges to be dropped, saying that police allegations the Cuban had incited terrorism through internet postings was in fact just an example of ""freedom of expression."" But the judge maintained the charges of alleged links to al Qaeda, while police further analyze the suspect's various portable computers, external hard drives and USB memory sticks that were seized at the time of his arrest on Spain's Mallorca island Tuesday, said the court spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The suspect was accompanied by two uniformed police officers outside the judge's chambers, and at times was handcuffed. He wore a black T-shirt, dark ankle-high blue jeans and gray sandals. The judge's order requires him to report daily to the police station nearest his home in Cala Rajada, on the northeast side of Mallorca, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the island's capital, Palma de Mallorca. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that he was wanted for alleged membership in al Qaeda and had 1,120 radical videos on the Internet, mostly produced by him, and that he used the internet for the radical indoctrination of other individuals . Authorities have been investigating the suspect since last year, the ministry statement said. Civil Guards detained him for allegedly recruiting and indoctrinating others for the terrorist group and for distributing public messages aimed at provoking terrorist attacks, the statement added. Spain's Balearic archipelago in the Mediterranean is a popular tourist resort for Spaniards and others from Europe, with large contingents of Britons and Germans visiting or residing there. Since the Madrid train bombings of 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others, Spanish police have arrested more than 400 suspected al Qaeda militants or collaborators, the Interior Ministry website says. Most have been of North African or Middle Eastern origin, with a few from Latin America.","The suspect must report daily to police, a court spokeswoman said .

"(CNN) -- A satellite whose orbit is degrading is likely to crash back to Earth on Friday, and 26 pieces have a good chance of surviving the heat of re-entry, NASA said. Despite being pretty sure that the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, or UARS, will re-enter the atmosphere sometime Friday afternoon, U.S. time, NASA says there is no way to know where it will fall. Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes, even minutes before re-entry, it will be impossible to pinpoint an exact location, Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team said Wednesday. On top of that, he said, ""part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry."" NASA says most of the six-ton spacecraft is made of aluminum, which has a relatively low melting temperature and will burn up on re-entry. But about half a ton of material is likely to make it through. ""There are some pieces that are made of stainless steel and titanium and beryllium that have very high melting temperatures, and those pieces will survive,"" Matney said. He said NASA has identified 26 pieces, ranging from tens of pounds to a few hundred pounds, that could make it. Because water covers about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, NASA believes most, if not all the debris that survives will land in an ocean or sea. And even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any will hit people. Objects this size re-enter the Earth's atmosphere about once a year, according to NASA. This is the largest NASA satellite to re-enter in about 30 years, but at six tons, it's only a fraction of the size of the 75-ton Skylab that fell back to Earth in 1979. Portions of it hit Western Australia.","Re-entry of the atmospheric research satellite is likely to come Friday afternoon, NASA says .

"(CNN) -- The wait is almost over. After months of hype, a reported $35 million in marketing costs and one high-profile judge switcheroo, Simon Cowell's ""X Factor"" will finally premiere on Wednesday. But will it be one talent contest too many? And can the show possibly be as big a hit in the U.S. as it is back in the UK? I've been eagerly anticipating the U.S. launch of ""The X Factor"" for a long time now and have been frequently posting updates on my site Remote Patrolled. As a reality TV producer, originally from the UK but now living here in the United States, I'm very familiar with ""The X Factor"" format and its influence on British culture. For the past eight years, ""The X Factor"" has been the No. 1 entertainment show in British television, launching the career of several British pop stars and one international singing sensation, Leona Lewis. So can lightning strike twice? In case you're not too familiar with ""The X Factor"" back story, here's a quick refresher. Over in England in 2001, the ITV1 network unleashed a new talent contest called ""Pop Idol."" The show became an instant smash, due in large part to its toughest judge, Simon Cowell, and an addictive elimination format. In 2002, ""Pop Idol"" relocated to the U.S. as ""American Idol."" That show became an even bigger hit, launching stars like Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson and Carrie Underwood and making Cowell one of the richest people in show business. Now here's where it gets really interesting. ""American"" Idol was overseen by Spice Girls guru Simon Fuller, leaving Cowell as a mere (highly paid) gun-for-hire with no stake in the show -- or the success of its artists. As vocal as Cowell has been about being competitive, it is not surprising that he wanted to run his own show and reap the subsequent rewards. So back in England, ""Pop Idol"" was canceled after two seasons and replaced by the Cowell-produced ""X Factor,"" resulting in some bad blood between the two Simons and a high-profile lawsuit (eventually settled). The format of ""The X Factor"" is similar to ""Idol,"" but there are several key differences. On ""The X Factor,"" each of the four judges 'mentor' a category of contestant: Males younger than 30; females younger than 30; groups; and 30s and older. The show therefore becomes a contest between the judges as much as the contestants, often resulting in plenty of judges' bickering (""X Factor"" judges Sharon Osbourne and Dannii Minogue were reportedly barely on speaking terms by the end of their run on the show). At the same time, the diversity of the contestants also makes the show rather different from ""Idol,"" which these days only seems to crown white male guitar players. One other key difference is that ""The X Factor"" is BIG! Auditions take place in front of a live audience, rather than a tiny audition room. And as the show progresses, it's the job of the judges to produce each of the contestants' performances as though they were staging an awards show style performance. So ""X Factor"" finalists get dancers, elaborate sets and complex lighting arrangements in contrast to the ""static stand-and-sing"" style of ""American Idol."" Those are the differences. But can ""The X Factor"" succeed in the fiercely competitive U.S. marketplace? Back in England, the show faced little competition in the music competition genre. The BBC had ""Fame Academy"" (for which I produced all the live performance shows) and ITV1 had ""Popstars"" (a version of which also ran for two seasons here in the U.S.), but both shows had effectively run out of steam by the time ""The X Factor"" launched. By contrast, the U.S. version of ""The X Factor"" is entering a crowded market dominated by a decade of the very successful "" American Idol."" Then there's NBC upstart ""The Voice,"" which came out of nowhere in the spring to achieve strong ratings, especially among the highly coveted 18-49 demo. And at the same time as ""The X Factor,"" NBC will also be rolling out a new season of another singing competition, ""The Sing Off."" And those are just the success stories. Over the last few years countless music competition series have come and go. Remember ""Rock Star,"" ""The One,"" ""R U The Girl,"" ""Clash of the Choirs"" and MTV's ""Top Pop Group?"" Exactly! Even this year we've seen the heavily hyped ""Glee Project"" struggle on Oxygen, while Bravo's ""Platinum Hit"" was an outright flop. Can ""X Factor"" buck the trend and become a bona fide phenomenon? In large part, the success of ""The X Factor"" will depend on whether it can discover a true international superstar. Even Simon Cowell has admitted this will be the benchmark of the show's success. Unfortunately this will also be the show's toughest challenge. It's been a long time since ""Idol"" discovered a true star. Not since Season 7's David Cook has an ""Idol"" artist sold a million albums (though Season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert has done reasonably well), and Season 10 winner Scotty McCreery seems unlikely to buck the trend. And while ""The Voice's"" Javier Colon has received plenty of critical kudos, ""The Voice"" finale was actually one of the lower-rated episodes of the season. It could be argued that the public appetite for music competition pop stars has already been sated. Another challenge for ""The X Factor"" is that ""The Voice"" has effectively stolen one of the key gimmicks of the Simon Cowell series -- the idea of judges as 'mentors' who work with their contestants and are in a competition with one another. Even more damaging is that ""The Voice's"" starry line up -- Christina Aguilera, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Cee Lo Green -- is a heck of a lot more contemporary, successful and A-list then ""X Factor"" judges Paula Abdul, Nicole Scherzinger and L.A. Reid. But ""The X Factor"" has one undeniable ace in its hand -- Cowell himself. After a pitiful season of ""Idol"" in which Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez and Randy Jackson could barely utter a word of criticism to any of the contestants, it will be refreshing to once again hear Simon's sharp-tongued but truthful feedback. On this year's ""Idol,"" everyone was 'amazing', resulting in a tedious series that eliminated strong contenders such as Pia Toscano far too early and neutered others such as Casey Abrams who needed some harsh truth telling to raise their game. Personally I think ""The X Factor"" will be a huge hit for Fox, enabling the network to dominate the fall season in much the same way it does the second half of the TV season. With all the hype and hoopla surrounding Cowell's new show, audience awareness is higher than for any other show this season. The only remaining question is just how big will ""The X Factor"" be? Can it possibly beat the 20 million plus audience ""Idol"" still routinely clocks up? Or will it have to settle for the more modest 12 million to 14 million ""The Voice"" pulled in? Knowing Simon Cowell, nothing less than No. 1 will be good enough. But for now it's up for us the audience to decide.","Simon Cowell's ""X Factor"" will finally premiere on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The mysterious visitor stands in a patch of scrubland in Somalia, surrounded by Islamic militants wielding AK-47s. His face is covered by a white-and-red headscarf; he is slim and seems young. But there is something puzzling about him: His skin is fair, and when he speaks in an audio recording, his English is near perfect and spoken with a North American accent. The militants -- belonging to Al-Shabaab -- say his name is Abu Abdulla Almuhajir (the foreigner). And they say he is an envoy from the al Qaeda leader, Ayman al Zawahiri, thousands of miles away in Pakistan. Almuhajir has turned up in the desolate scrubland, they say, to offer al Qaeda's help with famine relief. Photographs show him at what appears to be an aid camp that Al-Shabaab claims it has set up for victims of the famine. The recording says he is delivering aid that al Qaeda had purportedly collected, including food, clothing and $12,000 converted into Somali currency. A video showing the images and audio recording was posted to Islamist websites last week. U.S. counter-terrorism agencies are still trying to ascertain Almuhajir's identity and whether he really was an al Qaeda envoy -- about which there is some doubt. The event, at which a large group of Somalis were shown sitting crossed-legged on the ground, was clearly a propaganda ploy by Al-Shabaab to boost its popularity -- and that of the al Qaeda brand. International aid agencies have sharply criticized the group for banning or obstructing aid in areas in central and southern Somalia worst hit by the famine. The group's brutal imposition of Taliban-like practices in territory under its control has also alienated many Somalis. If authentic, the event suggests a strengthening of the relationship between hard-line factions of Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda. Though factions of the group have long been allied with al Qaeda and share its vision of global jihad, the video of the meeting would be a rare demonstration of such ties. The so-called emissary told his Somali audience that al Qaeda felt their pain and urged Muslims to support Al-Shabaab, which is fighting Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law. He also recalled Osama bin Laden's long interest in Somalia, saying he ""played a major role in repelling invading forces of the Muslim land in Somalia."" And Almuhajir promised that al Qaeda's new leader, Zawahiri, would continue that support. ""In a recent release, Sheikh Ayman brought the drought in Somalia to the attention of the Muslim Ummah (or global Muslim community) and encouraged them to support their brothers in Somalia,"" he said. Western counter-terrorism analysts have been puzzling over the identity of ""the foreigner."" Several Americans and Canadians are believed to have joined al Qaeda in Pakistan in recent years and risen through the group's hierarchy. The most prominent has been Oregon-born Adam Gadahn, 33, al Qaeda's English-language spokesman who joined forces with the group around a decade ago. But counter-terrorism analysts say that Gadahn's voice (and waistline) is very different from that of the mysterious al Qaeda envoy pictured in the Al-Shabaab video. Another candidate is Adnan Shukrijumah, 36, an American citizen born in Saudi Arabia who spent much of his youth in New York and South Florida, who joined al Qaeda around the time of 9/11 and rose up the ranks to become a planner for the group's external operations. But the envoy appears to have fairer skin than Shukrijumah. And then there is Jude Kenan Mohammed, 22, from Raleigh, North Carolina. He is believed to be still at large in Pakistan after leaving the United States in October 2008 to allegedly wage jihad. Just after he arrived, he was arrested by Pakistani officials, charged with weapons possession and released on bail. The following year, he failed to show up to his court hearing, suggesting he may have slipped into tribal areas. It may be that the whole event was manufactured in an effort to bolster Al-Shabaab's credentials after a series of military setbacks. Sending an al Qaeda envoy from Pakistan to Somalia -- especially a Caucasian -- would be risky. And there are more than a dozen North Americans (from both the U.S. and Canada) who have gravitated to Somalia to wage jihad in recent years, among them Abu Mansoor al-Amriki. The 27-year old from Alabama, whose real name is Omar Hammami, has produced Al-Shabaab hip-hop videos in an effort to extend the group's appeal to English-speaking youths. Despite several unconfirmed reports that he had been killed, Hammami remains on the FBI's most-wanted list. But his voice is not an obvious match to that of the mysterious al Qaeda envoy. Al-Shabaab still controls most of central and southern Somalia, and has recently shown ambitions to take its campaign beyond Somalia's borders. In July 2010, the group carried out a pair of deadly bombings in Kampala, Uganda, killing more than 70 people. it was the first attack the group launched outside Somalia, and was in retaliation, Al-Shabaab claimed, for Uganda's deployment of peace support forces in Somalia. In September, the U.S. Africa Command warned that Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb were trying to synchronize their efforts to launch attacks on U.S and Western interests, but had yet to show a significant capability to export terror. There is also evidence, according to Western intelligence officials, of cooperation between Al-Shabaab and the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. But within Somalia, the group is under growing pressure. It has been pushed from its last redoubts in the capital, Mogadishu, even though it retains the ability to launch suicide bombings in the city. And in recent weeks, Kenya has accused Al-Shabaab of kidnapping Western tourists and aid workers in northern Kenya, allegations which the Somali group denies. Kenyan troops have launched a cross-border operation against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia with the apparent intention of setting up a buffer zone across the border. That's prompted the threat of retaliatory strikes inside Kenya. ""The Kenyan public must understand that the impetuous decision by their troops to cross the border into Somalia will not be without severe repercussions,"" the group said in a news release in English on Monday. Somalia analysts view this threat as real but believe Al-Shabaab will carefully weigh the costs and benefits of any such reprisal. The Somali group has an extensive presence in Nairobi -- home to a quarter-million Somali refugees -- and operates a network of safe houses in the city. ""They could easily tear apart Nairobi, but they've done nothing there at all because they realize this is their golden egg,"" said Michael Taarnby, an Al-Shabaab expert at the University of Central Florida.","Recording, images on Islamist websites purport to show fair-skinned man fluent in English .

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter for the death of Wang Yue, the toddler who garnered international attention after she was run over and ignored by passersby, authorities said Tuesday. Authorities arrested a man named Hu Jun, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The man, who is from eastern China, is accused of being one of two drivers who drove over the two-year-old girl on a narrow street in southern China earlier this month. The girl, known by the nickname Yue Yue, later died. Video captured by a nearby security camera showed the drivers, one after the other, hitting the girl in Foshan, Guangdong province. More than a dozen people walked, cycled or drove past the toddler as she lay bleeding in a busy market area. The video footage sparked a global outcry about the state of morality in China's fast-changing society. That included generating a flurry of activity on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, and spurring a ""Stop Apathy"" online campaign. The girl was eventually rescued by a 58-year-old scavenger who pulled her aside and tried to get help.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United secured their first victory in this season's UEFA Champions League with an unconvincing 2-0 victory against Romanian side Otelul Galati at The National Stadium in Bucharest. After a tepid first period the game burst into life in the second half with a string of penalties and red cards following a handball by the Galati defender Sergiu Costin. Wayne Rooney scored from the penalty spot but the relief was short lived. Two minutes later, Manchester United's Serbian center back Nemanja Vidic was harshly sent off for a high tackle on Gabriel Giurgiu. Galati pushed on but failed to make their numerical supremacy count, with Bratislav Punosevic guilty of missing the target when found unmarked in front of goal. A second red card was flashed, this time for the Romanian side, when Milan Perendija picked up a second yellow card. Deep in injury time Rooney was tripped in the Galati box and awarded a second penalty which he duly dispatched. It was a far from convincing performance from Manchester United, who now sit second in Group C, two points behind Portugal's Benfica who beat Basel 2-0 in Switzerland. ""We didn't have the penetration first half,"" coach Alex Ferguson told the cameras after the game. ""[Wayne Rooney showed] Composure with his two penalties, he took them well."" He was less convinced by Nemanja Vidic's red card. ""He's raised his foot and in the context of the interpretation [of the rules] I can see why he [the referee] has given it,"" he admitted. ""But it's very harsh."" Manchester City kept up appearances with the neighbors after they too secured their first UEFA Champions League win. City have found life harder in the Champions League compared to the English Premier League - where they are currently top - and soon fell behind to Spanish side Villarreal after Ruben Cani scored within four minutes. A Villarreal own goal leveled the match but Sergio Aguero scored with virtually the last kick of the match to keep City in touch with Group A leaders Bayern Munich, who drew 1-1 with Napoli . Real Madrid continued their perfect start to their Group D campaign by thumping French side Lyon 4-0. Karim Benzema scored against his old club before Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil and Sergio Ramos completed the rout. With Madrid all but through to the next round Ajax gave their chances of finishing second a boost with a 2-0 victory against Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. Group B, on the other hand, is much harder to predict. Troubled Inter Milan went top after beating French side Lille on the road thanks to a first half Giampaolo Pazzini strike. Meanwhile CSKA Moscow beat Turkish side Trabzonspor 3-0. But only four points separate top from bottom at the half way stage.","Manchester United beat Romanian side Otelul Galati 2-0 .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When is wearing a T-shirt with the American flag on it considered provocative? Answer: When you wear it to a high school with a dress code that explicitly prohibits ""any clothing or decoration which detracts from the learning environment."" And when the high school, where 20% of the 1,300 students are English-language learners and 18% come from low-income families, has been described by the San Francisco Chronicle as having ""an ethnically charged atmosphere."" And when, despite concerns about potential violence, you and some of your friends make your patriotic wardrobe choices on, of all days, Cinco de Mayo. Last week, Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Ware said as much when he dismissed a lawsuit by a group of students and their parents against the Morgan Hill Unified School District in North California. The plaintiffs had alleged that, on May 5, 2010, the students' rights to freedom of speech were violated when Live Oak High School Assistant Principal Miguel Rodriguez ordered them to remove or turn inside out T-shirts bearing the American flag. The students refused, and two of them were sent home. Under ordinary circumstances, wearing a T-shirt with the American flag on it would probably not be a big deal. But this high school is no ordinary place, especially not on Cinco de Mayo. It's a cultural powder keg. The previous year, in 2009, a group of Mexican students marked the holiday by walking around campus holding a Mexican flag. A group of white students responded by hanging a makeshift American flag from a tree and chanting ""USA."" According to the Chronicle, tensions flared and the two groups faced off with profanity and threats. Little wonder that when some students showed up at school wearing T-shirts with American flags on them administrators decided to err on the side of caution. Meanwhile, the judge did the right thing in dismissing the case and declaring that administrators had the right to take preventive action if there was a ""reasonable fear"" of violence. Score one for common sense. Can you imagine where we'd be if the court had gone the other way and stripped school officials of the power to maintain order? It's easy for conservative radio talk show hosts and other right-wing commentators to criticize the administrators, but they weren't there. They're speaking from ignorance. They don't have even the most basic understanding of the mood at the high school or the events of previous years. Conservatives are confused. For the last four decades, they have chipped away at the idea that students' free speech rights should trump every other consideration. The Supreme Court established those rights in 1969 in a case called Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School District. In that case, a group of high school and junior high school students were suspended when they wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War. The high court declared that students don't ""shed their constitutional rights to free speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."" But since Tinker, and at the urging of conservatives, the Supreme Court has curtailed First Amendment rights of students, especially when the expression of those rights is disruptive, obscene or might lead to violence. It did so in three other cases: Bethel School District v Fraser (1986), in which the high court held that a high school student's speech during an assembly -- filled with sexual innuendo -- was not protected; Hazelwood v Kuhlmeier (1988), in which the justices held that schools can regulate the content of student newspapers; and Morse v Frederick (2007), in which the Court held that school officials can restrict student speech at a school-supervised event even if it takes place off-campus. That's the new legal reality, and it's one that conservatives helped create. Now they have to live with it. The other problem is the parents, who did their offspring no favors by encouraging them to play the victim and call a lawyer. They were so eager to sue and teach their kids to stand up for their rights that they neglected to teach them that, in our system, rights come with responsibilities. Like this one: Americans have the responsibility to treat one another, and one another's cultures, with respect. Just because someone shows cultural pride -- St. Patrick's Day, anyone? -- doesn't mean it's an expression of anti-Americanism. Quite the opposite. America is all about coming together as one, while preserving the cultural attributes that make us unique. There's the rub: The students who brought the lawsuit against school officials claim to be proud of the American flag. But it's obvious they don't have the foggiest idea what it represents. And, when they had the chance, their parents failed to teach them. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter for more views on the news .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra warned Saturday that more water would pour into the capital, Bangkok, as the country endures its worst flood in half a century, state media reported. Giving her weekly television address to the nation, Shinawatra said efforts were being made to manage the flow of floodwaters to minimize the impact on residents. Extra protection would be given to historical sites, palaces, hospitals, business districts, utilities and transportation infrastructure, state-run news agency MCOT quoted her as saying. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters for victims of flooding in affected provinces, Shinawatra said, according to the agency. There are currently more than 113,000 people staying at the shelters, which can cater for about 800,000, she said. The government had hoped that strengthening flood barriers and widening canals would keep populated areas safe. But now the government is trying a different tack: opening floodgates to relieve pressure on dams and levees and send the water toward the sea. The decision to divert water through canals in Bangkok means parts of the city, and its surrounding suburbs such as Rangsit, are flooded. The flooding, which follows months of monsoon rains, has already killed 356 people, with nearly 9 million others affected, authorities said. Overall damage from the floods could top $2 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. Many residents waded through dirty water in the capital Friday as they made a desperate attempt to save their belongings. Among them was a teary-eyed woman named Surirat Prapankarn, from a suburb outside Bangkok, who could be seen lugging her sodden possessions through waist-high water. Pulling her things out of her front room, Prapankarn said she was overcome with sadness when she looked at her destroyed home and at what had been lost. She wondered how she would find food for her 16 dogs. Waters rose overnight in the northern Bangkok suburb of Rangsit, giving residents little chance to save what they could. The lucky few moved out of flooded homes by boat, or anything that could float. The rest waded through water with plastic bags balanced on their heads. Pets could be seen tucked into coats or pushed inside boats. Children, meanwhile, seemed to struggle to stay on their feet against the fast-moving water. Another resident, named Saisamorn Pongsairak, said she had lived in the inundated Rangsit neighborhood all her life. ""I woke up this morning around 2 a.m. and the water was only at my ankle high. But now it is up to my waist,"" she said. Pongsairak runs a food store, which she said she refuses to close, frying chicken in waist-high water on an elevated stove. Thailand's prime minister has urged all Bangkok residents to move their belongings to higher ground as government workers endeavor to contain the flooding. Government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisaeng said the move was a precautionary measure. To protect their cars, residents double parked along elevated highways, making it nearly impossible to navigate a city where traffic is congested on a normal day. On Thursday, authorities expressed confidence that the main international airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, was prepared to withstand the water's impact. Airport officials said a 3.5-meter-high flood prevention wall protects the airport. Thailand derives a significant portion of its revenue from tourism.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After missing her first day of community service at the Los Angeles County morgue, actress Lindsay Lohan gets a second chance to appear on time Friday. ""Lindsay arrived at the morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for orientation tomorrow,"" said her publicist Steven Honig Thursday. Just a day earlier, a judge rebuked Lohan for similar failures, revoked her probation and forced her to post $100,000 bail. ""Her lateness was due to a combination of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the media waiting for her arrival,"" Honig said in a statement. ""Lindsay spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in, and everything is all cleared up."" Chief Coroner Craig Harvey said Lohan failed to show up on time -- 10 a.m. ET Thursday -- to the coroner's office. Though she arrived late, Lohan was turned away because there wasn't enough time to complete her hours for the day, officials said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled Wednesday that after Lohan posted $100,000 bail for her probation revocation, she had to perform two working shifts -- or eight hours a day -- twice a week until her probation revocation hearing November 2. Lohan's tardiness Thursday doesn't mean she is turned away from the program, Harvey said. If Lohan shows up Friday on time, she will be allowed to work and perform her community service, Harvey said. The coroner's office will dismiss Lohan from her morgue duties only if she does something ""terribly"" wrong or shows misconduct, Harvey said. Sautner revoked probation for Lohan because of her failure to comply with community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center. Under Sautner's ruling, once Lohan made bail the same day, the actress now must perform 16 hours of community service a week -- over a minimum of two days a week -- at the county morgue before her probation violation hearing next month. Lohan, 25, was on probation after pleading guilty in May to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She served five weeks of home confinement ending in June for that misdemeanor theft and violation of another probation. Lohan's legal woes began in 2007 with two drunken driving arrests and have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes and her failures of alcohol and drug tests. Her current probation calls for her to perform 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center and 120 hours at the county morgue within a year. But the judge expressed anger Wednesday at Lohan's repeated probation failures. She said Lohan posted nine absences at the women's center since her last court hearing July 21 -- and performed, at most, only two hours of service. Lohan's attempt to perform community service at a nearby Red Cross facility -- instead of the women's center -- was voided Wednesday because the judge said she didn't authorize that change. After the hearing, Lohan publicist Honig released a statement: ""Lindsay is hoping this matter will be resolved on November 2 and the court will reinstate probation and allow her to continue fulfilling her community service."" Lohan's estranged father, Michael Lohan, told HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell"" that his daughter needs ""a very, very intensive"" program of rehabilitation for substance abuse. ""What the judge did, she had to do,"" he said Wednesday. But he said jail time would not be the proper remedy. ""She's not going to be working the morgue. She's going to wind up in a morgue if someone doesn't do something to get her help,"" he said. At one point during this week's hearing, Los Angeles city attorneys Lisa Houle and Melanie Chavira asked the court to revoke Lohan's probation and impose jail time because of her failure to do community service. One of the city attorneys said Lohan ""is in violation for getting herself kicked out of the women's center, which she was ordered to do."" But Lohan's attorney told the court that the actress received ""a glowing"" probation report, which said that ""Ms. Lohan has reached a turning point"" in her behavior and maturity. The judge raised several questions about the reliability of that report, however. Sautner remarked how the probation report showed Lohan had excused absences from community service between September 9 and October 5 so that she could travel to New York, Milan, Italy, and Paris for work. But a psychologist's report said Lohan had perfect attendance for counseling every week, the judge observed. ""The psychologist said she appeared in person for her counseling every Tuesday,"" the judge said. ""I don't know how she did that."" ""Did she go to Milan for five days and come back in time or go to Paris for five days and come back in time?"" Sautner asked the defense attorney. ""If she was gone from September 9 to October 5, did she get beamed across the pond? I don't know how that happened,"" the judge said. Lohan's attorney, Shawn Holley, told Sautner that she didn't know the specifics of Lohan's psychological appointments, but the attorney said the arrangement did call for phone conferences. Holley added that Lohan's work in Europe was done to support her and her family -- and affected her ability to carry out the community service. ""Because the work is out of the county, it did cause a disruption to her schedule"" to do community service, Holley said. Lohan's community service at the county morgue won't be easy, the judge noted. ""They don't mess around and you show up and do what they tell you to do,"" Sautner said. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Publicist: She arrives 20 minutes late to do community service at Los Angeles County morgue .

"(CNN) -- If the congressional ""super committee"" does not reach a deficit reduction deal by Wednesday's legally mandated deadline, I propose we take a page from the NBA owners and lock Congress out. I'm serious. We, the taxpayers, are the owners of Congress and if Congress won't make a deal that helps our nation, then let's put a big padlock on the doors of the House and Senate -- or at least change the locks and not give them the keys. Polls show that me and apparently 91% of my fellow Americans have never been more frustrated with the dysfunctional nature of ""our"" Congress. Congress' approval rating has fallen to an abysmal 9% -- to put this in perspective, herpes is now slightly more popular than Congress. Bed bugs really can't be that far behind. I'm not sure who the 9% of voters are who think Congress is doing a good job -- I can only assume it's Congress' friends and families as well as some of the well-connected lobbyists who have reaped benefits. Maybe the 9% are those pleased when Congress made history in August after waiting until the last minute to compromise on a budget deal, which led to the first downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's. Or possibly the 9% were impressed when House Democrats and Republicans joined together in a rare moment of bipartisanship a few weeks ago and voted in favor of a resolution by a whopping 396-9. Was this vote to create jobs for the more than 25 million Americans who are unemployed or underemployed? Or maybe this vote was to help Americans on the brink of foreclosure? Nope, this vote was to address an issue that Congress felt demanded immediate attention: Affirming that our national motto is: ""In God We Trust."" Wow, that should really put some food on the table of a hungry family whose unemployment benefits are close to expiring. I hope you take the time to ""thank"" Rep. J. Randy Forbes, a Republican from Virginia, for leading the courageous charge on that issue. Instead of a congressional lock out, perhaps Donald Trump could host a new TV show entitled: ""Congressional Apprentice,"" where each week members of Congress are given a task to help our nation. Those who fail will be met by Trump gleefully declaring: ""Congressman ... You're fired!"" I'm at the point that when I hear about a king in a foreign nation dissolving the legislature in his country, I almost wish our president could do the same. Despite all its negatives, Congress can take credit for one positive achievement: Inspiring more Americans to become engaged in politics as witnessed by both the rise of the Occupy movement and the tea party movement. Congress' failures have awakened both the left and the right of the American electorate. I hope that both the Occupy and tea party groups (and everyone else in the middle) can agree on a concrete change to our electoral system, namely: Term limits for Congress. Even though Congress' approval rating had fallen to 21% at the time of the November 2010 congressional mid-term elections, the inherent advantages of incumbency for members of Congress are so powerful that still 87% of incumbents in the House and 90% in the Senate won re-election. Term limits would mandate a turnover in the composition of Congress so that federal elected officials no longer focus on political concerns and making a career out of serving in Congress but instead on enacting legislation that benefits all Americans in the short time they will serve. Term limits are the only way to ensure meaningful change of our Congress. But that won't be easy. To impose congressional term limits, the U.S. Constitution must be amended -- just as it was with the 22nd amendment, which set a term limit for our president. The problem is that absent a constitutional convention, the only way to start the process for a Constitutional amendment is that Congress -- the people with a 9% approval rating -- have to pass it by a two-thirds vote in each chamber before it can be sent for the required approval by three-fourths of the state legislatures. Good luck getting Congress to agree on that. Our best and most practical hope is asking candidates running for Congress to make a personal pledge to limits of two terms in the Senate and three in the House. Congress, though, still has a chance to atone for its mistakes. It's like at the end of the holiday classic, ""The Christmas Carol"" when Ebenezer Scrooge awoke on Christmas morning, and after realizing he still had a chance to redeem himself, joyfully declared: ""I haven't missed it. "" Well, Congress, you have almost missed it. While we don't have three ghosts to warn you, we do have hundreds of millions of Americans sending you a message: Stop the political posturing, make a deficit reduction deal and then work together to revive our nation's economy. If not, there are numerous locksmiths in the Washington area who promise that they can change locks within 15 minutes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Congress looks unlikely to reach a deficit reduction deal by deadline .

"(CNN) -- One year ago this week, America got a wake-up call about a core problem in our politics that empowers ideological extremists and special interests. On September 14, 2010, both Delaware Rep. Mike Castle and Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty lost closed partisan primaries, depriving most voters of a chance to vote for them in a general election. One a Republican and the other a Democrat, they both fell prey to a system that is rigged to punish political independence and that artificially polarizes American politics. Each of their stories is worth retelling. One gave us Christine O'Donnell, and the other was regarded as a serious, but hopefully temporary, setback to education reform. Call it a case of RINO (Republican in name only)-hunting and DINO-hunting -- the results are far-reaching. Mike Castle was a former governor and longtime Republican congressman from Delaware. He had established a fiscally conservative record as the successor to supply-sider Pete DuPont, balancing the budget and cutting tax rates three times. As a congressman, he voted against President Barack Obama's health care bill, in part because he felt there were not enough medical malpractice reforms, and he voted against the stimulus bill. But he was centrist on social issues, a supporter of abortion rights and gay rights. He was concerned about the environment and climate change and was no great fan of the National Rifle Association. In other words, he was no hyperconservative warrior but an excellent fit for his state, and one of the most broadly popular politicians precisely because he was center-right. He was consequently considered an easy pick to succeed Vice President Joe Biden in the Senate and flip the seat from Democrat to Republican. But in the tea party-driven purges of 2010, Mike Castle was considered a traitor to the conservative cause because he had a record of working across the aisle. And so they turned to activist and serial candidate Christine O'Donnell. Keep a few things in mind. O'Donnell had just five in-state donations in the first quarter of the 2010 cycle. But in the third quarter, as the RINO-hunting fever took hold, she received a quarter-million dollars in tea party national activist cash. A video posted by an O'Donnell supporter prominently -- and without any facts whatsoever -- suggested that the married Mike Castle was gay, a frequent tactic of the far right against anyone they deem a squish. (My favorite antecedent: Then-Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower was called ""the candidate of effeminates"" by supporters of conservative isolationist Sen. Robert A. Taft in their 1952 primary.) O'Donnell, then unemployed, had previously lost two statewide races and never served in elected office. She was best known for being a social conservative activist, talking about her anti-masturbation policy and pre-evangelical flirtation with witchcraft on Bill Maher's late-night show. Suddenly, she was lauded as the grass-roots candidate of fiscal conservatives, parroting libertarian rhetoric that had nothing to do with her beliefs to date. But on September 14, 2010, she beat Castle in a closed partisan primary in which only 32% of Republicans voted (and keep in mind that Republicans are a distinct minority in Delaware). The result? In November, Republicans lost a Senate seat they were likely to win, especially in a GOP-leaning year. Like Sharron Angle in Nevada, O'Donnell got the nomination but was too extreme for the general election. The Democrats held on to the U.S. Senate. Extremes are ultimately their own side's worst enemy. Mayor Adrian Fenty's story in Washington is less well known, but no less resonant. Tea party primary challenges are already infamous, but left-wing challenges to more centrist Democrats are in the process of catching up. And this is Exhibit A in the annals of DINO-hunting to date. Fenty was in his first term as mayor, young and charismatic, but he alienated allies by seeming aloof and out of touch (sound familiar?) Some leaders in the the inner-city African-American community felt that Fenty, who is also black, was not spending adequate attention on their community's concerns. The real issue in his re-election, however, was his embrace of education reform, led by his controversial but nationally known schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee -- one of the stars of the education reform documentary ""Waiting for Superman."" Teachers unions are among the top donors to Democratic campaigns. They expect their way to be obeyed. And they decided to use Fenty as an example. They ended up pouring about $1 million into the September closed partisan primary, in which Fenty faced City Council President Vincent Gray. That money -- and directly linked get-out-the-vote efforts -- ended Fenty's tenure as mayor despite a majority of residents saying that the city had improved under his watch. Independent voters and Republicans -- who might well have been strong supporters of Fenty's reforms -- never had a chance to cast a ballot in this election for their mayor. Instead, the election was effectively over before the higher-turnout general election was ever held. Michelle Rhee left the school chancellorship to start a national education reform group called Students First. And Mayor Vincent Gray's administration almost immediately encountered a series of scandals, leading to near-record low approval ratings for such a young administration. The lesson: Closed partisan primaries are fundamentally unrepresentative. They're too easily hijacked by ideological activists and party hacks beholden to special interests. And because these local primaries are the gauntlet that candidates have to run, they lead directly to the culture of hyperpartisanship that now threatens to paralyze our capacity for effective self-government. The parties have forgotten that they are not the purpose of our politics. So here's one reform whose time has come: Replace closed partisan primaries with open primaries -- like those in California and New Hampshire and many other states -- allowing independents and other candidates full access to the political process. That, along with redistricting reform, would help heal the harsh but ultimately artificial polarization of our politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","A year ago, moderates in both parties lost primaries in New Jersey and D.C.

"Waltham, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Mitt Romney has pledged to repeal President Obama's universal health care law if he is elected president. Critics find his position rather strange, arguing that the plan he helped develop when he was governor of Massachusetts is quite similar in design to the Obama plan. Romney disputes his critics, saying there are important and fundamental differences between the plans. Who is correct? In actuality, both plans draw extensively from legislation offered by President Nixon in January 1974. In a book just published, ""Power, Politics, and Universal Health Care,"" David Shactman and I explain how Romney and Obama used the same approach as Nixon to lower the number of uninsured. All three built their system on private, employer-sponsored insurance in which all but the smallest employers had to provide insurance to their workers or pay a penalty. All utilized Medicare to insure the elderly and an expanded Medicaid-type program to insure the poor. All provided subsidies to low-income individuals and small employers. The Romney and Obama plans created state-based private insurance exchanges to make insurance more accessible and affordable to small business and individuals. President Obama has been heavily criticized by conservatives because his plan includes a mandate for all individuals to have insurance or pay a penalty. Romney, too, has joined those criticizing the president, yet his plan in Massachusetts included just such a mandate. This idea was originally proposed by conservative groups as a measure of personal responsibility and an alternative to a single-payer system advocated by many progressive organizations. Romney believes it is alright to have a state require all to have coverage but that it cannot be mandated by the federal government. Romney contends the Massachusetts plan required no new funding, whereas the Obama law calls for nearly a trillion dollars in increased taxes and cuts in projected Medicare spending over 10 years. What Romney doesn't say is that the Massachusetts plan is partly funded with earmarked federal dollars and partly with state funds generated by a tax increase previously enacted to pay for a universal coverage plan that was never implemented. Unfortunately for Obama, there was no larger entity to support his plan. He had to pay for his plan with new federal monies and cuts in future federal spending. Although the federal government will assume a greater proportion of health spending, total health spending in the United States is projected to increase only 2% more by 2019 under the Obama plan than it would have otherwise. As with the Nixon proposal, neither Romney nor Obama decided to include significant measures to reduce health care costs. Although both were criticized, I believe that was a sound political decision that allowed all the major health groups to support both plans. President Clinton's health plan drew strong opposition from many stakeholders because it included a tight spending budget. Under Obama's plan, hospitals, insurers and drug companies agreed to modest cuts in future revenues or rate increases, because all expected increased revenues from the millions of newly insured Americans. Both Obama and Romney expected that constraining health costs would be necessary in future years. A complete review of the two plans should acknowledge that the Obama plan includes many components not in the Massachusetts legislation. The most controversial are a board appointed to control Medicare spending and a requirement that insurance companies spend a minimum percentage of their revenues on direct patient care. The plan also includes a number of provisions to reform Medicare and Medicaid, and an extensive list of new delivery system approaches to be tested with federal pilot and demonstration programs. Important as these components may be, they are not part of the basic framework of the plan. After comparing the Romney and Obama plans, it is clear that the similarities far outweigh the differences. Romney could argue, however, that Obama didn't use the Massachusetts plan as a model but rather drew on the proposal put forth by Richard Nixon almost 40 years earlier. Romney's plan worked for Massachusetts, reducing its uninsured rate to the lowest in the country. Although the legislation did not put a brake on rising health care costs, there is some evidence it did reduce its rate of growth compared to other parts of the country. Health insurance premiums have traditionally been higher in Massachusetts than in the rest of the United States. The gap, however, has narrowed somewhat as premium growth between 2006 and 2010 in the United States grew by an average yearly rate of 5.1% while in Massachusetts the average growth was 4.4%. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stuart Altman.","Romney promises to repeal Obama health care plan, yet critics find links between two .

"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina (CNN) -- In many places across the South you can walk in the footsteps of slaves, and if you understand the history, it is not a happy journey. The same is true at Friendfield Plantation outside Georgetown, South Carolina. This is a former slave house on Friendfield Plantation, where Michelle Obama's family has roots. It's not exactly ""Gone With the Wind,"" but what makes this overgrown 3,300 acres of marsh and pine trees stand out is this: The family of first lady Michelle Obama believes her great-great grandfather was held as a slave here and labored in the mosquito-infested rice fields. It makes Friendfield Plantation a symbol of something more than servitude. It's the symbol of something that's never happened before, one important segment of an American family's journey from the humiliation of slavery to the very top of the nation's ruling class. CNN recently was the first television network allowed to visit the plantation and shoot video. It's not a museum. It's just private land, still with shadows of its past. Friendfield's most distinctive historical feature, perhaps, is the dirt road known as Slave Street.  Stroll across the plantation with CNN's Joe Johns » . Six white-washed little shacks are all that remain of the slave quarters, even though rows of these houses once stood on the property. About 350 slaves lived here during the 19th century. The houses are nothing special -- no plumbing, of course. The wooden walls are paper thin in places. It would have been hot and humid in summer, and most certainly cold in winter, although the shacks had fireplaces. They would have been crowded: probably one or two families living in a space smaller than a modern-day garage. The White House is some 472 miles from Georgetown, South Carolina. But long before Michelle Obama was born, her great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, likely toiled in the fields here six days a week, from sunup to sundown. The place he probably called home was a little white shack smaller than -- by comparison -- a Secret Service security shed on the grounds of the executive mansion at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. All told, hundreds of people lived like this, on this one plantation alone. ""Anywhere between 200 to 500 at different times,"" said Ed Carter, the property manager. ""The older the plantation got, they kept adding on more cabins. [Some] cabins are 1847. ""There was some on the other street that were about probably 1820s. And when they added on, got a bit more wealthy, they just kept adding on more slaves, more cabins.""  Watch Obama's recent comments on slavery » . The shacks probably weren't much refuge from the vicious clouds of mosquitoes, chiggers and other pests that still impinge on a person's every move on the plantation. Then, consider the dangers of the alligators and snakes. There was also the oppressive heat and humidity of South Carolina. And on the day CNN visited, the skies opened up in a violent rainstorm. Add up all of these factors and you begin to get a picture of what life probably was, and was not, for the slaves on Friendfield Plantation. Workers on the rice plantation -- and Friendfield was one of the largest in these parts -- faced all these elements, plus the threat of disease, including malaria and yellow fever. And unlike the CNN crew, the slaves were not free to leave. Even in death, the slaves stayed. Three cemeteries are on the Friendfield grounds. The one slave cemetery CNN visited had mostly unmarked graves, but Jim Robinson -- who was born into slavery and died a free man -- is believed to be buried there somewhere. The cemetery clearly has been segregated from the rest of the property. Slave cemeteries were typically situated on land unsuitable for any other use. Surrounded by trees, it might have been a beautiful place. Now, it is hard to tell that you are standing in a cemetery -- except for half a dozen grave markers, some made of wood, bearing no names. All that's known about Jim Robinson's life comes from the few remaining records that mention him. Slaves weren't documented as individuals in the census, nor in life and death certificates. They were property, not people. But Michelle Obama's great-great grandfather was a teenager when slavery was abolished, so as a free man, he started to leave a paper trail. The 1880 census shows he was born about 1850, in South Carolina, and that his parents were born in South Carolina as well. He married a woman named Louiser, and in 1880 they already had three children, two boys and a girl, ages 1, 2, and 3. The son that would become Michelle Obama's great grandfather was not born yet. The census lists Jim's occupation as a farmer, and Louiser's as ""keeping house."" They are both recorded as unable to read or write. It's good fortune to uncover even this much information; the original handwritten census got wet, the ink ran and it is nearly illegible. Proof of life, nearly washed away. There are a lot of unknowns concerning Michelle Obama's ancestry -- how many generations of slaves there were, or what route they took to this hemisphere. The Obama election campaign commissioned a study of Michelle's genealogy by the research group Lowcountry Africana, but they couldn't make the link back to Africa. As with so many African-Americans' family histories, the paper trail runs dry. ""I don't think that that sort of information is available for anyone from Friendfield Plantation at this point,""  historian Tori Carrier, of Lowcountry Africana, said. ""Very, very few, if any, of the Friendfield records actually survived except in public records: wills and estate inventories. ... ""There's not a real Friendfield Plantation records set, or plantation journals that have been preserved ... and there's certainly not a shred of documentary evidence right now which would even suggest to us what the African origins would be,"" Carrier  said. In an interview with The Washington Post last year, Michelle Obama talked about learning her family's past and understanding the history of slavery. ""A lot of times these stories get buried, because sometimes the pain of them makes it hard to want to remember,"" she said told the Post for an October story. ""You've got to be able to acknowledge and understand the past and move on from it. You have to understand it, and I think a lot of us just don't have an opportunity to understand it -- but it's there."" Back in Georgetown, South Carolina, Margretta Knox remembers attending the Bethel AME church with the first lady's grandparents -- Jim Robinson's grandson and his wife -- when she was a girl. The couple spent many of their years in Chicago, but returned back South after they retired. ""My father knew that Fraser Robinson's father sold newspapers,"" she recalled. ""He made his kids read them. Mr. Robinson was very, very smart, he could recite poetry. ... Their grandfather could recite poetry and that kind of thing. ... Her grandfather and her grandmother, they were both very smart people."" But the family ties to the old plantation just got lost. ""We let our parents die before we really thought about asking them questions,"" Knox said. ""We didn't think about it until much later, and then it was too late. They were already gone. So there was no history after that. ... ""Because we live here, we don't think about it. It's just like, you've been around it all of your life, it doesn't cross your mind. You're just living for today."" In that same way, it probably never crossed Jim Robinson's mind, as a slave in a white-washed cabin, that one day his great-great granddaughter would be living in a white house so very, very different from his own.","CNN visits plantation where Michelle Obama's slave roots began .

From 1989 to 1995, the Kids in the Hall enjoyed TV success, and many of their sketches and phrases have become a part of pop culture lore. For instance, if you've ever crushed somebody's head, you, sir, have enjoyed a Kids in the Hall moment. There's plenty more from their catalog of absurdity, and you can pretty much find them all somewhere on the Interwebs. But if you're looking for a place to start, this author's personal favorite is a sketch called ""Citizen Kane."" And my friend Paul favors one called ""Wrong Number."" So, here, now, you have some Kids in the Hall advice from somebody named Paul, and somebody with the last name Bellini. Feel free to touch us. Despite being known for their sketches, the current Scott Thompson/Kevin McDonald tour is actually more focused on stand-up comedy. Thompson says, ""I never liked it until very recently. I always felt too exposed and out of control."" It's definitely something new for Thompson and McDonald, and, perhaps, even more new for their fans. But the chemistry between the two comedians comes out best when they share the stage during moments throughout the show. And it certainly came out when we sat down with them in Atlanta before their performances at The Punchline. As you'll see in our video, Thompson and McDonald feed off each other with ease, often completing each other's thoughts. Certainly, like all comedy, the Kids in the Hall aren't for everyone, but there's no denying their success; especially if catching the eye of a young Uma Thurman is the barometer of that success. Thompson recalls meeting her backstage after a show early in the group's career. ""Uma Thurman at the time was the sexiest woman in the world,"" he says. ""We had never met a celebrity before. We all thought she wanted to sleep with us. It really was a big launching pad for us. It made us think that wow, we're in the big leagues. She was the first responder."" She didn't sleep with them.","McDonald and Thompson were part of the Kids in the Hall sketch comedy group .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Dengue fever has killed 25 people and affected more than 6,000 over the past two months in Lahore, Pakistan, a health department spokesman said Monday. In total, 6,400 cases of dengue fever have been documented, said Ikhlaq Ahmed, spokesman for the health department of Punjab province. Of those, 6,000 are in Lahore, a city of more than 6 million people known as Pakistan's cultural capital. The 25 who died are all from Lahore, in eastern Pakistan. An average of 300 new cases of the virus-based disease, spread by mosquitoes, are being reported in the city daily. ""We prefer to stay at home rather than going shopping,"" because of the threat of disease, said Zainab Khan, a 25-year-old professional from Lahore. Asim Hussain, who works in an office in Lahore, said, ""I may lose my job,"" since he hasn't gone to work because of the outbreak. All the schools in Lahore have been closed by the provincial government, Ahmed said. The outbreak has created panic in the city, he said, as thousands of people crowd hospitals for testing. The city's poshest areas are among the hardest hit, he said.","A health official says 25 people have died .

"(CNN) -- Ten days later and despite an $11,000 reward, police have not found a missing 5-year old Arizona girl. Jahessye Shockley wandered out of her Glendale, Arizona home on October 11, unnoticed by her older siblings who were supposed to be watching her. Her mother called police after returning home from an errand. In the first three days after the girl went missing, Glendale police wrapped up a grid search of her neighborhood and moved into the second phase of their investigation where they are following up on tips they receive from the public. Family members have begged for information on Jahessye's whereabouts. ""Please bring my baby back... Her safe return is all I want,"" Jahessye 's mother, Jerice Hunter, said last week. ""She belongs to this family... She's somebody's child. Mine. Please bring my child home."" Shirley Johnson, the girl's grandmother, said she is wondering why the national media hasn't spread the word on the case. ""I want the national media to pick it up... I won't stop til they do. I don't know why it's not national now,"" Shirley Johnson, Jahessye's worried grandmother, told CNN affiliate KPHO Thursday. ""They have the ability to make sure someone from across the nation knows what's going on."" Jahessye 's case has been mentioned in the Washington Post and the Huffington Post in recent days. But it has not received much national television coverage compared to cases like Baby Lisa, the 11-month-old missing Missouri girl. That case has received daily national news coverage and has been featured on the cover of People magazine. Retired police officer and child advocate Paul Penzone told KPHO that he noticed the lack of national media coverage. ""I don't know what's missing or why, but in our community this is a big deal,"" said Penzone. ""Continued coverage absolutely is critical. The eyes of the community are going to be biggest tool for law enforcement if this little girl is somewhere where she can be seen and recovered."" On the day she disappeared Jahessye was left home with her 13-, 9- and 6-year-old siblings, police said. The children have been interviewed separately by experts and have maintained that they do not know what happened to her, Glendale police Sgt. Brent Coombs has said. Ann $11,000 reward has been offered in the case. Jahessye is described as a black female about 3 feet 5-inches tall, 55 pounds with black hair in a ponytail and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, blue jean shorts and pink sandals. Anyone with information about Jahessye's disappearance is asked to call the Glendale Police Department at 623-930-HELP (4357).","Jahessye Shockley was last seen on October 11 .

"(CNN) -- At least three Tunisian government officials resigned Monday and Tuesday, the country's official news agency reported, in the wake of the resignation of the prime minister on Sunday. Popular protests in the North African nation led to the resignation of the longtime president in January, prompting a wave of unrest across the Arab world. But the flight from Tunisia of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali did not end the protests there, and Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi quit on Sunday. The minister of higher education and scientific research, Ahmad Ibrahim, and the higher education secretary, Faouzia Farida Charfi, both quit on Tuesday, Tunis Afrique Presse reported. Mohamed Nouri Jouini, the planning and international cooperation minister, resigned on Monday, the agency said. The country's stock market is due to reopen on Thursday, after shutting down Monday, TAP reported. Tunisia's interim president tapped Al-Baji Qa'ed Al-Sebsi as the country's new prime minister Sunday after Ghannouchi resigned, state-run media reported. Ghannouchi told reporters Sunday that he was ""resigning today because I am not willing to be a person that takes decisions that could cause casualties."" Three people were killed during protests in the capital, Tunis, on Saturday. He also questioned ""why a lot of people considered their main target to keep attacking the government, although a lot of its members agreed to join in this critical time."" In addition to the three killed, nine others were injured during the mayhem in Tunis, according to an Interior Ministry statement cited by Tunis Afrique Presse. More than 100 people were arrested in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, and accused of ""acts of destruction and burning,"" the ministry said. Protesters had gathered in the area to demand that the interim government step down and the current parliament be disbanded. Demonstrators also were asking for suspension of the current constitution and the election of an assembly that can write a new one, as well as organize the transition to democracy. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. By January 13, Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- had turned executive power over to his prime minister and fled the country.

"(CNN) -- The sun had not risen yet on that February day in 1986 when Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier's eight-vehicle motorcade of luxury cars and jeeps arrived at the Port-au-Prince airport, then named for his father. Surrounded by soldiers and about 100 journalists who came to witness the end of an era in Haiti, the dictator boarded a United States Air Force C-141 jet along with his glamorous wife, Michele Bennet, their two children and 20 friends and servants. Also on the plane that day were trunks of designer clothes, gold, jewels and priceless art. What could not be seen was the hundreds of millions of dollars Haitian officials accused the Duvalier clan of stealing from state coffers. The pillaging of Haiti's national treasury now lies at the heart of legal action against Duvalier, who stunned the world by returning to Haiti this week from some 25 years of quiet exile in France. Some lawyers who have been following the Duvalier money trail for years were flabbergasted that such a man was able to enter Haiti legally, that he was not arrested right away. ""I don't know how a criminal like him goes free,"" said Enrico Monfrini, a Switzerland-based lawyer who has been representing the Haitian government in a long and drawn out legal battle over Duvalier's cash. Duvalier reportedly lost a chunk of his wealth when he and Bennet divorced, but the family still has $5.7 million in assets in a frozen bank account in Switzerland that belongs to a family foundation. Now, a Swiss law enacted specifically to help repatriate stolen funds from failing states may help return the Duvalier money to Haiti, said Daniel Thelesklaf, executive director of the International Centre for Asset Recovery in Switzerland. ""I am optimistic there will be a decision by the end of the year,"" he said. The law, which goes into effect February 1, was enacted to help Switzerland overcome existing hurdles with states that have no mutual legal assistance partnership with Switzerland or with troubled nations that are incapable of dealing with such issues, according to the Swiss Foreign Ministry. For a judge order restitution, a government must prove a discrepancy between the wealth of a ""politically exposed person"" and his or her earnings, along with high levels of corruption in that country. ""They managed to draft this law very quickly,"" Monfrini said, adding that legal proceedings in Haiti would not affect efforts at restitution. He said $5.7 million is not a large amount compared to what Duvalier allegedly stole, but morally, repatriation of the money would be a huge victory. But not a complete one until Duvalier is made to stand trial for his alleged crimes, said human rights lawyer Mario Joseph, who has worked in Haiti on building the legal case against Duvalier. Joseph said no one in Haiti ever imagined that Duvalier would return to face charges. His presence in the country has enabled the court to reopen a 2008 case against the strongman, he said. But Duvalier's lawyer, Reynold Georges, expressed confidence Wednesday that Haitian authorities have little evidence to press charges. Duvalier, said Georges, would not only remain a free man but he could decide to return to politics. Georges later told CNN that Duvalier had given ""all that money"" to charity for Haitian relief after the earthquake. ""I don't know if the Swiss bank transferred that money already, so I don't have any details on that,"" Georges said, ""but I guarantee you that that has been done."" Dismayed by the thought of the return of a brutal dictator, Monfrini pressed upon Haiti's justice system to prevail, and for the courts not to forget what Duvalier pledged in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake. He expressed ""complete solidarity"" with those who were suffering in ""these hours of great national distress"" and called on Swiss authorities to transfer all of the money from his foundation to the American Red Cross for the relief effort. Monfrini doubted Duvalier's sincerity but not the new Swiss law. ""This money will go back to Haiti for sure,"" he said. ""It will never go back to Duvalier.""","NEW: Duvalier's lawyer says ""all that money"" has been given for Haitian relief .

"(CNN) -- Hours after Libya's former interior minister said he resigned to support anti-government protesters, the Libyan government said he had been kidnapped. Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi told CNN Wednesday that he resigned Monday after hearing that 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. He accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale. But the same day, Libyan state media reported that ""gangs"" in Benghazi had kidnapped him. Witnesses have reported that Benghazi has essentially been taken over by the opposition. Witnesses also told CNN they saw Younis on Sunday and Monday in Benghazi, where he was siding with the protesters. CNN could not immediately confirm reports for areas beyond Benghazi. The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country. CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. Libyan state television added that Libyan forces have warned those responsible for the kidnapping that they ""will be chased in their hiding places."" Earlier Wednesday, al Abidi said he had quit the government and is supporting the protesters, who he predicted will achieve victory in ""days or hours."" ""Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi, and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that,"" al Abidi said in an Arabic-language telephone interview Wednesday. He called Gadhafi ""a stubborn man"" who will not give up. ""He will either commit suicide or he will get killed,"" said al Abidi, who said he has known him since 1964. Al Abidi called on Libyan security forces ""to join the people in the intifada."" Already, he said, ""many members"" of the security forces had defected, including those in the capital, Tripoli. Since the recent protests in Libya started February 15, a growing number of Libyan officials have reportedly resigned. Libya's ambassador to Bangladesh, A.H. Elimam, resigned to side with pro-democracy protesters, said BSS, the official news agency of Bangladesh, citing a Foreign Ministry official Tuesday. iReport: Are you there? share photos, video . Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil also resigned, saying he was protesting the ""bloody situation"" and ""use of excessive force"" against unarmed protesters, according to the Libyan newspaper Quryna.

"(CNN) -- At least 24 people were killed in cities across Syria during a government crackdown Saturday against those in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, according to a U.K.-based human rights group. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the western Syrian city of Homs, as residents contended with fuel shortages and power outages throughout the day, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. CNN cannot independently confirm accounts from the ground in Syria because the government has not provided access to Western media. Also Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that al-Assad had passed the ""point of no return -- no way that he will resume his authority or legitimacy over his people."" ""I think that the world response ... these are real signals that there is acceleration toward the end of this regime,"" he said, citing the responses of the Arab League and Jordan. The clashes come the same day as a deadline set by the 22-member Arab League to put forth a peace plan meant to stem violence against protesters which has resulted in months of bloodshed. Earlier this week, Syria accepted ""in principle"" the alliance's plan to permit observers into the country to verify whether the regime has taken measures to protect civilians, a senior Arab diplomat said Friday. Originally, 500 observers were believed to be destined for Syria. But on Friday, Arab Doctors Association Head Ibrahim Zafarani said he received an email from Arab League officials that indicated only 40 names would be submitted. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday afternoon that the proposed number had been reduced to 40. Last week, the league's 22 nations voted to suspend Syria's membership, but later gave Damascus three days to implement a protocol to allow observers to enter the nation. International pressure has since been mounting against al-Assad over his regime's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, amid concerns that violence in Syria is escalating.

"(CNN) -- Britain's David Cameron and Germany's Angela Merkel restated their commitment to a strong Europe Friday, as they sought to show a united front in the face of Europe's debt crisis. Their talks in Berlin come amid tensions between the two nations over how to restore financial stability in Europe. ""The United Kingdom has a great interest, and very sensibly so, in seeing the eurozone being strong,"" Merkel said. While Britain has some differences of opinion with Germany over the EU treaty and ways to boost competitiveness, she said, the two countries are tied by ""strong bonds of friendship."" Both will work closely together ahead of a meeting of European leaders next month, she said. Britain is the biggest economy in Europe outside the 17-nation eurozone, which uses the euro as its currency, while Germany is the economic powerhouse within it. The pair have not always agreed on the best ways to tackle the current debt crisis, which has seen attention focused on Italy and Greece in recent weeks. Senior members of Cameron's Conservative Party have been calling for more powers to be brought back to Britain from Europe, as EU treaty changes are made to ensure economic stability. Cameron, who has previously expressed concern that Europe's difficulties are affecting Britain's economic recovery, also downplayed divisions between the countries as he stood alongside Merkel. ""We have had a very good discussion between very good friends,"" he said. ""There are many things on which we are in absolute agreement."" However they have not made progress on plans for a European financial transactions tax, Merkel acknowledged. Britain opposes such a tax, fearing it could disadvantage London as a global financial center. Cameron called for the deal reached at a summit in Europe on October 27 to be implemented as soon as possible. The plan includes a series of measures to address the crisis, including debt relief for Greece, new capital requirements for banks and plans to build a financial ""firewall"" around vulnerable euro area economies. ""A strong, successful and stable eurozone is in all our interests,"" Cameron said. ""We need this crisis to be resolved. Britain, like Germany, has a big national interest in that happening."" And while the two do not agree on all matters, they can discuss and accommodate each other's views, he said. Cameron met earlier Friday with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Brussels. Global markets have been volatile, as political turmoil linked to the financial crisis has forced a change of government in both Greece and Italy in the past week.","David Cameron is in Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .

"Miami (CNN) -- A defunct satellite plummeting toward Earth is expected to re-enter the atmosphere between 11:45 p.m. Friday and 12:45 a.m. Saturday ET, NASA reported late Friday evening. ""During that time period, the satellite will be passing over Canada and Africa, as well as vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. The risk to public safety is very remote,"" the space agency said. The United States is once again an unlikely but potential target for the 26 pieces of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, expected to survive the descent. Those pieces, made of stainless steel, titanium and beryllium that won't burn, will range from about 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds, according to NASA. ""There is a low probability any debris that survives re-entry will land in the United States,"" NASA headquarters said, ""but the possibility cannot be discounted because of this changing rate of descent."" Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team in Houston said there's no way to know exactly where the pieces will come down. ""Keep in mind, they won't be traveling at those high orbital velocities. As they hit the air, they tend to slow down. ... They're still traveling fast, a few tens to hundreds of miles per hour, but no longer those tremendous orbital velocities,"" he explained. Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes as it orbits -- even just before it begins re-entry -- it will be impossible to pinpoint the exact location the pieces will come down. On top of that, Matney said, the satellite is not stable. ""Part of the problem is, the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways, and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry."" Because water covers 70% of the Earth's surface, NASA has said that most if not all of the surviving debris will land in water. Even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any of it will hit people. However, in an abundance of caution, the Federal Aviation Administration released an advisory Thursday warning pilots about the falling satellite, calling it a potential hazard. ""It is critical that all pilots/flight crew members report any observed falling space debris to the appropriate (air traffic control) facility and include position, altitude, time and direction of debris observed,"" the FAA statement said. The FAA said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows, rocket launches, kites and inoperable radio navigational aids. NASA says space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back. ""This is nothing like the old Skylab scare of the '70s, when you had a 70-ton space station crashing out of the sky. So, I agree with the folks in Houston. It's nothing to be worried about,"" McDowell said. Pieces of Skylab came down in western Australia in 1979. The only wild card McDowell sees is if somehow a chunk hits a populated area. ""If the thing happens to come down in a city, that would be bad. The chances of it causing extensive damage or injuring someone are much higher."" NASA said that once the debris hits the atmosphere 50 miles up, it will take only a matter of minutes before the surviving pieces hit the Earth. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Re-entry is expected between 11:45 p.m. Friday and 12:45 a.m. Saturday ET, NASA says .
The space agency still can't say with certainty where the satellite's remnants will land .

"(CNN)  -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, facing an international arrest warrant, is paying the price for pandering to the West, al Qaeda's second-in-command said in an audio statement released Tuesday. Ayman al-Zawahiri, seen here in 2007, said Tuesday the Sudanese president pandered to the West. ""I am not defending Omar al-Bashir or his regime, nor am I defending what it has done in Darfur and elsewhere,"" Ayman al-Zawahiri said in the statement released by al Qaeda's production company, as-Sahab Media. But, he said, ""the issue isn't one of Darfur and solving its problems; the issue is one of making excuses for more foreign interference in the Muslims' countries in the framework of the contemporary Zionist Crusade."" The warrant issued by the International Criminal Court earlier this month accuses al-Bashir of war crimes and crimes against humanity, charges he denies. In response, Sudan ordered 13 international aid groups to leave the country, groups that the United Nations says provide roughly half the assistance delivered in Darfur. ""The Bashir regime is reaping what it sowed,"" al-Zawahiri said. ""For many long years, it continued to back down and backtrack in front of American Crusader pressure."" He further accused Sudan of expelling members of the mujahedeen who had sought refuge there, particularly Osama bin Laden, and declaring ""in an audacious lie that they had left voluntarily, then attempting to beg payment for that from the Saudi regime and the Americans."" Al-Zawahiri asked, ""Why hasn't the United Nations moved to protect the Palestinians in Gaza from Israeli barbarity and criminality, while it pretends to cry over the suffering of the people of Darfur? Why hasn't the United Nations and the international community intervened to lift the siege from Gaza, while it pretends to cry over the people of Darfur being deprived of relief and aid?"" ""The Sudanese regime continued to pant for American approval, and it agreed to the division of the Sudan, paved the way for the imminent secession of the south, provided all the information it had on the emigrants and mujahedeen to the American government, and handed over some of them to the regimes of treason and criminality in their countries,"" al-Zawahiri said. ""But despite all that, the senior criminals weren't satisfied with it and continued to besiege it with demands and interference, even going so far as to demand the arrest of its leaders and prominent figures."" He said he wants to send a message to Muslims in Sudan, telling them they are being targeted so that Islam can be eliminated from the country. ""And in order for Islam to be eliminated from the Sudan, a justification must be found for Western military intervention,"" he said. The audio message is the fifth released this year by al-Zawahiri and the fourth in English, according to Virginia-based IntelCenter. The center said on its Web site it focuses ""on studying terrorist groups and other threat actors ... and disseminating that information in a timely manner to those who can act on it.""","Ayman al-Zawahiri says he is not defending Sudanese regime, actions in Darfur .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran, but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city, Tehran. Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady. On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama. The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband's quest for the presidency. Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign. Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes, Rahnavard is usually nearby.  Watch more about Zahra Rahnavard » . ""We look at her and we say, 'we want to be like her in the future, ' "" said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. At this rally, Rahnavard -- a writer and art professor -- spoke for her husband, who was campaigning elsewhere. Wearing a floral headscarf and a traditional black chador -- a full-length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- Rahnavard called for freedoms she says were lost during President Mahmoud Ahmadijenad's term. ""I hope freedom of speech, freedom of the pen and freedom of thought will not be forgotten,"" she said. The crowd, which was clad in Mousavi's trademark color green, cheered wildly. It waved placards with his picture and swayed from side to side, chanting and beating drums. The women sat on one side; the men on the other. The overwhelming majority were young voters, many of whom said they attended because of Mousavi's wife, a mother of three. Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million -- has a median age of 27. ""I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women,"" said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife. Mousavi, a former prime minister, is considered a threat to Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner, in the June 12 elections. He is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. Over the weekend, the Iranian government blocked access to the social networking site Facebook, where Mousavi has a page with more than 5,000 supporters, the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) said. Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying, ""Access to this site is not possible."" Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplays Rahnavard's impact. She may win over reformists and women, he says, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates. ""If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him,"" Marandi said. But try selling that to Rahnavard's enthusiastic supporters. ""This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president,"" said Farhad Mahmoudi. ""And this is why we're so happy because we can have a first lady.""","Wife of presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi generates huge crowds .

"Guadalajara, Mexico (CNN) -- Authorities found 26 bodies Thursday inside three abandoned vehicles in Guadalajara, Mexico, an official said. All the victims were men, said Ulises EnrÃ­quez, a spokesman for the Jalisco delegation of the Attorney General's Office. The vehicles were discovered near a monument on one of the city's main avenues, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing police sources. Jalisco state Attorney General Tomas Coronado Olmos told CNN affiliate TV Azteca that a message was found with the bodies, but he did not disclose what it said. In a Twitter post, Jalisco Gov. Emilio Gonzalez, a former mayor of Guadalajara, said he was ""appalled and outraged"" by the discovery, which came a day after authorities in Sinaloa state found 16 charred bodies inside two trucks that had been set ablaze. Speaking about those bodies and also those found in Guadalajara, Mexico's new interior minister promised to provide federal support. ""I would like to express our solidarity and support to the governments (of Jalisco and Sinaloa) and, in particular, let them know that the federal government will assist in investigating these cases, finding those responsible and making sure these crimes don't go unpunished,"" said Alejandro PoirÃ©, who was sworn in last week. Also Thursday, the Mexican military said it had seized 15 tons of marijuana in a rural area of Jalisco state several hours from the city. About 43,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. But brutal cartel killings are rare in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-most populous city. The city recently hosted the Pan American Games and is scheduled to host a large international book festival next week a few miles away from where the bodies were found. In a security report published before the games began, analysts said Guadalajara would probably be the next hot spot in Mexico's drug war, as the Zetas drug cartel tries to take over turf long dominated by the Sinaloa cartel. The analysis, published in September by Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America, noted that major offensives were unlikely amid stepped-up security in the city during the high-profile sporting event. ""With over 10,000 police and a quantity of soldiers -- pulled from their duties in Ciudad Juarez -- on special assignment during the games, we would be surprised to register anything more than a slight blip during the games,"" the analysis said. ""Though when they are over, a major criminal offensive for the city could surface in early November, developing into a protracted battle for the city that will last though the end of the year, and possibly well into 2012.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's interim leaders will declare liberation on Sunday and hold elections in the coming months as the war-torn country works toward building a new society in the post-Moammar Gadhafi era. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the National Transitional Council executive board, said elections ""should be within a period of eight months, maximum."" He spoke at the World Economic Forum in Jordan. The first vote will be for a National Congress that will draft a constitution. After that, parliamentary and presidential elections will be held. Jibril said that oil-rich Libya is currently producing around 300,000 barrels per day, up from near zero during the depths of the conflict. The country should be back at its prewar output of 1.6 million barrels of oil per day within 15 months, he said. Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the NTC, which will mark the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started. NATO, which launched an operation to protect Libyan citizens against the Gadhafi regime during the Libyan war, plans to ends its operations by October 31. Speaking in his weekly address Saturday, Obama said Gadhafi's death ""showed that our role in protecting the Libyan people, and helping them break free from a tyrant, was the right thing to do."" ""Our brave pilots and crews helped prevent a massacre, save countless lives, and give the Libyan people the chance to prevail. Without putting a single U.S. service member on the ground, we achieved our objectives. Soon, our NATO mission will come to a successful end even as we continue to support the Libyan people, and people across the Arab world, who seek a democratic future."" Questions persist about what would happen to Gadhafi's body, which was on public display Saturday at a Misrata meat market cooler. Queues of people lined up to view the corpse, which appeared to have a bullet hole on the left temple. His family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership ""to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,"" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. Libyan and world powers wanted to capture Gadhafi and prosecute him for war crimes. The U.N. human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into his death amid questions over the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. They want to know whether Gadhafi was killed in crossfire or executed by fighters. ""There are at least two cell-phone videos, one showing him alive and one showing him dead. Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,"" human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday. ""We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture."" Human Rights Watch, which is also calling for an internationally supervised autopsy and an investigation into the death, said it is unlikely that Gadhafi was killed in crossfire. Peter Bouckaert, the group's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a ""humiliating end"" for the former dictator. ""When he left the area, he was very much alive,"" Bouckaert said. ""There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice.""

"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Leon Panetta praised China on more than one occasion Sunday during a series of meetings with fellow defense ministers from southeast Asia, but hinted if relations between the United States and China worsen, it could be a threat to ""the security of the world."" He said he appreciates China's muted response to the United States announcing a deal last month to sell more arms to Taiwan, and he lauded China for working with its neighbors with regards to the contentious issues involving the South China Sea. ""I would commend them for the way that they've handled the news of that sale to Taiwan, compared to the past,"" Panetta told reporters after a meeting with Indonesia's defense minister Sunday in Bali. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949. The $5.3 billion arms package, announced last month, includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet. Last year, a similar deal prompted China to temporarily cut off military to military relations with Americans. This time, aside from some strong objections voiced by Beijing, Panetta said there has been no tangible action taken in response by China. ""I've heard nothing that indicates that they're taking any steps in reaction to that,"" Panetta said. Part of the reason might be the way the United States government handled the sales. ""It was something that the United States had announced but we had given the Chinese a heads up as to what was going to take place,"" Panetta said. ""I think in the end ... they handled it in a professional and diplomatic way and we appreciate that. "" The South China Sea, a body of water east of Vietnam, north of Malaysia and west of the Philippines, has been a source of regional tensions for decades. But because of recent discoveries of massive oil reserves as well as its importance to regional maritime and aviation navigation, tensions have increased recently. Many countries lay claims to the same parts of the sea. After his meeting with the Indonesian defense minister, Panetta met with defense ministers from all eight member nations of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes all the nations that border the South China Sea, except China. In remarks prepared for the start of the meeting, Panetta said, ""I applaud the July accord between ASEAN and China on implementing guidelines to the 2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the South China Sea. I would encourage you to maintain this momentum, and continue working towards a binding code of conduct."" But Panetta said there are still some concerns regarding China's military that bear watching. ""Obviously there are some concerns about some of the things they are doing on modernization, there are concerns about some of the things they are doing with some of the more sophisticated weapons that have been developed."" He said China being open and letting the world know what its military is doing is key. ""As long as they are transparent, as long as we can discuss these issues on a frank and direct basis then I think we can develop a strong working relationship."" He ended his discussion of China with the reporters on an ominous note about positive relations. ""I think it would be in the interest, not only in the interest of both nations, but also in the interest of the security of the world.""","China handled news of U.S. arms sale to Taiwan well, Panetta says .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have found a decline in oxygen levels in the Gulf of Mexico following the BP oil spill but have found no ""dead zones"" as a result, a federal task force reported Tuesday. Levels of dissolved oxygen in deep water have dropped about 20 percent below their long-term average, according to data collected from up to 60 miles from the well at the center of the worst oil spill in U.S. history. But much of that dip appears to be the result of microbes using oxygen to dissolve oil underwater, and the decline is not enough to be fatal to marine life, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official Steve Murawski, the head the Joint Analysis Group studying the spill's impact. ""Even the lowest observations in all of these was substantially above the threshold,"" Murawski said. The samples were collected from 419 points at varying distances from the ruptured well at the heart of the disaster and at depths as far down as 4,800 feet, the group reported. The task force is made up of NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The undersea gusher erupted in April, releasing an estimated 4.9 million barrels (205 million gallons) of crude before being temporarily capped in July. The volume of oil -- and the amount of chemical dispersants used to break it up -- have created concerns about the long-term health of the Gulf. At the same time, the spill delivered a severe economic blow to the region, where fisheries and beach resorts are major employers. Early findings from a mid-August survey led by the University of South Florida indicated oil had settled to the bottom of the Gulf further east than previously suspected and at levels toxic to marine life. At about the same time, a team from Georgia Sea Grant and the University of Georgia released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that leaked from the well ""has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem."" The latest study ""does not discuss the broad ecosystem consequences of hydrocarbons released into the environment,"" NOAA said. But it concludes that the oil is continuing to break up and disperse underneath the surface, making the emergency of a major oxygen-poor dead zone unlikely. In early August, the federal government estimated that about three-quarters of the oil spilled had either evaporated or been dispersed, or had been skimmed or burned off the surface. The disaster began with an April 20 explosion aboard the oil rig Deepwater Horizon that left 11 men dead. The blast uncorked a BP-owned well off southeastern Louisiana that spewed for 87 days before being temporarily capped.  Operations are under way to permanently seal the well. BP, rig owner Transocean and well cement contractor Halliburton have blamed each other for the disaster. BP plans to release the findings of its internal investigation of the accident on Wednesday, the company said.","Deep-water oxygen levels are down but not deadly, report concludes .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration made public all information available throughout the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday in response to a preliminary report that criticized how it handled the disaster. ""This was an unprecedented environmental disaster met with an unprecedented federal response which prevented any of the worst-case scenarios from coming to fruition,"" Gibbs told reporters when asked about the report made public the previous day. ""When we had information, we gave it to the public."" According to the working paper released Wednesday from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, the administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf after the April 20 oil rig explosion that caused the disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies. The explosion claimed 11 lives and led to more than 60,000 barrels of oil being spewed into the Gulf daily for almost three months. According to the working paper, the White House Office of Management and Budget squelched higher worst-case estimates accepted by government officials, preventing the public from hearing them. In addition, the commission staff sharply criticized later White House estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up, burned or naturally dispersed, saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer-reviewed by scientists. Gibbs acknowledged that some mistakes were made, in particular citing comments regarding the estimated oil dispersal by former White House environmental adviser Carol Browner in one of ""hundreds"" of interviews she gave. However, he insisted that the administration worked with the information available at all times, noting that it was impossible to see or measure the oil spill rate in the initial weeks after the explosion. ""Throughout this process, we got better information,"" Gibbs said. ""When the rig exploded and the blowout preventer failed 5,000 feet below the ocean, nobody could see what happened."" The installation of video cameras and other technology improved the ability to estimate the spill flow in ensuing months, Gibbs said. At the insistence of Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the administration required BP to install pressure monitors to provide the ""best available data on the flow rate,"" he added. The commission working paper said the government's low estimates of oil flow from the spill, as well as the apparent underestimation of how much oil remained in the Gulf, ""created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem."" Gibbs echoed federal officials who say the low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill, describing the overall effort as the ""most robust federal response that we've ever seen"" to such an accident. However, the 29-page report said: ""Even if responders are correct, however, loss of the public's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem. The absence of trust fuels public fears, and those fears in turn can cause major harm, whether because the public loses confidence in the federal government's assurances that beaches or seafood are safe, or because the government's lack of credibility makes it harder to build relationships ... that are necessary for effective response actions."" The report is considered a working paper. The commission will issue a formal report on January 12, 2011. The president appointed the commission in June and tasked it with providing recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur. The commission is headed by former Florida governor and former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly from the Republican administration of President George H.W Bush. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, said BP was providing too-low figures for the oil flow in effort to escape liability. ""Low-balling the flow rate numbers was BP's attempt to hide both the truth and their wallet from the American people,"" Markey said. After the oil rig sank, the U.S. Coast Guard and BP initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day. The administration later derived a 5,000-barrels-per-day estimate, depending on an ""unsolicited, one-page document"" based on visual operation of the speed at which the oil was leaking from the end of the riser at the bottom of the Gulf. Despite ""inaccuracies"" in  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists' estimate of 5,000 barrels, the government stuck with that number through May 27, despite estimates from outside experts suggesting a much higher figure, the report said. The panel's staff wrote that in some cases, nongovernment scientists relied on more refined or better-established methodologies. ""It is possible that the early official flow estimates would have been more accurate if the government had either enlisted greater in-house scientific expertise, or enlisted outside scientific expertise by making available the data on which government estimates were based,"" the report said. ""The government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of May, took on great importance,"" the report said. Soon after the spill, the Minerals Management Service and BP reported a worst-case estimate of 162,000 barrels, but that was replaced by another estimate received by the Coast Guard and NOAA of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day. The actual figure turned out to be about 62,000 barrels per day. According to the report, NOAA wanted to make public some of its worst-case models and requested approval from the Office of Management and Budget. That request was denied. On Thursday, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco challenged some of the working paper's assertions, saying the commission staff erroneously equated NOAA's worst-case scenarios with projections of flow rates. The two were different, she said in a letter to the commission. Lubchenco also said the early flow-rate estimates did not hamper the government response, and that there was no unwarranted delay or squelching of NOAA's information by the Office of Management and Budget. ""The worst-case scenario models and documents had nothing to do with calculation of the flow rate, but they did help inform the Unified Command's preparations for possible eventualities,"" her letter said. ""And the worst-case scenario paper was made public."" A member of the government team assembled to address the gulf between official and independent flow-rate estimates told CNN, ""We were never pressured [by the government] that we should change our [flow rate] number."" Ira Leifer blamed the initially low oil flow-rate estimates on the poor quality of data the group of scientists had from BP. Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said. The report also faulted the government's tracking of the spill. It said a White House official in August claimed 75 percent of the oil was ""gone."" But the response team could not support that claim, panel staffers wrote. That information was never meant ""to be a precise tool,"" and the administration should not have used it as a scientific report, they said. ""It did not attempt to quantify biodegradation, or the exact amounts of remaining, dissolved, and dispersed oil, which were not the targets of response action."" Further, it said, the government's failure to account for the stages of biodegradation increased public confusion of how much oil was actually ""gone."" The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the cleanup. ""As for the predictions about the spill flow rate, senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be: in early May, [Interior] Secretary [Ken] Salazar and Admiral Thad Allen told the American people [in media interviews] that the worst case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day,"" said a statement from OMB Acting Director Jeffrey Zients and Lubchenco of NOAA. ""The federal government response was full force and immediate, and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed,"" the statement continued. ""As directed by the President, the response was based on science, even when that pitted us against BP or state and local officials, and the response pushed BP every step of the way. Finally, and most importantly, the response provided results for the people of the Gulf Coast."" Regarding the flow and recovery of the spilled oil, Zients and Lubchenco said responders worked with best known information at the time and later came up with improved analysis. ""The facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill,"" they said.

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Republicans retained four of the six state Senate seats that were in jeopardy in Tuesday's recall elections in Wisconsin, news media in the state reported. Democrats won two seats but needed three to take control. The Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which certifies election results, said official results will begin to come in Thursday and will be certified that day at the earliest. The unofficial results released Wednesday were collected by The Associated Press and distributed to newspapers, television and radio stations. The recall election stems from the bitter battle last winter that saw pro-union protesters camping out in the state Capitol and Democratic senators fleeing the state in an unsuccessful attempt to halt legislation by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that some felt was anti-union. Democrats were angling to win GOP-held seats to capture control of the upper chamber. Before the election, Republicans held a 19-14 majority in the state Senate. With a victory, Democrats had hoped to build momentum for a planned effort to recall Walker. Walker, who was elected in November with strong support from tea party activists, can't be recalled until after he serves a year in office. Republicans have countered with their own recall attempts against three Democrats.  One of them survived a challenge in July, while two others will be on the ballot next week. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus applauded the results of the Tuesday vote. ""Today, Wisconsin voters rejected the reckless spending of Wisconsin Democrats and the downgrade-inducing policies of their Washington counterparts. They have given their seal of approval to Republicans' successful efforts to balance the budget and ensure a healthy economy,""  he said. Priebus also said the vote was an affirmation of Walker's policies. Walker set off a firestorm in January when he moved to curtail the collective bargaining rights of most state employees. With majorities in both houses of the Legislature, Walker and his GOP allies voted to limit raises for public employees except police and firefighters to the rate of inflation, bar unions from deducting dues from workers' paychecks and force them to hold a new certification vote every year. Republicans insisted that the legislation was necessary to control skyrocketing public employee benefit costs and close a budget shortfall, while Democrats called it an attempt to gut public-sector labor unions, one of their core constituencies. The state Supreme Court upheld the legislation in June. While Democrats would not have been able to roll back the union restrictions with control of only one chamber of the Legislature, they would have been able to block any of Walker's other initiatives. Tea Party Express chief strategist Sal Russo said he was pleased about the vote. ""The importance of those achievements cannot be overstated,"" Russo said. ""Wisconsin has set an example that the nation as a whole should follow.""

"(CNN) -- An Australian woman is suing the nation's top four banks for their alleged role in laundering money from her teenage son's $200,000 eBay scam that afforded him a $6,000-a-day playboy lifestyle. Australian media reported that in 2007, the then 14 year old boy was making so much money selling non-existent laptops, mobile phones and watches on eBay he could afford to book a $4300-a-night penthouses overlooking Sydney Harbour, fly friends interstate for lavish parties and hire limousines to take him to the beach. A spokesman for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia confirmed to CNN that the woman from the south coast of New South Wales, who along with her son cannot be named for legal reasons, had launched an action in the Supreme Court seeking damages over the scam. Reports said she was seeking an apology from the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac and NAB for ''unconscionable conduct'' after allegedly allowing her son to open numerous bank accounts with debit cards ""without reasonable scrutiny"". She claims the banks ignored her or refused to discuss the matter for privacy reasons when she warned them they had issued accounts that were being used by a minor to bank illegal funds, reports said. ''He was an intelligent boy who worked out how to cheat the system and play it for all it was worth,'' she told Australia's Sun Herald newspaper. ''As his parent and legal guardian, I begged the banks to stop giving him accounts and debit cards but each time I got nowhere because of the Privacy Act.'' She said her suspicions were aroused four years ago when her son began spending lavishly. She told the Sun-Herald she later uncovered a log book listing thousands of dollars worth of transactions with eBay. The boy, now 19, allegedly deceived the Commonwealth Bank into opening an account after fronting up to the bank with a birth certificate and a friend over the age of 18 who claimed to be his guardian, according to reports in Australian media. ''Once he secured that, he was able to accumulate check and Visa debit accounts with many other financial institutions including Westpac, the Bank of Queensland, ANZ, Credit Union Australia and the Hume Building Society,'' the mother was quoted as saying in the Sun-Herald report. Police eventually arrested the boy at school after many of the frauds were linked to an IP address attached to a classroom computer. By the time of his arrest, the boy was already allegedly working another scam, milking the $1,500 overdraft facility on a series of debit accounts. In the meantime, reports said, the boy lived a playboy lifestyle with shopping sprees for Versace and Prada clothes and Louis Vuitton luggage. ''There I was, a single mum of two, desperately struggling to put food on the table. He, meanwhile, would stroll in after feasting at the latest fancy restaurant of his choice and chuck me leftovers in a plastic tub,'' she told the Sun-Herald . Underneath the exterior, her son was an ''insecure boy out to impress,'' she told the newspaper. Reports said that during the past four years, she had reluctantly handed her son to the police 15 times.","Woman seeks damages over the scam, a bank spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- ""Success with Honor."" So proclaims the motto of Penn State University's athletics program. For years that seemed to be the case. Under the tutelage of Coach Joe Paterno, the football program has never been sanctioned by the NCAA for a major violation and boasts one of the highest graduation percentages for athletes in Division I-A football. But just as a major program is only as good as its last win, so is one's honor, one's ethical status. The recent charges of sexual abuse of boys by a former Penn State assistant football coach and the seeming years-long cover-up by university officials has befouled an illustrious program and the school's honor. For those of us who have been influenced deeply by Joe Paterno's football career as proof that an ethical program can indeed be run in high-power college football, the visceral and immediate response is that of the child to Shoeless Joe Jackson after the breaking of the ""Black Sox"" scandal in baseball, ""Say it ain't so, Joe."" But alas, it appears to be so. Rather, however, than bemoan the decline in college sports, a topic upon which one could write for weeks, I am more concerned about what lessons we can learn from this experience and how it fits within a wide and, seemingly, growing culture committed to prostrating itself before the idol of monetary success. From banking scandals to Wall Street, elementary schools to universities, the scramble to succeed in dollar terms, to bring in ever more money has led individuals and organizations to ignore visible, powerful, and pressing evidence of malfeasance. Money and power buy impunity, or at least rent it. The Catholic Church, News Corporation, Citigroup, and now Penn State deserve the opprobrium that has been, and should be, heaped upon them for looking away, feigning ignorance, or covering-up the frauds, the abuses, the criminality. When we place our loyalty, our commitment, in the service of individuals, organizations, or money we already have started down the path of corruption. Such misplaced loyalty, whether to a colleague in a hospital, a comrade in battle, or a stock trader on the floor, can only lead to error, wrongdoing, and evil. In appearing to place success above honor, the administration of Penn State University has aided a sexual predator and ruined numerous lives. In their loyalty to the university's good name, they failed in their loyalty, nay their duty, to the victims and to society as a whole. For this they should be wholeheartedly condemned and punished. The firing of Coach Paterno and university president, Graham Spanier, are clearly the right steps in that direction. For the rest of us, we need also to look inward. As fans, investors, administrators and co-workers, how have we furthered this reality? Do we really desire the NCAA to clamp down on abuses, even if it is our team? As surgeons, do we report the incompetent or drunken medical colleague? As individuals whose wealth increases, do we really care about the nature of the stock trades or the processes? How we answer those questions determines the nature of our society. Let us honor the coach who reports boosters slipping money to players, the co-worker who reports malfeasance, and the soldier who decries abuse and illegal orders. For if we do not, we ourselves must bear the guilt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward Queen.","Edward Queen: Penn State has betrayed its athletics motto, ""Success with Honor'

"(CNN) -- A grandfather who perished in a Christmas day fire at a Connecticut home died from blunt-force head and neck trauma as well as smoke inhalation, while his wife and their three grandchildren died from smoke inhalation, the state medical examiner's office said Wednesday. Authorities said on Tuesday that Lomer Johnson fell through roof rafters outside a window. One of the children's bodies was found just inside the window. It appeared Johnson was trying to get the child out, but died after climbing through the window, said Stamford, Connecticut, Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte. The medical examiner's office said Wednesday Johnson suffered from smoke inhalation in addition to trauma from the fall. Three young sisters -- a 10-year-old and 7-year-old twins -- died in the fire along with the Johnsons. The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and a friend escaped the blaze. The fire, which broke out about 5 a.m. Sunday morning in the three-story Victorian home, is believed to have been caused by smoldering embers removed from a fireplace about two hours before and taken to an area in the rear of the house, Stamford Chief Fire Marshal Barry Callahan said. The city of Stamford razed the three-story home on Monday after determining it was unsafe. The million-dollar home in the wealthy Shippan Point neighborhood was under renovation. All that was left of it was the mailbox, around which grieving neighbors placed flowers. CNN affiliate WFSB reported that Badger attempted to climb the renovation scaffolding outside the home in an apparent attempt to reach her family. Witnesses said they heard her screaming that her whole life was inside the home, the station said. Intense flames and heat pushed back firefighters searching for the trapped family members, Conte told reporters on Tuesday. The investigation into the fire continues, officials said. ""It's going to take a while,"" Conte said. ""That poor woman lost her entire family in one fell swoop."" Badger, a New York advertising executive, purchased the Connecticut home for $1.7 million in December 2010, according to property records. Johnson worked as a Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue's Manhattan store this holiday season, the department store said. He and his wife would have celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary on Monday, according to WFSB. Authorities said Tuesday it was unclear whether the home had working smoke detectors.

"(CNN) -- A man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party intends to plead not guilty to all charges, his attorney said Wednesday. Ruben Jurado, 19, faces a charge of attempted murder in the shooting of Army Spc. Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan's native San Bernardino, California. He also faces charges on ""allegations involving premeditation and the use and discharge of a firearm causing great bodily injury,"" the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office said in a statement on Tuesday. Jurado ""will deny any and all allegations,"" defense attorney Michael Holmes said in a written statement to CNN on Wednesday. ""We anticipate receiving the initial discovery of police reports and any other evidence that the district attorney has at this time."" Holmes noted that the court ""allows video arraignment,"" but said he and Jurado had ""discussed this process and he wanted to be present in court during the entire process. He requested to be present and the next available date is tomorrow (Thursday) morning."" The party in Sullivan's honor was to celebrate his recent return to California from Kentucky, where he was stationed while recovering from wounds sustained in a suicide bombing a year ago in Afghanistan. The bombing killed five members of his unit and left him with a cracked collarbone and brain damage, according to the San Bernardino County Sun. Sullivan received the Purple Heart, the newspaper reported. At the party, Sullivan was shot twice after an argument and physical confrontation with Jurado, who fled the scene, according to police and witnesses. The fight broke out after Jurado and Sullivan's younger brother began arguing about football, the brothers' mother, Suzanne Sullivan, told CNN. Jurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills, California, on Monday afternoon, said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters. On Tuesday, Sullivan's mother told CNN he was ""on 100% life support."" ""He can move his head and he responds through nodding and blinking to us. His eyes aren't always open, but we try to encourage him to do so as often as possible,"" Suzanne Sullivan said. She said her son asked what had happened to him and wanted to know why. ""We told him what it was about and he just closed his eyes,"" she said. Suzanne Sullivan said her family is having a difficult time coming to terms with what happened. ""He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- From color-popping dresses to bold prints and shapes, Afro-centric designs have been storming catwalks in recent years, catching the eye of fashionistas across the world. But for many international consumers, especially those with no access to shops dedicated to African brands, it can often be hard to get their hands on designer garments from the continent. As a result, more and more African designers are taking their lines to the web in a bid to reach out to a larger market. And while many are setting up their own websites, others rely on internet boutiques which have more experience navigating the online market. One such store is My Asho -- launched in June 2009, this UK-based web boutique carries the work of established and up-and-coming African designers, giving them a chance to showcase their creations to a wider audience. Founder Dolapo Shobanjo says she started My Asho -- taken from the Yoruba word ""aso"" which means cloth -- when she realized that African designers were not getting the promotion they deserved. ""I contacted the top designers, I spoke to them and asked them about their struggle and how difficult it is for them,"" says Shobanjo. ""That's really how it got started, so to create that credible infrastructure is to show the global demand for the products and that will kick start the productions."" Today, My Asho stocks a variety of womenswear, children's clothes and accessories from more than 30 African designers. Shobanjo says she is very careful when it comes to selecting new designers, making sure they have high professional standards. ""We're very happy to add new people in the site but we have to ensure that the designers we add are serious,"" she says. ""There are a lot of people out there who claim to be African designers but it's more like 'oh, I have a tailor who can sew very well and who can copy items,' so we have to distinguish between copy-cats and people doing this as a hobby."" One of the designers featured on the site is Erzumah Ackerson who runs clothing label Bestow Elan. She says My Asho is an ideal platform for her work, helping her to make her creations more visible as well as boost demand. ""I think there's still an element of investment that still needs to be done so we are recognized on an international as well as mainstream platform but I think My Asho is a perfect platform because since I've been on there, I've had a lot of international buyers and got into mainstream magazines."" And as this digital expansion is helping create more demand, many African designers are now having to keep up in their supply. Titi Ademola, a Ghana-based designer who is the founder of the KIKI Clothing brand, says the biggest challenge for many fashion designers is manufacturing. ""You get a lot of excitement from so many places but once you get an order, how do you manufacture in large quantities?"" says Ademola. ""So, that's the issue that I'm facing, trying to focus on quality control and trying to ensure that you consistently provide quality and appealing garments to other companies and other markets,"" she adds. With clients in more than 50 countries, Shobanjo's goal is to create a sustainable business model for My Asho. At the same time, she also wants her company to help her continent by supporting local African communities where the clothes are manufactured. As a result, Shobanjo's prioritized working with ethical brands that show a commitment to fair labor practices and create opportunities for their communities. ""I'm supporting Africa, helping it grow and creating jobs but it's not to say that a certain percentage of x is going to here because I don't think that is a sustainable business model,"" says Shobanjo. ""I think it is better to create from the start ethical principles and work with designers who pay their tailors well, who are investing in helping their communities grow and then once you grow as a business then you know that they will also grow as well.""

"(CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died of respiratory arrest brought on by a pancreatic tumor, a public health official said Monday. Jobs died at 3 p.m. Wednesday at home in Palo Alto, California, said Amy Cornell of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. His death was announced Wednesday by Apple, the Silicon Valley company he founded with Steve Wozniak. Jobs was 56. The hard-driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse. In more recent years, he introduced the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet -- all of which changed how digital content was consumed. Jobs' death, while dreaded by Apple's legions of fans, was not unexpected. He had battled cancer for years, took a medical leave from Apple in January and stepped down as chief executive in August because he could ""no longer meet (his) duties and expectations."" On October 19, Apple employees will celebrate Jobs' life and contributions. A company memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook said: . ""Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week. But I've found some comfort in the extraordinary number of tributes and condolences from people all over the world who were touched by Steve and his genius. And I've found comfort in both telling and listening to stories about Steve. ""Although many of our hearts are still heavy, we are planning a celebration of his life for Apple employees to take time to remember the incredible things Steve achieved in his life and the many ways he made our world a better place.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Latino voters strongly support President Barack Obama and his Democratic Party, despite dissatisfaction with the administration's deportation policies, according to a survey released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center. The results are good news for Obama and Democrats for next year's election, as Hispanics are the fastest-growing population group in the country and comprise a major voting bloc. According to the survey, Latino registered voters favor Obama over Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney or Texas Gov. Rick Perry by margin of more than 2-to-1. The results are similar to the presidential election in 2008, when Obama got 67% of the Latino vote compared with 31% for Republican candidate Sen. John McCain. Hispanic voters have traditionally identified with the Democratic Party, and the Pew survey's results showed that connection continues. It said two-thirds of Hispanic registered voters identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party, while 20% felt that way about the Republican Party. ""It is interesting that among Latino voters, the voters who are registered, there is a lot of support for the Democrats, but also for Barack Obama,"" Mark Hugo Lopez, executive director of the Pew Hispanic Center, said in an interview with CNN. The survey of 1,200 Hispanic adults was conducted in English and Spanish from November 9 through December 7, and has a margin of error of 3.6%. While showing strong Latino support for Obama and Democrats, the survey also showed Hispanics dislike immigration policies of the Obama administration, which increased deportations to 395,000 in 2009 and 387,000 in 2010. According to the Pew survey, 59% of Latino respondents disapproved of the administration's handling of deportations, while 27% approved. At the same time, the survey found that less than half of the Hispanic respondents -- 41% -- knew that more deportations were occurring under the Obama administration than the Bush administration that preceded it. A strong majority -- 77% -- of Latino respondents who were aware of the increased deportations under Obama disapproved of his administration's policy, while just over half of those unaware of the increase also expressed disapproval. Hispanics accounted for 97% of deportees in 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. More than 90% of Latino respondents in the survey support the DREAM Act, a Democratic measure pushed by Obama that provides a pathway to legal residency for children of illegal immigrants who attend college or serve in the military. Republicans have blocked passage of the measure in Congress. In the interview with CNN, the Pew Hispanic Center's Lopez said that the most important issues for Hispanic registered voters were jobs, education and health care -- the same as in past years.

"Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel declared himself impressed after road testing the new Pirelli tires that are to be used for the 2011 season. The Red Bull driver was back at the Abu Dhabi circuit where he clinched his first ever drivers' championship crown last weekend, after edging out teammate Mark Webber and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. The Yas Marina track played host to all 12 Formula One teams as they began a two-day tire test on the Pirelli rubbers, set to replace Bridgestone from next year. A total of eight sets of tires are available to teams during testing. Ferrari's Felipe Massa, who finished a disappointing sixth in the drivers' standings, was quickest in the unofficial timings on Friday, with Vettel in second. ""I think the tires behaved well, better than expected given the short amount of time Pirelli have had and they've done a good job,"" Vettel told the official Formula One website. ""Pirelli are obviously in the middle of their development and what we used today is not what we will race with, but it was a good start."" Massa was three-tenths of a second faster than Vettel, and completed 94 laps of the circuit using two different types of tires. ""It was a positive start to begin to understand the behavior of the Pirelli tires. I felt at ease right from the start and there were no unpleasant surprises,"" Massa added. ""We acquired a lot of data which will be useful for the Italian company to develop the tires still further for the start of the 2011 season. ""On the harder tires, there were some difficulties over a long run while the softs worked well both on the very first lap and also after they had done a larger number of laps."" McLaren test driver Gary Paffett claimed third place while Kamui Kobayashi of BMW Sauber was fourth. ""We have to hand it to Pirelli, the tyres are already on a good level and we feel it was a very positive day,"" said BMW Sauber technical director James Key. ""We feel we learned a lot about the way the tyres are behaving and responding to different set-up changes.""","Sebastian Vettel impressed after road testing new Pirelli tires to be used in 2011 season .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Newly discovered artifacts beneath the huge stones of Jerusalem's Western Wall, one of Judaism's holiest sites, indicate it took longer to build than previously believed. Until now, the wall constructed as part of King Herod's enlargement of the Temple Mount area was thought to have been completed before he died in 4 B.C. However, the discovery of three oil lamps from the first century and 17 bronze coins, four of which were dated A.D. 16, in a ritual bath beneath the Western Wall appears to confirm the writings of a first-century Jewish historian, who said the project was completed decades after Herod's death. ""This is important because now we would not speak any more of the Temple Mount being built by Herod"" alone, said University of Haifa professor Ronny Reich, an archaeologist working on the site on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. ""This is an archaeological finding that indeed the works of the Temple Mount took a long time, far after Herod's death."" A statement by the antiquities authority said the ancient historian, Flavius Josephus, wrote that Herod began constructing and enlarging the Temple Mount area in 22 B.C., which was the 18th year of his reign. Josephus wrote that it was ""the largest project the world has ever heard of,"" according to the authority's statement. Josephus also wrote that the completion of the building project, which included the Western Wall and Robinson's Arch as part of the Temple Mount complex, did not end until A.D. 50, the statement said. ""This bit of archaeological information illustrates the fact that the construction of the Temple Mount walls and Robinson's Arch was an enormous project that lasted decades and was not completed during Herod's lifetime,"" the authority's statement said. ""This dramatic find confirms Josephus' descriptions which state that it was only during the reign of King Agrippa II (Herod's great-grandson) that the work was finished, and upon its completion there were 8,000-10,000 unemployed in Jerusalem."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Coins found by archaeologists shed light on construction of one of Judaism's holiest sites .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Former hostage Sigifredo Lopez landed in the Colombian city of Palmira to a hero's welcome Thursday afternoon, free after nearly seven years of captivity by Marxist rebels in the jungle. A Brazilian helicopter takes off Thursday from an airport in Palmira, Colombia, to pick up Sigifredo Lopez. Lopez was met at the helicopter that ferried him to freedom by his wife and two sons, who cried openly and deeply as they hugged him. One son held his father's head in his hands and spoke to him fervently as he kissed his forehead. Lopez's mother also hugged him before the freed hostage was swallowed by a mob of family members of other hostages who had died in captivity. After hugging well-wishers for more than 20 minutes, Lopez climbed into a white Red Cross sport utility vehicle and drove off in a four-vehicle convoy. The former regional legislator was abducted April 11, 2002, by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC. Lopez's release was the sixth unilateral one by the rebels in a week, but few of the kidnappings were as dramatic as the one in which Lopez and 11 other lawmakers were taken. He is the only one of that group who remains alive. A video taken by the FARC that day in April 2002 and released in late 2006 shows the first minutes of the bold kidnapping that led to his captivity. The rebels had been training for months. At a FARC camp, they practiced in Colombian army and police uniforms and made mock-ups of the regional parliament in Cali with plastic tarps and sticks. A rebel camera was rolling as the 20-strong commando group drove a bus to Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. Salsa music was blaring.  Watch the FARC footage of the dramatic abduction of Lopez and other lawmakers » . They were posing as government soldiers. Motorcycle outriders cleared the way. Once they reached the parliament building, they faked a bomb alert. The bus pulled out in front of the building, and the video shows people running from the perceived threat. On the video, an unseen rebel is heard to say, ""For the deputies, we have a special vehicle."" Twelve congressmen took their seats, believing the military was shepherding them to safety. Minutes passed, and one politician asked where they are headed. A few minutes later, the muffled reply can be heard: ""Ladies and gentlemen. We are the FARC."" Back in the mountains, the hostages were herded aboard a truck. Guerrillas waved and hugged as they celebrated their audacious mission. In 2003, Lopez and some of the other hostages appeared in a proof-of-life video. One of his colleagues simply wrote, ""Until when?"" on his hand and held it up to camera. Another, Jairo Hoyos, sent a prophetic plea to the president: ""Mister President. Those who are about to die salute you."" Eleven of the congressmen were killed in captivity in June 2007. The FARC said they died in cross-fire during a military rescue mission. The Colombian army rejects that assertion. When the bodies were recovered three months later, autopsies showed most had been shot multiple times in the back. Lopez was the sole survivor. On Thursday night, he may be able to tell the rest of the world what happened that day. FARC has released five other hostages in the past week. On Tuesday, Alan Jara, the former governor of Colombia's Meta state, arrived at the airport in Villavicencio, southeast of Bogota. Four hostages -- three police officers and a soldier -- were released over the weekend. Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba has brokered the releases with the help of the the International Committee of the Red Cross and a group called Colombians for Peace. Brazil also has helped, providing the aircraft used in the releases. The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, announced the releases December 21 and designated Cordoba as the coordinator. Some analysts see these releases as a first step toward an eventual peace accord. Others suggest this is just another sign that government military gains combined with a tough right-wing political line are gradually beating the FARC into submission. Colombia has said the rebels are still holding about 700 captives . The government recently has offered rewards to guerrillas who surrender and free hostages. Last month, two guerrillas fled their camp deep in the jungles of southern Colombia, bringing along two captives, a 14-year-old boy and a male adult who were kidnapped in December. And a July rescue operation freed former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who had been held captive since 2002, along with three American military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. The government has said the FARC's military force has been severely compromised in recent months, but authorities still accuse it of trafficking huge quantities of cocaine to finance its decades-old insurgency. Security analysts said FARC, established in the early 1960s, has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts say.","NEW: Family greets Sigifredo Lopez, the sixth hostage to be freed by FARC this week .

"Washington (CNN) -- John Kerry got Swift-boated. Jimmy Carter had his re-election chances decimated in the Iranian desert. Then there was Michael Dukakis and that tank photo. It is a tradition of presidential politics in recent decades that Democrats get accused of being soft and inexperienced on military and foreign policy issues, and Barack Obama was no different in 2008. However, a string of foreign policy successes -- including the killings of terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki, and now the toppling of the Gadhafi regime in Libya without the loss of any U.S. service members -- have made Obama seemingly invulnerable to the quadrennial Republican attack line. The question is whether it will matter a year from now, when voters decide if he should get a second term. To analysts interviewed Monday, the president's policies and actions during almost three years in power have helped him shed the knee-jerk, anti-war reputation affixed to Democrats since the Vietnam era. They cite increased drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, including the one that killed the U.S.-born al-Awlaki, as well as the Special Forces mission that raided a compound in Pakistan housing bin Laden. ""Those actions demonstrate a degree of toughness that insulates him from the charge of being soft on defense,"" said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. However, voter dissatisfaction with 9% unemployment and crawling economic recovery is likely to overwhelm any benefit the president gets from foreign policy successes, said David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst. According to Gergen, the association of Democrats with liberal pacifism dates back decades. In the middle of the 20th century, he noted, Democrats were the party of international engagement willing to ""bear any burden"" to defend the nation and its interests, as President John F. Kennedy put it at his 1961 inaugural address. Then the Vietnam War deeply divided the country, with Democrats becoming inextricably linked to the fervent anti-war movement by nominating liberal South Dakota Sen. George McGovern for president in 1972, according to Gergen. In subsequent decades, the perception persisted of Democrats as liberals who were soft on communism and unwilling to use military force. In 1980, the failure of a military mission in Iran ordered by Carter to rescue 52 Americans held hostage since the revolution the previous year cemented his image as a weak leader. Crashed helicopters in the desert became the foreign policy symbol of a presidency that helped orchestrate the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. Carter then was defeated by Ronald Reagan in the presidential election that year. Eight years later. Dukakis saw his campaign against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush undermined in part by a photo that sought to prop up his military credentials by showing him riding a tank. However, the image of Dukakis in what appeared to be an over-large military helmet with his name affixed to the front, his tie and business shirt visible beneath military outer garb, instead prompted ridicule. The ""soft on war"" legacy for Democrats continued in 2004, when Kerry came under fierce, privately funded attacks that accused him of falsifying his account of a battle that earned him a Silver Star as a Swift boat operator, as well as making false claims about misconduct by other U.S. forces in Vietnam and Cambodia. The campaign against Kerry coined the phrase ""swift-boating"" in reference to an acute, partisan and not necessarily truthful political attack. It also turned what should have been a benefit for Kerry -- his war record compared to the non-service in Vietnam by Republican incumbent George W. Bush -- into a controversial issue. Kerry lost the election. For Obama, what was perhaps his greatest foreign policy triumph -- the covert mission to send U.S. special forces into Pakistan after bin Laden -- came close to the kind of failure that plagued Carter's rescue mission 31 years earlier. One of the U.S. helicopters involved became disabled, forcing a change in how the mission was carried out. This time, though, the U.S. forces were able to infiltrate bin Laden's compound, kill him and fly out with his body. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, called Obama's decision to launch the mission one of the most courageous he ever saw a president make. If the bin Laden mission had failed, West and Gergen noted, Obama would likely find himself in the same position as Carter -- an incumbent candidate labeled as weak and ineffective. ""They would have tried to turn Obama into Jimmy Carter,"" West said, adding: ""People would have said that even though the mission was ambitious, the execution was flawed and that this would reflect poorly on presidential leadership."" Instead, ""I don't think it's going to be possible for Republicans to Swift-boat Obama,"" West said. The president's actions ""demonstrate a degree of toughness that Jimmy Carter didn't have."" Both Gergen and West said Obama's strategy seeks to exert U.S. influence while minimizing the nation's long-term commitment to overseas conflict and any loss of American lives. That strategy was most evident in the Libya campaign, which was launched by the United States under a U.N. resolution authorizing establishment of a no-fly zone to protect civilians from attack by Gadhafi's military. Eventually, the campaign shifted to NATO control, with U.S. forces playing a supporting role for air strikes that targeted Gadhafi forces. In the end, the total cost to the U.S. government is expected to be under $2 billion with no loss of American lives, compared to the more than $800 billion in costs and more than 4,000 U.S. fatalities in the Iraq War launched by the Bush administration. Some Republicans have tried to defuse credit for Obama's policy, complaining it lasted longer than necessary because the administration withheld the full might and leadership of U.S. forces throughout the Libya campaign. But to West, the successful completion of the mission -- with Gadhafi gone and no long-term U.S. commitment or cost -- will bolster Obama in next year's election. ""I've seen that a lot of people are arguing foreign policy is not going to be relevant in 2012,"" according to West. ""I think those interpretations miss the leadership Obama has displayed in foreign affairs."" Gergen warned that Obama remains vulnerable to problems in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the president is ending or reducing long-running U.S. wars. Last week, Obama announced that virtually all U.S. troops would leave Iraq by the end of the year, which would fulfill a campaign pledge from 2008. At the same time, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan is being decreased following an earlier surge ordered by Obama, with the goal of ending the war by the end of 2014. Republicans such as veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona -- who lost to Obama in 2008 -- have criticized both moves, saying they undermined the long-running missions by providing U.S. enemies with an end date to the nation's military commitments in those countries. ""I do think he's fortified himself against these Republican attacks,"" Gergen said of Obama, but he added that ""Iraq or Afghanistan or both could become a crisis between now and the election. Overall, though, the president has strengthened his standing as commander-in-chief, Gergen and research assistant Michael Zuckerman wrote in a CNN column last week. Obama's foreign policy approach will ""bolster a campaign argument that may resonate not only with his base, but also with swing voters increasingly wary of foreign engagements: that Obama wields force much more prudently and surgically than the reckless GOP -- that he has wound down Iraq and helped win back international respect, all while delivering strong results,"" the column said.","Foreign policy wins fortify the president against Vietnam-era criticism of Democrats .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber squeezed in some very public displays of affection at a hockey game in Canada on Saturday night, but just one day earlier, they made a decidedly more private outing to a local animal shelter -- and quietly adopted a dog. Winnipeg animal rescue D'Arcy's A.R.C. got a surprise visit from the young lovebirds, who stopped by for some canine therapy. ""They spent a lot of time with the puppies,"" the rescue's chief executive officer, D'Arcy Johnston, tells PEOPLE. ""I was told that [Gomez] was missing the dogs that she has at home."" Gomez, who is currently on tour and performed in Winnipeg over the weekend, owns five rescue dogs and has advocated publicly on behalf of animal rescue. During the hour she and Bieber spent at the shelter, they zeroed in on a 10-week-old husky mix and fell in love -- puppy love, that is. ""I wasn't expecting her to adopt a dog while she was on tour and has a busy schedule,"" Johnston says. Gomez went through the standard screening process and was able to leave with the puppy, which she named Baylor, that day. ""Baylor probably would have had a bad life or a very short life,"" Johnston says. ""But he got rescued and brought to our shelter and is now going to live a very good life.""

"(CNN) -- Tottenham moved up to third in the English Premier League as Emmanuel Adebayor helped welcome manager Harry Redknapp back to the dugout with both goals in Monday's 2-0 win against Aston Villa. Redknapp had minor heart surgery three weeks ago, but returned earlier than expected to see his side edge above London rivals Chelsea and Newcastle on goal difference. Tottenham now trail Manchester United by four points and Manchester City by nine, with a game in hand on both teams. The victory extended Spurs' unbeaten league run to nine matches following two early defeats to the Manchester sides -- the club's best showing in the opening 11 games since the 1967-68 season. ""I enjoyed the way we played tonight, I think the fans enjoyed it as well -- they've seen lots of great teams over the years and they're enjoying the way this team's playing,"" Redknapp said. ""It's great to be back tonight - I wouldn't want to watch it at home again, that was nerve-wracking."" Adebayor's brace at White Hart Lane represented his first goals for Spurs since a double against Liverpool in his second league appearance for the club on September 18. Rafael van der Vaart had netted in five successive games after that before missing the win over Fulham, and the Dutchman's return from a hamstring injury gave Tottenham too much potency for a Villa side which included former Spurs fullback Alan Hutton in right midfield to combat the threat of Gareth Bale. But manager Alex McLeish's ploy failed to pay off as Welsh winger Bale caused constant problems, and it was from his scuffed shot after Villa failed to clear a corner that Adebayor acrobatically hooked home the 13th-minute opener. The on-loan Manchester City forward, who made his international return for Togo last week, doubled the lead five minutes before the break when he forced in from close range after Villa defender James Collins failed to cut out Bale's teasing near-post cross. Adebayor should have completed a hat-trick in the second half but Spurs could not convert their continued dominance into more goals. Redknapp was able to bring off Van der Vaart with 20 minutes to play, allowing striker Jermain Defoe a chance to impress ahead of Saturday's trip to West Bromwich Albion. Villa stayed eighth on 15 points after 12 games, but have yet to win away in the league this season after four draws and two defeats. Meanwhile, Chelsea manager Andre Villas Boas earlier insisted that his job is safe despite Sunday's 2-1 defeat by Liverpool, the club's third in four league games. The 33-year-old former Porto coach said his relationship with billionaire owner Roman Abramovich was still good. ""He didn't pay 15 million euros ($20 million) to get me out of Porto and another fortune to get me out of Chelsea,"" he said. ""It is not a question of the owner having patience. I have said we have set out to build something new at this club and the club is committed to what we are building for the future."" Malaga moved up to fifth in Spain with a 3-1 victory away to struggling Racing Santander on Monday. Santander dropped to the bottom on goal difference below Real Sociedad and Granada, whose match against Mallorca on Sunday was called off when a linesman was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Visiting Malaga broke the deadlock three minutes after halftime through teenage midfielder Isco, and a 66th-minute own-goal by Alvaro Gonzalez doubled the lead. Manuel Arana gave Santander hope four minutes later, but veteran Dutch substitute Ruud van Nistelrooy set up Uruguayan forward Seba Fernandez for a late volley.","Emmanuel Adebayor scores both goals in Tottenham's 2-0 win over Aston Villa .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a month after false rumors on Twitter about school attacks caused car crashes when parents panicked on the streets of Veracruz, Mexico, state lawmakers there approved new regulations Tuesday making disturbing the peace a crime. The new law could mean that imprisoned suspects previously accused of ""terrorism"" for their online posts could face significantly less time behind bars. Now, those convicted of disturbing the peace could face up to four years in prison. State laws allow for a punishment of up to 30 years in prison for those convicted of terrorism. Authorities say two suspects are behind false statements on Twitter and Facebook that fueled a chaotic scene in the Mexican port city of Veracruz last month. One post claimed that five children were kidnapped. One mentioned bomb threats. Another described a helicopter was firing gunshots at an elementary school. ""Remain calm. I think that the children should be in their homes. Go get them,"" another post warned. Gov. Javier Duarte initially accused those behind the messages of ""terrorism."" But he proposed the new regulations amid a firestorm of criticism from activists and human rights groups, who said the terrorism accusation -- and the possible punishment -- didn't fit the crime. In a debate in the state's congress Tuesday, opposition lawmakers called on Duarte to retract the initiative, arguing that the document was designed to help two people but could have a much broader impact. A lawyer representing suspects Maria de la Luz Bravo Pagola and Gilberto Martinez Vera said his clients would not use the new provision in Veracruz state's penal code to defend themselves. Instead, attorney Fidel Ordonez Solana said he planned to make the case that they should be set free before a federal judge at a hearing Friday.","The new measure stems from accusations over false posts on Twitter that caused chaos .

"(CNN) -- It's a tough time for businesses, but one entrepreneur may have found the recipe for success. Male and female servers go topless at Grand View Topless Coffee Shop. On Monday, Donald Crabtree opened Grand View Topless Coffee Shop in Vassalboro, Maine, where the waiters and waitresses serve their customers topless. In a town with fewer than 4,500 residents, the topless coffee shop is booming with business. Paul Crabtree, the owner's brother, describes business so far as ""fantastic."" ""It's just been crowds mobbing in,"" he said. Donald Crabtree faced initial opposition to his plan, but he won the right to go ahead in a planning board hearing last week. Many local residents were irate over the idea of combining coffee and nudity. Crabtree, however, saw a profitable business venture. ""I know what people want,"" he said. ""People like nudity, and coffee is profitable. Sure, I'd start a coffee shop, but I'd be out of work in a week."" The flood of job applications -- more than 150 -- for Grand View Topless Coffee Shop reflected the rough job market. Crabtree hired 10 women and five men under stringent requirements, including friendliness and, what he considered most important, that the wait staff ""treat everyone equally."" Watch townspeople, employees talk about coffee shop . ""We didn't hire '10s,' "" he said, referring to appearance. ""We hired everyone from skinny to big-boned women."" Of the 15 selected, most had been laid off from other jobs in the past few months. Elvis Thompson of Brunswick, for example, was a line cook at a restaurant before he lost his job. ""They couldn't afford me anymore,"" he said. He said he doesn't mind fielding interesting requests from customers. ""An 80-year-old woman told me she wanted to see me in spandex,"" Thompson said. ""I just feel really lucky to have a job. I need the money so I can pay my rent."" Ginni Labree from Palermo, Maine, said she applied to several restaurants before being hired at the Grand View. All the restaurants declined to hire her because of her lack of experience. ""I'm so excited, so excited to have a job,"" she said. The coffee shop jobs are paying off. One waitress received a $100 tip for a cup of coffee, and most of the wait staff make about $30 a table. Although the topless coffee shop has been open less than a week, Crabtree said he is already seeing regulars. Customers include a variety of individuals, but mainly couples and females. He also sees his new business venture as a temporary fix for customers struggling through tough economic times. ""The economy is so bad,"" Crabtree said, ""Everyone's losing their homes, their ties, everything they own. People leave here happy and can't wait to come back. It's nice to see people smile again.""","Men, women without tops wait tables at Maine coffee shop .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- The number of people killed during riots in Tunisia recently is about 21, the government said Wednesday, rejecting international media reports that the figure is higher. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has fired Interior Minister Rafik Belhaj Kacem, the government announced Wednesday, in the wake of the deadly protests over high unemployment and poor living conditions. Tunisian protests fueled by social media networks . Ahmad Freaa will be his replacement, Minister of Information Samir Abidi announced. Meanwhile, the government announced a curfew for the greater Tunis area from 8 p.m. Wednesday (2 p.m. ET) until 6 a.m. Thursday (midnight ET). Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi declined to answer a CNN question about whether live ammunition or snipers were used against demonstrators, saying those matters will be part of an investigation into the conduct of the security forces. Everyone arrested in the past few days has been released other than those accused of looting and vandalism, he said. Ghannouchi also announced that the government will begin providing a monthly grant and social security coverage to every unemployed person, providing they do nonprofit or volunteer work while looking for jobs. Sources with the Union of Tunisian Workers said eight people were killed Wednesday in demonstrations in the towns of Dkash and Douz in the southern part of the country. The union says more than 50 people have died since the demonstrations erupted. Lofti al Ahwal, a member of the union, said the organization is waiting for further action by the government before determining its next step. The union rejects government claims that members of al Qaeda have infiltrated the rioters, he said. Al Ahwal said violence will be met with violence, and cautioned that shooting at demonstrators will escalate the situation. The union is unable to control the angry crowds, he acknowledged, and some of the actions and statements from enraged rioters do not comply with union policy. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged the Tunisian government in a statement ""to ensure that its security forces cease using excessive force against demonstrators, and to launch transparent and credible investigations into the deaths."" While the situation escalated over the weekend, deaths were also previously reported in preceding weeks, the statement said. ""Whatever the precise total (of deaths), I am extremely concerned about the very high number of people killed in Tunisia in recent weeks,"" Pillay said. ""It is essential that basic international human rights norms and guidelines governing the use of firearms are urgently and strictly adhered to."" Reports suggest that most protests have been peaceful and that security forces used excessive force, she said in the statement. A leading human rights group, Amnesty International, condemned Friday what it called a violent crackdown by Tunisian authorities on the recent protests. The wave of demonstrations was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in early December. Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. He died January 4 from his injuries. The protests grew in size and sometimes turned violent. Human rights groups said last week at least three others have died since the protests started -- two demonstrators shot by police and another man who electrocuted himself by touching a 30,000-megawatt pole and shouting, ""No to misery! No to unemployment!"" Amnesty reported that 10 other protesters have been injured in confrontations with security forces and that lawyers have been singled out for beatings and arrest after a nationwide sit-in on December 31. If there is evidence that members of the security forces have used excessive force or conducted extra-judicial killings, they should be arrested, tried and -- if convicted -- punished, Pillay said in the statement. She also expressed concern about reports of widespread arrests, including those of human rights advocates and bloggers advocating human rights, as well as reports that those detained are being mistreated and tortured. ""While it is correct that people should be arrested if there is evidence they have committed crimes such as violence or arson, no one should be arrested or harassed for standing up for human rights,"" she said. ""Human rights defenders and bloggers, arrested solely for their peaceful activities, must be released immediately."" Tunisian authorities have said they are acting in self-defense. Security forces fired on protesters in December, the state-run TAP news agency reported at the time. Witnesses say the demonstrators consisted largely of people urging the government to improve social services. Tunisia's government called them violent troublemakers. Tunisia has been ruled for 23 years by Ben Ali, an ally of Western powers and a target of activist and human rights groups that claim he runs a corrupt police state that has infringed on citizens' rights.","NEW: A curfew is established in the greater Tunis area .

"New Orleans (CNN) -- Two people were killed and more than 50 others injured Thursday in a 40-car pileup that shut down Interstate 10 in eastern New Orleans, authorities said. Both eastbound and westbound lanes were closed following the crashes, which began about 4 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), said Garry Flot, New Orleans police spokesman. It was unknown how long the interstate would be closed, he said. Twenty-two people were transported to hospitals with minor to critical injuries. Another 37 complained of minor injuries at the scene but refused medical care, Flot said. One firefighter suffered a cut on his face while performing his duties at the scene, Flot said. He was taken to a local hospital for stitches. The area was experiencing heavy fog at the time the crashes occurred, according to CNN meteorologists.

"(CNN) -- A San Francisco Giants baseball fan severely beaten in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium has taken a monumental step in his recovery -- speaking for the first time in nearly six months. ""We are blown away with all of this,"" the family of Bryan Stow posted Wednesday on its website, support4bryanstow.com. ""Literally one day we got some facial responses and the next, he's talking. His voice is gravelly and you have to be close to hear him, but he is talking."" Stow, 42, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31 beating after a game between the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers. According to the family, when speech therapists asked Stow his first and last name, he responded. A therapist asked what his daughter's name was and Stow said, ""Tabby."" The therapist asked what that was short for and he correctly said, ""Tabitha."" Stow was also able to say the name of his son, Tyler, the family said. The critically injured man also was able to give his birth date and say he wanted to see Tabitha and Tyler. Doctors are trying to control Stow's blood clots and keep them from his lungs, his family said. ""Bryan's had many ups and downs, and though we see how far he has come, we try not to look too far back into these past 6 months, and we can't look too far down the road so we focus on right now,"" his family wrote. ""Bryan is more awake and more responsive then ever."" The men police believe were responsible for his attack -- Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29 -- pleaded not guilty last month to felony charges related to the beating. In the parking lot, two men confronted Stow and -- unprovoked -- began kicking and punching him while yelling profanities about the Giants, police have said.

"(CNN) -- After his infamous ""brain freeze"" that drew laughter and ridicule from his detractors, Texas Gov. Rick Perry poked fun at himself Thursday night while delivering the ""Top Ten"" list on CBS' ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" Perry sauntered on stage smiling, clapped his hands and saluted the crowd before rattling off the ""Top Ten Rick Perry Excuses."" Among them: . No. 6: ""You try concentrating with Mitt Romney smiling at you. That is one handsome dude!"" No. 5: ""Uh, El Nino?"" No. 4: ""I had a 5-hour Energy drink six hours before the debate."" No. 2: ""I wanted to help take the heat off my buddy Herman Cain."" No. 1: ""I just learned Justin Bieber is my father."" Perry made sure he was in control of the jokes after Wednesday's GOP debate in Rochester, Michigan, when he said he would eliminate three federal agencies if elected president -- but could name only two of them. That produced a painful period of more than 50 seconds during which Perry tried in vain to remember the third federal agency. It ended only after Perry conceded that he could not remember it -- even after appearing to consult his notes. ""Oops,"" he said. Perry has a chance to redeem himself on the debate front Saturday, when he is scheduled face off with other Republican presidential hopefuls at the CBS News-National Journal debate in South Carolina. The morning after the debacle, Perry said his ""brain freeze"" showed he is not ""the slickest politician"" among the field of Republican presidential hopefuls. His campaign, meanwhile, sought to raise funds off the gaffe, encouraging supporters to send $5 for every government agency they ""would like to forget."" Operatives from the left and the right slammed the moment as a potential sign of Perry's campaign imploding. The New York Times quoted Mark McKinnon, an aide to former President George W. Bush, as calling the moment the ""human equivalent of shuttle Challenger."" Speaking to CNN's Christine Romans on Thursday, Perry said, ""we need substance more than we need style"" and tried to turn the incident into an attack on President Barack Obama. When Romans said that the president has to be ""debater in chief,"" Perry responded, ""We've got a debater in chief right now. And you've got to ask yourself: How's that working out for America?"" His campaign sent out a note to supporters saying, ""We've all had human moments."" The note from ""Team Perry"" points out that Obama, at a campaign stop during the 2008 election, referred to having visited ""57 states."" ""Ronald Reagan got lost somewhere on the Pacific Highway in an answer to a debate question,"" the note adds. ""Gerald Ford ate a tamale without removing the husk. And tonight Rick Perry forgot the third agency he wants to eliminate. Just goes to show there are too damn many federal agencies."" In a 1984 debate against Walter Mondale, then-President Reagan delivered a closing statement that was widely viewed as rambling. He began by describing a day he had driven down the California coast. Reagan had to be cut off by the moderator. Ford, in 1976, was meeting voters in Texas when he bit into a tamale. Unaware of how to eat it, he did not first remove the husk. At Wednesday's debate, Perry was facing Texas Rep. Ron Paul when he started to answer the question. ""I will tell you, it is three agencies of government when I get there that are gone,"" Perry said. ""Commerce, Education, and the -- what's the third one there? Let's see. OK. Commerce, Education, and the ... "" ""EPA?"" Mitt Romney offered. ""EPA, there you go,"" Perry said. When pressed by moderator John Harwood if the Environmental Protection Agency was indeed the third agency he proposes shuttering, Perry admitted that it wasn't. He then attempted again to remember the details from his plan. ""The third agency of government I would -- I would do away with Education, the Commerce, and, let's see. I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops."" Several minutes later, Perry clarified that the agency he was trying to remember was the Department of Energy. Perry was already saddled with a series of lackluster debate performances and is down in the polls. On Twitter, reaction was swift. ""Perry collapses. Cannot remember a list of three federal government departments he wants to abolish past the first two. Seriously. And then he says 'oops.' He has all but disappeared inside his suit in this debate and is now basically done,"" conservative blogger Andrew Sullivan tweeted. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Roland Martin exclaimed, ""Damn, he actually forgot the third federal agency he would get rid of! That is THE MOST EMBARRASSING moment of any debate I've seen!"" Appearing in the spin room after the debate, Perry tried to make light of the gaffe. ""I'm sure glad I had my boots on,"" he said, ""because I sure stepped in it out there.""

"(CNN) -- Officials with the Iowa Lottery are seeking the winner of a $10.75 million Hot Lotto jackpot who has until 4 p.m. Thursday to claim it. ""Someone legitimately won this money and we want them to take it home,"" lottery CEO Terry Rich said in a news release. ""But you must present the winning ticket to the lottery in order to claim the prize."" The ticket, which was bought December 29, 2010, at a QuikTrip in Des Moines, must be redeemed by 4 p.m. Thursday. The ticket matched all six numbers: 3-12-16-26-33 and Hot Ball 11. Few financial advisers would consider the $1 spent on the ticket to have been a wise investment. The buyer overcame 1 in 10.9 million odds to win, said Mary Neubauer, a spokeswoman for the state lottery. If the ticket is redeemed, the winner would owe 25% in federal taxes and 5% in state taxes, she said. But the possibility of taxes and the absence of a ticket haven't deterred the hopeful from lining up -- just in case. ""We've been getting calls from the public all day long today,"" Neubauer said Wednesday night. ""The closer that the deadline gets, the more people seem to be calling."" Huge-money ticket in Georgia goes unclaimed . Some of the calls are from people who say they may have lost the ticket, or put it through a washing machine, she said. They are walked through a series of questions to determine whether they may indeed be the winner. So far, no luck. Other calls, she said, are from people who believe in the power of their own creativity. Once told they could not have been the winner, they call back again -- and again, each time with a different story, she said. ""That's why we keep emphasizing that it comes down to -- you have to have the winning ticket,"" she said. If the prize goes unclaimed, the money would return to the 15 lotteries that offer the game -- in proportion to the percentage of sales that came from each state. ""Iowa would get back about $1.3 million if this prize were to go unclaimed,"" Rich said. States differ on how they would use the money. In Iowa, the money would go into the prize pools for future games. Though a $77 million jackpot went unclaimed this week in Georgia, such cases are exceedingly rare, said Neubauer.","$10.75 million jackpot is set to expire at 4 p.m. Thursday if no one claims it .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- The lone survivor of a deadly home invasion wrapped up his testimony Tuesday afternoon after taking the stand against the second man charged with brutally killing his wife and two daughters. With relatives packed shoulder to shoulder in the two rows closest to the jury, Dr. William Petit testified in detail about the tragic events at his Cheshire, Connecticut, home on July 23, 2007, beginning with him being awakened by being hit by a bat. After his hands and feet were tied and a cloth was thrown over his head, he said, he heard a voice say, ""If he moves, shoot him."" Some of the evidence presented in court Tuesday included a handgun and photos of the rope used to bind Petit. The jury also saw pictures of his bloody head injuries. Petit told the court that while he was tied to a pole in the basement, he could hear ""loud thuds"" and ""moaning,"" likely from his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Shortly before hearing his wife, Petit was told by one of the intruders, ""Don't worry. It'll all be over in a few minutes."" Petit said that's when he knew ""I had to get out."" Petit managed to escape but could not summon help in time to save his family. He described his eldest daughter, Hayley, as captain of her varsity basketball team, a crew participant and soccer player, and Dartmouth-bound. His younger daughter, Michaela, was a piano player, a flute player, into sports and a member of a Brownies troop, he said. Joshua Komisarjevsky, 31, faces 17 charges in connection with the brutal home invasion. The first defendant to stand trial in the case, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in December after being convicted on 16 of the 17 charges filed against him. Testimony in the trial began Monday, with witnesses describing the final moments of Petit's wife and daughters inside their burning home and the futile attempts to save them. Prosecutors declined to give an opening statement to start the trial. But they did introduce tapes from two 911 calls, a bank teller who claimed the mother tried to withdraw $15,000 as ransom and a police officer who found Petit fighting for life outside his family's burning home. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. William Petit managed to escape. Entering the New Haven court on Monday, the first day of the trial, Petit succinctly told reporters, ""I just hope justice is served."" Several other members of the victims' family packed the courtroom, many of them wearing pins that Judge Jon C. Blue allowed over defense lawyers' objections that they might sway the jury. While he didn't present a comprehensive statement, New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington briefly spoke to jurors Monday, explaining that prosecutors believe the jury will be able to listen to the evidence and render a decision. As allowed by law, Dearington said, Komisarjevsky is charged both as a principal and an accessory. Komisarjevsky's defense attorney, Walter Bansley, told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone, that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal. Bansley said Komisarjevsky did not have a weapon. He told jurors that in order to convict Komisarjevsky of capital murder, they must determine he intended to kill someone. It was Hayes, Bansley said, who raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, poured gasoline in the house and lit a match. Komisarjevsky was a willing participant in the break-in and theft but not the murders, according to Bansley, who recounted mounting dissension between Hayes and Komisarjevsky as the home invasion progressed that morning. Hayes felt that the Petits needed to be killed, Bansley claimed, but Komisarjevsky refused to kill anyone. Bansley did allude to a ""confession"" that Komisarjevsky had later made in the incident. It was not entered into testimony Monday. During Hayes' trial, a court clerk read from a 40-page letter Komisarjevsky wrote to author Brian McDonald in 2008 in which he described the incident. ""All were compliant,"" he wrote. ""This time I took a risk, pulled the trigger, and the chamber was loaded. ... The Petit family passed through their fears and into terror. ""... It was captivating, validating that this pain in me was real. ... I was looking right at my personal demon, reflected back in their eyes. ... Hayley is a fighter; she tried time and time again to free herself. ... Mr. Petit is a coward; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened, and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen. ... I was cheated of my retribution, and so was Steve. ... I am what I am; I make no excuses. ... I'm a criminal with a criminal mind."" The reading continued, ""Michaela, Hayley, and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... I can't believe I lost control; I hate myself/I love myself. ... I stand condemned."" After the defense lawyers presented their opening statements Monday, the prosecution began to present evidence and call witnesses, starting with the same five people, in the same order, as in Hayes' trial. The first person on the stand Monday was Mona Huggard, a registered nurse at Petit's medical practice who said Hawke-Petit had called in to say her husband was sick -- only the second time, in her recollection, that he'd ever done so. Then Kristin Makhzangi testified how Hawke-Petit came to her bank window to withdraw $15,000. Video showed the transaction, which spurred a 911 call from the Bank of America branch's manager, Mary Lyons, warning that that the family might be in trouble. Lyons described Hawke-Petit as ""terrified."" About an hour after the visit, authorities say, she was dead. Another 911 call came from the Petits' next-door neighbor David Simcik, who testified spotting William Petit ""all banged up"" and asking him to call police. The day ended with Cheshire Police Office Thomas Wright taking the stand to explain how he'd arrived to find Petit bloodied on his neighbor's driveway. By the time he tried, unsuccessfully, to enter the door of the home, Hayes and Komisarjevsky had left and ""everything was burning,"" Wright said. Authorities threw rocks at windows and doused flames with a nearby hose. But once they finally got in, ""We saw no signs of life,"" he said.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Cameron Douglas, who is serving a five- year federal prison sentence for drug dealing, pleaded guilty Thursday to possessing drugs in his jail cell. For the latest charges, the son of actor Michael Douglas faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, plus a $250,000 fine. Douglas, 32, is charged with possessing items that tested positive for cocaine and heroin, which were found in his cell by an investigator. Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Anderson told the court one of the substances tested positive for methadone, which he described as ""something that people take when they're coming off a heroin addiction in order to facilitate the withdrawal,"" according to a court transcript. The charges state that Douglas obtained the narcotics both at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, as well as after he was transferred to a minimum-security jail in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania In court Thursday, he admitted struggling with addictions to heroin, cocaine and alcohol. ""God knows I am sorry,"" records show he told the judge. Michael Douglas said in a statement: ""Cameron accepts full responsibility for his conduct, which involved a small user-quantity of drugs. While he has made much progress, he is still not cured. Most people and their families are able to address this illness privately and outside of the spotlight. Unfortunately this has not been possible here, for reasons completely outside of his control. He thanks those that have rooted for his recovery and looks forward to the day when he will not disappoint."" Douglas is scheduled to be sentenced December 21.

"(CNN) -- There's great potential in the field of regenerative medicine, but doctors caution against seeking experimental treatments in an unregulated environment. Having had three surgeries for a neck injury already, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning reportedly took a private jet to Europe to get a stem cell treatment that is not approved in the United States. The therapy involved injecting fat cells from Manning's body into his neck, according to Fox Sports. Colts head coach Jim Caldwell declined to discuss Manning's health situation when asked about the stem cell treatment at a press conference Monday. Further details of Manning's treatment are not available. Discussing the choice to go abroad for stem cell treatments puts researchers in an awkward position, because the therapies offered abroad are unregulated and not confirmed to work, but they are based on concepts that the American medical community believes have potential. Generally, however, the consensus is that patients should not try to seek experimental stem cell treatments elsewhere, as there's no telling if they will work or have serious side effects. ""We believe that there is merit to this approach, we just want to see it (carried out) well, ethically and rigorously,"" said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. Scientists like Hare are trying to gather medical evidence through clinical trials to ensure that these treatments are safe and effective. Leaving the country to seek experimental treatments abroad is common, experts say, although no one has exact numbers for how many people seek stem cell treatments in other countries. Medical tourism as an industry is projected to grow 35% annually, and could reach 1.6 million American patients going elsewhere for treatments by 2012, according to the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions. (The agency had previously predicted 6 million by 2010, but those numbers have not panned out.) Besides orthopedic injuries like Manning's, there are stem cell therapies available elsewhere aimed at heart disease and neurological conditions, even autism. Germany, Panama and Thailand are all popular countries for seeking these kinds of treatments, Hare said. The basic idea is that stem cells have regenerative potential, and can even form new tissues. Mesenchymal stem cells are a particular kind that can become a variety of cell types, including bone cells and cartilage cells. While there is a lot of exciting research going on in the field of stem cells, the results aren't all good. A 2009 study in the journal PLoS Medicine documented the case of an Israeli boy who had gone to Russia to get fetal stem cells injected into his brain and spinal cord. He developed a brain tumor, apparently as a result of the treatment, although the tumor was slow-growing and benign. And earlier this year, authorities closed down a large stem cell clinic in Germany called the XCell-Center, which had operated through a loophole in the country's regulations regarding unapproved experimental treatments. The clinic had been implicated in the death of an 18-month-old boy after a stem cell treatment; a 10-year-old almost died after receiving something similar. One problem with going abroad for these unapproved treatments is that there's no follow-up; you won't have anyone back home to take care of any complications that might result, Hare said. In cardiac stem cell trials conducted in this country in people with advanced heart disease, medical professionals do follow up with patients and treat any complications that may arise. Another concern is that, without proper regulation, any given stem cell therapy abroad may actually be different every time you receive a treatment, said Jeffrey Karp, director of the Laboratory for Advanced Biomaterials and Stem-Cell-Based Therapeutics at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There also may not be any regulations on the quality of the treatment, so you really don't know what you're getting, he said. ""Regulatory agencies such as the FDA can ensure that cell therapy that reaches patients is safe, effective, and that quality control is established for isolating the cells, manipulating them outside of the body, and delivering them,"" Karp said. A lot of parents believe that stem cell therapies could help their children with autism, although there haven't been any clinical trials in the U.S. to substantiate this, Hare said. In orthopedics and cardiology, on the other hand, there are ongoing investigations; someone like Manning could have potentially joined a clinical trial instead of going abroad, although there's no guarantee that he would have received the treatment rather than a placebo. The idea of placebo also comes into play here, as with any therapy -- sometimes, just believing strongly that a treatment will heal you actually does change your body, even if that ""treatment"" isn't actually doing anything. But there are still significant risks from anything that's unregulated, Karp said. ""While stem cell treatments have been shown to have significant placebo effects during controlled clinical trials, I think patients considering unregulated stem cell treatments need to be aware that they are not optimized and may even do harm,"" he said.","Colts quarterback Peyton Manning reportedly sought a stem cell therapy in Europe .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- For nearly three years, the hit TLC show ""Toddlers & Tiaras"" has captured the drama behind the scenes in the world of child beauty pageants. The tantrums were extreme, and the pre-show prep of spray tanning and eyebrow waxing seemed perhaps premature for little kids. But in the last few weeks, as footage of 3- and 4-year-olds dressed in overly adult costumes (like Dolly Parton, complete with padded breasts, or Julia Roberts's streetwalker from ""Pretty Woman"") hit the airwaves, viewers and pageant skeptics have been expressing horror at an industry that is now accused of ""sexualizing"" young girls. ""Little girls are supposed to play with dolls, not be dolls,"" New York-based licensed clinical social worker Mark Sichel tells PEOPLE in its new issue. He adds that the extremes parents go to in order to prepare their children for competition -- using padding, fake hair, flippers (faux teeth) and spray tans -- ""causes the children tremendous confusion, wondering why they are not okay without those things."" Now devoted pageant moms are speaking out in their own defense. Wendy Dickey, who dressed her daughter Paisley, 3, as Julia Roberts, tells PEOPLE the look was ""tasteful and funny."" Still, ""If I knew there would be a reaction like this, I never would have used it,"" Dickey says. ""Next time, she'll be dressed as an angel.""

"(CNN) -- Owners of iPads and other tablet devices tend to be news junkies who are wealthier and more highly educated than than the general population, according to a new report. The Pew Project on Excellence in Journalism took an in-depth look at how people use tablets to get news. When the study was conducted in July, Apple's iPad made up the vast majority of tablet computers in use in the U.S., although Pew researchers also looked at people who used similar devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab, the Motorola Xoom and even the Nook Color. The project noted several differences between tablet users and the general U.S. population. First, tablet users tend to be more highly educated: Fifty-one percent have a college degree, compared with 28% of all Americans. Tablet users also tend to be richer: Fifth-three percent have an annual household income greater than $75,000, compared with 28% of the total U.S. population. (Conversely, 15% of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $30,000, while over a third of American households earn that much or less each year.) Most tablet users have jobs: Sixty-two percent are employed full time, compared with 41% of the total population. Along other demographic lines, tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender, race and political ideology. But age indicates some differences: Nearly half (46%) of tablet users are age 30-49, while just 35% of Americans are in that age bracket. Also, only 7% of tablet owners are age 65 or older, while 17% of Americans are seniors. This part of the population is growing fast as baby boomers age. Tablet users do seem to be hungry for news. The project notes: ""About half (53%) get news on their tablet every day, and they read long articles as well as get headlines."" Many news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets. The project found that about two-thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets, but that's not where they get most of their news, even on the tablet. ""The browser, carried over from the desktop experience, is still the more popular means of consuming news,"" said the report. ""A plurality of tablet news users (40%) say they get their news mainly through a Web browser. Another 31% use news apps and the browser equally, while fewer, 21%, get their news primarily through apps."" Of course, the tablet market is shifting fast. Right now, many smaller, cheaper tablets (mostly marketed as e-readers, even though they really are tablets) are hitting the U.S. market just in time for the holiday buying season. Amy Mitchell, deputy director of the Pew Project on Excellence in Journalism, says the study did take users of the Nook Color and similar modified tablets into account. It found that respondents used those devices to do much more than read books. ""I certainly think that as newer tablet devices like the Kindle Fire come into the marketplace at a lower cost, that it opens the possibility of bringing in different kinds of people to the tablet population, especially people who are younger or not in the upper income bracket,"" she said. The project also plans to do followup research on how tablet devices are shaping how Americans get news. ""I think whether it's called a tablet or some other name over the next couple of years, what matters is the kind of difference these devices make to the user experience,"" Mitchell said. ""People are using tablets to do different things with news than they did before."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","A new Pew study explores how people use tablets to get news .

"(CNN) -- In his first inaugural address in 1953, newly elected President Dwight D. Eisenhower told the American people, ""History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose."" This was a fitting and powerful response to the popular noninterventionism current of the 1950s from a five-star general who knew how to win a war. The first and most important job of the president is to be commander in chief. Eisenhower knew that, as so did many of our great presidents. Today, we are in danger of losing that founding virtue. President Obama's decision to order a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year will most likely lead to disaster. He greatly risks losing a country in which we have invested so much time, resources and, most importantly, human life. And he risks losing it to Iran, the world's largest sponsor of terrorism and our primary enemy in a serious Middle East proxy war. ""The long war in Iraq will come to an end by the end of this year,"" Obama said Friday. It may come to an end for our troops, but it is far from over for the people of Iraq. Only very few of the loudest opponents of the Iraq war advocated complete withdrawal. The U.S. military commanders recommended at least 15,000 troops remain. Obama once again ignored his generals, as he did with Afghanistan, and instead pressed ahead with a politically calculated decision. Another view: ""Who lost Iraq"" is the wrong question . Perhaps this will gain him praise from the far left of his base, but this will not sit well with a vast majority of the American people. More than 4,000 Americans have died in the Iraq war. The American people have been impatient with the war, but they know we were successful in Iraq. To throw this all away for political expediency is irresponsible. To be tired is one thing, to be irresolute is another. The frequent refrain of Osama bin Laden was that he could always wait us out and that we would eventually show ourselves to be the weak horse, not the strong horse. And, God forbid, if we lose Iraq, it will be on the shoulders of the commander in chief. Under Obama's plan, a mere 160 U.S. troops would stay in Iraq to guard the U.S. Embassy. That is hardly enough troops to defend our own people. For comparison, the United States has 1,234 troops in Belgium, 1,894 troops in Bahrain and 678 troops in Qatar, according to the Department of Defense's active-duty military personnel records. We risk another Saigon moment by evacuating Iraq and leaving no support behind. On my radio show, ""Morning In America,"" Michael Rubin, who is the American Enterprise Institute's Middle East expert and teaches our troops at the Naval Postgraduate School, said with no qualifications that he thinks we will lose Iraq because of this. Dan Senor, senior adviser and the chief spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq in 2003-2004, told me that the president's decision shocked and perplexed him. Iraq cannot survive sectarian violence and Iranian influence on its own, he added. Baghdad will surely move closer to Tehran in our absence. Indeed, one can already see the influence of Tehran. Two weeks ago, Iraq publicly defended the actions of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an early and telling sign that Iraq was preparing for the withdrawal of American forces. The Iranians want influence in Iraq; Obama wants out of Iraq. The president defends his actions on the basis of his campaign pledge to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq and former President George W. Bush's withdrawal timeline of 2011. However, just until last week, the Obama administration was negotiating the Status of Forces Agreement with Nuri al-Maliki's government with the understanding that several thousand troops would remain in Iraq -- a clear break from his campaign pledge. More importantly, total troop withdrawal was never a platform of Bush's withdrawal timetable. We know that Tehran is celebrating the president's announcement. Just weeks after spoiling an Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., the United States will withdraw from its strongest post from which to engage Iran. We have given them an open road to Baghdad and unfettered weapons supply lines to Syria and Lebanon. By ceding Iran the high ground, the Obama administration has also undercut American and Israeli efforts to shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program. In spite of all this, Obama will spend his re-election campaign trotting out his foreign policy accomplishments. He deserves credit where it is due. Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki and Moammar Gadhafi are dead. But should we see the loss of Iraq and the rise of Iran, all this will be for naught.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A series of bomb and gun attacks targeting police stations, mosques and churches left 65 people dead in northeastern Nigeria, the Red Cross said Saturday. Attackers also left scores injured -- probably more than 100 -- in a three-hour rampage in the Yobe state city of Damaturu, according to Ibrahim Bulama of the Red Cross. Sixty-three people died. ""It is a very bad scene,"" he said. Gunmen first attacked the police headquarters and the anti-terror office before moving to churches and mosques, he said. Most of the casualties were police officers. In Potiskum, also located in Yobe state, gunmen attacked a book shop near the police station, killing two and injuring 5, the Red Cross said. The Friday attacks came the same day suicide bombers suspected to belong to a militant Islamist group targeted a military base in nearby Maiduguri. Three suicide bombers drove a stolen black SUV toward a Joint Task Force headquarters, but could not get through the gate, military spokesman Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed said. The blast damaged roofs and walls of the base. Mohammed said two other simultaneous explosions took place at other military facilities. An unspecified number of Nigerian soldiers suffered injuries. Saturday evening, a suicide bomber launched another attack in Maiduguri, Mohammed said. No casualties were reported except for the bomber. He blamed the militant group Boko Haram for the attacks. Loosely translated, the group's name means ""Western education is sinful."" It wants to establish a state based on Sharia, or Islamic law, in northern Nigeria.

"(CNN) -- An attorney for Florida A&M University's longtime band director, Julian E. White, said his client has demonstrated ""exemplary"" anti-hazing leadership and should not be dismissed following the death of a drum major. In a letter Friday to FAMU President James H. Ammons, attorney Charles E. ""Chuck"" Hobbs III said White's reports and suspensions related to hazing have not always been met with suspensions from the university or action by law enforcement. Ammons moved Wednesday to fire White, who had led the 420-member band since 1998. ""The reason for this intended employment action is based upon your alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100,'"" Ammons said in a letter to White. The dismissal came four days after the death. Band members had returned to their Orlando hotel following a game last Saturday. There, Robert Champion, 26, ""reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe,"" the sheriff's office said in a release. Champion was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Ammons' letter notified White that he was being dismissed effective December 22 and placed on administrative leave, with pay, effective immediately. The letter was provided to CNN by the university. Hobbs' letter said White has had many honors while holding his ""dream position."" ""Dr. White has been at the vanguard of implementing measures to eliminate hazing within the Marching 100 over the past 22 years,"" it read. ""From an administrative standpoint .... hazing within the Marching 100 has often been met with reckless indifference by White's superior officers, who often ignored his requests for assistance or who privately lauded his decisions to suspend members from the band for hazing while failing to ensure that hazers were either charged with applicable criminal offenses or expelled."" Opinion: What I learned from the FAMU marching band . In addition, Hobbs wrote, White is a fully tenured professor entitled to due process. He argued there are no grounds for White being dismissed for ""just cause."" On Wednesday, Gov. Rick Scott sent a letter to Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey asking the department to join the investigation ""to assure that the circumstances leading to Mr. Champion's death become fully known, and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death, they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable."" Authorities have not said what happened to Champion. A spokeswoman for the Orange County Medical Examiner's Office said Wednesday that the autopsy had not been completed and that no cause of death was available. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. After the incident, Ammons suspended band performances and said he will convene a task force ""to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100."" Ammons acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City stunned city rivals Manchester United 6-1 at Old Trafford Sunday with Mario Balotelli scoring the opening two goals in the rout. It was the heaviest home defeat for reigning champions United in the English Premier League and left them five points adrift of City at the top of the table. Balotelli fired City ahead after 22 minutes and was then involved in the game's pivotal moment two minutes into the second half. The 21-year-old Italian's strength took him clear of United defender Jonny Evans, who could only pull him back as he closed on goal. Referee Mark Clattenburg was left with no option than to show Evans the red card and the floodgates opened. Balotelli, forced to move out of his Manchester home on Saturday after a late night prank with fireworks went wrong, was on hand to slot home after brilliant work by David Silva and James Milner. When Sergio Aguero added the third on the hour mark, the game was up for Alex Ferguson's home team, but they did pull back a goal after a sublime strike by Darren Fletcher. But that was the signal for City to really rub in their dominance as substitute Edin Dzeko grabbed a fourth in the 90th minute. With United in total disarray, Silva tapped in from close range and Dzeko added his second and the sixth in injury time. City manager Roberto Mancini hailed the result as proof of the strength of their title challenge. ""I'm satisfied because we beat United away and I don't think there are a lot of teams that could win here,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I think this game is important because we beat them at Old Trafford but not for the 6-1."" By contrast, Ferguson was annoyed with his players for conceding late goals when down to 10 men and with the game gone. ""It was our worst ever day,"" he conceded ""It's the worst result in my history, ever. Even as a player I don't think I ever lost 6-1. I can't believe the scoreline. The first goal was a blow for sure but it was retrievable at 1-0. ""The sending off was a killer for us. We kept attacking when we went 4-1 down and we should have just said, 'We've had our day'."" Chelsea later fluffed the chance to move above United into second place when they were beaten 1-0 by west London rivals Queens Park Rangers. Chelsea were reduced to nine-men after first half red cards for Jose Bosingwa and Didier Drogba. Heidar Helguson had put QPR ahead from the spot after being fouled by David Luiz before referee Chris Foy sent off Boswinga for pulling back Shaun Wright-Phillips and Drogba for a studs-up challenge. Chelsea had their chances to level with Nicolas Anelka wasting the best, but QPR held on to gain three valuable points. Earlier Sunday,  Arsenal captain Robin van Persie came off the substitute's bench to help his side to a 3-1 home win over Stoke City. Peter Crouch had leveled for Stoke following Gervinho's opener, but Dutch ace van Persie continued his fine scoring run with a double to lift Arsenal up to seventh. Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur also took closer order in the battle for Champions League spots with a 2-1 win at struggling Blackburn. Two goals by Rafael van der Vaart secured the Spurs victory, their fifth of the season, while at Craven Cottage, Everton scored twice in injury time to clinch a 3-1 victory over Fulham.","Manchester City beat Manchester United 6-1 in derby clash at Old Trafford .

"(CNN) -- ""I may have spoken too soon,"" Bob Orsa said the other afternoon, with a sardonic laugh that didn't carry much mirth. He and I had first met exactly three years ago -- on September 18, 2008, toward the end of that frightening week when the American economy seemed to be on the verge of disintegrating. Lehman Brothers had collapsed, Merrill Lynch had been taken over by Bank of America, the stock market had plummeted, and the ""too-big-to-fail"" theory that would lead to the bailout of the major banks was forming. Things were a mess. Not that Bob Orsa was a player in those Wall Street and Washington machinations. He was a small businessman in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, a borough of about 18,000 people. Or -- more accurately -- he was about to become a small businessman in Chambersburg. In what would be described as the worst U.S. economic climate since the Great Depression, Orsa was getting ready to open the doors of a new restaurant on the town square. I'd been in Chambersburg interviewing longtime merchants about what rough financial times meant for them. And it was the new guy on the town square -- Bob Orsa -- who sounded, in the face of everything, optimistic. ""Some time to open a new business, right?"" he'd said as we had stood outside the restaurant looking at the old county courthouse across the way, as carpenters inside his building readied it for opening day. ""But I feel good."" Of the national economy, he'd said: ""It'll all come back. History shows us that, doesn't it? It always comes back."" I'd been thinking about him in recent days -- wondering how his restaurant had ended up doing, and whether he is as upbeat as he had seemed three years ago. I wanted to talk with him not because he is an expert in the intricacies of global finance, but precisely because he is not. He and small businesspeople like him are on the receiving end of the Wall Street decisions and convulsions that can lead to times as brutal as the ones the country has been dealing with. I just wanted to find out what was going on at his place on the Chambersburg town square. ""I never thought the bad economy would be lasting this long,"" he said. The restaurant he opened is called Cafe D'Italia. It's not a big establishment: 36 seats, 11 tables, open for lunch and dinner. ""I had thought it would take us two years to become solid and feel that we'd made it,"" he said. ""Now I'm thinking it will take four years or more. People aren't eating out at restaurants as much as they would be in good times, because it's a way they can cut back on their expenses."" He said he doesn't have to follow the stock market on a minute-to-minute basis to know how money worries and layoffs are affecting his customers. ""The first thing you notice is that people will come in less frequently -- they'll still be loyal and come, but not as often as they might. This is a small town, and I know my customers. I know when I don't see them. ""Going out to a restaurant is a luxury that can be scratched off. I'll see it in the individual dinner orders. A couple who would usually order two main dishes might order one and ask to split it. They'll skip the salad. Maybe they'll skip the dessert. I don't blame them -- it's a way to save a little more money."" He finds himself in the same position as his guests: ""People are pinching pennies out of necessity, and I am, too. I have 13 people working for me -- cooks, servers, hostesses, utility people. Ideally, I should have 17. But to warrant new hiring, I've got to have the right amount of business coming in, and I don't. ""I just spent $18,000 to put in a walk-in refrigerator/freezer. That's a huge chunk of change for a small operation like mine. I waited 2 1/2 years to take that plunge. ""Would I love to have another chef on staff? Absolutely.

Orsa is 56 and has been in the restaurant business for 30 years, he says, ""and I'd be the first to know if I thought my quality was down, or the service was not what it should be. That's not it. Even in good times, if you have a good product, a good location, good service, making a business a success requires good luck, too. No one guarantees that you're going to make it. ""But in this economy, with this kind of joblessness, making a go of a small business becomes even more of a challenge."" He feels a little cynical about the too-big-to-fail mantra that bailed out the major banks. ""There's no 'too small to fail' for businesses like ours. No one's going to save us if we can't make it."" He said that since opening he has always met his payroll and always paid his vendors, but that with revenues about 20 to 25 percent less than what he would like them to be, ""there have been more than a few weeks when I haven't been able to pay the last person who gets paid: me."" When things are tough, he doesn't have to ask his customers to explain, because ""I can see it. You know how people look when it's been raining for two straight weeks -- tense, a little down? That's the look, even when the sun is out."" Yet the high hopes he had for his business when he and I met three years ago are still there, and so is the pride in what he -- like so many small business people across the country in this economy -- is trying to do: . ""Just being proud of what you've built. Being a part of the life of the town. I like it that I have afforded 13 people a living for almost three years now. Winter's coming, and sales tend to go down in the winter, at the same time the energy costs for heating this place go up. But that's all right. We've got a business right here in the center of town, and it wasn't here before we built it, and we're going to make it.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Tripoli on Tuesday, making her the first Cabinet-level American official to go to Libya since the ouster of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi. She landed under tight security in a country where forces loyal to the transitional government are still battling Gadhafi loyalists. She met with officials of the National Transitional Council and visited those wounded in the fighting. NTC fighters toppled Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-old government in August after six months of battles. Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law and intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Sanussi, are wanted on war crimes charges and remain fugitives. Regarding Moammar Gadhafi, Clinton told reporters: ""We hope he will be captured or killed soon."" As Clinton boarded the military plane to leave for Malta on Tuesday evening, she saw several Libyan fighters, who gave her a warm welcome. After a short meet-and-greet at the airport with Malta Embassy employees, Clinton was headed for Oman. At a news conference Tuesday with Clinton, interim Libyan Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril expressed appreciation for political, humanitarian and moral support from the United States. He said he does not plan to be part of Libya's new government. Asked if she was concerned about civil war continuing in Libya, Clinton said she is encouraged that steps are being taken to address reconciliation and get the Libyan army and police under one command, but noted that action cannot be taken with fighting still under way. On whether the United States will cooperate with Islamists, Clinton said democracy must reflect the aspirations of the Libyan people. America will support a democratic process that respects the rule of law, she said, and includes renouncing violence and giving up arms. Women in Libya should have equal rights, she said, as they sacrificed in the revolution and deserve to be part of the new Libya. Clinton then attended a town hall meeting, telling residents: ""Don't spend your time settling scores of the past. Keep an eye on the future. ... You can't drive forward when looking in the rearview mirror."" She also visited a hospital and met wounded fighters, many of whom need surgeries to save their limbs. The operations are being held up by red tape and processing necessary to get out of the country for transport. She said she will try to help them. ""There are three main purposes to the secretary's visit,"" a senior State Department official said in a briefing to reporters Monday before Clinton's arrival. ""First is simply to offer on behalf for the United States, on behalf of the American people and government, our congratulations, our best wishes to the Libyan people for what, through great hardship, sacrifice and courage, they have achieved in opening the door to a more promising future for Libya after 42 years of the Gadhafi dictatorship."" The official said Clinton and her counterpart were to announce the restarting of the Fulbright Program, an educational exchange, and English Access, an English-language program. They were to talk about a new program with Oberlin College in Ohio and archaeologists in Libya to map, document and do risk assessments of archaeological sites in eastern Libya. ""We also want to be talking to the Libyans about how to integrate Libya fully into the 21st-century world economy in transparent ways where Libya's oil wealth is used for the benefit of all of Libya's citizens,"" the official said. In discussing economic diversification, the official mentioned ""privatizing some of the state monopolies, because much of the economy is state-owned."" ""The NTC sees privatization as being one of the engines to diversification and growth. Now many of these decisions have to wait a more permanent governing structure. The NTC is being very careful about not taking significant decisions on dismantling this or dismantling that until they are able to assure themselves of a more popular base. They've very mindful of the fact that that T in NTC stands for transition."" The official said conventional and nonconventional weaponry in Libya is fully secured and accounted for. Clinton intended to ""talk to Libyan officials about the fact that we will be increasing our assistance on the MANPADS destruction to nearly $40 million ...,"" the official said, referring to man-portable air-defense systems, which are shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles. Asked about reconciliation, the official said the NTC has remarked that it would work with people who don't have ""blood on their hands"" and try to be inclusive. ""It has to be able to show that it has political credibility, that it's able to also have places for those who actually fought for the liberation of Libya in the governing structures,"" the official said. Gadhafi's whereabouts are unknown, and the official acknowledged the existence of pro-Gadhafi enclaves. ""He has people, henchman, loyalists, sons, here and there who still have circles around them. I don't think there's any coordination going on between them. I think you're having pockets of people who are trying to stop the flow of history ahead,"" the official said. ""Yes, he's a nuisance. Yes, he's still providing problems here and there. But the Libyans are not waiting to build a better future for themselves, for their children, for their country."" Clinton also said she was pleased to see an end to the ordeal of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held captive by Palestinian militants for more than five years. Shalit was released Tuesday as part of a prisoner swap between Israel and the Palestinians. Shalit was held far too long in captivity, Clinton said. CNN's Elise Labott is the news media pool producer for Clinton's trip.","NEW: Hillary Clinton heads to Oman after brief stopover in Malta .

"(EW.com) -- There are two ways for pop stars to make a Survivor Album: either power-sing through your problems like Christina Aguilera, or make like Rihanna and dance till you forget what you're supposed to be getting over. On her first release since checking out of rehab, Demi Lovato wants to have it both ways. She's front-loaded ""Unbroken"" with leave-no-synth-effect-behind R&B (''You're My Only Shorty,'' featuring Iyaz), shy love-in-this-club tracks (''Who's That Boy''), and Timbaland bangers (''All Night Long,'' with Missy Elliott). So it's a little unnerving when she gets to the album's second half -- the part where, as she told Ryan Seacrest, ''I'm singing about some issues that I've never even spoken about before.'' Having struggled with cutting since she was a preteen, Lovato admits, ''I ended up with wounds to bind ... and I just ran out of Band-Aids'' on the hugely affecting ballad ''Fix a Heart.'' Demi Lovato covers Lil Wayne's 'How to Love' in NYC: Watch it here . The piano confessional ''For the Love of a Daughter'' finds her picturing herself at age 4, begging her dad to ''put the bottle down'' and keep his ''selfish hands'' to himself. And then there's ''Skyscraper,'' an anthem so honest you can hear her voice breaking. Taylor Swift teams with Hayley Williams in Nashville for 'That's What You Get' Clearly it's been a tough year for Lovato. But as Rihanna could tell her, sometimes bad years make great songs. B+ .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A nun has died after setting herself on fire in southwestern China, the first Tibetan woman known to have killed herself in this way, the London-based Free Tibet campaign group said Tuesday. According to the group, Tenzin Wangmo, 20, called for religious freedom in Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama as she set fire to herself outside Dechen Chokorling Nunnery in Ngaba County, Sichuan Province on Monday. She died at the scene. The State Administration for Religious Affairs in Beijing told CNN they were not aware of the incident. Free Tibet, which advocates Tibetan independence, also reported that two Tibetans were shot and wounded on Sunday by security forces during a protest outside a police station in the prefecture of Ganzi. Tenzin is the ninth Tibetan -- all monks or former monks -- to commit self-immolation in protest against Chinese rule since March, the advocacy group said. Five have died. The last attempt took place on Saturday when a 19-year-old former monk from Kirti monastery in Aba, another ethnic Tibetan area in Sichuan province, set himself alight in the central market in Ngaba Town but survived. His whereabouts are unknown, according to Free Tibet. Activists say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under Beijing's control. ""Most Tibetans live in fear because of suppressive and unfair government policies but they dare not speak up,"" prominent Tibetan writer and activist Tsering Woeser told CNN. ""Tibetan Buddhists can't use violence to protest, therefore they can only do violence to themselves, such as self-immolation, to make people pay attention to their situation. ""This is not suicide, this is sacrifice in order to draw the world's attention."" Another incident in Aba in March, in which a monk died, sparked weeks of often violent confrontation between local monks and authorities. Security forces locked down the Kirti Monastery and eventually detained more than 300 monks, rights groups said at the time. When the United Nations working group on enforced disappearances expressed its concern to Beijing, Chinese officials called the organization's perspective ""biased and unfair."" ""The relevant local authorities are conducting legal education for the Kirti Monastery monks to maintain religious order there -- there was no question of forced disappearances,"" Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said in June. China also rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying its rule has greatly improved living standards for the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama's representative signed an agreement with Beijing in 1951 to affirm China's sovereignty over Tibet but also grant autonomy to the area. A failed uprising against Beijing's rule in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama into exile. The Dalai Lama denies seeking independence for Tibet, saying he wants genuine autonomy, under which Tibetans can make their own policies on key issues, such as religious practices. In a 2008 uprising, violent unrest in Tibet and the subsequent military crackdown left at least 18 dead, and activists say tensions have remained high in many areas since then. CNN's Xiaoni Chen contributed to this report.","Group: Tenzin Wangmo called for religious freedom in Tibet before setting herself alight .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer have put Spain on the brink of reaching the Davis Cup final after winning their opening two singles rubbers against France in convincing fashion. With the red clay of Cordoba suiting the Spanish duo perfectly, world number two Nadal -- showing no ill effects from losing the final of the U.S. Open to Novak Djokovic earlier this week -- set the ball rolling with a crushing 6-3 6-0 6-1 success over Richard Gasquet. And Ferrer doubled Spain's advantage, brushing aside Gilles Simon 6-1 6-4 6-1, to leave the four-times champions needing just a win in Saturday's doubles rubber to reach the final. The New Musketeers: France's fantastic four bid for Davis Cup glory . Despite searing heat, Nadal never allowed Gasquet time to get into their match, with the 10-time grand slam winner telling reporters he was delighted with his performance, considering he felt tired. ""That worked out well, I managed to play with a cool head and do what I had to do throughout without losing concentration for a minute,"" said Nadal. ""There were moments where he helped me in making mistakes, not forcing me to play long points. My service was working well and that made me feel much more comfortable,"" added the Spanish No.1. A despondent Gasquet added: ""Even a tired Nadal remains an exceptional player. I couldn't find a way past him. It's a defeat that really hurts."" Spain are attempting to reach the final for the third time in four years, and are favorites to take the trophy with two of the world's top five players amongst their ranks.

"(CNN) -- NATO will begin to scale back operations in Libya following Moammar Gadhafi's death, with the preliminary end date of October 31, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Friday. A formal decision on a definitive end date will be made early next week. ""We did what we said we would do and now is the time for the Libyan people to take their destiny into their own hands,"" Rasmussen said after meeting with officials in Brussels to determine what should happen next. NATO forces will be on standby until the end of the month to continue to provide assistance to civilians if needed, he said, adding that, if requested by the new Libyan leadership, the international body could also help in the transition with regards to reforms to the country's defense and security sectors. Although Gadhafi was eventually captured by Libyan fighters and apparently killed by crossfire, the seven-month-long western intervention through NATO was a key factor in his downfall. One question is sure to come up: Has the Libya operation presented a model for future NATO missions or has it revealed the organization's limitations in terms of resources and political will? New day for Libya, but one fraught with challenges . Within days of the U.N. Security Council's authorization of Resolution 1973, with the mandate of protecting Libya's civilian population, NATO forces were engaged in action by air and sea. The operation relied on three main prongs -- implementing a no-fly zone, enforcing an arms embargo and taking action to protect civilians and civilian areas under threat of attack. Since March 31, some 9,634 strike sorties, where targets are identified or hit, are among 26,000 sorties to have been conducted, NATO said Friday. Among the targets were Gadhafi's military command centers, armored vehicles, munitions dumps and underground bunkers. NATO confirmed on Friday that 11 pro-Gadhafi military vehicles were hit by NATO aircraft outside his stronghold of Sirte Thursday morning, after they were seen leaving the city at high speed carrying large amounts of arms and ammunition. NATO did not know at the time of the strike that Gadhafi was in the convoy, which was targeted only because of the threat it posed to civilians, the NATO statement said -- but it later learned that Gadhafi ""was in the convoy and the strike likely contributed to his capture."" Gadhafi died soon after he was seized by Libyan fighters. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Friday that Gadhafi's death is proof of the success of the NATO alliance and the mission in Libya. ""This was not an easy effort, it involved a great deal of cooperation, a great deal of partnership. But the fact was that working together, they accomplished this mission that Gadhafi is no longer. And finally Libya belongs to the Libyan people,"" Panetta said while flying to Asia for a series of meetings with U.S. allies in the region. Rasmussen similarly hailed the alliance's Libya mission as a ""remarkable success,"" saying the operation ""prevented a massacre and saved countless lives."" Gadhafi killed in crossfire after capture, Libya PM says . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program, in an interview to be broadcast Sunday, that the operation had shown that the United States did not have to carry the weight of international military interventions alone. The point, he said, ""is that the NATO alliance worked like it was designed to do, burden-sharing. In total, it cost us $2 billion, no American lives lost."" And unlike other NATO operations, such as Afghanistan, where the United States has carried ""the primary burden,"" Biden said, ""this was really burden-sharing."" Pentagon spokesman George Little put the price tag for U.S. Defense Department operations in Libya as of September 30 at $1.1 billion. This included daily military operations, munitions, the drawdown of supplies and humanitarian assistance. Britain and France also committed significant resources to the operation, as did some smaller nations, such as Norway, which provided six Norwegian F-16s in the early months of the mission. But those who argue the operation exposed NATO's weaknesses point to the larger countries, such as Germany and Poland, which did not get involved. Germany abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote on Resolution 1973, saying it was concerned about a protracted military conflict. And despite President Barack Obama's determination that the United States take a backseat role in Libya, its surveillance drones and air support provision were key. In a farewell speech to the NATO council in Brussels in June, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned that the organization had become a ""two-tiered"" alliance poorly equipped to deal with challenges. Criticizing the reluctance of some of the alliance's 28 members to spend money on defense, he said the Libya operation had made it ""painfully clear"" that shortcomings could ""jeopardize the alliance's ability to conduct an integrated, effective and sustained air-sea campaign."" More analysis of NATO's performance is bound to come up as the smoke clears. NATO may also be called to help Libya's fledgling government and disparate militias achieve an orderly transition. ""There are significant security challenges ahead for Libya,"" Toner said. ""Whether that is something NATO can help them with, or whether we can help them with, or whether other countries can help them with, we'll figure that out in the days ahead."" But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, on Europe 1, suggested it was all over. ""It's up to the National Transitional Council to say it as the Libyans have their fate in the hands today. But, I think we can say that the military operation is finished, all of Libya's territory is under the control of the National Transitional Council. And that, subject to a few transitory measures in the week to come, the NATO operation has come to an end."" Damon Wilson, of the Washington-based Atlantic Council think tank, said he expected the NATO ambassadors meeting in Brussels to recognize that NATO's military operation in Libya was done, but that its involvement in the country was not. NATO could help the new civilian government in such areas as civilian control of the military, professionalization of security forces and border security, he said, although it might take time before the interim government was in a position to make requests of NATO. And NATO can draw some important lessons from the mission, Wilson said. ""In many respects this was a successful operation. It was an operation in which the United States did play a pretty prominent role, and we even downplayed how much of a role we played. ""But our European partners really stepped up to the plate. It showed that NATO works but it also showed that the alliance is effective in including our Arab partners -- in this operation, a key ingredient to success.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Severe flooding in Thailand on Saturday threatened central areas of Bangkok, a bustling capital barely above sea level and facing inundation at the next high tide predicted at 13 feet. Residents who decided to stay in their homes despite government pleas to get out waited anxiously to see whether high tide, forecast for Saturday afternoon, would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city had been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods, but in central Bangkok, it had been mostly dry. The city was facing two converging threats, however. Runoff the equivalent of 480,000 Olympic-size pools was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tide pushed the water in the opposite direction. ""The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,"" a Red Cross bulletin said. Saturday's high tide, the Red Cross said, was expected to put ""extreme pressure"" on Bangkok's elaborate system of dikes and other flood defenses. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the state-run MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents waded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. ""We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,"" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. ""The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. The military had set up a flood relief center, ""but now even that has water coming in it,"" she said. Asked what help the government had provided, she said, ""We don't see that the government is doing anything much to help people, so better to help ourselves by getting out of Bangkok."" But the Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. Still, so many people had left that the streets were relatively quiet. Panic buying had led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. City officials bracing for more flooding have opened nine evacuation centers. Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported. The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit. Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner and Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta. Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.","NEW: Tourists urged to steer clear of Bangkok .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama released his long-awaited debt reduction plan Monday, outlining a roughly $3 trillion savings blueprint that was immediately criticized by top congressional and other Republicans. The president's plan includes $1.5 trillion in new revenue generated largely by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, a proposal strongly opposed by GOP leaders who insist that any tax increase will undermine an already shaky economy. The measure -- which would add to nearly $1 trillion in savings signed into law under the debt-ceiling deal enacted in August -- does not include changes to Social Security. It would increase Medicare premiums for individuals with higher incomes starting in 2017 -- the year Obama leaves office if he wins a second term. ""We are not going to have a one-sided deal that hurts the folks that are most vulnerable,"" Obama said at the White House, offering a defense of tax hikes on the highest earners. Spending cuts alone ""will not solve our fiscal problems. We can't just cut our way out of this hole,"" he added. ""It's going to take a balanced approach. If we're going to make spending cuts -- many of which we wouldn't make if we weren't facing such large budget deficits -- then it's only right that we ask everyone to pay their fair share."" Obama explicitly promised to veto any debt-reduction legislation that cuts benefits while failing to include higher taxes on the wealthy. iReport: What do you think about Obama's plan? ""I will not support any plan that puts all the burden on ordinary Americans,"" he insisted. Republicans responded by dismissing the plan as little more than a cheap political gimmick. It's ""a thinly veiled attempt to score political points,"" said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. ""By raising taxes on job creators, Obama may win back some support from disgruntled liberal voters, but America will lose even more sorely needed jobs."" ""Veto threats, a massive tax hike, phantom savings and punting on entitlement reform is not a recipe for economic or job growth â€” or even meaningful deficit reduction,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""Pitting one group of Americans against another is not leadership,"" added House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Key congressional Democrats quickly rallied to Obama's defense, calling the blueprint a serious attempt to take on one of the most contentious issues in Washington. The ""proposal is clearly moving in the right direction,"" said North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ""It represents a significant and balanced plan for bringing our deficits and debt under control."" On Monday night, Obama referred to the Republican response as predictable and said the issue shows the fundamental difference between the parties on how the nation should deal with mounting federal deficits and national debt. ""What has been clear over the last two and a half years is that we have not had a willing partner,"" Obama told a New York fundraising event. ""Now, we've been able to get some stuff done despite that, and despite a filibuster in the Senate. But at least over the last nine months what we've seen is some irreconcilable differences, let's put it that way."" The release of Obama's blueprint is likely to set the stage for a fall dominated by harsh partisan debates over taxes and spending, as well as a 2012 presidential campaign focused on growing economic fears. Under Obama's plan, $800 billion in revenue would be generated by allowing some of the Bush-era tax cuts for high-income households to expire, as the president has repeatedly called for. An additional $400 billion would result from capping the value of itemized deductions and other exemptions for high-income households. Read the White House plan (PDF) The remaining $300 billion would come from closing various tax loopholes, according to a senior administration official. A new tax surcharge could also be imposed on millionaires: the ""Buffett Rule,"" named after investor Warren Buffett, who argues that the richest Americans are not taxed enough. Wealthier Americans often derive much of their income from investments, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income such as wages. As a result, they can end up owing a lower percentage of their income in federal taxes than someone who makes less money, especially once payroll taxes are factored in. The concept behind the Buffett Rule is that those earning more than $1 million should not be allowed to pay a lesser percentage of their income in federal taxes than Americans lower down the income scale. Read more: On taxes and debt, left and right dare to agree . In terms of spending, Obama's plan incorporates $580 billion in mandatory cuts, including $248 billion from the politically popular Medicare program. Roughly 90% of those savings will come from reducing overpayments in the system, according to a senior administration official. Any changes to Medicare benefits won't kick in before 2017, the official said. An additional $72 billion will come from Medicaid and other health programs. The president's plan does not include any Social Security reform proposals or changes to the Medicare eligibility age, reforms that have reportedly been put on the table by the administration in the past but are strongly opposed by a number of progressive Democrats. Another $1.1 trillion in savings would be generated by winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the administration is counting savings that would result from spending caps it has proposed on future overseas contingency operations. The administration also estimates interest savings of approximately $430 billion, a result of less borrowing and smaller annual budget shortfalls. Roughly $450 billion in the plan would be used to pay for the American Jobs Act, the economic stimulus measure proposed by Obama last week. Top Republicans call the president's plan a form of class warfare. ""When you pick one area of the economy and you say, 'We're going to tax those people because most people are not those people,' that's class warfare,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We have a difference of opinion on how best to fix these problems,"" House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But when the president does things like this, it leads you to believe that he's not in bipartisan consensus-making mood. He's in a political class-warfare mode and campaign mode. And that's not good for our economy."" Obama explicitly rejected the class warfare claim Monday. ""I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare,"" the president said. ""I think it's just the right the thing to do. I believe the American middle class, who've been pressured relentlessly for decades, believe it's time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations."" Democrats have blamed Republicans for blocking the Obama administration's initiatives purely for what Democrats insist are short-term political gain. ""I don't think people like that style of politics, and that's the reality ... we'll be facing in November 2012,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Sunday. Congressional action on deficit reduction is moving on multiple tracks now. Durbin said the Democratic-controlled Senate would take up Obama's jobs plan next month, while leaders in the Republican-controlled House have rejected some parts of it. Meanwhile, a special deficit reduction commission created under last month's debt-ceiling agreement has started its work amid the longstanding political divisions on key issues. The 12-member committee, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate, has until November 23 to draft a $1.5 trillion deficit-reduction plan that can win congressional approval by December 23. Otherwise, more than $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect, on top of $900 billion in cuts already mandated under the debt ceiling deal. The special committee ""is taking this issue far more seriously than the White House,"" McConnell said Monday. More than a year of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction has failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between Republicans and Democrats involving the size of government and whether to raise tax revenue while cutting spending. The brinkmanship of the negotiations, with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached, was one reason that ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA-plus in August.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Face-to-face questioning of potential jurors to hear the case against Michael Jackson's doctor began in a packed Los Angeles courtroom Friday morning, four days ahead of the opening statements and testimony. The pool of 84 potential jurors in court appeared diverse, although only six were African-American. Each side will be allowed 10 ""peremptory challenges,"" allowing them to get rid of jurors without stating a reason. Prosecutors and defense lawyers mutually agreed in closed-door sessions Wednesday and Thursday on which potential jurors in a pool of 145 were too biased to put their prejudices aside to decide if Dr. Conrad Murray is criminally responsible for the pop icon's death, according to Murray defense lawyer Michael Flanagan. ""Both sides just want to get a fair jury that hasn't made up their mind and is willing to make a decision based upon the facts,"" Flanagan said after Thursday's jury selection session. Lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said there were no surprising reasons for striking jurors ""for cause,"" and the pool was filled with people who could be open-minded. ""Time ameliorates things,"" Chernoff said. Flanagan predicted Thursday afternoon that Friday's jury selection would ""go very fast."" While most judges allow defense lawyers an hour to question potential jurors, Pastor is allowing just 20 minutes for each side, Flanagan said. ""Twenty minutes is a pretty short period of time,"" Flanagan said. ""You can't say 'hi' to everybody in 20 minutes."" It is expected 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen by the end of court Friday. Murray, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, would face up to four years in prison if the jury finds him guilty. The ""for cause"" strikes were based mostly on written answers potential jurors gave to 113 questions earlier this month. Lawyers had a week to study the questionnaire responses, a process they went through once before in April before the trial was delayed for several months. ""One of the things that we learned in the case the last go-around in the jury selection, it's absolutely shocking how many jurors think already they know everything about this case,"" Chernoff said in an interview last week with Jean Casarez, a reporter with CNN sister network In Session. Opening statements for the trial, which will be televised, are scheduled for September 27. The judge told members of the jury pool he expects their service will be over on or about October 28. The Los Angeles coroner has ruled that Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with other drugs. Prosecutors have accused Murray, who served as Jackson's personal and full-time physician at the time, of having a role in the overdose. They contend Murray used a makeshift intravenous drip to administer propofol intended to help Jackson sleep, a practice they argue violated the standard of care and led to the pop music icon's death.","NEW: 84 potential jurors, including six African-Americans, remain in the jury pool .

"(CNN) -- Witnesses began describing the final moments of and futile attempts to save a Connecticut mother and her two daughters inside their burning home, opening the trial Monday for one of the men who authorities claim is responsible for their murders. Prosecutors declined to give an opening statement to start the trial of Joshua Komisarjevsky, 31, who faces 17 charges in a brutal home invasion in Cheshire. But they did introduce tapes from two 911 calls, a bank teller who claimed the mother tried to withdraw $15,000 as ransom and a police officer who found Dr. William Petit -- the lone survivor -- fighting for life outside his family's burning home. The first defendant to stand trial in the case, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to the death penalty in December after being convicted on 16 of 17 charges filed against him. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. William Petit managed to escape. Entering the New Haven court Monday, Petit succinctly told reporters, ""I just hope justice was served."" He was one of several of the victims' family members packing the courtroom, many of them wearing pins that Judge Jon C. Blue allowed over defense lawyers' objections they might sway the jury. While he didn't present a comprehensive statement, New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington briefly spoke to jurors, explaining that prosecutors believe the jury will be able to listen to the evidence and render a decision. Under the law, Dearington said, Komisarjevsky is charged both as a principal and an accessory. Komisarjevsky's defense attorney, Walter Bansley, told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone, that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal. Bansley said Komisarjevsky did not have a weapon. He told jurors that in order to convict Komisarjevsky of capital murder, they must determine he intended to kill someone. It was Hayes, Bansley said, who raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit, poured the gasoline and lit the match. Komisarjevsky was a willing participant in the break-in and theft, but not the murders, according to Bansley, who recounted mounting dissension between Hayes and Komisarjevsky as the home invasion progressed through that morning. Hayes felt the Petits needed to be killed, Bansley claimed, but Komisarjevsky refused to kill anyone. Bansley did allude to a ""confession"" that Komisarjevsky had later made in the incident. While it was not yet entered into testimony on this trial's first day, during Hayes' trial, a court clerk read from writings of Komisarjevsky, in which he described the incident in a 40-page letter that he wrote to author Brian McDonald in 2008. ""All were compliant,"" he wrote. ""This time I took a risk, pulled the trigger, and the chamber was loaded. ... The Petit family passed through their fears and into terror. ""... It was captivating, validating that this pain in me was real. ... I was looking right at my personal demon, reflected back in their eyes. ... Hayley is a fighter; she tried time and time again to free herself. ... Mr. Petit is a coward; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened, and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen. ... I was cheated of my retribution, and so was Steve. ... I am what I am; I make no excuses. ... I'm a criminal with a criminal mind."" The reading continued, ""Michaela, Hayley, and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... I can't believe I lost control; I hate myself/I love myself. ... I stand condemned."" After the defense lawyers presented their opening arguments, the prosecution began to present evidence and call witnesses -- the same five people thus far, in the same order, as they did during Hayes' trial. If they continue this trend, Dr. Petit would be the next witness to testify when the trial resumes Tuesday morning. The first person on the stand Monday was Mona Huggard, a registered nurse at Petit's medical practice who said that Hawke-Petit had called in to say her husband was sick -- only the second time, in her recollection, that he'd ever done so. Then Kristen Makhzangi testified how Hawke-Petit came to her bank window to withdraw $15,000. Video showed the transaction, which spurred a 911 call from the Bank of America branch's manager, Mary Lyons, warning that that the family might be in trouble. Lyons described Hawke-Petit as ""terrified."" About an hour after the visit, authorities say, she was dead. Another 911 call came from the Petits' next-door neighbor David Simcik, who testified spotting Dr. Petit ""all banged up"" and asking him to call police. And lastly on Monday, Cheshire Police Office Thomas Wright explained how he'd arrived to find Petit bloodied on his neighbor's driveway. By the time he tried, unsuccessfully, to enter the door of the home, Hayes and Komisarjevsky had left and ""everything was burning,"" Wright said. Authorities threw rocks at windows and doused flames with a nearby hose. But once they finally got in, ""We saw no signs of life,"" he said. In Session's Sunny Hostin and CNN's Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: A bank employee describes Jennifer Hawke-Petit as ""terrified""

"New York (CNN) -- The U.S. population is expected to top out at close to 312.8 million people just around the time crowds gather to watch the ball drop on New Year's Eve, according to new census data released Thursday. The figure represents a 0.7% increase from last year, adding 2,250,129 people to the U.S. population since the start of 2011, and a 1.3% increase since Census Day, April 1, 2010. The agency estimates that beginning in January, one American will be born every eight seconds and one will die every 12 seconds. U.S.-bound immigrants are also expected to add one person every 46 seconds. That combination of births, deaths and migration is expected to add a single person to the U.S. population every 17 seconds, the Census Bureau said. Meanwhile, millions are set to ring in the new year. In New York, authorities are preparing for large crowds in Manhattan's Times Square, where Lady Gaga is expected to join Mayor Michael Bloomberg to push the button that drops the Waterford Crystal ball at 11:59 p.m. ET on New Year's Eve. ""And I'm so looking forward to performing on NYE+dropping the Ball with Mayor Bloomberg!"" the pop star posted on Twitter. ""What an honor as a New Yorker."" Past guests have included Muhammad Ali, Rudy Giuliani, Colin Powell and Bill and Hillary Clinton. On Thursday, officials conducted New York's annual ""airworthiness test"" -- a process in which confetti is tossed by handfuls above Times Square -- in preparation for the annual city tradition of dumping one ton of confetti over revelers in the iconic square. The Big Apple this year edged out Las Vegas for the first time in seven years as the top travel U.S. destination for those celebrating the new year, according to a December travel booking website poll. Seven New York neighborhoods made the top 10 list, with two districts in Las Vegas and one in New Orleans making up the other three, according to the Priceline poll.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Prosecutors in Italy allege that a businessman supplied Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi with about 30 women, or escorts, in order to win favor with him. It's the latest development in a long-running sex scandal. Transcripts of some of 100,000 wiretap recordings made between September 2008 and 2009 were filed with a court in the southern city of Bari Friday, as prosecutors wrapped up a three-year prostitution investigation. The transcripts reveal that Berlusconi and businessman Gianpaolo Tarantini repeatedly discussed bringing women to parties. Tarantini selected women to be of ""young age and slender"" and instructed them in what to wear and how to behave at Berlusconi's parties, the prosecutors say. Among them was Patrizia D'Addario, prosecutors say, who in 2009 alleged she and other women were paid to attend parties at Berlusconi's residence. He denied her claim. In another conversation, they discuss what women they should each bring to a party that night. Berlusconi says that the male guests are powerful men ""so the girls have the idea of being in front of men that can decide their destiny."" He says he has ""two young girls whom I've not seen for a long time"" -- one of them a journalist and the other a 21-year-old Brazilian ""who cried over the phone telling me that I'd forgotten her."" Discussing a party the night before in a wiretap from October 10, Berlusconi tells Tarantini there were perhaps too many women. ""At the most to have two each, but now I want you also to have yours, otherwise I feel in debt. Why don't you bring yours for you and I bring mine. ... "" Tarantini agrees, and Berlusconi continues: ""Then we can exchange them ... "" In a conversation between Tarantini and one of the women he recruited, she said Berlusconi told her he would help her. Berlusconi is not accused in this case filed in Bari but faces a separate trial in Milan for allegedly paying for sex with a then-17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer named Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer."" El Mahroug has denied having sex with the premier. Both admit that he gave her money, although they say it was an act of kindness to help her. Berlusconi has always denied wrongdoing and also denies ever having paid for sex. The latest revelations in the Bari case have reignited calls among his critics for Berlusconi to resign. In a letter published Saturday to the Foglio newspaper, run by his former spokesman Giuliano Ferrara, Berlusconi wrote that he had no intention of quitting. He said his behavior was nothing like what had been described in the media, and that he had done nothing to be ashamed of. In a separate but linked investigation by prosecutors in Naples, Tarantini is accused of having blackmailed Berlusconi over the scandal. According to the Naples prosecutors, Berlusconi was a victim of ""veiled and implied threats"" and paid 800,000 euros to Tarantini. The prime minister denies having been blackmailed and says he gave the money to Tarantini as an act of charity. CNN's Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","Newly filed court documents reveal details of inquiry into associates of Berlusconi .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia teacher's passion and curiosity about her immigrant students' homelands led to a path that changed her life and those she's touched - forever. Sue Ellen Wortzel said her student's stories of struggle to find food, a safe place to live, a basic education other economic hardships in their home countries often left her speechless and explained why their families searched for a better life in the U.S. Their emotional stories moved Wortzel to learn more about where they came from in Central America and inspired her to help their home countries. As an educator, Wortzel felt she had the ability to create a positive change in some of their country's schools and began her journey to do so in 2006 with a trip through Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. During this visit, she took note of some of the specific problems educators and students faced. ""I saw teachers and students doing amazing things with nothing or bare-bone structures,"" she said. In one high school in Nicaragua, Wortzel discovered classrooms that only had one or two copies of a text book for a 30-plus-student class. Teachers would use chalkboards and cover them with notes from the text book, so everyone could see and digest the information. In addition to a lack of books, Wortzel noticed a lack of maps, globes, calculators and other teaching supplies. Basic transportation to and from school is a problem, too, for some families. ""Oftentimes, kids walk up to two hours to school in rural areas, since their families can't afford to pay for public transportation,"" said Wortzel. ""This hardship is tough on kids and many times they just give up and quit attending school."" Public education throughout the world varies greatly. In the United States, education is predominantly funded by taxpayers, and students are not charged tuition to attend public schools. In Central America, resources lack for many children to obtain a basic public education. Wortzel acknowledges the U.S. public education system is filled with problems, but has witnessed that students in ""forgotten"" countries suffer, too. She has made it her life's mission to help those outside U.S. borders. ""Children have no control over what happens to them and access to education is not something we can save for particular children,"" she noted. Wortzel's personal interaction with her students as well as her international travels inspired her to create a nonprofit organization calledTALICA in 2006, with operations based in Atlanta and Central America. TALICA stands for ""The Teaching and Learning Initiative for Central America."" Its mission is to expand access to basic educational materials for schools in Central America. Since 2006, TALICA has established school collections and donated about 4,500 books and supplies to seven public school libraries in five communities, and helped establish a community library and the first-ever medical collection in the village of Balgue, Nicaragua. The school materials are hand-picked by local teachers, and TALICA takes them shopping about once or twice a year for their supplies. How does TALICA make this happen? It takes hard work, coordination and personal relationships to make it all come together. TALICA's team is small, consisting of five volunteer directors as well as hundreds of supportive family and friends across the U.S. and Central America who volunteer their time and resources. Grass-roots fundraising is a key element to TALICA's survival. Members will host dinner parties, wine tasting events and other fundraising efforts to raise cash. With a budget of about $12,000 a year, TALICA uses its money as strategically as possible to do the most good. TALICA's current projects include supporting five schools on the island of Ometepe, Nicaragua, and a scholarship program to send a student to college. This impoverished rural region was selected because it has a literacy rate hovering around 67 percent and has big educational challenges, according to Wortzel. In comparison, the U.S. literacy level is 99 percent according to the CIA-World Fact Book. The nonprofit's newest project is a science initiative. ""We're building an extra classroom to house a small science lab and book room to a high school that has been outgrowing its space,"" said Wortzel. ""We've been working closely with the biology teacher, Elvin Cruz, in developing a lab."" A future goal is to provide Kindles and other e-readers to these schools. Wortzel said there isn't sufficient access to a wireless network in some of these regions to make it happen now. Ultimately, Wortzel and her team believe in the power of education and know it's the key to lift up this region of the world and elsewhere. ""It's in our best interest as humans to help educate people in the most remote and destitute parts of the world,"" she said. ""Building personal and loving relationships with people from other countries and cultures is important to building consensus and peace.""","U.S. educator forms nonprofit called TALICA to help students in Central America .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time Wednesday, as the nation faces an economic crisis and corruption allegations bring increased scrutiny to the monarchy. King Juan Carlos receives 292,752 euros ($382,743) annually, the royal palace said in a statement. Prince Felipe, next in line to the throne, receives about half that amount . Queen Sofia, Princess Letizia, Infanta Elena and Infanta Cristina received a combined total of 375,000 euros for royal duties ($490,274) in 2011, the palace's statement said. The announcement comes as a corruption investigation reportedly involving the king's son-in-law has fueled public criticism of the royal family. Authorities are investigating whether a foundation headed by Inaki Undangarin improperly used public funds, according to media reports. No charges have been filed against Undangarin, a former Olympic handball player who married Infanta Cristina in 1997. Urdangarin's attorney, in an interview with Europa Press earlier this month, said his client was innocent. The palace pledged its commitment to austerity and transparency in its statement Wednesday. Spain faces an economic crisis that has brought thousands of protesters to the streets and sparked sharp government austerity measures. About 5 million people in the country are jobless. Spain has an overall unemployment rate of 21.5%, but it youth unemployment rate is a staggering 45%. Conservative prime minister sworn in . Economic protests surged across Spain over the past year, fueled by young people known as ""indignants,"" who criticized government officials and financial institutions.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese officials said they killed seven members of the Uighur ethnic group in the restive western region of Xinjiang in order to free two hostages -- an account the Uighurs disputed. The hostages -- local villagers looking for their lost sheep in the rural county of Pishan outside of Hotan city-- were kidnapped by a group of Uighurs on Wednesday night, said Hou Hanmin, a spokeswoman for the chief of the regional information office in Xinjiang. The operation to rescue them left one police officer dead and wounded another, he said. However, Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the Stockholm-based World Uighur Congress, said the shooting did not stem from a rescue operation. Police opened fire when locals clashed with officers during a demonstration outside the police bureau, he said. The Uighurs were protesting a recent security crackdown in Hotan city. ""This is incident was not an accident,"" he said. ""It is a direct result from the Chinese crackdown on Uighurs. It has become unbearable for Uighurs there to accept the oppression and current rule from the Chinese government."" The Chinese authorities have often blamed militants of Uighur descent for outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang in recent years. Uighurs are ethnic Turks who are linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population. Beijing has said Uighur militants are often based overseas and has linked some of them to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement that allegedly trains in Pakistan. The clash comes after a two-month security crackdown, which ended in October, against violence, terrorism and radical Islam across the resource-rich region, which borders Pakistan, Afghanistan and numerous unstable Central Asian states. The tightened security measures included 24-hour security patrols of troubled areas, identity checks and random street searches of people and vehicles. Uighur activists say the crackdowns have only heightened anger among Uighurs who already accuse the government of religious and political repression. Uighurs also say they feel economically disadvantaged as a thriving Han population continues to move into the region.","NEW: The World Uighur Congress says police opened fire on protesters .

"San Bernardino, California (CNN) -- A man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party pleaded not guilty to all charges at his arraignment Thursday. Ruben Jurado, 19, faces a charge of attempted murder in the shooting of Army Spc. Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan's native San Bernardino, California. Jurado also faces four ""special allegations involving premeditation and the use and discharge of a firearm, causing great bodily injury,"" said Christopher Lee, spokesman for the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office. ""Special allegations"" can add to a convict's sentence in California. Jurado entered court Thursday in an orange jail jumpsuit, with his hands and ankles shackled. The arraignment lasted only a few minutes. Three of Sullivan's relatives attended. The next court date is scheduled for January 9. The defense team expects to receive ""initial discovery of police reports and any other evidence that the district attorney has,"" defense attorney Michael Holmes said Wednesday. He noted that the court ""allows video arraignment"" but said Jurado ""wanted to be present in court during the entire process."" The party in Sullivan's honor was to celebrate his recent return to California from Kentucky, where he was stationed while recovering from wounds sustained in a suicide bombing a year ago in Afghanistan. That bombing killed five members of his unit and left him with a cracked collarbone and brain damage, according to the San Bernardino County Sun. Sullivan received the Purple Heart. At the party, Sullivan was shot twice after an argument and physical confrontation with Jurado, who fled the scene, according to police and witnesses. The fight broke out after Jurado and Sullivan's younger brother began arguing about football, the brothers' mother, Suzanne Sullivan, said. Jurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills, California, on Monday afternoon, said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters. Suzanne Sullivan said her family is having a difficult time coming to terms with what happened. ""He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it,"" she said. ""But to see he survived that, and now for this to happen to him, just breaks my heart.""

""I'm obviously disappointed that the injury occurred, but especially disappointed with such an important part of my schedule coming up, including the Masters,"" Langer said in a statement, PGATour.com reported. ""I do, however, appreciate the fine care of Dr. Weiland and his team, and will work hard to recover to allow me to resume play on the Champions Tour this summer."" His thumb will be in a splint for five weeks but his doctors expect him to make a full recovery. Langer won his first Green Jacket in 1985 -- becoming only the second European player to win the tournament after Seve Ballesteros -- before going on to claim a second title in 1993. The 53-year-old, who turned professional in 1976, has enjoyed a sparkling career winning 42 times on the European Tour. He was also an integral part of Europe Ryder Cup team during their resurgence during the 1980s and 1990s, making a total of ten appearances as a player and one as captain in 2004 when Europe won by their biggest margin in the competition's history. In 2007, Langer joined the PGA Champions Tour and has become one of it's most successful players winning a total of 14 titles. The most recent of these came at the ACE Group Classic in February. Last December, Langer was crowned Champions Tour Player of the Year after claiming five titles during the 2010 season. This year's Masters tournament gets underway on April 7.","Bernhard Langer will miss the 2011 Masters tournament for first time in 28 years .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have found a wide-eyed primate -- a clawed fur ball that fits snugly in one hand -- in the first live sighting in more than 80 years of a creature that some thought was extinct. ""It was truly amazing,"" one scientist said. ""I couldn't conceive that we had actually caught one."" Over a two-month period, scientists working in Lore Lindu National Park on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi caught and released three pygmy tarsiers. They bear a striking resemblance to the Furby, an electronic toy that spoke its own fantasy language and dominated children's wish lists in the late 1990s. They caught two males and one female, said Sharon Gursky-Doyen, a Texas A&M University anthropology professor who led the expedition. The group spotted a fourth -- high in the tree canopy -- but were unable to catch it. The species had not been observed alive in more than eight decades, since they were collected for a museum in 1921. Many scientists had believed them to be extinct until eight years ago, when two scientists trapping rats in Sulawesi accidentally trapped and killed one. ""I needed to go myself ... to confirm in my own mind,"" whether they were there, Gursky-Doyen told CNN on Wednesday, after recently returning from Indonesia. And, on the second night of trapping in August on moss-covered, chilly Mt. Rore Katimbo, her group caught the first small nocturnal creature in a mist net. ""It was truly amazing,"" she said. ""My whole body was shaking ... I couldn't conceive that we had actually caught one."" The second trapping didn't come until three weeks later, but that first sighting ""kept us going,"" Gursky-Doyen said, amid the cold, drenched conditions. The pygmy tarsier, or Tarsius pumilus, weighs about 50 grams (1.7 ounces), and has dense fur, large, protruding eyes. In addition to seeming as a living, breathing version of the Furby, it also appears as though it ought to have had appeared in the 1984 movie ""Gremlins."" Unlike other primates, the pygmy tarsier -- endemic to a specific area of Indonesia -- has claws instead of nails on its fingers. It is half as big as the Philippines tarsier, which has similar features. For their part, the pygmy tarsiers may have been more frightened than elated at being discovered. ""I was bit once, but I take responsibility for that,"" Gursky-Doyen said, explaining that the animal nipped her as she was trying to attach a radio collar -- to track its movement -- to its neck. The task isn't an easy one, she said, because the animal can swivel its head around 180 degrees. Despite another person helping to hold the animal still, he turned and bit her, she said. They have ""pointy, triangular teeth,"" she said. It was ""very painful."" But for the most part, they appeared very ""passive,"" she said. Other tarsier species give alarm calls, but these didn't, at least nothing that a human could hear, she said. Gursky-Doyen said she would like her graduate student, Nanda Grow, also on the expedition, to return to the field site for her dissertation, to learn more about the number of animals and how altitude and other variables affect them. ""I do believe that the density of these animals is very low,"" she said, noting that many villages are located within Lore Lindu National Park. ""That threatens them,"" she said.","Pygmy tarsiers thought to be extinct for more than eight decades .

"(CNN) -- Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid were both held in La Liga as they battled to unconvincing draws. Real Madrid failed to score for a second consecutive game as they were held 0-0 by Racing Santander. Coach Jose Mourinho could do little to inject some life into his team as they struggled to break down a spirited Racing defense. In fact it was Racing who could have taken the lead after Oscar Serrano's superb strike was only kept out by a stunning finger-tip save by goalkeeper Iker Casillas. The draw followed Real's 1-0 defeat to Levante and leaves them seventh in the league. ""This was a different match to that against Levante as here it felt as though there was only one side looking to win the game,"" Mourinho told AFP. ""It is a worrying situation as we have now lost five points from two games away from home. It would be wrong to say one player hasn't scored or another one has failed but as a team we weren't at our best although we tried."" Meanwhile Barcelona were lucky to grab a 2-2 draw with Valencia, La Liga's early, surprise pace-setters. In a chaotic 11 first half minutes Eric Abidal gifted Valencia the lead when he deflected a low cross from the left into his own net. Pedro soon equalized for Barcelona but a few moments later Pablo Hernandez tapped in to restore Valencia's well-deserved advantage. But the match turned on what may well be the miss of the season when Roberto Soldado, totally unmarked and in the middle of an empty net, somehow slid in and diverted the ball past the left hand post. In the second half Barcelona probed in their typically patient fashion before Cesc Fabregas scored his fourth goal of the season. The match finished 2-2. Elsewhere Atletico Madrid won 4-0 win against Sporting Gijon. Big money summer signing Falcao scored twice, taking his tally to five goals in two games. Qatar-owned Malaga beat Athletic Bilbao 1-0 whilst Levante followed their impressive victory over Real Madrid with all three points against Rayo Vallecano, beating them 2-1. In Italy AC Milan needed a 63rd minute goal from teenage substitute Stephan el Shaarawy to earn a 1-1 draw against Udinese. The result means that both Milan clubs have yet to record a win this season. Tuesday night saw Inter Milan lose 3-1 to newly-promoted Novara and coach Gian Piero Gasperini lose his job. But AC Milan coach Massimilano Allegri insisted that he was happy with his team's performance. ""We played well right up until the end and only risked conceding on the counter,"" he told AFP. ""It's normal that it's not nice looking at the table but the important thing is how you play. I'm happy because the lads played well and took risks by trying to score.""

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Latin music pulses from the stereo as 40 women jump, shimmy and sway to the beat. Zumba is the most popular exercise class at one suburban Atlanta YMCA. It's not a dance club. This is a regular morning exercise class at the YMCA in Alpharetta, Georgia. It's called Zumba. Part dance, part aerobics, Zumba is an hourlong routine that works almost every muscle in the body. ""It is dance fitness,"" explained Stephanie Maxim, one of two class instructors. ""We teach them moves that you can see on 'Dancing with the Stars': salsa, mambo, cha-cha, and we put it into a group fitness format."" ""It's not like a workout,"" explained Diane Walterstiel, 55, of Alpharetta. ""Before I come, I'm tense, but when I leave, I could kiss the world."" Nearly a year after being introduced at the YMCA in suburban Atlanta, Zumba is the most popular exercise offering at the facility. Alberto Perlman, co-founder and CEO of Zumba Fitness in Hollywood, Florida, wasn't surprised when the concept took off not just in the United States but around the world. ""We turned exercise into a party,"" Perlman declared. ""Zumba broke some of the rules of fitness. We used music in the original form instead of using step counts."" Perlman, whose background is in marketing, teamed up with Colombian dancer and choreographer Alberto ""Beto"" Perez in Miami in 2001. ""One day, Beto forgot his aerobics tapes, so he played his salsa and meringue songs during class in their original form,"" Perlman said. ""People went crazy. They didn't feel like they were in a class with a drill sergeant."" Perlman said Perez decided to call the exercise Zumba, after the Colombian slang word meaning to buzz like a bee or move fast. Zumba is now a brand name. Since 2003, Perlman's group has trained 20,000 instructors around the world and sold more than 3 million DVDs on the Internet and through infomercials, he said. Heather Bleakman teamed up with Maxim to teach the Georgia YMCA session. She called the class a form of therapy. ""We see women change,"" she said. ""We see their faces light up."" Bleakman stood at the front of the room and offered a high-impact version of Zumba for those who could keep up while Maxim focused on a slower low-impact routine. Maxim warned participants at the beginning of class to modify the exercise to fit their needs. She added that wearing proper footwear is one of the best ways to guard against injury. ""In Zumba, we do a lot of pivoting, so you've got to have a shoe that has more of a flat base so you can move, or you'll feel the torque in the knee,"" Maxim cautioned. Lilieth Burke, 48, of Alpharetta started attending Zumba classes a year ago and kept coming back because she appreciated ""the simple composition of dance moves."" Unlike other exercise workouts she's tried, ""Zumba is not a punishment,"" she said. Burke summed up the benefits: ""I feel fit, I sleep better, I feel better, I feel younger, and I feel I can live another 48 years.""","Set to original-form music, Zumba classes combine dancing and aerobics .

"(CNN) -- When scores of disgruntled Tunisians took to the streets in January to demand the ouster of their country's president, actor Dhafer L'Abidine was watching from afar. Based in the UK, L'Abidine, who is one of Tunisia's most famous actors, went through a roller-coaster of emotions as he watched the unfolding of the uprising that subsequently spurred the Arab Spring. ""I was trying to keep in touch all the time and see what happens and follow the news and understand what's happening,"" remembers L'Abidine. ""You go through everything,"" he says. ""Sadness, frustration and then happy moments at the end so it was a difficult time but I think it was an amazing time and I think what's happening now is quite amazing because you've got the first free elections coming in October -- it's a new page in the Tunisian history."" The months of civil unrest culminated in the collapse of the regime of Tunisia's President Zine el Abidine who ruled the country for more than 20 years. Today, the north African country is still dealing with the aftermath of the revolution but people remain optimistic that the move to democracy can still be achieved. L'Abidine, who has set up a production company in Tunisia, believes the recent events will open up opportunities for artists in the country, giving them the freedom to express themselves without any restrictions. ""Before, if you write something that doesn't suit the ideas of the dictatorship or the government then there's no way you're going to make it,"" says L'Abidine, a former football player and model. ""Now, at least we've got the freedom to write stories that we want to tell -- the censorship is not there. I think this is a great opportunity for artists, whether singers or writers or filmmakers, just to go for it and use the opportunity into progressing the movie industry back home."" The talented actor is perhaps best-known for his part in big-budget romantic comedy ""Sex and the City 2,"" in which he played the role of a charming host whose job was to look after the film's four main characters on a trip to Abu Dhabi. ""It was great fun,"" says L'Abidine about his part in the Hollywood movie. ""I had some filming to do in New York and then in Morocco and it was a great experience -- just to be involved in such an iconic TV program and then a film, so I'm very happy about having been part of that."" While L'Abidine has been carving a successful path as an actor in the international stage -- his work also includes roles in ""Centurion"" and ""The Stone Merchant"" -- he's maintained links with the region he's from, getting the best of the two worlds. The much-traveled actor has appeared in several TV series across the Middle East and North Africa and also presented one of the biggest talent shows in the region -- ""Prince of Poets"" -- with an audience of about 20 million viewers per show. ""I'm lucky in a way that actually I can go back to Tunisia or in the Middle East and do different roles in Arabic or sometimes in French or in English,"" says L'Abidine who is fluent in four languages. ""Playing different parts and also being in England there's a great opportunity to do different roles."" But long before wowing moviegoers, L'Abidine pursued his teenage passion for football in Tunisia, going to school during the day and training in the evening. After spending three years in France, where he studied computer science and played football, L'Abidine returned to Tunisia before relocating to the United Kingdom to follow his dream of acting. But settling in his new environment wasn't without challenges -- L'Abidine, who at the time didn't speak the language, had to divide his time between studying hard and working part-time in restaurants and bars in London to support himself. ""There were hard times but now when you look back they were very useful and actually you can learn from them and they make you who you are -- at the end, you can't have a life experience just with good things, the difficult times are also very useful for now and for the future,"" says L'Abidine. Passionate about his country, L'Abidine says January's revolution shows the world that Tunisia is not just a tourist destination but a place with long history and rich culture. ""I'm proud to be Tunisian and I'm proud to what's happening now in Tunisia and I'm proud of the people who actually lost their lives so then people like me and others can have a better future,"" he says. ""I'm very grateful to them, I think it's a difficult time for other counties now -- Arab countries -- because they're going through the same process but I think the reward at the end is so great. ""I'm positive about it and I think it's an amazing time for the Arab world.""","Dhafer L'Abidine is one of Tunisia's most famous actors .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel is on track to become Formula One's youngest double world champion after topping the qualifying timesheets for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. The 24-year-old headed off Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to claim his 11th pole position this season as he seeks a ninth victory from 14 races. That would give him another championship crown -- the first was clinched at the last race of 2010, but this one would be with five to go as he seeks to build on his 112-point lead in the night event. Vettel can beat the mark of second-placed Fernando Alonso, who was 25 when he won his second title with Renault in 2006. But the Spaniard could delay Vettel's celebrations if he finishes fourth on a testing Marina Bay Street Circuit where he led from the start to win last year from Vettel and Webber -- and also triumphed with Renault in 2008. How the F1 title can be won: Vettel on the verge . Alonso will have to improve on Saturday's qualifying, where he was fifth fastest ahead of Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner downplayed chances of the title being decided this weekend. ""The moon and stars have got to line up. We haven't booked anything for a party should we win. We're focused on the race,"" he told reporters in quotes carried by AFP. Vettel set the pace in the first two sessions before clocking an unbeatable one minute 44.381 seconds in his only run of Q3 to give Red Bull a perfect record in qualifying this season. Vettel fastest in Singapore practice . ""I decided to abort my second run when I made a mistake because it is very easy to damage the car so I went wide,"" he said. ""I was quite happy with my first lap. I think the circuit ramped up at the end and I think it was possible to go faster, but I'm very happy. It's a very difficult track with such a long lap to get everything right. I think we learned from our mistakes that we made last year."" Webber then surged into second with 1:44.732 to push past McLaren's former world champions Jenson Button (1:44.804) and Lewis Hamilton (1:44.809). Hamilton was unable to make a second run due to a fuel problem, and watched from the pits as his time was beaten. Alonso timed 1:44.874 to be well clear of Massa (1:45.800) and the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg -- whose legendary teammate Michael Schumacher failed to set a time along with Force India's Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta -- who both opted to conserve tires.","Sebastian Vettel wins his 11th pole position of 2011 at Singapore Grand Grix .

"LOGANVILLE, Georgia (CNN) -- The crowd cheered as Morgan Lawless faced her first pitch of the fall baseball season. Morgan Lawless, who has cerebral palsy, plays baseball at Bay Creek Park near Atlanta, Georgia. The 14-year-old middle-school student clenched her teeth as she swung the bat into a single. Instead of running to first base, Lawless zoomed over in her motorized wheelchair. Lawless has cerebral palsy. She's among nearly 300 children who play in a special-needs baseball league at Bay Creek Park in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb of Loganville. ""It's actually fun because we get to be kids and we can play like regular people,"" Lawless said. What's different about this ballpark is that the field is made of a rubberized material that allows for easier movement in wheelchairs. ""We started out on a dirt field,"" said league founder Cathy Smith. ""But power wheelchairs and dirt don't mix."" Smith helped raise some of the half-million dollars in private and county funding needed to build the field in 2004. She said she gets goosebumps whenever she watches the young players come across home plate. ""The grin and smile on their faces just says it all."" Coach Tom Estes joined the program eight years ago with his now-15-year-old son, Justin, who has cerebral palsy. Estes noted that some of the players, like his son, use a wheelchair, but others with autism, Down syndrome and multiple sclerosis are ambulatory.  Health Minute: Watch more on special needs baseball » . During a game, the children are paired with young helpers from another local baseball league. No special skills are required to participate, Estes said. ""If we have to help them hit, help them run, help them catch, we are simply here to let them play baseball."" The coaches have taken extra precautions to make sure no one gets hurt. The players wear batting helmets, and a coach feeds large, softball-sized rubber balls into a pitching machine to control the direction. There are no umpires, and no one really keeps score. ""We have a lot of tie ball games,"" Estes chuckled. The games are short, just two innings, but everyone gets to play. ""It's not about competition as much as it is about the ability to just do what other kids do,"" said Mike Lawless, Morgan's father. He said his daughter looks forward to the games all week. So does Estes' son. ""Until you get involved, you don't realize the closed life they live,"" Tom Estes said. Being part of the team gives the players a sense of independence and self control and gets them outside in the fresh air, he said. ""They're out here doing the same thing as the other kids. They really don't do that on a normal basis."" The weekly games also give the kids something to brag about in school on Monday morning, Estes said. ""They hear everyone else talking about it...and my son can say, 'Yeah, I hit a home run yesterday, too. It was great.' "" Justin Estes seemed to take all the attention in stride. And what does he think is the best part about playing baseball? Pointing past his wheelchair to the smooth surface of the field, he said simply, ""No ruts.""","Special-needs baseball league near Atlanta has nearly 300 children .

"(CNN) -- Kaka converted a penalty in time added on to give holders Brazil a dramatic 4-3 win over Egypt who filed an official complaint after their Confederations Cup opener at Bloemfontein on Monday. Kaka celebrates after his last-gasp penalty gives holders Brazil an opening win in their Confed Cup victory. Substitute Ahmed al-Muhamadi was red-carded after handling on the goalline in a desperate attempt to deny Brazil -- and Real Madrid's recent $92million signing Kaka rifled home from the spot for his second goal of the game. But the decision by English referee Howard Webb to award the penalty upset African Nations Cup winners Egypt. They were unhappy that Webb initially blew for a corner but changed his mind after the fourth official, Australia's Matthew Breeze, spoke to him after reportedly seeing television replays. ""Since when do the regulations say it is a penalty based on the monitors or on the television?"" asked Egypt's deputy coach Shawki Gharib. ""Egypt is going to file a complaint against the penalty."" Brazil coach Dunga saw nothing wrong with the decision. ""It was a clear case of a penalty,"" he said, adding that his team let a two-goal lead slip because they were tired. ""We had two tough (World Cup) qualifiers, 23 hours of travel and the time difference. The players have not been sleeping well so obviously we are quite happy with the win."" Substitute Giuseppe Rossi scored a brace to help world champions Italy stage a second-half recovery against 10-man United States and claim a 3-1 victory in their tournament debut in Pretoria. South Africa are staging the tournament as a warm-up for next year's World Cup finals -- with Egypt struggling to qualify for 2010 after their recent 3-1 defeat against Algeria. But it looked as though Egypt were going to deny five-times world champions Brazil an opening victory in their defense of the Confederations crown after a fightback that saw Mohamed Zidan also score twice. Brazil were leading 3-1 at halftime with first-half strikes from Kaka (5 minutes), Luis Fabiano (12) and Juan (37) with Zidan heading home Wael Gomaa's cross on nine. It was all change early in the second half when Egypt drew level with two goals inside a minute. The first came when Sayed Moawad pulled the ball back from the left to Mohamed Shawky who blasted a superb strike beyond Julio Cesar. And Brazil were left reeling when Zidan pulled Egypt level seconds later. Brazil coach Dunga took off Manchester City pair Robinho and Elano soon after and replaced them with Benfica midfielder Ramires and Milan striker Alexandre Pato. And Kaka had the final say in a match played in front of thousands of empty seats despite FIFA president Sepp Blatter's criticism that organisers had not done enough to sell tickets for Spain's game with New Zealand on Sunday. Brazil next face CONCACAF Gold Cup winners United States on Thursday before facing world champions Italy on June 21. Egypt play Italy on Thursday before meeting the U.S with the top two from each group go through to the semifinals. Italy were trailing 1-0 against the U.S. at the interval after Galaxy forward Landon Donovan fired his side ahead from the penalty spot after 41 minutes. The Americans were already down to 10 men following the dismissal of Ricardo Clark who was given a straight red card after 33 minutes for a foul on Gennaro Gattuso. But the introduction of Rossi just before the hour mark turned the game. The Villarreal striker blasted home from 30 yards to equalise on 59 minutes before Daniele De Rossi put Italy in front with 18 minutes left.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Before Amy Harned goes outside to work in her garden, she coats her face and neck with sunscreen, then puts on a hat, jacket and work gloves. Amy Harned, 48, takes a lot of vitamins and maintains a healthy diet to manage her lupus. The 48-year-old is doing more than protecting herself from dangerous ultraviolet rays. She's trying to keep the sunlight from triggering a flareup of her lupus. Harned, who lives in Webster, Massachusetts, is among the 1.5 million Americans who suffer from the autoimmune disorder. Lupus causes the body's immune system to attack its own tissues, causing inflammation and damage. When Harned's lupus was first diagnosed, she said she ""was really terrified, but gradually I got more information."" She realized with proper treatment she could lead a somewhat normal life. No two cases are alike, experts say. In fact, there are four types of the illness, ranging from mild to severe. Before effective therapies were developed, the disease was fatal more often, usually from overwhelming infection and kidney failure.  Health Minute: Watch more on living with lupus » . The Lupus Foundation of America estimated that more than 16,000 new cases develop every year. More than 90 percent of people with lupus are women, the group says. Experts aren't sure why. ""It clearly has to do with estrogen and estrogen receptors,"" said Lisa Fitzgerald, a Boston, Massachusetts-based rheumatologist. Genetics can play a role as well. Not only does lupus run in families, but, Fitzgerald said, a person may be more susceptible if a relative has other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Environmental factors also may increase risk of the disease. Researchers believe that taking certain prescription medications, and even exposure to sunlight, can trigger the illness. Age is another risk factor. The Lupus Foundation says the condition is most often diagnosed when women are in their childbearing years between 15 and 45. Harned's symptoms developed 15 years ago, when she was 33. ""My first symptoms with lupus were [that] my hands were swollen,"" Harned recalled. ""They were very stiff, to the point that brushing my teeth was hard just holding the toothbrush."" The stiffness and achy joint pain are caused by inflammation brought on by lupus, Fitzgerald said. In addition to swollen joints, she said the other symptoms include fatigue, facial rash, fever, chest pain, swollen glands and sores in the mouth and nose. With such varied symptoms, diagnosis can be tricky. The American College of Rheumatology recommends doctors confirm four of 11 criteria for a proper diagnosis. A blood test and urinalysis are two of the ways doctors determine whether a patient has lupus. Researchers have come a long way in the last 50 years when it comes to understanding the condition, Fitzgerald said. ""The prognosis for lupus today is very good,"" she said. ""The survival rate is really over 90 percent in five to 10 years of having the disease. In the 1950s it was probably 50 percent."" Part of the reason for the improved success has to do with better treatment in managing the condition. Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, naproxen and ibuprofen offer relief to some patients. Other lupus sufferers might be prescribed an antimalarial drug called hydroxychloroquine. ""It's a quinine derivative. It's quite safe,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It can make a big difference for patients who have mild disease."" Fitzgerald added she also prescribes corticosteroids ""to squelch flareups."" While they work well, she cautioned they do have side effects. After 15 years of living with the condition, Harned has her own tricks for coping with lupus. In addition to taking daily prescription drugs, Harned controls the symptoms by eating a healthy diet and exercising, getting enough rest and taking what she called ""a ton of vitamins."" Some experts have touted fish oil and flaxseed as promising complements that may help ease inflammation. Harned also slathers her exposed skin with sunscreen containing SPF 45. ""There is an aspect of ultraviolet light that can damage DNA in the cells,"" Fitzgerald said. ""This sets off an inflammatory reaction that causes the rash we know as lupus rash."" While Harned is fully aware there is no cure for lupus, she described herself as someone who is not just managing her illness, but thriving. When she looks toward the future, she said she thinks, ""I had grandparents who lived into their 90s. So that's what I'm hoping for, maybe even 100.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Andre Rives no longer mows his own lawn and it's not because he's too busy. The thought of cutting his grass brings back some bad memories. ""Man, did this just happen to me?"" Andre Rives asked himself after losing three toes in a mowing accident. Rives, a 28-year-old cable technician from Ellenwood, Georgia, accidentally cut off three toes on his right foot two years ago while trying out his new riding mower. ""I was going too fast and my shorts got caught on the gear shift,"" Rives recalled. ""I came too close to the curb and I couldn't stop. I ended up sliding off and my foot went under."" Rives is one of 100,000 people in the United States in 2006 who suffered an injury in a lawn mower accident. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which tracked the statistics, said the problem is more common than people think. The group reported most injuries occur among adults age 25 to 64, followed by children under the age of 5. More than 22 percent of injuries involved the wrist, hand or finger; nearly 14 percent involved the foot, ankle or toes. ""Most of the time it's a pure accident,"" said Dr. Marvin Royster with the Peachtree Orthopaedic Clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. ""They slipped on the lawn mower, the grass was wet or the lawn mower overturned."" Royster described some injuries, such as burns from touching the muffler, as mild. But other risks are greater; a mower can eject a piece of metal, rock or wood up to 100 mph, he said.  Health Minute: More on lawn mower risks » . In Rives' case, the accident resulted in the amputation of three toes. Royster repaired some of the damage in the operating room but was unable to re-attach the digits. He met with Rives recently for a follow up visit. ""Andre is doing very well,"" the doctor said. ""He has a little trouble with running and getting up on the ball of his foot, but other activities, he's able to do quite well."" The Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons noted that most lawn mower injuries are preventable if some basic safety guidelines are followed. ""The main thing is you need to wear protective clothing,"" Royster cautioned. Wear protective goggles, gloves, boots and long pants. Never mow barefoot or in sandals. ""Mowing the grass with flip-flops on or sandals on, you're just asking for trouble,"" Royster said. Have your lawn mower serviced before the start of the season to ensure it's working properly. Do not remove any safety devices on the machine. Be sure to add fuel before starting the engine, not when it's running or hot. The liquid could overflow or flame up. Finally, keep hands and feet away from the lawn mower blade even if the machine is turned off. Once cleared of an obstruction, a blade can swing around and cause injury. Rives realized immediately after his accident that he made a number of common sense mistakes. ""Even in the hospital, I'd say 'Man, did this just happen to me?' "" He said he's learned his lesson. His wife made him sell his riding mower after the accident. He pays professionals to mow his lawn twice a month. Rives said that in spite of having just two toes remaining on his right foot ""I am not having a pity party for myself. I have to keep going on.""","100,000 people in U.S. suffered  lawn mower accident injury in 2006 .

"ALPHARETTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Ben, who's 15 months old, can already do a lot of things. He can turn on a light or open a door. He can pick up a remote control off the floor. He can pull a heavy object with his teeth. Colise Johnson, 42, spent two weeks in September at a canine training camp getting acquainted with Ben. But Ben, a gangly golden retriever, is more than a family pet. He is a specially trained seizure dog who may one day be able to save the life of his new owner, Colise Johnson. ""Having epilepsy and cerebral palsy is kind of like having a nonstop roller coaster ride,"" said Johnson, 42, of Portland, Oregon. ""You never know what's going to happen, but with him, he slows the ride down so it's manageable."" Johnson, who uses a wheelchair and must wear a helmet because of persistent seizures, is among 3 million Americans who live with some form of epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes recurring seizures, violent muscle spasms or, sometimes, a loss of consciousness. There are no estimates of how many patients are paired up with assistance dogs, and the benefits of having such an animal have not been studied to any great extent. But Dr. Gregory Barkley, a neurologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and an adviser for the Epilepsy Foundation of America, believes nearly a quarter of the people who suffer from frequent, severe seizures might be helped by a canine companion. He said the dogs have ""an unqualified devotion to their master"" that may offer important mental health benefits. The dogs are sometimes credited with powers they really don't possess, Barkley said. ""The dog does not predict a seizure,"" he said. ""It may respond to the earlier stages of a seizure."" Johnson owned a seizure dog for 12 years before he died in 2007, ironically, having his own seizure.  Watch more on Ben and his new owner » . She recalled that the dog, named McKeever, ""told me ahead of time when I was going to have a seizure. ... He helped me get off the floor if I fell, helped me retrieve items, helped me get clothes out of the drawer for a bath, open the fridge on command and took out the recycling."" She said she'd felt lost without McKeever since his death, but that recently changed. Johnson spent two weeks in September at a training camp at Canine Assistants in Alpharetta, Georgia, getting acquainted with Ben. This year, Johnson was one of 1,100 people on the agency's waiting list. Jennifer Arnold founded the nonprofit service in 1991 and has placed more than 1,000 dogs with adults and children with physical disabilities or other special needs. ""We work primarily with people who have mobility issues and have conditions like muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and brain injuries,"" Arnold said. In the past few years, Arnold also helped train 100 seizure dogs to assist people with epilepsy. ""We train them to do basically 90 different commands,"" Arnold said. ""They learn to do things like go for help and press buttons to alert 9-1-1."" Over time, nearly all the dogs eventually develop the ability to identify the onset of a seizure, she said. ""We have no understanding of what it is that alerts the dogs that a seizure is oncoming,"" she said. ""Is it a smell that the body produces? We don't know to what stimuli the dog is responding."" By spending time with epilepsy patients, Arnold's dogs are taught what a seizure looks like and not to be frightened. Some dogs are able to anticipate a seizure 20 to 40 minutes before it happens. ""If the dog feels that their person is going to have a seizure, they tend to get very restless and distressed. ... They show signs of stress and agitation,"" Arnold said. ""Provided their human can read what that means, you have a really good alert system going on there."" Barkley has heard similar anecdotal information from his own epilepsy patients, but many of those dogs were simply family pets and were untrained, he said. He warned patients to be wary of agencies that charge a lot of money for a dog that may or may not be able to perform certain tasks. Canine Assistants offers its dogs free of charge to qualified patients. The group not only covers the cost of airfare and lodging during the training sessions, but it provides a lifetime of food and veterinary care at no cost. Arnold estimated the total value at $20,000 per dog. She said that a third of her company's operating costs are underwritten by large corporate grants. The rest of the money is raised through private donations. Arnold helped train some of the 140 dogs currently at the facility. She said she has no trouble letting the animals go to new homes because she knows they'll serve an important purpose, especially for the epilepsy patients. ""They become a prisoner,"" Arnold said. ""They don't want to leave the house ... they're so vulnerable. Just having this dog with you means that you're not ever alone."" Johnson, the married mother of a 15-year-old, is looking forward to regaining some independence with a new dog in the house. ""He's going to be able to give my family a break. He's going to be able to let them rest a little bit easier,"" she said. She also looked forward to a new reason to get out of bed in the morning. ""With the dog, instead of getting all bummed out or getting depressed over the seizures, I'll spend time with him and play with him and start laughing."" ""These dogs will change your life in such a way you won't know how you've lived without him once you've had them.""","Three million Americans live with epilepsy, which causes recurring seizures .

"(CNN) -- Peru declared a state of emergency in parts of the country after weeks of protests against a mining project, the Andina news agency reported. The state of emergency, which begins Monday, which will last for 60 days in four areas of Cajamarca department, according to Andina. President Ollanta Humala Tasso announced the decision, described as an attempt to re-establish peace in the area, Andina reported. The announcement Sunday came after protests against the construction of a $4.8 billion gold mining project called Conga. The decision came as union leaders refused to stop ongoing protests, Andina reported. Eighteen people were hurt, several by gunshots, following protests on Wednesday, the department's director of health said. The protests took place despite an announcement Tuesday by U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp. that work on the project would be suspended. Newmont, which is based in Denver, Colorado, and describes itself as one of the world's largest oil companies, said it had suspended construction on the project ""for the safety of employees and community members."" It noted that operations there and at the nearby Yanacocha mine ""have experienced intermittent work stoppages as a result of ongoing protests in the region."" The protests began when anti-mining activists expressed concern about the possible impact of the project on the local water supply, the company said in a statement on its website. ""The Conga Environmental Impact Assessment was approved in 2010 after extensive review by the Peruvian government, which included significant engagement and consultation with local communities,"" it said. Critics say the mining project would adversely affect the area's ecosystem and would leave cattle in the zone without access to water.

"(CNN) -- The owner of a Philadelphia art store was arrested Tuesday and charged with smuggling and conspiracy for illegally importing and selling African elephant ivory, according to the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Federal agents seized approximately 1 ton of ivory from Victor Gordon's African art store -- one of the largest government seizures of ivory on record. Gordon, 68, is also allegedly in violation of the Lacey Act, which aims to fight against the trafficking of wildlife, fish and plants that have been obtained illegally, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Gordon allegedly paid a co-conspirator to travel to Africa to buy raw elephant ivory, according to the 10-count felony indictment against him.  He provided his co-conspirators with pictures of ivory carvings and asked that the ivory be designed by African carvers according to his designs, court documents said.  Gordon also asked that the ivory be dyed to give it an antique, older look. He illegally imported the ivory through John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, a statement from the U.S. attorney said. Ivory usually comes from the tusks of elephants.  A high demand for ivory led to a staggering decline in the African elephant population in the 1970s and 1980s, but the killing of elephants for their tusks remains a serious problem, even after laws and international treaties were put in place to prohibit the practice.  The U.S. Endangered Species Act names the African elephant as a threatened species. ""The amount of the elephant ivory allegedly plundered in this case is staggering and highlights the seriousness of the charged crimes,"" said U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch.  ""We all have a responsibility to protect endangered species, both for their sake and for the sake of our own future generations."" Poaching and illegally selling ivory is serious issue in West and Central Africa, where the ivory in the Gordon case came from, the U.S. attorney's statement said. If he is convicted of the charges against him, Gordon could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.","Despite laws against the sale of ivory, demand remains high .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A bomb exploded Saturday at a private hospital in the tourist city of Agra, India, injuring three people. The bomb went off at Jai Hospital's reception area, said Brij Lal, spokesman for Uttar Pradesh police. The hospital is about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the famed Taj Mahal, India's most popular tourist destination. The blast blew out window panes and damaged the hospital's waiting room, where the three injured people were, said P.K. Tiwari, the inspector general of police in Agra. One of them sustain burn injuries. ""It is difficult to say what the cause and motive of the blast were. But we know that this was not a sophisticated device and seems to have not created too much impact,"" Tiwari said. ""My guess is this is a crude bomb."" Police at the scene said they spotted several unclaimed lunch boxes and bicycles near the blast site. India's Home Ministry said it had dispatched commandos to Agra and was in the process of collecting evidence from the scene. The Agra blast occurred a day after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned the nation's senior police officers about India's vulnerability. ""The security environment in the country continues to be uncertain,"" Singh said in remarks at a police conference Friday. ""The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Delhi are grim reminders of the grave challenges posed by terrorism to our national security."" India has suffered a spate of attacks in recent years, including the November 2008 siege of Mumbai that killed 163 people. This month, a bomb inside a briefcase at the high court in the capital, New Delhi, killed 11 people and injured 74 others. The Islamic extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami claimed responsibility for that attack in an e-mail to several TV news channels. Authorities have detained three suspects from the Kashmir region. In July, 19 people were killed in three deadly blasts in Mumbai, India's largest city and financial hub.

"(CNN) -- England and France set themselves on course for the quarterfinals of Rugby's World Cup with their second wins of the competition in New Zealand Sunday. Fellow Six Nations side Wales also revived their hopes with a hard-fought 17-10 win over Samoa after their narrow opening defeat in Pool D to defending champions South Africa. Martin Johnson's England saw off another determined challenge from Georgia 41-10 to stay on top in Pool B, while France beat Canada 46-19. The French were troubled by the Canadians, who only trailed by a converted try after an hour before Damien Traille grabbed a breakaway try and Vincent Clerc crossed twice late on to make the scoreline flattering. Marc Lievremont's team will have to improve against hosts New Zealand in Auckland next Saturday, with the losers likely to face England in the last eight. England were scarcely more impressive against a Georgian team who have impressed in the World Cup and were also in touch at halftime. But England pulled away after the break with Shontayne Hape and Chris Ashton scoring two tries apiece with Delon Armitage and Manu Tuilagi also going over. After the off-field furore involving Mike Tindall, who captained the side in the opening win over Argentina, England were looking for a big performance but Johnson was disappointed with their display. ""If we are happy with those standards we will go home early,"" he told AFP. Wales were behind in Hamilton as they trailed 10-6 at the half, but were sparked into life by winger Shane Williams's 67th-minute try, his eighth in the World Cup.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A number of states, including Georgia, already are putting things in place to opt out of the controversial No Child Left Behind Law, following President Barrack Obama's announcement Friday that states can now apply for waivers. The law, passed in 2001, requires, among other things, that public schools meet targets designed to make all students proficient in math and reading by 2014 or face penalties. The administration will begin reviewing applications to waive some of the demands the law places on states, Obama said Friday. Top education officials in Georgia said Friday that it should be up to each individual state to decide how best to evaluate student performance in the classroom. Following the president's announcement, Georgia State School Superintendent Dr. John Barge described his state's alternative to closing the achievement gap. The College and Career Ready Performance Index, ""lets states determine how they approach the guiding principles,"" Barge said Friday. Georgia is one of a handful of states, including Kentucky, Delaware, and Wisconsin that have expressed interest in waivers seeking flexibility from No Child Left Behind (NCLB). Barge and U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) personally delivered Georgia's request for a waiver to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan Tuesday. Barge said the waiver will give schools more flexibility. ""It will not be a matter of the entire accountability label hinging on a single test,"" he said. Under the administration's new guidelines, states will be encouraged to devise standards of accountability that do not treat all schools the same. ""The purpose is not to give states and districts a reprieve from accountability, but rather to unleash energy to improve our schools at the local level,"" Obama said in a statement. In order to gain approval for waivers, states must present the U.S. Department of Education with credible alternative plans to measure performance. Georgia's proposal focuses on several indicators to measure student performance, including reading, language arts, math, science, and social studies, offering an index that will vary based on grade level. ""With NCLB, science and social studies teachers were not measured to determine adequate yearly progress,"" Georgia Department of Education Communications Director Matt Cardoza said. ""Many times, those teachers would feel their subjects were not as important. Now, there are multiple indicators, including science and social studies."" States that do not apply for waivers will still be expected to meet the guidelines set out by No Child Left Behind. States may submit official applications for waivers by mid-November. Waivers could be granted in early 2010. CNN's Lesa Jansen contributed to this report .","President Obama announces state waivers to No Child Left Behind .

"(CNN) -- Months after rescuers found them struggling and covered in oil, 33 endangered and threatened young sea turtles are finally going home to the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Audubon Nature Institute freed the turtles Thursday in waters about 40 miles southwest of Grand Isle, Louisiana. This marked the latest mass release of turtles since about 500 were rescued in the weeks and months after the massive months-long oil spill. ""We were able to release these turtles because they're now healthy, and we're seeing recovery in the surface habitats of the Gulf of Mexico,"" NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco said in a news release. The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 men. Two days later, the platform sank and oil started gushing into the Gulf. In early August, owner BP used cement and mud to plug the damaged Gulf of Mexico well. Officials formally declared an end to the oil spill disaster on September 19, though considerable efforts remained to clean up area waters and revive wildlife affected by the spill. Earlier this month, NOAA reopened federal waters off the Louisiana coast to fishing. Thursday's release marked another milestone in the area's recovery, according to those involved. ""Returning this group of sea turtles to their home waters is ... a sign that Louisiana is on the path towards recovery,"" said Randy Pausina, an assistant secretary for Louisiana's office of fisheries. The 33 turtles had been rescued more than three months ago by federal officials and state wildlife authorities from Louisiana, Florida and Georgia, as well as the Riverhead Foundation and the In-Water Research Group. They were rehabilitated at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans. They included green, Kemp's ridley and hawksbill sea turtles, which are classified as endangered species. There also were loggerheads, which are a threatened species. With 270 turtles having been cleaned, nursed back to health and released, there are more than 200 still in rehabilitation sites around the area. Scientists did extensive aerial and shipboard tests earlier this week on the waters near the release point, making sure the sargassum algae was clean. Young turtles thrive in such areas, which provide protection from predators and ample food, including small crabs, snails and other creatures. ""Six months ago, it was nearly impossible to imagine this day would ever come,"" said Ron Forman, the Audubon Nature Institute's CEO and president.","The turtles were among 500 rescued after the mammoth months-long oil spill .

"(CNN) -- Three years after the killing of Mexican journalist Armando Rodriguez, his colleagues said they are more determined than ever to write about the nation's drug cartels despite the risks. ""Those who ordered the killing of Armando were wrong because those who are left are more seasoned and we are working,"" said Luz del Carmen Sosa, a reporter for El Diario de Juarez newspaper who took over Rodriguez's crime beat after his death. ""Those who believed we were going to take step back, they were wrong."" On November 13, 2008, Rodriguez -- called ""El Choco"" by his colleagues because of his chocolate skin tone -- was about to take his two young daughters to school when a man approached the garage of his house and fired 11 shots into his chest. His daughters, one of whom witnessed the attack, have not spoken publicly since the incident and did not attend a memorial event for their father on Sunday. Rodriguez's wife declined an interview request from CNN. His colleagues believe he was targeted because of his coverage of drug cartels in the border town of Ciudad Juarez. Before his death, Rodriguez was among the first journalists to write at length about the violent shift in the city. He was a high-profile reporter for the most-read paper in the city, covering a dangerous beat. It was a job his friends believe cost him his life. Local reporters now look at the killing as the first of many targeting journalists for their work. Since 2000, 74 journalists have been killed in Mexico -- 14 since 2010. On the third anniversary of his death, his newsroom colleagues gathered Sunday to pay tribute and ""remember Choco ... friend, journalist, family man and a great man,"" the paper's editorial assistant Pedro Torres said at the public event. His colleagues criticized the investigation into his unsolved killing, saying it is an example of the hundreds of unsolved murders throughout the city -- widely considered to be one of the most violent in the world. Sandra Rodriguez Nieto, an El Diario reporter, said she believes that someone is ""hiding those responsible"" for Rodriguez's death. It's a charge prosecutors with the Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office have denied. Early in the investigation they announced the detention of a suspect in the shooting, but never released details about who they held. The lack of information led to speculation among El Diario's newspaper staff that there was a cover up. Making matters more complicated were attacks on the investigators working on the case. In July 2009, a convoy carrying JosÃ© Ibarra LimÃ³n, the first federal prosecutor designated to Rodriguez's case, was riddled with bullets by unknown assailants. The following August, Pasillas Paul Fong, the secretary of the Seventh Agency who would inherit the case, was executed. Days later, a third investigator took the case, only to flee Juarez soon afterward. ""This is a situation that hurts, an unacceptable situation,"" Torres said. Of the five publications in Juarez, El Diario de Juarez is the most popular paper in terms of circulation and has made a reputation for aggressively covering drug violence. In September 2010, two of the paper's photographers were attacked -- one was killed. A clear motive was never established, but investigators at the time did note the car carrying the two young journalists was registered to the son of the inspector of the State Human Rights Commission, Gustavo de la Rosa Hickerson. Some believe the journalists were not the intended targets of the attack. On the same day friends and family buried the slain photographer, the newspaper published an open letter to the drug cartels operating in Juarez. The letter, written by the editorial staff, pleaded for an end to violence against journalists. No newspaper in Juarez had ever published an editorial directly addressed to the cartels; and no other paper has done so since. ""You are, at present, the de facto authorities in this city,"" the letter said, ""because the legal institutions have not been able to keep our colleagues from dying."" In the wake of Rodriguez's death, del Carmen Sosa said she has no fear and was ready to take full responsibility for her work, even if it means death. She said she operates under the same mantra as her predecessor. ""Unlike Armando Luis Carlos (Rodriquez), I'm alive,"" del Carmen Sosa said. ""I try to be responsible with my journalism and I have no fear."" In 2010, she was presented with an award for her courageous reporting. ""I can only thank God every day ... because we need justice not only for Armando but for all the homicides in this city,"" she said.","Since 2000, 74 journalists have been killed in Mexico -- 14 since 2010 .

"Miami (CNN) -- Tilikum, the killer whale that killed a SeaWorld trainer last year, has returned to the stage at the Orlando, Florida, theme park. Tilikum made his return appearance Wednesday morning in front of an audience in the ""Believe"" show. Trainer Dawn Brancheau was killed on February 24, 2010, when the killer whale -- commonly known as an orca -- grabbed her ponytail and pulled her under the water in front of horrified visitors. Brancheau died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's office said at the time of the accident. Anthony Frogameni, Brancheau's nephew, said the family did not want to comment on Tilikum's return. ""From the start we've decided, it's a large family we all have our different opinions but we're just not going to talk about that aspect of it -- we're only going to focus on Dawn, "" Frogameni said. The Dawn Brancheau Foundation, which her family founded in her memory, says that the 40-year-old trainer's hair was especially long the day she was killed because she was growing it out to donate it to Locks of Love. The nonprofit organization provides hairpieces to disadvantaged children dealing with long-term hair loss due to medical treatment. SeaWorld had not answered written questions from CNN as of Wednesday evening, but did issue a statement saying Tilikum's participation in the shows was ""an important component of his physical, social and mental enrichment."" Since the accident last year, trainers no longer go into the water with any of the orcas at SeaWorld parks. In August, SeaWorld was fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one in connection with Brancheau's death. The agency's investigation ""revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando,"" the OSHA statement said. On this day when Tilikum is the star of the show, Frogameni says, ""We want people to remember Dawn's life, not that tragic accident.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The public may have seen the last video images of the failed blowout preventer from the BP oil well disaster, as authorities expressed possible security concerns. The feed from a camera on board a salvage ship was discontinued Saturday after the apparatus was raised from the sea floor and placed on the vessel Q4000. At his regular briefing with reporters Wednesday, National Incident Commander Thad Allen said additional questions about the unit would now have to go to the U.S. Justice Department and the Joint Investigation Team. When pressed about the video feed, Allen said, ""We'll have to refer that to the Department of Justice. There were some constraints put on that videotaping based on the people that are looking at the blowout preventer and their identities and so forth, and I think there's, there may be some security issues associated with it."" Allen said the ship will carry the unit to shore, but that the timetable and other questions will no longer be something he can address as part of the disaster operations that he heads. As of Wednesday, he said, ""the blowout preventer is already up on deck on the Q4000. The lower marine riser package has been separated, and they're putting it on latching skids getting ready to move it closer to shore."" He said ""exactly when it arrives and what the disposition would be, I would refer you to the Department of Justice, or the Joint Investigation Team,"" since ""from this point out it doesn't involve the spill itself.""

"(CNN) -- Actor and author Hill Harper wants you to live your life and understand what true wealth is. ""The word courage, one of my favorite words, the root or the etymology of that word is 'cour,' which means heart,"" he said. ""I think true courage is actually following your heart and not getting or succumbing to what other people's definition of what your life should be. Live your life."" Harper, who once wanted to be a professional football player, tells me the story of how he accomplished that himself, thanks to the advice of an uncle. ""I had all this student loan debt, and I had this six-figure legal job offer in corporate law coming out of Harvard Law School. There were job opportunities there, particularly out of this high-end law firm,"" he said. Harper has a bachelor of arts degree from Brown University, where he studied acting, and a masters in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government, which is a part of Harvard. He says many people told him to take the legal job offer to pay off his debt. They advised him to pursue his passion of acting later. His Uncle Frank recognized he was only looking at the legal job for the salary. ""'Let me tell you, if you're ever making a decision and the principle reason you'll do it is because of money, then it is absolutely the incorrect decision,'"" Harper said his uncle advised. Harper emphasizes that money can be a factor, but it should not be the primary one. ""I went on to take a job waiting tables from 11 at night to 7 in the morning at a diner. Fighting rush hour traffic to get home by 8 to go to sleep. Wake up at noon or 1 to audition for films and go to acting class in the evening and maybe come home and get a nap between 9:30 and 10 and go to work again at 11,"" he said. ""I certainly wasn't making as much money as I would have at a law firm, but I was following my heart."" Known for his roles in ""CSI: NY "" and ""Beloved,"" Spike Lee gave Harper his first big acting break when he hired him to play one of the leads of his movie ""Get on the Bus."" Harper has written three books that have been on The New York Times best-seller list. His first one, ""Letters to a Young Brother: MANifest Your Destiny,"" won the American Library Association Award for Best Books for Young Adults in 2007.

"Cairo (CNN) -- A Syrian-born broadcaster and activist working in Egypt said Saturday his kidnapped wife was found and taken to a hospital. ""My wife was found in a bad medical condition on a street in the suburbs of Cairo by a woman who took her to the hospital,"" said Thaer al-Nashef. ""I am on my way to see her now."" Media coverage likely led to the release, said al-Nashef, indicating the abductors ""were probably paid thugs."" Egyptian police did not immediately confirm his account. Thaer al-Nashef, who describes himself as a ""political activist against the Syrian regime,"" said Friday he believed the kidnapping of his pregnant 25-year-old wife, Mona al-Gharib, was the work of Syrian intelligence agents operating in the country. There was no response from the Syrian government about the allegations. Egyptian police confirmed that al-Nashef filed a police report about his wife's disappearance on Friday. Al-Nashef said he went to the general prosecutor's office Saturday and was told officials have the phones of the suspected kidnappers under surveillance. Al-Nashef said he was alerted to the alleged kidnapping by a text message. ""We have kidnapped your wife, you dirty dog, so you don't insult your master again,"" al-Nashef quoted the text as saying. Al-Nashef said he received further text messages from the alleged kidnappers, including one that threatened that his wife would be raped, and another saying his wife would be killed if he went to the media with the story. A message sent Saturday, he said, read: ""The Nile will deliver your wife's dead body. You killed her by opening with your big mouth to the media. You are next."" Al-Nashef's wife is an Egyptian citizen and a student at Azhar University, he said. She is six months pregnant with their second child, he said. Al-Nashef said the messages came from an Egyptian number. Al-Nashef is a freelance journalist in Egypt and serves as a TV anchor for several networks, including January 25 TV, which was launched after the revolution, which toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The Syrian government has been accused of seeking retribution against relatives of Syrian activists working against the Bashar al-Assad regime from abroad. The U.S. State Department announced this summer that it had received reports that Syrian mission personnel had been conducting video surveillance of people participating in peaceful demonstrations in the United States.","The woman is the wife of a freelance TV anchor in Egypt .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Military police poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday in hopes of stopping clashes between protesters and police, as the Egyptian government said a truce had been declared through a group of clerics. The truce lasted about three hours. CNN saw military police lined up, separating protesters from the police. But after a period of calm, some protesters began throwing rocks at soldiers. Riot police responded with tear gas; the unrest continued late Wednesday. Some army soldiers tried to stop security forces from shooting tear gas, but they were outnumbered. On state-run TV, the government said religious scholars were on their way ""to form a human shield between the protesters and the security forces."" CNN saw no sign of a human shield of clerics. But along the barricades separating protesters from security forces, some clerics were talking to protesters, trying to negotiate. Egypt's grand mufti, the country's highest religious official, called on police to put down their weapons and ""never aim"" firearms at the Egyptian people. In an audio message aired by Egyptian state TV, he called for a ""peaceful protest for Egypt's sake."" Protesters reached Fahmi Street, which leads to the Interior Ministry, and were trying to surround the ministry, state-run Al-Masriya TV said. Earlier, police pulled back from Mohamed Mahmoud Street, the site of clashes throughout the five days of the latest uprising. Adel Saeed, spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said ""a truce has been reached between the protesters and the security forces at the Ministry of Interior through several leading religious scholars."" It was not immediately clear who may have been represented in the discussions to which Saeed referred. Mohamed Mahmoud Street leads from Tahrir Square -- the center of the protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak as president in February and of the most recent demonstrations -- toward the Interior Ministry. During a lull in the street battles earlier Wednesday, CNN saw riot police embracing and kissing some young people who were taking part in the demonstrations. Minutes later, rocks and tear gas were in the air again. Protesters erected barriers using debris from burned-out cars and large trash bins in case the battles resumed. Crowds have packed Tahrir Square since Saturday, calling for the nation's military rulers to step down immediately. The demonstrations Wednesday were a vociferous rejection of Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, field marshal of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, who delivered an address Tuesday aimed at calming the protests. ""The people demand the downfall of the council of shame,"" some demonstrators chanted Wednesday. Through the state-run news agency MENA, the government said that the army was ""exerting all efforts to stop bloodshed of Egyptians"" and that the military had deployed three armored vehicles to Mohamed Mahmoud Street. The death toll in the latest clashes has risen to 35, including 31 people in Cairo and four in other cities, state-run television said Wednesday. The number of wounded is up to 3,250, according to Hisham Sheeha, spokesman for Egypt's Health Ministry. Saeed, of the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said 312 people had been arrested since Saturday. Security forces could be seen making arrests Wednesday. Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim was among those arrested, according to Karim Amer, a film producer who said he was with her when she was filming events close to the Interior Ministry. ""The military started firing tear gas so we all ran in different directions and I lost her,"" Amer said. ""She called me and said she was arrested by military. "" A CNN e-mail to noujaimfilms.com, which lists Noujaim as director, was not immediately returned. Meanwhile, the mother of one of the three American students detained in Egypt said Wednesday that she was able to speak to him briefly in a telephone call arranged by U.S. diplomats. ""He sounded scared, but he said he was OK,"" Joy Sweeney said of her son, Derrik Sweeney, one of three American college students being held for questioning in an Egyptian courthouse, accused by authorities of throwing Molotov cocktails in Tahrir Square. The students will be detained another four days as an investigation continues, said a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor. An official from the U.S. consular office visited the students, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Katharina Gollner-Sweet. The chaos and fighting have raised new questions about Egypt's future less than a week before parliamentary elections are set to begin. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called on Egypt ""to end the clearly excessive use of force."" ""Some of the images coming out of Tahrir, including the brutal beating of already subdued protesters, are deeply shocking, as are the reports of unarmed protesters being shot in the head,"" Pillay said in a statement. ""There should be a prompt, impartial and independent investigation, and accountability for those found responsible for the abuses that have taken place should be ensured."" After Mubarak's ouster, military leaders took control with the promise that eventually a civilian government would be elected and take over. Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country. Many also have voiced anger about a proposed constitutional change that would shield the military's budget from scrutiny by civilian powers. They say they worry the military would become a state within a state. Members of the nation's Cabinet offered to resign Monday, with one minister citing concern over the violence in Tahrir Square. Tantawi of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said the resignations were accepted, but the current government will remain as a caretaker until a prime minister is named to form a new government. Speaking Tuesday on Egyptian TV, Tantawi said the armed forces were ""only concerned about the security of the country and the interests of the country,"" and want to ""establish democracy for the people of Egypt.""

"(CNN) -- Fernando Torres rediscovered his scoring touch with a double at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea romped to a 5-0 win over Genk in their Champions League Group E match Wednesday. The Spanish international striker had not scored in European club football for over two years, but looked dangerous throughout and might easily have had a hat-trick. The Belgian visitors were up against it from the start and after Torres hit the post, Raul Mereiles scored with a thumping shot from outside the penalty area. Torres was soon on the score sheet with a neat side foot effort and added his second with a well-placed header from a Mereiles cross. Branislav Ivanovic headed home from a Florent Malouda free kick for the fourth just before halftime. Torres, who was rested at the weekend, looked sharp as he went in search of his third and he was denied by Genk keeper Laszlo Koteles only for Salomon Kalou to grab the fifth from the rebound. Chelsea lead Bayer Leverkusen by a point after the German side beat Valencia 2-1 in the other Group E match. Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack was the inspiration for Leverkusen, who fell behind to a goal from Brazil striker Jonas. But they hit back through goals by midfielders Andre Schuerrle and Sidney Sam after the break, with ex-Germany captain Ballack setting up the winner with a superb defense-splitting pass. Meanwhile in Group F,  Arsenal made sure it was a good night for English Premier League sides with a last-gasp victory over Marseille in the Stade Velodrome. The game was headed for a 0-0 draw when substitute Aaron Ramsey cropped up for the precious winner as Arsenal go top of the group by a point from their French opponents. Olympiakos of Greece beat German champions Borussia Dortmund 3-1 in the other match in the group to keep alive their hopes of qualification for the knockout stages. Jose Holebas, a German player of Greek descent, headed the opener for the home side after just eight minutes. Dortmund deservedly leveled through Polish striker Robert Lewandowski midway through the first half, but five minutes before the break Rafik Djebbour restored the Olympiakos lead. With the visitors pressing, Olympiakos broke upfield to win a free kick and defender Francois Modesto headed home from Ariel Ibagaza's delivery to seal the victory.","Chelsea beat Genk 5-0 in Champions League E match at Stamford Bridge .

"Cedar Key, Florida (CNN) -- Two weeks after BP plugged its damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico with cement and mud from above, the next step in the process to permanently shut down the apparatus is in limbo as scientists gauge the risks posed by pressure inside the well. ""Our first goal is to do no harm,"" Thad Allen, the government's point man in the Gulf, said in a teleconference Wednesday. The procedure the first week of August was called a ""static kill."" The timeline for the next step -- the ""bottom kill"" -- is unknown, as scientists try to determine which of two methods would work best to mitigate the pressure issues, Allen said. Crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on July 15, then replace the well's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby Development Driller II in the Gulf. The other option would require BP to devise a pressure-relief device for the current capping stack. Once crews get their marching orders, it will take them about four days to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the ""bottom kill"" process of plugging the well from below will begin. Allen said Wednesday cementing will require another several days. Allen also told reporters that seafood coming from reopened Gulf fishing waters is safe to eat. ""There's no problem with Gulf seafood. It's being tested more than any other seafood out there right now,"" Allen said. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco echoed Allen's comments about Gulf seafood, saying that where water may still be tainted, no fishing is allowed. ""Twenty-two percent of federal waters in the Gulf remain closed because we have not yet determined it's safe"" to eat seafood from there, Lubchenco said in the same teleconference.  She added that scientists are continuing to conduct testing in the areas that have reopened. Wednesday is the last day that BP will accept claims from people and businesses affected by the Gulf oil disaster.  After that, the oil giant will direct people to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, led by attorney Kenneth Feinberg. Feinberg is charged with independently administering the $20 billion escrow account established by BP to compensate for damage caused by the Gulf disaster. At a town hall meeting in Houma, Louisiana, Wednesday morning, one woman accused Feinberg of working for BP, accidentally referring to him as ""Mr. BP."" ""This facility is going to be much more generous, much more efficient, and much quicker than BP,"" Feinberg responded. ""If anyone here thinks I am not independent and am merely an arm of BP, don't participate. It's a voluntary program."" Feinberg promised that eligible individuals who submit a claim would get a check in 48 hours and eligible business claims would be paid in no more than seven days. But he acknowledged that he'd have to earn the trust of fishermen and others who say they've received conflicting information about the oil spill response from BP and various government agencies. ""There is only one way that I will earn your trust,"" Feinberg said Wednesday, ""and that is paying the claims."" Others at the town complained that income they've received from BP for helping respond to the spill would be deducted from their payments, pointing out that those who stayed home would be eligible for more money. ""There are very few people that I've met here in the gulf that are in emergency situations, desperate to pay their mortgages and put food on their tables that have not sought other work, other employment,"" Feinberg told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday in response to such grievances. BP, which said Tuesday it has paid $368 million in claims so far, will continue to handle claims by government entities. On Tuesday, a major environmental watchdog group called for more stringent testing of seafood from the Gulf of Mexico, where the fall shrimping season began this week. The state of Alabama just reopened its coastal waters to fishing and shrimping on Monday. The National Resources Defense Council released a statement saying it sent letters to the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, co-signed by almost two dozen Gulf coast groups. The letters asked the government agencies to: . -- Ensure that there is comprehensive monitoring of seafood contamination. -- Ensure public disclosure of all seafood monitoring data and methods. -- Ensure that fishery reopening criteria protect the most vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women and subsistence fishing communities. ""With the opening of shrimping season and near-daily reopening of fishing areas, seafood safety is a major issue right now,"" Dr. Gina Solomon, a senior scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, said in the statement. ""The government needs to show it is putting strong safety criteria and testing standards in place to ensure that the seafood from the Gulf will be safe to eat in the months and years to come."" The oil spill has hampered the seafood business across the Gulf as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off-limits amid safety concerns. With the once-gushing well capped temporarily for more than a month now, NOAA and the Gulf states have started lifting those restrictions. Pete Barber, president of the Alabama Seafood Association, told CNN affiliate WALA that although the waters are open and the shrimp have been deemed safe, that doesn't mean seafood buyers want it. ""We've had major distributors call up some of our processors who have been working with them for years, generations, and they've basically said, 'We don't want Gulf product,'"" Barber said. ""Some of those boats have their hulls full of shrimp and no one that's eagerly looking to buy them."" While some shrimpers are eager to get back out, many are still working for BP, which has hired boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines. But the need for skimmers appears to be winding down. The state of Louisiana said Tuesday that of 343 operational skimmers, only 40 were sent out Monday in search of oil -- and they came back to shore with 100 cubic yards of debris, but not even one gallon of oil. Two reports published Tuesday express concern about the lingering effects of oil spilled from the ruptured BP well. Researchers at the University of South Florida have concluded that oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico farther east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at the University of South Florida. In addition, a team from Georgia Sea Grant and the University of Georgia released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that gushed from the well ""has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem,"" the university said in a release. The Georgia study ""strongly contradicts"" a 2-week-old government report saying that only 26 percent of the oil spilled from the well remains in the Gulf. Lubchenco addressed the discrepancy Wednesday, saying the Georgia study was based on different parameters than the federal study and, ""We stand by the numbers we released in the oil budget."" ""We have said all along there is dispersed oil subsurface -- that oil is out there, "" she said. ""It is dilute, in parts per million"" but ""dilute and dispersed does not mean benign."" The NOAA chief said scientists will ""continue to do additional monitoring and refine the estimate"" as new information comes to light. The government believes the water is clean enough for at least one form of sea life to abide. Allen, Lubchenco and some biologists reintroduced 23 sea turtles to the Gulf off Cedar Key, Florida, Wednesday morning. The Kemp's ridley sea turtles had been cleaned and de-oiled at the Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans, and at Gulf World in Panama City, Florida. Then, they were temporarily housed at SeaWorld Orlando, Mote Marine Laboratory, and the Florida Aquarium, NOAA said in a press release Wednesday. To date, approximately 500 live turtles have been rescued during the Gulf oil spill, and more than 450 stranded or captured turtles have had visible evidence of external oil. Approximately 350 turtles are still in rehabilitation facilities and will be released as they are given clean bills of health, according to NOAA. The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 men. Two days later, the platform sank and oil started gushing into the Gulf.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Thousands of anti-riot police were in the streets of Bangladesh's capital city Thursday as the opposition alliance launched a day-long general strike in protest of a fuel price hike. The strike, occurring all over the country, paralyzed daily life as road communications were heavily disrupted and schools and business establishments remained closed on Thursday, the last working day of the week. The usually busy streets of the capital, Dhaka, looked almost deserted as most means of public and private transportation remained off the roads. The opposition group Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies, mostly Islamic parties, called the strike after the government raised the price of petroleum fuels and compressed national gas on Sunday. Dhaka's police chief, Benazir Ahmed, said his department deployed 13,000 policemen alone in the capital to break up any opposition protests, and the home ministry also initiated mobile courts to try protesters summarily on the streets. Police said that the strike was mostly peaceful apart from a few incidents of violence, but the opposition parties said the police and the ruling party men beat up their activists wherever they had tried to bring out a procession. Police said they had arrested some 200 people from different parts of the country, but the opposition claimed that the number was at least 400. The BNP acting secretary general, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, said, ""The government has increased fuel prices at a time when people's suffering has already peaked due to high inflation."" But the government said it was an ""issueless"" strike. The general secretary of the ruling Awami League, Syed Ashraful Islam, said it was illogical as the prices of fuel oils were still lower in Bangladesh (a liter of gasoline costs US$ 1.06) than in the international market. ""If the prices of fuel oils increase in the global market in the future, the government will increase the prices again because the government will need to pay huge subsidies otherwise,"" he added. The fuel price hike, the second such rise in four months, triggered protests also by transport owners.","Dhaka police put 13,000 officers in the streets in that one city, police chief says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were pushing to complete the well at the heart of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill before the disaster, but no ""conscious decision"" to cut corners on safety has been discovered, a presidential commission reported Monday. ""There seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19th-April 20th time period,"" said Bob Graham, the commission's co-chairman. ""And as a result of that, a number of things which might have made the outcome of this plight different were deferred or abandoned."" The undersea gusher erupted with an April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing a well for the oil giant BP at the time of the blast. The rig sank two days later, taking 11 men to a watery grave and unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The well was about 45 days behind schedule, and Fred Bartlit, the commission's chief counsel, said BP's operating costs for the leased rig were running about $1.5 million per day. Those costs were ""overhanging the heads of people on the rigs,"" Bartlit said -- ""but they don't want their buddies to get killed, or themselves."" ""To date, we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety,"" he said. But as the commission opened two days of new hearings into the disaster on Monday, Graham questioned why the timing was ""so central"" to managers that they did not examine the well's cementing job more closely. ""I would hope that tomorrow we get down to the question of just what was driving for a decision on that particular narrow 24 hours,"" added Graham, a former U.S. senator and Florida governor. In its preliminary findings, the commission criticized BP for shifting its plans for capping the completed well. At one point, one of the ""company men"" on the doomed rig was unaware of changes being planned back on shore, staff attorney Sean Grimsley said. Mark Bly, BP's executive vice president for safety, told the commission he and the company ""don't exactly agree"" with the findings. ""In our work we went through what turned out to be the eight critical things we thought had contributed causally here,"" he said. ""We clearly identified the failure to isolate at the bottom of the well and the negative test and, subsequently, the monitoring, so we didn't see the procedures here as particular to that. We felt they were covered in the other things that we described."" Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, an outspoken critic of BP, said the company has ""a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits."" ""When the culture of a company favors risk-taking and cutting corners above other concerns, systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or tradeoffs being considered,"" Markey said in a written statement on Monday's findings. The Massachusetts Democrat leads the House Energy and Commerce committee's energy and environmental subcommittee. Still pending are test results on the rig's blowout preventer, the massive fail-safe device that was supposed to shut down the well in case emergency. Federal authorities took control of the preventer in September and have turned it over to a Norwegian engineering firm to analyze the device ""from soup to nuts,"" Bartlit said. BP, rig owner Transocean and cement contractor Halliburton have pointed fingers at each other since the rig sank. As the well's owner, BP was responsible for capping the ruptured well and cleaning up the more than 200 million gallons of oil that spilled. The well was sealed temporarily in mid-July and capped permanently on September 19. Lab test results should have prompted managers to redesign the cement slurry used to line the well, the committee reported. In addition, the Transocean drill crew also could have diverted the escaping hydrocarbons overboard or triggered the rig's emergency disconnect before the blast, which could have shut in the well and ""limited the impact of any explosion and/or the blowout,"" the commission stated. Managers for both BP and Transocean treated a pressure test as a ""complete success"" despite repeated signs showing that the cement job was not containing the high-pressure oil and gas, the commission found. Co-chairman William Reilly, a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the evidence so far indicates a ""culture of complacency"" on the part of both industry and regulators, including the since-disbanded Minerals Management Service. ""If we had not been complacent, I suppose the most obvious reality is we would not have experienced two full months of a gushing well leading to 200 million gallons being spilled,"" Reilly said. ""We would not have seen Congress underfund the regulatory agency consistently over the better part of the last 20 years, and the consequent failure of MMS to rise to the challenges posed by technologies that simply became so sophisticated that they scarcely were any match for the people they were regulating."" The commission's final report is due January 11. Investigations are also under way by the Justice Department, several congressional committees and a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department board. Unlike those agencies, however, the presidential commission does not have the power to subpoena witnesses -- an issue Bartlit raised several times. ""We get a lot of arguments,"" he told Graham at one point. ""This is where subpoena power, senator, would be helpful, because it's going to be hard to resolve those unless I can sit people down in a room in a very professional, gentlemanly way and cross examine them and find out, you know, what's believable and what's not believable.""

"(CNN) -- Forty-three soldiers suffered heat-related illnesses Friday during a 12-mile road march at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, an Army spokesman said. The march was the culmination of a week of ""expert field medical badge training,"" during which soldiers are tested on their medic and general soldier skills in order to receive an ""expert"" badge, Fort Bragg spokesman Benjamin Abel said. Sixty soldiers were on the march, which started at 6 a.m., and they were carrying backpacks, helmets, weapons and other combat gear, Abel said. About an hour and a half into the march, the people running the event noticed some personnel ""were having difficulties,"" and medical transports were begun, he said. Eighteen of the soldiers were transported to Womack Army Medical Center, and one was admitted to the intensive care unit, he said. Humidity levels Friday morning were higher than expected, but ""this is odd, out of the norm, to have this many people treated,"" Abel added. The expert field medical badge is deemed by the Army as ""the utmost challenge to the professional competence and physical endurance of the soldier medic,"" Fort Bragg officials said in a statement earlier this week. ""It is the most sought-after peacetime award in the Army Medical Department, and while the combat medical badge is the 'portrait of courage' in wartime, the expert field medical badge is undoubtedly the 'portrait of excellence' in the Army all of the time,"" officials said. ""To wear the EFMB means you passed a grueling series of hands-on-tests on communications, common skill tasks, emergency medical treatment, evacuation of the sick and wounded, litter obstacle course, day/night land navigation courses, comprehensive written test, 12-mile foot march, CPR, physical fitness test, and weapons qualification,"" the base said.

"(CNN) -- A judge subpoenaed the Spanish king's son-in-law Thursday in a corruption case that has drawn increased scrutiny to the royal family. Inaki Urdangarin, the Duke of Palma de Mallorca, must testify on February 6, a Spanish court said in a statement. The case, widely reported in Spanish media for weeks, has fueled public criticism of the royal family. Thursday's statement from the Balearic Islands Superior Court of Justice formally named Urdangarin as a defendant, but did not specify charges against him. According to media reports, authorities have been investigating whether a foundation headed by Urdangarin improperly used public funds. Mario Pascual Vives, an attorney representing Urdangarin, told reporters Thursday that his client is ""absolutely innocent."" Vives said Urdangarin, who lives in Washington, was on a skiing trip in the United States and had not spoken with him about the case since the court's announcement Thursday. Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, married the Spanish king's youngest daughter in 1997. The corruption allegations have brought increased scrutiny to the monarchy as Spain faces a nationwide economic crisis. The court's announcement came a day after Spain's royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time in an effort to boost public confidence and transparency. An announcement by the royal palace that Urdangarin will not participate in official family activities during the investigation and remarks by King Juan Carlos in his Christmas Eve speech that ""justice is equal for everyone"" have deflected public criticisms of the royal family, according to Gerardo Correas of the International School of Protocol in Madrid. A large round of applause greeted the king at an inauguration ceremony for the new legislature earlier this week, Correas said. But many Spaniards were still buzzing over the political scandal -- with some asking whether other members of the royal family were connected to, or aware of, Urdangarin's business dealings. ""The debate continues in the street and will continue for a long time,"" Correas said. CNN's Ana Maria Luengo-Romero and Miguel Angel Antonanzas contributed to this report.","A Spanish court says Inaki Urdangarin must testify on February 6 .

"(Health.com) -- Amanda Santos wanted to send her 5-year-old daughter, Skylar, to a small private school. But after they interviewed, met the teachers, and submitted Skylar's medical records, they never heard back from the school, despite repeated inquiries. Santos, who lives in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, can't say for sure why communication was cut off so abruptly, but she's convinced that Skylar's severe nut allergy was an issue. ""They knew going in that she had an allergy; they said it was no problem,"" says Santos. ""But until we sat down and had a meeting about the precautions they'd have to take -- kids washing their hands, asking parents not to send nuts to school, that kind of thing -- they didn't realize how severe it was. I just think they didn't want her there, didn't want to deal with all of that."" Health.com: The latest on food allergies . Santos is not alone. According to a new study conducted in the U.K., families with children who are living with this potentially life-threatening condition often feel isolated, stigmatized, or unfairly excluded from activities, due to the allergies. In many ways, nut allergies feel more like a disability than a chronic illness because of the stigma, the researchers say. ""Families reported some really very difficult and unpleasant experiences when they were trying to keep their child safe from risk,"" says coauthor Mary Dixon-Woods, professor of medical sociology at the University of Leicester. She was surprised by the study's results. ""I was expecting to hear about problems with labeling and so on, but the extent of the stigma families reported was very troubling,"" she says. Peanuts are the most common food trigger of life-threatening anaphylactic shock, accounting for more than half of all fatal food-induced allergic reactions. Peanut allergies are on the rise, doubling in children between 1997 and 2002. About 1% of children in the U.S. have peanut allergies. Health.com: 8 Reasons to delay vaccines for kids . Along with the rise in nut allergies have come more restrictions on schools and other public places, including nut-free classrooms and airplanes, as well as better labeling for products. In recent years, there has been a bit of backlash against the greater focus on nut allergies. In 2008, Harvard Medical School professor Nicholas A. Christakis published in the journal BMJ an editorial called ""This allergies hysteria is just nuts."" While noting that allergies are a real problem, he wrote about the ""overabundance of caution"" at his children's school and an incident in which a school bus was evacuated because a peanut was found on the floor. To determine some of the challenges faced by parents of children with nut allergies, Dixon-Woods and her colleagues interviewed 26 families about their coping strategies and techniques for avoiding dangerous situations. They found, however, that these parents were routinely made to feel that such allergies were nothing but a ""frivolous and self-indulgent fad invented and maintained by attention-seeking people."" Health.com: The healthiest vacuum cleaners for your home . Parents interviewed for the study frequently encountered skepticism or hostility when they tried to explain their children's allergies to others, says Dixon-Woods. Birthday parties became ""nightmares,"" and even just sending kids to school or leaving them with friends or family was terrifying. Interview transcripts from the study reveal several scenarios in which parents felt ridiculed, ignored, or challenged on the subject of food allergies. · In the lunchroom at school, children might feel bullied. ""She was teased and things like that, people saying...'I've got nuts and I'm gonna come and touch you,'"" said one participant. · Said one participant about a family camping trip: ""He'd caught her sort of pulling faces and complaining to other people that they'd had to put the peanuts away...they all laughed and it was awful..."" · At a social gathering, the hosts thought the family was overdramatizing the problem. ""We got invited up for a party...gave them a list of what he could eat,"" said one study participant. ""[We] walked in there and I couldn't believe my eyes, big bowls of peanuts in between all the food."" · Forgetful or disbelieving relatives aren't uncommon. In one family, a grandparent gave a child candy with nuts. ""Now whether it was deliberate or not, I don't know, but I blew a fuse,"" said one participant. ""I suppose in my heart of hearts I felt that he'd given it deliberately; my husband doesn't want to believe that his father would do that."" The study, published Monday in the journal Chronic Illness, was funded by the British charity Midlands Asthma and Allergy Research Association. Dixon-Woods agrees that better food labeling, more education, and stricter regulation is necessary to reduce misunderstanding and negative attitudes about nut allergies especially in the United States, where peanut-based products are ubiquitous and the word allergy is frequently used to describe non-life-threatening conditions such as hay fever. ""It may be time to come up with a new term to describe the condition,"" Dixon-Woods says. ""'Nut allergy' is so poorly understood that it really is not a helpful term anymore."" Health.com: How to buy the right air cleaner . The Santos family removed their daughter from preschool this year because a teacher gave her a food with traces of nuts. When she had a minor reaction, the school's response was, ""Well, she didn't die, so she's fine,"" Santos says. They've had flight attendants tell them that other passengers' snack preferences were more important than Skylar's safety. And they've gotten nasty looks from parents on Skylar's T-ball team after her coach requested that a child who'd been eating nuts put them away and wash his hands. ""Generally speaking, the public awareness of food allergy in the U.S. has increased, and this has resulted in some real benefits to families,"" says Brian P. Vickery, MD, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham. ""For example, manufacturers are now required to put clearer labels on food items, many restaurants can provide better experiences, and schools are often more prepared to handle children with allergies."" However, the situation is far from perfect, he says. Health.com: 15 hypoallergenic dogs and cats . ""Bullying in school does happen. The risks of anaphylaxis are not always appreciated,"" says Dr. Vickery. ""Many families continue to struggle over and over again with obstacles, limitations, skepticism, and judgment."" Each family handles the challenges differently, but ""we try to provide as much practical and scientific guidance as we can, and equip them to handle anything that might happen,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Holders Barcelona made hard work of beating Czech minnows Viktoria Plzen 2-0 in their Champions League Group H clash Wednesday but need just one win to reach the knockout stages. The Catalan giants were near their fluent best in the Nou Camp but wasted a string of chances after midfielder Andres Iniesta put them ahead early after being set up by Lionel Messi. Argentine goal machine Messi hit the woodwork twice before David Villa made the game safe with a second eight minutes from time. It left Barcelona unbeaten in the group, but they trail AC Milan on head-to-head record as the Italians beat BATE Borisov 2-0 in the San Siro. Both the big guns have seven points with their return clash in the San Siro on November 23 set to decide who goes through as winners of the group. Goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kevin Prince Boateng ensured an easy night's work for the Rossoneri, but their coach Massimiliano Allegri is already looking ahead to playing Barcelona again after holding them to a draw in the Nou Camp. ""It was an important win tonight to help with qualification, we still need points but our aim is to be playing Barcelona for first place, that would be an important result for the subsequent draw,"" he told SkySport of Italy. In Group G, Cypriots APOEL Nicosia held Portugal giants Porto to a 1-1 draw and top a tight section with five points. Brazilian star Hulk put the home side ahead as he lashed home an early free kick, but six minutes later the visitors were level. Hulk's fellow Brazilian Ailton found space and produced a 25 meter shot that Helton in the Porto goal could not cover. Zenit St Petersburg are second in the group, a point behind, after coming from behind twice to draw 2-2 at Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk.

"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from the massive earthquake that shook eastern Turkey over the weekend rose to 570 on Friday, up from 535 the day before, but crews have pulled 187 people alive from the rubble, Turkish officials said. In addition, about 2,555 people were injured by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Sunday, according to the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency. Rescue workers extracted 13-year-old Serhat Tokay from the rubble of an apartment building early Friday, 108 hours after the earthquake struck Ercis, the semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. The child was being treated in a field hospital. Eight hours earlier, crews had rescued 18-year-old Imdat Padak from the wreckage of another building in Ercis, the agency reported. After teams from Azerbaijan retrieved him, Padak was taken to a hospital for initial treatment, and then was airlifted by helicopter to the city of Van. Padak appeared not to have any significant trauma, but was suffering dehydration. He is reported to be a student from the village of Kiziloren and was taking courses while preparing for university entrance exams. Earlier in the week, crews pulled a 2-week-old baby, Azra Karaduman, alive from the debris. There were reports Thursday of a moderate earthquake in the country's south. A 5.2 earthquake hit about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the center of Sunday's quake, near the border with Iraq, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Tokay was the latest of several people found alive in the rubble days after Sunday's quake. On Wednesday, rescuers pulled two people from collapsed buildings.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration said Iran has been ""saber-rattling"" over its threat to block the strategically important Strait of Hormuz and renewed its vow Thursday to keep the corridor open. But the Islamic republic's military underscored its intention Thursday to undertake whatever military maneuvers it sees fit on the waterway. This is the latest in the recent war of words between the United States and Iran over the strait. It started when Tehran's vice president this week warned that the country could block the strait if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. The U.S. Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain countered that ""any disruption will not be tolerated."" The shipping channel leads in and out of the Persian Gulf between Iran on one coast and Oman and the United Arab Emirates on the other. It is strategically important because tankers carrying oil travel through it. An Obama administration official, speaking on background because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the government has been ""committed to Gulf security for decades and it should come as no surprise to anyone that we'll do what we must to ensure the strait remains open."" Iranian Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said his country ""asks for no other country's permission for the implementation of its defense strategies,"" state-run Press TV reported on Thursday. On Wednesday, Iran's Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari said, ""Iran has total control over the strategic water way,"" adding that, ""Closing the Strait of Hormuz is very easy for Iranian naval forces."" The vice president, Mohammad Reza Rahimi, issued his threat on Tuesday. ""Iran has repeatedly warned that in the event of a military attack on the country, it will not hesitate in taking all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty one of which would be to close the strategic oil passage,"" Press TV said in its report. The administration official stressed that ""the saber-rattling is really all on the Iranian side."" Iran has been holding a 10-day military exercise in an area from the eastern part of the strait out into the Arabian Sea. Western diplomats describe the maneuvers as further evidence of Iran's volatile behavior. France, Britain and Germany have proposed sanctions to punish Iran's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. Western powers believe Iran is intent on building nuclear weapons, but Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Physically closing the strait would require means that likely are not available to Iran, said Professor Jean-Paul Rodrigue of Hofstra University. ""At best, Iran can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration,"" said Rodrigue, who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues. Rodrigue told CNN that any move by Iran to close the strait would be ""suicidal"" to the current regime. In 2009, 15 million barrels of oil passed through the strait every day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ""Keep in mind that countries such as China and Japan are more dependent on Persian Gulf oil than the United States,"" the professor said. About 18% of U.S. net petroleum imports come from the Persian Gulf region, while Canada provides 25%, according to Rodrigue. The scholar, who has written extensively about oil ""chokepoints,"" said there are no other means to move large quantities of oil over long distance than by maritime transportation. ""It is thus an international issue where the United States, for strategic and historical reasons, is spearheading its security,"" Rodrigue said.

"(Health.com) -- Over the past several years, researchers have noticed an odd pattern in the relationship between body weight and Alzheimer's disease: Middle-aged people have a higher long-term risk of developing the disease if they're overweight or obese, while older people have a lower risk of the disease if they're carrying excess weight. A new study, published this week in the journal Neurology, may offer a clue to this so-called obesity paradox. Non-overweight individuals in their late 60s, 70s, and early 80s who have no outward symptoms of Alzheimer's are more likely than their heavier peers to have biological markers (or biomarkers) of the disease, the study found. This finding raises the possibility that weight loss or a low body mass index (BMI) later in life may be an early warning sign of mental decline, the researchers say. ""Weight changes or body composition changes may actually be a manifestation of disease, which would explain the obesity being an apparent protective factor,"" says Jeffrey M. Burns, M.D., the lead author of the study and the associate director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Center, in Kansas City. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Well before memory loss and other symptoms appear, Alzheimer's may trigger metabolism changes that promote weight loss, Burns says. ""In general, we think of Alzheimer's as a brain disease, but this is evidence that there are systemic problems throughout the body in the early stages of Alzheimer's."" Burns and his colleagues analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a huge study spanning 58 hospitals and universities that's funded by the National Institutes of Health and an array of nonprofit organizations and drug companies. The goal of the initiative is to find ways to measure the progression of Alzheimer's and the precursor condition known as mild cognitive impairment. The researchers looked at 101 people who underwent brain scans designed to identify the plaques and abnormal tangle of proteins that are the hallmark of Alzheimer's, and another 405 people whose cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed for fragments of these proteins (beta-amyloid peptide and tau). Each group included some people with Alzheimer's disease, some with mild cognitive impairment, and some with no signs of mental deterioration. Health.com: 7 ways to protect your memory . There was no connection between BMI and Alzheimer's biomarkers in the patients who actually had Alzheimer's. But in the other two groups, lower BMI was associated with higher levels of biomarkers and a higher likelihood of having brain plaques and tangles. Among people with mild cognitive impairment, for instance, 85 percent of non-overweight individuals had signs of these brain abnormalities, compared to just 48 percent of those who were overweight or obese. (A BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight.) Richard Lipton, M.D., an attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, who was not involved in the new research, agrees with the authors that the findings suggest that Alzheimer's can affect the entire body early on. ""The most obvious manifestations of Alzheimer's disease are in the brain, but Alzheimer's disease has a large number of effects on the body as well,"" says Lipton, the principal investigator of a long-running study on aging and Alzheimer's. ""The brain regulates blood pressure and respiratory rate and pulse and hunger and satiety and blood flow to various organs in the body, so it wouldn't be surprising if a widespread disease of the brain had effects on many, many different aspects of bodily function."" Health.com: Aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise . The study shows only an association, not cause and effect, so Burns and his colleagues can't be sure that Alzheimer's directly causes weight loss (or prevents weight gain). In fact, the researchers found no association between BMI changes and Alzheimer's biomarkers in a subset of study participants whose weight was tracked for two years. May Ahmad Baydoun, Ph.D., a staff scientist at the National Institute on Aging who studies risk factors for dementia, described the study as ""very strong"" overall. But, she says, ""the results would have been a lot stronger if they found weight loss over time is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pathology, also over time."" The relationship between weight loss and the progression of Alzheimer's is likely a two-way street, Lipton says. People who start to experience declines in mental function may shop for groceries less regularly, cook less frequently, and eat less -- and the poor nutrition that results could in turn accelerate the progression of the disease, he says. Health.com: Foods that may help save your memory . ""It seems pretty likely to me that both things are true -- that good health practices prevent illness, and health practices may fall apart in the early stages of illness and accelerate cognitive and physical decline,"" Lipton says.

"(CNN) -- Al Sadd coach Jorge Fossati praised his team for overcoming a ""big injustice"" to become the first Qatari football club to reach the Asian Champions League final. The former Uruguay coach saw his Doha-based team record a 2-1 aggregate victory over Suwon Bluewings after losing 1-0 to South Korea's two-time Asian champions on Wednesday, despite having key players suspended following an ill-tempered first leg last week. ""Of course we are very, very happy,"" the 58-year-old told the Asian Football Confederation website. ""To overcome them was difficult. There were many problems and yet we won and that's why I am happy. ""You know we had to play this game with big injustice. We didn't have some players because of non-football issues. In this situation, we tried to do our best with whatever resources we had."" Five players and coaches were suspended for the match at the Sheik Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium, after a mass brawl broke out following Al Sadd's controversial second goal in the 2-0 win in Suwon on October 19. The fighting erupted after Senegal striker Mamadou Niang scored his and Al Sadd's late second goal while Suwon's players were tending to an injured teammate, presuming play had been halted. Former Marseille forward Niang was later sent off and missed the return leg along with Ivory Coast attacker Kader Keita and goalkeeping coach Suhail Saber Ali, while Suwon were missing Macedonian striker Stevica Ristic and coach Ko Jong-Su. But even without their star players, Al Sadd held on after Oh Jang-Eun had given Suwon a 1-0 lead with a sixth-minute volley, as Khalfan Ibrahim hit the Koreans' crossbar with a vicious long-range shot before halftime. Earlier on Wednesday, South Korea's Jeonbuk Motors advanced to the November 5 final courtesy of a 5-3 aggregate win over Saudi Arabia's Al Ittihad. After a 3-2 away success last week, the 2006 Asian champions won 2-1 thanks to first-half goals from Brazil forward Eninho. Al Ittihad's only response was a late consolation goal from former Bordeaux winger Wendel Geraldo, after both teams had been reduced to 10 men. Al Ittihad, the 2004 and 2005 champions, suffered an early blow when Naif Hazazi -- the scorer of both first-leg goals -- was sent off in the 11th minute for a headbutt, while Jeonbuk substitute Krunoslav Lovrek received a second yellow card late in the match. Jeonbuk coach Choi Kang-Hee was pleased his team would have home advantage at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium. ""We got what we wanted,"" said Choi, a former Suwon coach. ""We are at home for the final and that is an advantage for us. The lead we took from the first leg gave us some breathing space at home but we knew well that Al Ittihad are a very good team. ""We expected them to come at us strongly and we were ready for that. Eninho's goals were a big help but we still had work to do and were able to get the result we needed."" Jeonbuk will attempt to keep the Champions League title in South Korean hands for the third year in succession, after Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma's victory in 2010 and the Pohang Steelers' 2009 triumph.","Al Sadd the first Qatari football club to reach Asian Champions League final .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- They came seeking justice as the sun rose Tuesday over a courthouse in the heart of downtown Los Angeles made famous by its celebrity trials -- O.J. Simpson, Snoop Dogg, Phil Spector. But there were almost as many definitions of justice as there were justice seekers. Some shouted ""Murderer!"" as the defendant, Conrad Murray, arrived at the Clara Foltz Justice Center for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial in the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson. ""Dr. Murray,"" corrected Beatrice Fakhrian, a supporter of the defendant. ""He has earned that title."" So began the long-anticipated trial of the personal physician accused of causing the death of one of the most famous people in the world. More than 100 people from France, Spain and Australia, as well as the far-flung suburbs of Los Angeles, crowded into the dingy courthouse plaza, jockeying for a chance at one of just six courtroom seats, or to say their piece in front of television cameras. Some read psalms, some handed out sunflowers, some chanted ""Justice for Michael,"" and many of them carried signs, transforming a wall outside the courthouse into an international billboard. ""Bulgaria Loves MJ,"" one sign said. So do the Netherlands, Romania and Malaysia, according to the signed posters taped to the wall. A doctor in a while coat preached about safe ways to administer anesthesia. A Michael Jackson impersonator preened for the cameras. ""Even in death, Michael Jackson can draw a crowd,"" said Najee Ali, a Los Angeles civil rights activist who grew up in Jackson's hometown, Gary, Indiana. Ali was the force behind the ""Caravan of Love"" to support Jackson when he was acquitted in Santa Barbara of child molestation charges in 2005. Julie Jenkins, 31, came from Australia and was rewarded by winning the lottery for one of the courtroom seats available to the public. She has been a Michael Jackson fan since she was 7 and wore black jeans, a red shirt, a black armband and aviator sunglasses in honor of her idol. ""For me, it represents the first time I saw him in person,"" she said, explaining her get-up, which was vaguely reminiscent of JacksonÂ¹s look during his ""History"" tour. ""It also represents blood, because we think he was murdered."" She pounded a closed fist over her chest. That sentiment is shared by many of Jackson's fans, although Murray is charged with the less serious offense of involuntary manslaughter. He is accused of giving Jackson a lethal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to help him sleep as the pop star prepared for his comeback ""This is It"" concerts in June 2009. Defense: Michael Jackson caused his own death . Murder also is a major theme for the group ""Justice4MJ,"" which was out in force on Tuesday, leading the crowd in chants of ""Justice for Michael"" as Jackson's family walked into the courthouse. Erin Jacobs, one of the group's outspoken leaders, also won a seat for the trial's first day. She has attended every pretrial hearing, and was tossed out of court last week during jury selection after getting into a staring contest with Murray. She said she hadn't slept. Like her idol, ""I experienced insomnia last night,"" she said. ""I have been a fan my whole life. This is my passion, to work for Michael."" Court officials warned Jacobs she would have to cover up her T-shirt in court. If she flashed her ""Justice4MJ"" logo, she'd lose her seat and be banned for the rest of the trial. Karlene Taylor, 49, wanted a seat so badly she couldn't sleep. She has been a Jackson fan since she was 8. ""I remember 'ABC' Michael,"" she said. Alas, the lottery gods did not smile on her Tuesday. Robyn Starkand and Betty Byrnes of the fan group ""Call for Love"" handed out sunflowers, hoping to lead a respectful vigil on the courthouse steps, complete with songs and prayers. But they were upstaged by a Michael Jackson look-alike. They started with ""Heal the World,"" but the voices soon waned, and Jackson impersonator Goward Horton stepped in with his version of ""Man in the Mirror,"" complete with Jackson's distinctive yips and squeaks. ""They've turned it into the Goward show,"" Starkand groused. ""This is really serious. It's not the time for a Michael Jackson impersonator."" It was a time for the real one, their Michael.","Fans throng courthouse for trial of Michael Jackson's doctor .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of three men have been found in shallow graves in eastern Ohio, all of them believed to have been killed after answering a Craigslist ad to work on a cattle farm, according to authorities. The Summit County medical examiner's office on Saturday identified one of the victims as Timothy Kern of Massillon, Ohio. The 47-year-old's death, caused by ""gunshot wounds to the head,"" was ruled a homicide, the office said in an audio recording. A phone call led police Friday to Kern's body in a shallow grave behind an Akron mall, authorities said. Multiple law enforcement authorities, including FBI officials, have tied Kern's death to a wider investigation into the two other killings. In his last Facebook posting, dated November 10, Kern wrote: ""Just got one of the strangest job offers. A good offer but strange. The job is to watch over 680 acres south of cambridge. Odd jobs and such but mainly just secure it. Trailer, utilities, salary. Drawbacks? No cell phone service, kids are up here, and i have to move this Sunday."" Meanwhile, the body of a ""white male"" was also discovered Friday ""in a shallow grave in Stock Township,"" about 120 miles south of Akron, Noble County Sheriff Stephen Hannum said in a statement. The sheriff did not respond to calls Saturday from CNN. But Hannum said earlier this month that there are ""two suspects in custody"" in the case. Michael Rafferty told CNN affiliate WJW that his 16-year-old son Brogan Rafferty of Stowe is among them, charged with attempted murder. The father claimed that his son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted,"" insisting that his son is a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The other suspect in the case -- 52-year-old Richard Beasley of Akron, as identified on a Summit County court website -- is being held on unrelated charges. No attorney was listed for Beasley in the court document. The investigation began the night of November 6, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Hannum. The shooting victim, who is from South Carolina and was not identified by police, told the sheriff he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property. WJW: Body of missing Massillon man identified . He met with the two suspects and drove with them toward Stock Township. After being told a road was closed due to a landslide, the South Carolina man got out of the car to start walking toward the property, which he was told was nearby. He told the sheriff that, while walking through a heavily wooded area, he then turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran"" -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing, according to the sheriff. The victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help, Hannum said. Then, on November 11, the sheriff received a call from a Boston, Massachusetts, woman who said her twin brother had not been seen since October 22 in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The brother had also answered a Craigslist ad ""and she felt very sure it was the same advertisement (the shooting victim from South Carolina) had answered."" On November 15, authorities -- including agents from the FBI and Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, plus ""cadaver-sniffing"" dogs -- found ""the body of a white male buried in a shallow grave"" near where the first man had been shot, Hannum said. Police have not identified the body. The sheriff tied that man's death to the investigation of the shooting that left the South Carolina man wounded in the arm. Multiple authorities since then have also linked the two bodies discovered Friday -- including that of Kern -- with the same investigation. Zach Kern, 19, told CNN that he last saw his father November 12 after he'd gone with another son for the job interview. ""He was all stoked about it,"" Zach Kern said of his father's feelings about the opportunity to work on the cattle farm. ""My brother ... thought the whole situation was sketchy."" Timothy Kern ended up going to the would-be job site alone, not with the 17-year-old son who'd accompanied him to the interview, Zach Kern said. The same son added that his father, divorced and with three children, worked ""odd jobs"" including recently as a street cleaner in Canton. He said that his father saw his children daily, adding that the whole family is struggling to come to grips with his death. ""We're just trying to get through this,"" Zach Kern said Saturday.","One man told police he was shot after answering a Craigslist ad for an Ohio job .
