"Not ready: Close pals say Cressida Bonas, seen here attending a society wedding has no plans of becoming a Royal bride within the next 12 months . Their romance may be going from strength to strength – but if Prince Harry thinks that his glamorous young girlfriend Cressida Bonas is ready for marriage he can think again. Cressida, 25, has told friends she has no plans of becoming a Royal bride within the next 12 months and would prefer smitten Harry to wait before asking for her hand  in marriage. The couple have been dating for two years, but observers have noted that their relationship has become far more serious in recent weeks. However, a close friend of the couple said the former dance student ‘has yet to make up her mind about what she wants to do’. ‘Cressida is very busy and has lots to do. Marriage is not  something she’s considering yet,’ said the source. ‘She has just started a new job where she’s being paid the usual salary for someone of her age – i.e. peanuts – and she has found a flat to rent with her friend Daisy. She is doing all the things that people in their 20s should be doing. ‘Who knows what might have changed by this time next year but that is how she wants it to be. ‘She doesn’t want to miss out on that chapter – she’s not that kind of girl. That said, her mother is ecstatic and would love them to get engaged.’ Although Harry, 29, has made it clear to his girlfriend that he is besotted – and that he would love to pop the question – Cressida’s determination not to rush things also stems from the fact that few of her closest friends have settled down. The source said: ‘When Cressida’s good chum Missy Percy got engaged to one of Harry’s best friends, Tom Van Straubenzee, she was really happy for them because they had been together for several years. However, she noted that Missy was only 25 at the time and she thinks that’s really young.’ Instead, free-spirited Cressida, who recently started a new job in marketing, is busy planning her adventures for the year ahead. In addition to hiring a tipi with friends for the Glastonbury Festival in June, she is planning a trip to Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island in the Caribbean this summer. She will be travelling with her half-sister Isabella, who is married to Sir Richard’s son Sam. Close: Harry is said to be keen to pop the question to Cressida, the pair looked happy pictured here at an event in Wembley Arena last month . Busy: Free-spirited Cressida is said to be busy planning her adventures for the year ahead . Cressida also wants to attend the Burning Man festival, a cultural event that takes place in the Nevada desert at the end of August. The friend said: ‘Cressida has always wanted to go to Burning Man and she’s been talking about joining a huge gang who are going this year. It’s unlikely Harry will be able to go, though. Impatient: Harry has made it clear to his girlfriend that he is besotted with her . 'It is such an effort – you have to book flights to San Francisco and then hire an RV and fill it with food because no money is exchanged on the festival site. It takes lots of planning and months of saving. ‘Those are the kind of big events on Cressie’s horizon at the moment, not weddings.’ Meanwhile, Harry is planning two overseas Royal tours this year. He is due to visit Estonia and Italy in May, followed by a visit to Brazil and Chile in June. The latter will allow him to watch one or two matches at the World  Cup in Brazil, and a Palace aide has told The Mail on Sunday it is likely he will attend at least one England game. On Tuesday Harry went on a ‘boys’ night’ to a smart private club in Mayfair with his friends James Haskell, the England rugby star, stockbroker Adam Bidwell, and Viscount Erleigh. The group was overheard teasing Harry about reports that he will soon be walking down the aisle. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were joshing him about planning his stag do. Harry said, “I have to be careful, it can’t be like Vegas”’ – thought to be a reference to his infamous trip to the city in 2012  when he was photographed frolicking naked at a hotel. The source said Harry’s friends promised to ‘send him out in style’ and one of them claimed: ‘Leave it to us, you’ll be hungover for a week.’","Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas is not ready for marriage, according to close friends .

"Britons are too ignorant about Europe to vote in a referendum on the subject, a top Brussels official claimed last night. Viviane Reding, vice-president of the European Commission, said the British debate about Europe was so ‘distorted’ that people could not make an ‘informed decision’ about whether or not to stay in the EU. Mrs Reding - who boasted that 70 per cent of the UK’s laws are now made in Brussels - also rubbished David Cameron’s bid to curb immigration from Europe, saying it was incompatible with membership of the EU. 'Dangerous': Viviane Reding was criticised for making assumptions about what qualifies Britons to cast a vote on EU membership . Speaking at an EU-sponsored ‘Citizen’s Dialogue’ event in London, Mrs Reding accused British politicians and media of so misrepresenting the EU that it is now impossible to hold a fair referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. ‘You are on the verge of having (to take) maybe a national decision?’ she said.‘Do the people who are asked to vote know what they are going to vote about?’ ‘The fact is that very often, I see a completely distorted truth being presented and then how do you want people to take an informed decision? They simply cannot.’ Europe Minister David Lidington criticised her comments, saying that pro-EU points of view received a wide airing in the UK, including on the BBC. 'Legitimate concerns': Mrs Reading was attacked for dismissing people's concerns, which could lead them to support anti-EU parties such as UKIP, led by Nigel Farage (pictured) He added: ‘It is very dangerous to start making assumptions about what makes someone qualified to cast a vote.’ Pawel Sidlicki, of the think tank Open Europe, said: ‘Mrs Reding epitomises the EU elites’ approach to dealing with the public -superficially embracing debate with citizens while dismissing any substantive criticism. 'Having their legitimate concerns dismissed in such a high-handed manner only drives people towards populist, anti-EU parties. Sadly, EU politicians like Reding often do a better job at driving voters towards these parties than they do themselves.’ But Mrs Reding said the British public needed to be made more aware of the ‘facts’ about Europe. She said the European Parliament was now ‘the most powerful parliament in Europe’, because of its role in signing off new EU laws proposed by the European Commission. ‘Seventy per cent of the laws in this country are co-decided by the European Parliament,’ she said. ‘So it’s not neutral who you sent to the European Parliament.’ Mrs Reding also suggested Britain would have to leave the EU if Mr Cameron pursues his bid to cap immigration from Europe. She said it was ‘not possible’ to curb free movement of people while retaining free movement of goods, services and capital.","Viviane Reding, vice-president of European Commission, made comments .

"A woman charged with leaving her two-day-old son outside to freeze before dumping him in the recycling was embarrassed that she didn't know who the father was, a court has heard. Angela Alexie, 24, gave birth to baby John Doe alone in a garage in Eastpointe, Michigan, on December 22, 2014, and cut the umbilical cord with her teeth. The mother-of-three, whose children are all in foster care, claims she didn't have the strength to take the baby to authorities as she was embarrassed and didn't know if her boyfriend was the father. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Angela Alexie, 24, (pictured on Friday) allegedly delivered the baby boy on her own in the unattached garage of a friend's house that she was residing in and then put the baby in a recycling bin after he had died . Steven Kaplan (left), Alexie's attorney said that she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' and that she did 'as well as she could' in caring for the child . Workers found the child naked and bundled in a black shirt as his body came down the conveyor at the Recommunity Recycling center in Roseville on January 14 . Wrapping the child in a blanket, Alexie left the him on the floor of the open-windowed residential garage for two days as she slept inside, checking on him every two hours. She attempted to breastfeed him, she says, but he never latched on. She did not bring him formula. On Christmas Eve, John died, and Alexie posted on Facebook 'RIP Baby', which she claims referred to somebody else's child. Alexie placed the body in a plastic bag and left him on the floor of the garage for another week before somebody placed the bag in a recycling dumpster, the court heard. She is charged with felony murder and first-degree child abuse. The court also heard from Cyndee Johnson, a worker at ReCommunity Recycling who saw John's body come down the conveyor belt on January 14. He was blue, covered in snow, and curled up as if he were trying to stay warm, Johnson said. 'When I first saw, it scared me,' Johnson said tearfully. 'I jumped back. I moved back. I realized this was an actual baby.' 'It just grabbed my heart. I knew something wasn't right.' 'I said, 'That's a real baby. Stop the line! Stop the line!'' she testified. It is believed that the child was born on or around December 22 in the garage of a friend's house in Eastpointe (pictured) and died Christmas Eve night, but the Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office is still working to confirm the timeline . Police said Alexie went to and from the garage while living in the house to check on the baby and to feed him. They believe that the boy's body was put in a recycling bin that was picked up from the home on January 13 . The boy, unofficially named Henry Alexander Macomb by morgue workers, 'must have suffered greatly' while left in the garage with low temperatures in the 30s, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said. It is believed that Alexie went to and from the garage while living in the house to check on the baby and to feed him . There is no official cause of death but authorities believe hypothermia played a major role. 'She did nothing. She let that child freeze to death,' Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Bill Cataldo said on Friday, according to Detroit Free Press. 'He died when there were a number of ways to save him.' Alexie said she concealed the pregnancy from her boyfriend and pretended to have miscarried. Authorities released an appeal to find the mother, which prompted a response from Amy Lesniak, who is caring for two of Alexie's children. She said she suspected Alexie was pregnant when she started missing visits, claiming to have the flu or stomach problems. When she heard a baby was found in the dumpster, she called police saying she believed the child was Alexie's. Alexie, who has three other children in foster care, is charged with felony murder and child abuse in the death of her son . Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'. He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense . Steven Kaplan, Alexie's attorney, said she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' in court yesterday. Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'. He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense. Alexie has relinquished her rights to bury the baby. The Macomb community has rallied together to provide a funeral and burial for the baby.

"Stylish Samantha Cameron is known for her knack of dressing impeccably, whatever the occasion, and today the Prime Minister's wife chose a dramatic autumnal sari to take in London's colourful Diwali celebrations. Samantha, 42, chose a russet-coloured sari edged in gold for a visit to the Swaminarayan Mandir, the largest traditional Hindu temple outside India, at Neasden in north-west London. She even combined the outfit proudly with a poppy. Diwali, known as the festival of lights, is a five day celebration undertaken by millions of Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world. Stylish Samantha Cameron is known for her knack of always dressing impeccably for the occasion and today the Prime Minister's wife chose a dramatic autumnal sari to take in London's colourful Diwali celebrations . For Hindus, the five-year festival of Diwali is one of the most important events in the year. Fireworks and lamps are used to create a riot of colour to celebrate the victory of good over evil, sweets are traded and new clothes bought. Lamps are lit and kept on during the night and families come together to carry out traditional tasks such as cleaning the house to honour the goddess Lakshmi. While Samantha Cameron looked the part in her dramatic sari, David Cameron chose not to dress quite so spectacularly as his wife though, wearing his trusty navy suit and sensible blue tie. Mr Cameron was garlanded when he arrived at the Neasden Temple, as it is popularly known, and both he and Samantha were welcomed with a chandlo on their foreheads – the red mark adopted by Hindu worshippers and afforded to guests. As a customary mark of respect, they removed their shoes before entering (David’s were black slip-ons; Samantha’s nude pumps).

Pramukh Swami Maharaj inspired the mandir and consecrated it in 1995.From . the moment the first stone was cut on 16 February 1993 to the moment . the final piece was packed in June 1995, over 1,500 skilled village . craftsmen, artisans from Rajasthan and Gujarat – skilled in traditional . stone and masonry – worked round the clock chipping away to fashion the . rough stone and fine marble into the required forms.

The Bulgarian . limestone resisted remarkably well the effects of the extreme weather . conditions with temperature variations from 30ºC in the summer and . dropping to minus 15ºC in the winter. The limestone is very dense, with . fine grains and creamy-white in colour. Italian marble is favored for . its consistent white coloration, smooth texture and strength. Marble . from Ambaji is noted for its snow-white appearance and good finishing.Limestone . and marble were transported in consignments by sea to the port of .

It was decided that much of the . carving be carried out at Kandla itself for reasons of convenience. A 15 . sq km plot was acquired and cleared up and a mini-township built for . the craftsmen who would sculpt the stone. Five worksheds were in . operation at the Kandla site – one for cutting stones, one for marble . work, one for limestone work, one for polishing and one for packing . carved materials.

"Well one’s the king of the swingers – the other’s a bungle VIP.

The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in . Stratford, East London, opens today and will include an action-packed . adventure playground and interactive water fountains. Harry claimed the . attraction was ‘better than expected’, saying: ‘I think it’s absolutely . amazing. I can’t wait to see it full of people.’ And . the prince, 29, – who seemed to be following in his father and . brother’s footsteps, sporting a thinning patch of hair – added: ‘People . will be pouring through the place. The sun will be out. It will be the . longest summer we’ve ever had, I’m sure.’ Prince Harry and Mr Johnson, both wearing navy suits, met outside the Aquatics Centre and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren at the riverside play area and speak to the teams involved in transforming the area in the last 18 months. Harry chatted with schoolchildren and even pushed them on a swing while Boris watched from the sidelines. Perhaps he was afraid of making a fool of himself again after appearing on a zip wire above Victoria . Park last year - the stunt did not exactly go to plan as the London Mayor . was at one point left dangling helplessly above a bemused crowd. The development has been led by the London Legacy Development Corporation. When Harry was asked if Prince George would visit the park in future years, he replied: 'I'm sure he'll have his chance to come down here. 'You never know, the Olympics might be back here again before we know it.' On hearing that remark, Mr Johnson joked: 'We'll put in for the Winter Games!' 'Come on, Boris, give us a hand!'

"A young mother died from cervical cancer after doctors were accused of missing the signs of her disease nine times and refusing her a smear test, saying that at 20 she was too young. Keely Devine had complained of pain in her hip and abdomen, as well as heavy bleeding, following the birth of her son Jayden. She visited her GP to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two-and-a-half years, but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Keely Devine, 23, (pictured in hospital) died from cervical cancer after doctors were accused of missing the signs of her disease nine times and refusing her a smear test, saying that at 20 she was too young . Miss Devine was also fitted with a . contraceptive coil to try and alleviate the heavy bleeding and discharge . she was experiencing. But despite her repeatedly raising concerns about . the pain she was experiencing, her family say she had no physical . examinations and was refused a smear test on the grounds that she was . too young to have this. By the time she was diagnosed with cervical cancer it was too late. She had a large tumour measuring 5cm x 6cm x 3cm which was obstructing her cervix and the cancer had spread into her pelvis. Just . three years after she first reported her symptoms after the birth of . her son in September 2010, she was dead at the age of 23, having spent . the last four months of her life on the Teenage Cancer Ward at St James's Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Miss . Devine, of of Armley, Leeds, was diagnosed with cervical cancer on . January 4, 2013 and began a six week course of radiotherapy and . chemotherapy a few weeks later on February  19. Battle: Miss Devine visited her GP to discuss her symptoms more than six times and attended hospital three times in two-and-a-half years, but was repeatedly told that she had an infection and given antibiotics . The gruelling treatment caused her to suffer side effects such as severe sickness, vomiting and weight loss. By May 2013, the cancer had begun to affect her bowel and bladder and she was admitted to Hospital because of extreme constipation. On June 13, Miss Devine's family were told that there was nothing more doctors could do to treat her cancer, and that her condition was terminal. She remained in hospital until she died on 7 September 2013. Now her mother Alexandra Dickinson has instructed specialist medical lawyers to investigate if more could have been done by her GP and Accident and Emergency doctors to diagnose Miss Devine earlier and potentially treat her cervical cancer. 'As a family we are still coming to terms with losing Keely and in such tragic circumstances,' said Ms Dickinson, who is now looking after three-year-old Jayden. All women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening, with women aged between 25 and 49 encouraged to be tested every three years. The starting age was raised from 20 in 2003, because it was found that cervical screening in younger women can do more harm than good. Cervical cancer is linked to infection caused by the human . papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause abnormalities in the cells of the . cervix. In the majority of cases the immune system clears the infection, . but in a small number of women the abnormalities persist, and may turn . into something more serious - and if they are not treated can develop . into a cancer. Cervical abnormalities associated with HPV infection are very common in . women under 25, but are rarer in older women, while in the majority of . cases abnormalities in young women go away by themselves. If younger women were screened, many would test positive for abnormalities, and would be sent for unnecessary treatment to remove the affected cells. This treatment may increase the likelihood of a women having a premature baby if she later becomes pregnant, and the treatment process can also cause the affected woman significant anxiety. Cervical cancer is extremely rare in women under the age of 25 with just 2.6 cases per 100,000 women. The Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) reviewed evidence over the risks and benefits of screening younger women in 2009, but decided to keep the age limit of 25. The International Agency for Research on Cancer also recommends that women should not commence cervical screening before the age of 25. Source: NHS . 'She . had her whole life ahead of her and was looking forward to watching . Jayden grow up. Instead her life was cut short and now I hope we can . find answers as to why this could happen to my daughter and find out . why, after she repeatedly complained to doctors about the pain and . discomfort she was experiencing, that she was not diagnosed sooner. 'It was heartbreaking to see her struggling with her illness as it took hold in the last few months of her life. She was incredibly frightened and in a great amount of pain. 'She began to struggle to communicate with us and was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with her deterioration. She became wheelchair bound and extremely weak. She wanted to spend time with Jayden, but she didn't want him to see and remember her in so much pain and distress. 'Before she died, Keely was studying for a qualification in health and social care as she wanted to become a social worker. She was determined to gain this qualification so that she could give Jayden the best life possible.' Ms Dickinson said that by suing the NHS for negligence, she hoped to find out if more could have been done to diagnose Miss Devine's cervical cancer earlier. 'No other young girls or mothers should have to go through what she did,' she said. NHS smear tests are currently offered to women aged between 25 and 64, with NHS guidelines stating that the 'condition is very rare in women under 25.' The NHS website adds: 'All women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for cervical screening. Women aged between 25 and 49 are invited for testing every three years, . and women aged between 50 and 64 are invited every five years. 'Being screened regularly means that any abnormal changes in the cells . of the cervix can be identified at an early stage and, if necessary, . treated to stop cancer developing. 'It is estimated that early detection and treatment can prevent up to 75per cent of cervical cancers.' 'This is a heartbreaking situation as Keely was only 23-years-old when she died and also leaves behind a young son,' said Rachelle Mahapatra, of Irwin Mitchell's solicitors - which is representing Ms Dickinson. 'In . the couple of years before her death Keely had made multiple visits to . her GP and the hospital and we are investigating if more could have been . done to spot the cervical cancer earlier. 'Although . cervical cancer in young women is rare our specialist medical law team . has dealt with a number of cases involving women in their twenties from . across the country whose cervical cancer was initially missed by . doctors. Decline: Just three years after she first reported her symptoms, Miss Devine was dead, having spent the last four months of her life on the Teenage Cancer Ward at St James's Hospital in Leeds . 'Delays in promptly . diagnosing and treating cervical cancer can have devastating . consequences and it is vital that doctors focus on the symptoms rather . than the age of a woman when deciding whether or not it might be cancer. 'In . this case we are still in the early stages of our investigation as her . devastated family just want answers as to what happened during her care. 'They . know nothing can turn back the clock but, this case is about . highlighting any potential issues and lessons that can be learnt to . hopefully prevent other young women from suffering as Keely did.' A spokesman from the NHS said she was unable to comment on any individual cases.","Keely Devine, 23, first complained of symptoms after birth of son in 2010 .

"With more Miss Worlds than any other country and a TV audience of 50 million for the final of the national competition, beauty pageants are big business in Venezuela. Winning the Miss Venezuela pageant can mean a starry showbiz career and a route out of poverty, and as a result, there's no lengths that Venezuelan girls won't go to to win the prize - whether that means saving for a nose job or sewing a strip of plastic to their tongues to stop them eating. Overseen by the country's 'King of Beauty', Osmel Sousa, 67, competitors spend the six months leading up to the final in a tough beauty bootcamp where feelings aren't spared, the cameras are always watching and surgery is routine. Surgery: There are no lengths that girls in Osmel's 'Beauty Factory' won't go to to win the competition . The Miss Venezuela House is run by the svengali-like Sousa, who is always on hand to check the progress of the girls - and dispense an unlimited supply of cutting advice. Competitors are thinned out at regular evictions judged by Sousa. Watching the women sashay down the runway, he uses his eagle eye for imperfections to spot areas for improvement. 'The two central teeth!' he exclaims as one beauty walks towards him. Blushing, she replies: 'They filed them down yesterday.' 'File them down more!' is his response. One hopeful is 18-year-old Maya Nava who comes from Caracas' Santa Cruz barrio, a dangerous slum where there's a murder every 40 minutes. 'My wish is to be recognised,' she reveals. 'I want . people to know that people from the slums can succeed. Svengali: Miss Venezuela president Osmel Sousa speaks to BBC reporter Billie JD Porter . Thinning the ranks: The no-hopers are regularly weeded out by Osmel and his panel of judges . 'It would . guarantee me and my family a future. It would allow us to leave the . barrio.' To achieve her dreams, Ms Nava and her family have already spent $7,000 on surgery, including a nose job and breast implants. She has also had a plastic mesh sewn onto her tongue to make eating solids too painful to endure. 'It makes me lose weight faster,' she explains. 'You eat the same [things] but liquefied.' Not everyone approves of the extensive surgery the contestants undergo. The mother of Lara, another competitor insists her daughter won't have surgery because it 'would not be a fair contest'. She adds: 'All this surgery... Is it a competition to see who is the best surgeon or who's the prettiest girl?' Back in the Miss Venezuela House, Sousa is once again thinning the ranks of hopefuls. 'Listen girl, let me tell you, that . beehive hairdo looks horrendous!' he snaps at one. Tipped for the top: Regional winners Stephanie de Zorzi and Michelle Bertolini . Winner: Migbellis Castellanos narrowly beat Maya Neva to become Miss Venezuela 2013 . When a girl faints, he tells her: 'If you faint . like a beauty queen, get up like one too!' Later, he quips: 'I'm checking for girls who've got fat and to see they act like it's the final. There are a few who aren't concentrating.' While Sousa, who has done more than any other to ensure Venezuela's continuing success in international beauty pageants, might seem offensive, he insists that it's really all about the transformation. 'I am always working on that [what women . can do],' he insists. 'When I was little, I had Attention Deficit Disorder. I couldn't study, I'd just forget . everything so I drew beautiful women constantly. 'What I love is seeing positive . transformations,' he continues. 'Nature hasn't been kind to some women. Hopefuls: Girls taking part in Osmel's beauty bootcamp are expected to perfect everything from figure to voice . Hopefuls: Girls taking part in Osmel's beauty bootcamp are expected to perfect everything from figure to voice . Living the dream: Miss Venezuela (centre) and the two runners up can now expect a stellar showbiz career . 'If a girl needs a . nose job, you get her one. It's an industry so we strive for . perfection. We can't settle for mediocrity.' Not every woman meets with his approval however, with feminist protesters among those in line for another dose of caustic Sousa wisdom. 'Those organisations were created by ugly betties with no . hope of a fix!' he insists. 'They're all horrendous! 'They [feminist protesters] are taking things out of . context. We're not training astronauts here - we launch women's showbiz . careers.' And for women like Maya, who eventually - to the delight of her Santa Cruz neighbours - comes second in the Miss Venezuela pageant, success can be a route out of poverty too.

"A trembling Kerry Kennedy talked of her 'Daddy' as she took the stand in the third day of her drugged driving trial in Upstate New York today. The daughter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy testified about her childhood and her father's assassination, with her defense playing the Bobby card in an attempt to pull the heartstrings of the White Plains courthouse judge and six-person jury. 'My mother raised us because my father died when I was 8,' she said on the stand in response to a question from her lawyer, before adding, 'He was killed when he was running for president.' Scroll down for video . All smiles: Kerry Kennedy leaves Westchester County courthouse grinning Wednesday after bringing up her father's assassination on the stand . Daddy: Kennedy, pictured Wednesday with her daughter and sister, talked about 'Daddy' on the stand as she fought her case in court . Family support: Kennedy's sister Rory was just one member of the famous family who showed up to support her Wednesday . Referring to him as 'Daddy,' Kennedy went on to explain how her father 'was . attorney general during the civil rights movement and then a senator,' the New York Daily News reported. Her frail mother, Ethel, was present in the courtroom. Later in her testimony, Kennedy said she had 'no memory' of the moments leading up to her 2012 drug-induced crash. She said her day was planned like any other on July 13 -- gym, then work. And as she drove down the winding road from her Bedford mansion she said she recalled 'thinking how beautiful the light was filtering through the trees.' But then everything went blank she said. 'Then I have no memory,' Kennedy told jurors. 'I have no memory from going on (Interstate) 684 until my car was at a stop on Route 22.' The testimony came as the lawyer defending Kennedy against the drugged-driving charge told reporters the prosecution's witnesses were helping, rather than hindering, his client's case. Kennedy was charged after her Lexus swerved into a tractor-trailer on an interstate highway in 2012. Blood tests detected a sleeping drug, and she said she accidentally took an Ambien instead of her daily thyroid pill. Earlier Wednesday, Kennedy's lawyer paraded out numerous character witnesses, leading State Supreme Court Justice Robert Neary to exclaim that it was becoming almost tedious. Sad: Kerry Kennedy, pictured in 1963 with her father then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, testified about his death in court on Wednesday . Friends: Kerry, shown center with her father in 1964, explained how he was assassinated while running for president . According to the New York Post, . Larry Cox, director of the human rights organization KAIROS, and a . longtime friend called her 'one of the most highly respected humans . rights leaders extant today.' He . was followed by Alexander Lopez, who worked as Kennedy's persoanl . assistant at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, . and called his former boss 'an outstanding citizen' who was honest and . had no issue with sobriety. After Emily Liebert, a magazine editor . and close friend of Kennedy's, echoed those remarks, the weary judge . broke in: 'I think we're beyond the scope of character witness, I don't . want to say tedious, but beyond the scope.' On . Tuesday, the prosecution's toxicology expert said she doesn't know . whether Kennedy would have realized she was driving erratically after . taking the sleeping pill. That seemed to undercut the prosecution's claim that Kennedy should have pulled over as she felt the drug's effects. The . testimony came from Elizabeth Spratt, director of toxicology at the . Westchester County Department of Laboratories and Research. Defense attorney William Aronwald asked Spratt if impairment after taking the Ambien ingredient zolpidem is 'often not recognizable' by the driver. Spratt said, 'Yes.' Then he asked if Spratt could say Kennedy's impairment 'was in fact recognizable by her.' 'I don't know if she was aware,' Spratt said. However, she would not go so far as to agree that Kennedy definitely felt no effects. Tedious: Earlier Wednesday, Kennedy's lawyer paraded out numerous character witnesses, leading State Supreme Court Justice Robert Neary to exclaim that it was becoming almost tedious . Support: Ethel Kennedy, leaves Westchester County courthouse Wednesday, after listening to Kerry Kennedy testify . Spratt also acknowledged the possibility . of 'sleep driving,' which she defined as, 'You're driving without being . aware that you're driving.' She said the drug's effects include . sleepiness, poor motor coordination and headaches. It can also cause . amnesia, meaning that many people don't remember much after they've . taken Ambien, she said. Spratt testified on the second day of Kennedy's trial. The prosecution rested right after her testimony, and the defense immediately moved for a dismissal, saying no evidence of a crime had been presented. Justice Robert Neary denied the motion. The defense case opened with two character witnesses. The Rev. Gerard Creegan, a family friend, said he's known Kennedy since 1975 and had been to Kennedy family gatherings including 'weekends at the Cape.' He said Kennedy had helped him with human rights work in the Dominican Republic and was 'very honest' and 'very sober.' Character witness: Reverend Gerry Creedon, pictured, who runs a church in suburban Virginia outside of Washington, D.C., was a character witness for Kennedy on Tuesday . Kennedy's younger sister Rory Kennedy, . a documentary filmmaker, then took the stand and said the 54-year-old 'has a stellar reputation for honesty.' She said she also . has 'a reputation for sobriety and general healthy living.' Ethel Kennedy, 85, was wheeled into the court there to support her daughter. Outside court Tuesday, it was suggested to defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt that prosecution testimony was going his way. 'I think so, too,' he said. 'I hope the jury will agree.' New . York state trooper Bradley Molloy told the White Plains courtroom on . Tuesday that he initially thought Kennedy may have suffered a seizure or . stroke. She passed several . drug tests that he administered at the police station. The tests . included having Kennedy follow the tip of a pen with her eyes, stand on . one leg and touch the tip of her finger to her nose, Molloy said. Kennedy . told the trooper that she had consumed some carrots and a cappuccino . that morning and had slept about eight hours the night before. Molloy . said Kennedy also told him she was concerned that she might have . accidentally taken a sleeping pill instead of her thyroid medication, . which were next to each other on her medicine cabinet. 'The defendant was not impaired by any drug,' Molloy said. 'I feel she may have suffered a medical condition while driving.' Molloy said Kennedy was polite and . cooperative throughout the ordeal but she said to him that she had an . unspecified 'brain injury' the year before the accident that may have . contributed. On Monday, a . North Castle town police officer, Joel Thomas, said he had administered . four field sobriety tests, involving eye movements, walking and turning, . reciting part of the alphabet and standing on one leg. Kennedy only passed one, reciting the alphabet from J to T, he said. Also Monday, motorists testified that Kennedy swerved her Lexus into a . truck, damaging the car and blowing a tire, but kept driving and later . was slumped at her steering wheel and disoriented. In . his opening statement, defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said Kennedy was . not disputing that she drove erratically but she maintains that it was . an accident. Prosecutor Stefanie DeNise said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy violated the law 'by failing to stop and pull over as she felt the onset of symptoms.' Though Kennedy has no history of drunken or drugged driving, she isn't the first one in her family to face the charge. Her cousin Patrick Kennedy, who resigned as a Congressman from Rhode Island in 2011, was found to have traces of the same sleeping medication in his system when he drove his Mustang into a Capitol Hill barricade in 2006.","Senator Robert F.

"Europe's most active volcano Mount Etna has erupted - spewing molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside. The eruption, which was captured on camera from Acireale, near Cantania, sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night. The breathtaking footage shows the volatile volcano emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano, spews molten lava thousand of feet above the Sicilian countryside during its latest eruption . Fiery sight: A group of men engage in conversation, seemingly unaware that the volatile volcano is emitting streams of hot lava from the earth's core . Explosive: The eruption was captured on camera from Acireale, near Cantania. It is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year . Powerful: The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke and ash over the Italian island last night - forcing airport officials to close airspace over Mount Etna . The explosion  - which is the sixteenth paroxysmal eruption recorded this year - did not endanger any of the . villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain. However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe. This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass. This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down. Incredible: The explosion - which lit up the Sicilian sky - did not endanger any of the villages dotted around the slopes of the mountain . Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992 - causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain. Despite the town of Zafferana being endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid, successful diversion efforts saved the town and only one building was destroyed. However, the fiery volcano, currently standing at 10,925 feet tall, is still in constant activity. Astonishingly, it is steadily growing, and has been for 500,000 years, when eruptions began. Its latest eruption was preceded by a violent tremour on Monday, which sent hundreds of perfect smoke rings into the air. Risk: However, staff at Cantania Airport have been forced to close airspace above Mount Etna, which is the largest and most active volcano in Europe . Danger: This is because the vast ash clouds could be hazardous to aircraft, as they could potentially melt and coat moving parts with a layer of glass. This would ultimately cause the planes' engines to shut down . No signs of stopping: The fiery volcano is still in constant activity. It is situated on the geological boundary where the European and African plates collide . Experts believe the eruption may have sparked a change in the structure of a vent, perhaps into a particularly circular shape - allowing Mount Etna to spew the unusual smoke-like formations. The volcano, which came into existence almost one million years ago, has been well-documented since 1500BC, when its eruptions forced civilians to migrate for safety. Since then, there have been more than 200 eruptions - from the almost undetectable to the catastrophic. In . 122 BC, an explosive eruption spewed so much ash onto the town of . Catania - crushing hundreds of houses - that the town's inhabitants were . exempted from paying taxes to Rome for ten years. Horrific: Mount Etna's last major eruption was in 1992, pictured, causing a fast-flowing river of molten lava to cascade down the slopes of the mountain . The most powerful eruption to date was in 1669, when the explosions destroyed part of the summit and the lava flows reached the sea more than ten miles away. This disaster prompted town leaders to attempt to control the flows of lava - to no avail. An extremely violent eruption in 1852 produced more than 2 billion cubic feet of lava and covered more than three square miles of the volcano's base, while the longest eruption began in 1979 and went on for thirteen years. Near-miss: The town of Zafferana was endangered by the streams of the red-hot liquid; however, successful diversion efforts saved the town from much damage . Mount Etna's current activity consists of . continuous summit degassing, explosive Strombolian eruptions, and . frequent basaltic lava flows. It has proved a constant concern for Sicily - with more than 25 per cent of the island's . population living on Etna's slopes. The volatile volcano is also the main source of income . for the island due to a combination of agriculture - stemming from its rich volcanic . soil - and tourism.","Mount Etna's latest eruption was caught on camera from Acireale, near Cantania, in Sicily .

"UKIP is on course to take enough Tory votes to put Ed Miliband in power next year, according to a poll of marginal constituencies. The survey of ten Conservative-held seats suggests the anti-EU party could tip the balance in favour of Labour in all but two of them. The findings will reinforce the central Tory message that Ukip voters risk handing the election to Mr Miliband, who has effectively ruled out holding a referendum on EU membership. New polling shows voters deserting the Tories for Ukip will put Ed Miliband within touching distance of No10 . But the poll, conducted for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, is not all good news for Mr Miliband. It suggests he may have less chance of winning than he hopes because in seats where Ukip is performing really well there are fewer voters switching directly to Labour from Tory. Lord Ashcroft questioned more than 1,000 voters in Conservative-held constituencies where Labour came second in 2010. The survey found a overall 5 per cent swing to Labour in these marginals – enough to snatch nine of them (Brentford & Isleworth, Brighton Kemptown, Corby, Enfield North, Halesowen & Rowley Regis, Hastings & Rye, Hove, Ipswich and Nuneaton). But where Ukip is doing well, Labour might not achieve a 5 per cent swing, because voters who might otherwise have switched straight from blue to red have opted instead for Ukip. Lord Ashcroft said that, coupled with previous surveys in more marginal Tory-held constituencies, the results suggested at least 29 seats would fall to Labour if the findings were repeated at the general election. But he said the swing varied ‘significantly’ depending on the Ukip presence in each seat, with a strong showing from Nigel Farage’s party enough to deny Mr Miliband a lead in Pudsey and Gloucester and threaten his chances in Halesowen. ‘Though nine of these seats would change hands on the basis of these snapshots, Labour will not feel comfortable in many of them,’ said Lord Ashcroft. Labour leader Ed Miliband is on course to win the next election, according to a poll of marginal seats carried out by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft . Prime Minister David Cameron has lost crucial swing voters to Labour in marginal constituencies which hold the key to winning the next election . ‘Though Labour led by ten points in Enfield North and 13 points in Brentford, they were ahead by less than five points in Brighton Kemptown, Hove, Halesowen & Rowley Regis and Nuneaton. ‘Swings to Labour appear to be related to the Ukip presence, which varied significantly from one seat to the next. ‘Nigel Farage’s party scored just 7 per cent in Brentford & Isleworth, where Labour’s share was up 11 points since 2010, but 24 per cent in Halesowen, where Labour were down by two points, though still just ahead.’ The findings will fuel concern in Mr Miliband’s party that complacency about the impact on Labour of the Ukip surge could rob them of victory next year. The Lib Dem vote had fallen by more than half in nearly all seats surveyed, with just 23 per cent of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 saying they would do so again. In Corby the poll took into account the 2012 by-election. The seat had been won by the Tories in 2010 but went Labour when Louise Mensch resigned in 2012. The poll predicts Labour will hold the seat. Meanwhile, a separate poll by Ipsos Mori revealed proposed tax cuts are the most popular policies to emerge from the recent party conference season.","Nine out of 11 marginal Tory seats are likely to vote for Labour in 2015 .

"British ski operators could pull out of Austrian resorts en masse as a new minimum wage law is set to be passed this week. The Austrian government is expected to approve an amendment to the Austrian Anti Wage Dumping Act on Thursday, ensuring that non-resident workers be paid the same wages as Austrian employees. The changes to the act would be enforced from January 1, 2015 - midway through the imminent season. Ski companies face substantial losses if a new Austrian minimum wage law comes into effect on January 1 . Foreign travel companies will have to pay employees a minimum wage of approximately 1,000 euros - around £800 -  per month, and will face fines of up to 10,000 euros (around £8,000) per employee if they do not adhere to the amended legislation, rising to 20,000 euros (around £16,000) for more than three employees or if it is a recurring violation. The operators currently are able to pay staff lower hourly wages because their salary packages often include accommodation and food, flights, insurance, ski hire and passes, as well as compensation for working over holidays and evening shifts. With the ski season kicking off in the next couple of weeks, companies including Powder White, who manage nine chalets in Austria, will be forced to absorb the loss in profit if the changes come into effect on January 1, with ski holidays already sold and staff employed for the 2014/15 season. Fraser Ewart-White, co-founder of Powder White, told MailOnline Travel: 'These highly damaging proposals would lead to a large increase in employment costs, which could see the cost of a family ski holiday to Austria rise by up to £140, jeopardising Austria's position as a value destination. Ski resort staff are often paid lower wages, but given accommodation, food, flights and ski passes . British operator Powder White are fighting the changes, saying the cost of a family holiday could rise by £140 . 'We are working with other ski operators to challenge these plans which, if passed, will affect the viability of providing good value chalet holidays in Austria and would hurt the Austrian tourism industry immensely.' Similiar legislation changes in Switzerland in 2013 resulted in a number of major British ski operators pulling out of the region, with mainly high-end chalets remaining, where the wage increase could be absorbed. The affected chalets were allowed to continue paying staff previously-agreed wages throughout the 2013/14 season. Many of the chalet operators did not renew contracts for this season. Of the Swiss legislation, Andy Perrin, of holiday firm Inghams and its sister companies Ski Total and Esprit Ski told The Mail on Sunday last month: ‘There are no winners with this legislation.’","Austrian Anti Wage Dumping Act could come into effect on January 1 .

"A new trailer for a movie about the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 has hit the internet just 10 weeks after the plane vanished. Rupesh Paul Productions touted The Vanishing Act trailer at the Cannes Film Festival to look for prospective investors on Saturday. It could be in theatres within months as filming is expected to take place over 35 days and have more than 200 actors. Scroll down for video . One of the scenes in the 90-second trailer show two flight attendants sharing a passionate kiss before the flight does down . Someone loading a gun in the plane's bathroom is shown in the trailer looking to attract more investors . The search for the MH370 flight continues in the southern Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia . Flight MH370 was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it lost contact with air traffic control on March 8. It was carrying 12 crew members and 227 passengers from 14 different countries. As the search continues for the missing plane, the film’s movie poster claims to tell the ‘untold story’ behind the doomed flight, news.com.au reports. But based off the trailer it may not be the most accurate account of the tragedy. A Boeing 747 is used in the trailer instead of a Boeing 777 - the actual model of the plane that disappeared. The Vanishing Act's associate director Sritama Dutta said the only similarity between the movie and the disaster was it involved a missing plane. The 90-second trailer casts suspicion on a number of the passengers and crew members aboard. It hints a male MAS flight attendant could have been responsible for the tragedy that killed 239 people. In one of the scenes, a male flight attendant is fraught with jealousy when he spies a stolen kiss between a female flight attendant and another male colleague – one of them presumably his love interest. The Vanishing Act trailer shows a couple sharing an intimate moment on the job, while a jealous colleague watches from behind the curtains . The trailer shown at Cannes hints that the tragic accident may have been a crime of passion from a disgruntled flight attendant who spies his love interest sharing a kiss with another colleague . In another, a creepy male passenger wearing a blue shirt is seen staring down the camera with a look of menace on his face. As the tension builds, cutaway scenes of crew members being thrown around, passengers looking terrified, a passionate goodbye kiss between two flight attendants and a gun being loaded play out over a generic thriller score. A man, presumably a passenger, is depicted as a suspect who brought the MH370 flight down in the Rupesh Paul Production . Rupesh Paul, the man behind the production company, wrote the screenplay in 20 days based on a Malaysian journalist's theory about what happened. The journalist is one of the film's investors and wants to remain anonymous for now. Its budget is $3.5 million. The search for the plane continues in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. A Malaysian Airlines flight attendant looks happy on the job as she walks along the aisles as passengers sleep peacefully, not knowing what is to come .

Detective Ron Stallworth rose up the ranks of the Colorado Springs, Colorado, chapter of the KKK in the 1970s - even becoming its leader - just by responding to a want ad in the local newspaper. Mr Stallworth was able to do all this over the telephone. In the rare times he was required to make an appearance at meetings, he sent a white detective in his place. Now, Mr Stallworth is released a book with his story, Black Klansman, where he reveals just how high the clan had risen in Colorado in the 1920s and 30s and how low it had fallen by the time he began investigating in the 1970s. Telling his story: Retired DRon Stallworth made a mockery of the Ku Klux Klan by infiltrating it in the 1970s. He operated entirely over the telephone . David Duke, the Grand Wizard of the Knights of the KKK, spoke several times on the phone to Mr Stallworth - and the detective played him for a fool . Perhaps his greatest coup was winning over Duke, the charismatic leader of the KKK, who had a national profile after running for public office - including U.S. President. Mr Stallworth claims that he fooled even Duke into thinking he was a white man. 'I can always tell when I’m talking to a n*****. Take you for example. I can tell that you’re a pure Aryan white man by the way you talk, the way you pronounce certain words and letters,' Duke boasted, according to the Daily Beast. Mr Stallworth tells his story in his new ebook, Black Klansman . 'N******s do not have the same intelligence as the white man to properly speak English the way it was meant to be spoken,' he added. Mr Stallworth says he the Klan leader never suspected he was a black man. And he played Duke like a fiddle. He says the Louisiana native was easily flattered and so eager to impress that he shared his plans for rallies and action all over the country. Mr Stallworth passed these along to the FBI and his colleagues at police departments around the country. When Duke visited Colorado Springs, the police chief assigned Mr Stallworth - acting as an office - to guard him. Mr Stallworth used the opportunity to get a picture of himself with his arms around the Klan leader, according to the Daily Beast. Mr Stallworth writes that the Klan used to rule Colorado politics in the 1920s and 30s. Klansman Ben Stapleton was mayor for many years and that the Denver International Airport was named after him until 1995. Governor Clarence Morely was a Klansman and both U.S. Senators had dealings with the Klan. By the 1970s, though, the ranks had thinned and membership had become pathetic. When Duke came to Colorado Springs, for instance, the leader had trouble finding 100 Klansmen with a fully set of the white robes to march alongside him. Stallworth even guarded Duke, pictured left at a 1977 Klan rally, during his visit to Colorado Springs .","Detective Ron Stallworth infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Colorado Springs in the 1970s .

"The mom whose two children were 'slaughtered by their nanny' is now facing the daily trauma of coming face to face with the sister of their alleged killer on the school run. Marina Krim arrived home to the family apartment in the Upper West Side last October to find two of her three children dead in the bath-tub with horrific stab wounds and slit throats. Lucia, 6, and 2-year-old Leo Krim were found next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega, who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt. Marina Krimn (left) with her husband Kevin in 2009. The mom is said to be 'haunted' by her children's alleged sister by coming face to face with her sister daily on the school run . According to the New York Post, now Ortega's lookalike sister, who is also a caregiver, babysits a girl who attends the same public school as the Krims' surviving daughter, Nessie. In an email the paper says it has seen  a copy of, Mrs Krim describes her anguish at discovering that the family that employs Celia Ortega lives near them once again . She says: 'Can you imagine my anxiety as I am walking out of school with Nessie and on a daily basis wondering if I am going to run into this woman? 'She introduced us to the defendant who murdered our kids and Nessie's sister and brother,' the email continues. 'Making it all worse, we now find out she lied about the defendant's background to improve the chances of us hiring the defendant.' 'Now, Marina is reliving her nightmare every day,' a close friend told the paper. Mrs Krim and her husband, Kevin, took Nessie and left the city for a couple of months after the horrific incident to try to start over. They relocated to Tribeca when they returned to New York in early 2013. Kevin and Marina Krim have revealed how their surviving daughter Nessie, is helping them deal with the agony of the murder of her siblings Leo, 2,  and Lucia, 6 . Nanny Yoselyn Ortega (center) with Lucia Krim (right) and Nessie (left) before the horrific attack last year . But the parents who employ Ortega's sister, Henley and Xabi Vazquez, had moved from the Upper West Side themselves to the same neighborhood, and their little girl now attends the same school as Nessie. 'The most upsetting part is [the Krims] really moved as far away as possible from the scene and tried to rebuild their lives,' the friend continued. 'They've been doing great. And now it comes back to haunt them.' The school principal tried to resolve the situation by asking the Vazquezes not to send the nanny to school pickups, the New York Post reported, and in the end they settled on an arrangement that would see Celia Ortega pick up 15 minutes after everyone else. But Mrs Krim wrote in her email: 'the other day, I saw Celia three feet from me at 2:56 pm. Lucia (left), 6, and 2-year-old Leo Krim (right) were found dead in their family home on the Upper West Side . 'My heart was racing, I was disturbed and angry . . . Celia was practically wearing a disguise, wearing big sunglasses and an olive-green quilted coat, she basically grabbed the daughter and rushed away, looking to me like she knew she was breaking the bargain. I just cannot deal with this anymore, enough is enough.' In the days following Lucia and Leo's deaths, it was reported that Celia Ortega was wracked with guilt and sorrow because she helped her sister get the job. 'I don't know what happened. She loved the kids. She loved Marina,'she said. 'I would like to die. I would give my life for the children to come back.' At the time, Mrs Ortega also said that she could not face seeing Mrs Krim. 'I can't talk to Marina now. Maybe when she is more relaxed. I will give her a hug,' she said. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Nanny Yoselyn Ortega is alleged to have killed Lucia and Leo Krim  last year .

"An audio recording of underwater sounds might have captured the moment MH370 crashed into the ocean. The low-frequency sound was picked up by underwater listening devices in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia on March 8, the same day the Boeing 777 disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board. Researchers at Curtin University in Western Australia have been analysing the signal to see if it may be the sound of the plane crashing into the ocean. The recording would place the missing plane in the central Indian Ocean – nearly 5,000km from cape Leeuwin on the Perth coastline, outside the original southern Indian Ocean search zone. Scroll down for video . An underwater recording may have captured the moment the missing Malaysia Airlines plane hit the water after it lost contact on March 8 . This map shows the estimated uncertainty region (yellow box) for the source of the signals. Magenta points and text show the locations of the various recording stations . The low-frequency noise was picked up by two devices near the Perth coast, just off Cape Leeuwin and Rottnest Island. The sound was detected at 1.30am, on March 8, ten minutes after MH370 lost contact with air traffic control. 'One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash,' Dr Alec Duncan, a senior research fellow with the Centre for Marine Science and Technology told CNN. The researchers have calculated an 'uncertainty box' for the signal's origin. The box stretches some 4,000 kilometers in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean. At its widest point it spans some 200 to 300 kilometers in width. These are the type of CMST Acoustic Recorders that captured the possible MH370 noise. They are programmed autonomous underwater acoustic receivers, capable of recording underwater sound for many months . 'The sound was heard very approximately 5000km from Cape Leeuwin. It's a very rubbery number,' Dr Alec Duncan told MailOnline. The scientist said he is only '10 per cent' sure that the noise came from MH370 hitting the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank. 'We've been very up front that this is fairly unlikely to be revealed to be MH370.' Dr Duncan does not believe that releasing this new information will give false to hope the families who have lost their loved ones, instead he thinks it will come as a reassurance. 'I think it will be reassuring for families to know people are beavering away in the background... despite the fact that what we've found is not going to help a lot.' Curtin University researchers have used underwater sound recordings to come up with a possible estimate for where MH370 might have crashed. One of the recordings was taken at Rottnest Island (shown in this map) Unfortunately the locations of the sound recordings do not match up with the original search arc plotted in the southern Indian Ocean, where 26 nations, using either ships, aircraft or technical expertise, have been searching the waters off the Australian coast. He believes the most likely source of the noise was probably an earthquake or other natural event. However, Dr Duncan claimed search teams are still 'probably going to take a look there' and that he and his team will 'keep chipping away' at trying to locate the plane . 'I certainly would if I was them. There's certainly not a lot else to go on.' The data that he and his team at Curtin University have uncovered has already attracted significant interest from search authorities. 'They've been encouraging us considerably to keep on looking at it and to refine the numbers. I've been over to Canberra to talk to them and we continue to have a very close relationship with them,' Dr Duncan told WA Today. The acoustic signals recorded by the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) sound recorder west of Rottnest Island (top) and by one of the hydrophones of the CTBTO's HA01 hydroacoustic station off Cape Leeuwin (bottom). Arrows show the arrival time at each station of the peak energy of the signal, thought to possibly be MH370 crashing into the Indian Ocean . One of the underwater listening devices that recorded the low frequency sound is located some 20 kilometres off Perth. It's designed to listen to whales and other marine life but it can also detect black box 'pings' in the 30-40 kHz range. Another of the devices is designed to listen for signs of underwater nuclear explosions . It's operated by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System. Seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO Mark Prior told CNN that it's possible for the devices to record a plane crash 'but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular'. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre, who are organising the search for the missing plane, said they would consider Curtin University's findings but said: 'The current results are not compatible with the international search team's analysis of the most likely area where MH370 entered the water.' The search for the missing plane is now focused on the southern Indian Ocean, which is 5,000km from where the sound was recorded .","Researchers from Curtin University recorded underwater sounds the same day MH370 lost contact .

"British scientists have captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm, by studying the blue fluorescence that travels cell-to-cell until the whole organism is dead. Researchers from the Wellcome Trust and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) likened the spread of the blue glow travelling through the worm's . body to that of the Grim Reaper, stalking death. They believe that the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people and perhaps even lead to an increase in life expectancy. Scroll down for video... British scientists have captured death spreading like a wave through the body of a worm, by studying the blue fluorescence that spreads cell-to-cell until the whole organism is dead. The worm is pictured on the right is glowing bright, signalling that it is closer to death than when it was photographed on the left . Professor Gems said: 'Together the findings cast doubt on the theory that ageing is simply a consequence of an accumulation of molecular damage.' When individual cells die, they trigger a chemical chain reaction that leads to the breakdown of cell components and a build-up of molecular debris. The molecular mechanisms of this are reasonably well understood at a cellular level but we know much less about how death spreads throughout an organism at the end of its life. In worms, the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm. The study, published in PLoS Biology, reveals that this fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling. Professor David Gems from the Institute of Health Ageing at University College London, who led the study, said: 'We’ve identified a chemical pathway of self-destruction that propagate cell death in worms, which we see as this glowing blue fluorescence travelling through the body. 'It’s like a blue Grim Reaper, tracking death as it spreads throughout the organism until all life is extinguished. 'We found that when we blocked this pathway, we could delay death induced by a stress such as infection, but we couldn’t slow death from old age. 'This suggests that ageing causes death by a number of processes acting in parallel.' The mechanisms involved are similar to those that are active in mammals, confirming that the worm can provide a useful model to understand cell death in people. In worms, the spread of death can be seen easily under a microscope as a wave of blue fluorescence travelling through the gut of the worm (pictured). This fluorescence is caused by a cell death pathway called necrosis and its spread throughout the organism is dependent on calcium signalling . The source of the blue fluorescence was previously thought to be a substance called lipofuscin, which emits light of a similar colour and has been linked to ageing because it accumulates with increasing molecular damage. However, scientists now think another molecule called anthranilic acid is the source of the blue hue and the study shows that lipofuscin is not involved. Professor Gems said: 'Together the findings cast doubt on the theory that ageing is simply a consequence of an accumulation of molecular damage. 'We need to focus on the biological events that occur during ageing and death to properly understand how we might be able to interrupt these processes.' the research could eventually prove to be a useful model to understanding death in people .

"As the Ebola outbreak rampages through Africa scientists are privately concerned the virus could mutate to become airborne, one expert has warned. So far 2,300 people have lost their lives to the disease with more than 4,300 cases recorded in West Africa in the last six months - the worst outbreak since the disease was discovered in 1976. The World Health Organisation has warned there may be thousands of new cases each week in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria by early October. Fifteen countries could be hit by the outbreak - putting the lives of 22 million people at risk, a new study has revealed. But behind closed doors, virologists fear what we have seen so far may be just the tip of the iceberg. Scroll down for video . As the Ebola outbreak rampages through West Africa, one expert has warned the virus could mutate to become airborne. Pictured are health workers carrying the body of a woman they suspect died from the virus in Clara Town, Monrovia in Liberia . Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota said virologists are loathed to discuss their concerns for fear of whipping up hysteria. He said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola' Writing for the New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time. The virus can currently only be transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, including blood, of an infected patient. But  Dr Osterholm warns viruses similar to Ebola are notorious for replicating and reinventing themselves. It means the virus that first broke out in Guinea in February may be very different to the one now invading Nigeria, Congo and Cameroon. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' In 2012, Canadian researchers found the virus could be passed via the respiratory system between pigs and monkeys - both of which have similar lungs to humans. It was the same virus as that which is responsible for the current death toll in West Africa. A new study by Oxford University scientists created this new map showing the places most at risk of an Ebola outbreak. They predict up to 22 million people could be at risk . Dr Osterholm said public health officials, while discussing the possibility in private, are reluctant to air their concerns. 'They don't want to be accused of screaming ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater - as I'm sure some will accuse me of doing. 'But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.' He called for the United Nations to mobilise medical, public health and humanitarian aid to 'smother the epidemic'. Meanwhile Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. 'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus. 'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. 'In order to change it would have to develop a whole new system to allow it to attach to the receptors in the respiratory system. 'The difference with this outbreak is the intensity of the transmissions, it is spreading much more in communities rather than hospitals, as in the past. 'The best thing we can do is stop the current outbreak.' Professor Heymann said the way to take control of the virus is adopting the same three-pronged strategy that has proved successful in the past. 'The first thing to do is isolate any patient with the virus, and get them to hospital, while ensuring healthworkers are protected,' he said. 'The second is contact tracing, to identify those at risk. 'Once identified those people must have their temperatures checked twice a day and if they develop a fever within 21 days, they should be hospitalised. 'And the third thing to help combat the virus is community empowerment, helping people understand how it spreads and how to stop it spreading.' Workers wearing protective clothing stand next to a mother holding her child inside the contaminated area at the Elwa Hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia . Currently the virus can only be transmitted through contact with a victim's bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, diarrhoea and other secretions . His views come as Oxford scientists have created a new map of places most at risk of an Ebola outbreak. They warn regions likely to be home to animals harbouring the virus are more widespread than previously feared, particularly in West Africa. The virus, which can have a human mortality rate of up to 90 per cent, is thought to be carried by bats or other wild animals and to cross into humans through contact with blood, meat or other infected fluids. These jumps by viruses from animals to humans are known as 'zoonotic events' and were the cause of major human disease outbreaks such as HIV and the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The map, published as the West Africa Ebola outbreak, the world's largest, stands at almost 2,100, found that large swathes of central Africa as well as the western part of the continent have traits of what the scientists called 'the zoonotic niche' for Ebola. Understanding better where people come into contact with Ebola-infected animals - for example through hunting or eating bush meat - and how to stop them contracting the deadly disease, is crucial to preventing future outbreaks, the researchers said. Nick Golding, an Oxford University researcher who worked on the international mapping team, said it found significantly more regions at risk from Ebola than previously feared. 'Up until now there hadn't been a huge amount of research, but there was one paper in which the at-risk area was much smaller,' he said in a telephone interview. 'It didn't predict, for example, the area in Guinea where this current outbreak first started.'","Dr Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota said virologists are privately concerned the deadly virus could mutate .

"The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter. A statement read: ‘The hospital denies that Michael Schumacher has died.’ The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died . Rumours of his death prompted some journalists to gather at the hospital. Schumacher, 45, was put into an artificial coma after suffering traumatic brain injury in a near-fatal skiing accident on December 29. Shutting down function can give the brain time to heal. Last week his manager Sabine Kehm confirmed that he was being brought round from his coma. Grenoble University Hospital put an end to wild speculation circulating on the internet, including social networking site Twitter . She said: ‘Michael’s sedation has recently been reduced to initiate a process of awakening which may take a long time.’ According to sources cited in the French media the seven-time world champion blinked during brain tests last week. Citing ‘very reliable sources’, L’Equipe newspaper said Schumacher had undergone a number of neurological tests and had responded ‘positively’. Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up . Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France . Surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident. Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside. Schumacher had his catastrophic accident in the French ski resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. He had been skiing on the piste with his son Mick, 14, and family friends. Shortly after 11am he skied on to a patch of rocky off-piste located in between two runs. He skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two. Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash . He was wearing a helmet camera and his entire accident was recorded. Investigators said it was a freak accident and Schumacher, who is a very competent skier, was not skiing at an excessive speed. He was airlifted off the mountain and taken to Grenoble University Hospital where doctors put him into a medically-induced coma. A scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage. His manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life. A top neurosurgeon said stricken Michael Schumacher's brain cells are 'working together like a Formula One team' in a bid to get him to wake up from his six  week long coma. Dr Munther Sabarini, neurosurgeon and founder of the Avicenna Hospitals in  Berlin, Hamburg and Zurich, says the vital pyramidal neurons - control cells -  'are working together, so to speak, like an F1 team.  So if a driver shows  weakness, then another driver takes over under the new situation.  So it is  with the brain cells.  You can support brain function with a lot of resources  so that the healing process is accelerated and cause as little damage as  possible. 'Typically high-energy bodily functions are shut down during a coma. Only  after awakening can they be enabled again.  The vital signs are observed and  corrected. It is then up to the doctors to do a great deal; physiotherapy,  mental care, treatment of new or old diseases. 'Depending on the aid required the patient receives medication - usually called neuro vitamins - but the measures applied vary stronly from case to case.   After awakening one needs a few months to a few years to learn to overcome  physical changes. Young and healthy people like Michael Schumacher have better  chances to recover from such a trauma.' His medical team at the Grenoble University Hospital in France announced last week they are slowly reducing the anaesthetic that has kept Schumacher, 45, unconscious since his low-speed ski accident on December 29 when he smashed his  head on to rocks. This could take many more weeks. Anaesthetic gases which may have accumulated  in his body's fatty tissue must be removed extremely slowly. So far, there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment, according to  medical sources.  He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently. Three times  daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory  drive. He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up  phase to see if such things are returning naturally. Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his  prone position is pneumonia.  The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can  make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory  infection. Andreas Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and  Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus  Magazine; 'About 30 to 50 percent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as  Michael Schumacher has get it.' His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and  even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing.  He lies on a special  air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under  constant vigliance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the  bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection.

"The death toll from a horrific tour bus crash has risen from five to nine after the vehicle slid off an icy interstate in Oregon before tumbling over a steep embankment near an area known as Deadman Pass. Police say the bus lost control along snow and ice-covered lanes on Interstate 84 causing it to crash through a guardrail in eastern Oregon around 10.30am this morning injuring more than 20 others. The bus carrying about 40 people from Las Vegas to Vancouver, B.C. fell about a few hundred feet before finally coming to a stop according to state police. Emergency rescue: Emergency workers rushed to a frightening wreckage that left nine people dead after their tour bus crashed in Eastern Oregon injuring 26 others on Sunday morning . Destination: Oregon police say the tour bus was heading to Vancouver from Las Vegas when it lost control on the slippery interstate . Tragedy: By Sunday evening the death toll from this grisly wreckage had risen from five to nine people with the bus driver among the 26 others injured . Deadly slide: The tour bus careened through a guardrail along an icy Oregon highway before falling several hundred feet down this steep embankment . All of the last 'viable victims' have since been removed from the bus, according to Pendleton Fire Chief Gary Woodson speaking to East Oregonian. Rescue workers were using ropes to help retrieve people from the crash scene. St. Anthony Hospital in Pendleton treated . 26 people from the accident, including some who were treated and then . transported to other medical facilities, said hospital spokesman Larry . Blanc. The bus driver was among the survivors, but had not yet spoken to police because of the severity of the injuries the driver had suffered. Lt. Greg Hastings said the bus crashed along the west end of the Blue Mountains, and west of an area called Deadman Pass. Stretches of highway in the rural and agricultural area of east Oregon tend to be icy in winter months. The bus slid down the hill and landed upright, with little or no debris visible around the crash site. Escape: Survivors were pulled up to the roadside by ropes before at least 26 of them transferred to a local hospital . Crash scene: Police say the bus lost control along snow and ice-covered lanes on Interstate 84 nearly Pendleton causing it to crash through a guardrail in eastern Oregon around 10.30am this morning . Deadly conditions: The fatal crash was the second seen on Interstate 84 pictured on Sunday morning with a 69-year-old man killed in a rollover accident earlier in the day . I-84 is a major east-west highway through Oregon that follows the Columbia River Gorge. Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C. A woman who answered the phone at a listing for the company confirmed with The Associated Press that it owned the bus and said it was on a tour of the Western U.S. She declined to give her name. A bus safety website run by the U.S. Department of Transportation said Mi Joo Tour & Travel has six buses, none of which have been involved in any accidents in at least the past two years. First responders: Rescue personnel respond to the scene on I-84, east of Pendleton, where rope was used to help bring up survivors . Dramatic fall: The green tour bus is just seen on the right after sliding down the embankment after its crash off the interstate . Treacherous: The frozen winter conditions throughout the area made the roads incredibly slippery to drivers, with another fatal crash seen along the interstate earlier that morning . A spokesman for the American Bus Association said buses carry more than 700 million passengers a year in the United States. 'The industry as a whole is a very safe industry,' said Dan Ronan of the Washington, D.C.,-based group. 'There are only a handful of accidents every year.

Other new devices unveiled on Wednesday are a £79 ($99) Kindle Fire HD tablet, which includes a smaller, six-inch screen as well as a tablet designed for kids that starts at £119 ($149). Amazon also upgraded its 7-inch and 8.9 inch Fire tablets. All the upgraded and new devices start shipping in October. The expanding Kindle lineup underscores Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' commitment to developing devices as a way to retain users and bolster its core business of retail and shopping. This year alone, Amazon has launched a set-top box, a grocery ordering wand and a Fire smart phone, which debuted in July to lackluster reviews. Amazon, which entered the hardware sector with the 2007 launch of the Kindle, has adopted a strategy of selling the devices at cost, and it profits when users buy content or goods. The Kindle Voyage, left, and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. The new and updated devices come on the heels of Amazon's Fire smartphone launch in June and the launch of a Fire set-top box that allows online video streaming to your TV in April. It has been investing heavily in content, inking a deal this year to stream some HBO shows including 'The Sopranos' and 'The Wire' to members of its Prime subscription program. 'The vast majority of people are still using the tablets,' David Limp, vice president of devices for Amazon, said during a briefing with reporters in New York. Executives touted the Kindle Voyage as the thinnest device Amazon has ever made. The company hopes heavy readers might adopt the device, which more closely mimic a paper book. The £59 ($79) Kindle is crucial to attract new users, particularly in markets like China, Japan and Germany, where e-readers are starting to gain traction, executives said.","Retailer revealed six new devices in its biggest ever hardware launch .

"Horses are the latest victims of the obesity crisis as they take the burden of their overweight riders, experts have warned. A study found a third of recreational riders were too obese for their mounts, leaving the animals at risk of health problems such as back pain and lameness. They can also develop behavioural problems, such as bucking, rearing and problems following commands. Horses are the latest to suffer from the obesity crisis - because riders are too heavy for them, say researchers . Hayley Randle, one of the  scientists . behind the research, said: ‘People tend to think horses are such big . animals they must be okay, and not to take notice of the weight issue of . riders. But the health impact on the horse can be quite extreme, quite . quickly.’ Published in the Journal of . Veterinary Behaviour, the study assessed 152 horses and their adult . riders from stables across Devon and Cornwall. Guidelines set by vets state that . riders should weigh less than 10 per cent of the weight of their horse. But researchers from Duchy College in Cornwall found that just 5 per . cent of the riders passed the test. Riders should weight no more than 10 per cent of their horse's weight to prevent it from suffering from health problems as it adjusts to its load, scientists at Duchy College said . Thirty-two per cent weighed more than . 15 per cent of the weight of their animal, a level considered to pose a . welfare risk. The remaining 63 per cent tipped the scales at between 10 . and 15 per cent of the weight of their horse – a level seen as . ‘satisfactory’. Miss Randle, who conducted the study . with Emma Halliday, said guidelines should be put into place to protect . horses from overweight riders. She added: ‘The problem is that these . ratios are not widely known by people in the horse industry. People do . seem generally to be a bit heavy for horses. That is just a consequence, . I suppose, of our average weights going up. It is definitely a . potential welfare issue. These are broad-brush guidelines. ‘They don’t take account of all . factors, such as the age of the horse, the breed, the style of riding or . the experience of the rider. ‘But they are still important and helpful and people are not taking enough notice of them.’ Keith Chandler, president of the . British Equine Veterinary Association, said his members spent a large . part of their time dealing with lameness and back problems, which is . often be caused by ‘the wrong riders on the wrong horses’. He added: ‘Many riding schools are . very aware of these problems and exactly who can ride which horses and . who cannot, but there are some horse people who may not fully understand . the issues. ‘There is a discussion which needs to . take place in the horse riding community. There needs to be an awareness . that some larger riders need to ride bigger horses.’","Only one in 20 riders are within the optimum weight for their horse .

"Michael Treanor, the gambling mogul who wants to turn upstate New York into a Vegas-style resort was shockingly accused of sexually assaulting his sister - but incredibly claimed it was consensual. Nevele Investor and Claremont Partners CEO Treanor, 48, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault in 2007 after a night out with his sibling, according to a civil lawsuit she filed in 2008. She accused the married father of three daughters of trying to force himself upon her before they passed out at her New York City apartment and ripping off her pajama bottoms. Skeletons in the closet: Michael Treanor poses in front of a model of a proposed casino and resort at the former Nevele Hotel in New York's Catskill mountains . 'I remember suddenly being shoved across my bed and into the wall on the other side of the bed,' the sister, now 41, said in an affidavit according to The New York Post. 'The knuckles on my right hand smashed into the wall. Michael pulled off my pajama bottoms.' The pair were drinking at the now-closed Red Rock West Saloon in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood when Treanor became overly-friendly with his sister according to court documents. The businessman who has put down $1 million to compete with 21 other developers for one of four casino license's being awarded in the Catskill mountains denies that anything illegal happened that night. He countered that the pair fell asleep and that the encounter was consensual. He admitted to 'having made intentional contact with the victim in this case recklessly causing injury to her genitals.' However, his sister told The New York Post that 'I stand by everything that's in those papers...I have nothing to hide.' Drunken evening: This is a picture of the now-closed Red Rock West Saloon bar in Chelsea that Michael Treanor was drinking in with his sister in 2007 . Married: Michael Treanor and his wife Lisa Dodman Treanor remained married almost seven-years after the incident with his sister . After pleading guilty to the lesser offense of third-degree assault in Manhattan Criminal Court - he received a sentence of three years probation and one year of psychological counseling. He did test positive for cocaine twice during the first year of the probationary period, according to court papers. The outcome of the civil suit filed against Treanor in 2008 was sealed by the court. His sister told The New York Post that she no longer speaks to her brother but he is still married. Treanor, the father of three daughters, ages 10, 15 and 17, who resides in Bernardsville, NJ, is the face of the consortium trying to restore the dilapidated Nevele Grande hotel in the Catskills with a $420 million proposal to turn it into a casino. Relaxing: Treanor, 48, has plans to turn the Catskills into a gambling mecca like Las Vegas . The luxury resort closed in 2009, $21 million in debt. Treanor’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, said the alleged sexual assault was 'a dispute over money, and I believe the allegations were engineered by a financial dispute. 'And he resolved this by deciding not to drag this up by going to trial, and he did so with a plea to a reckless offense. It was not a sex offense.'","Millionaire Michael Treanor was accused of sexually assaulting his sister six-years ago after a drunken night out .

"Royal Bank of Scotland has squandered every penny of taxpayers’ rescue cash after racking up £46billion in losses since the financial crisis. This equates to more than £1,500 for every taxpayer in the UK. The state-backed lender delivered the grim figures yesterday as it revealed it had slumped further into the red. Some £1.7billion was wiped off its value as shares plunged by almost eight per cent. The bank posted an £8.2billion loss for last year and sparked another row over pay with plans to award £576million in bonuses. The loss was driven by a spiralling bill for mis-selling and restructuring costs and is the biggest since it posted the worst loss in UK corporate history of £24billion in 2008. Grim: Royal Bank of Scotland chief Ross McEwan announcing losses of £8.2billion for last year . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable led a chorus of criticism over the latest pay bonanza. Mr Clegg said a bank ‘on life support’ should not be ‘dishing out even larger bonuses’. RBS is 81 per cent owned by taxpayers after receiving a £46billion bail-out in 2008 and 2009. In total, the lender has since paid out £4.6billion in bonuses – £1billion for every £10billion it has lost. Appearing under a slogan declaring ‘A bank that earns your trust’, RBS chief Ross McEwan acknowledged that ‘it is a highly emotional issue to see bonuses paid when we are still losing money’. But he said he needed to ‘pay competitively’ to attract and retain the best staff. The argument received short shrift yesterday. Mr Cable said ‘the public simply will not understand why big bonuses and large salaries continue to be paid out by a loss-making public enterprise’. Predecessor: Stephen Hester was ousted as chief executive with a pay-off worth up to £5.6million after intervention by Chancellor George Osborne . TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady added: ‘There would be no RBS had it not been bailed out by taxpayers. Ordinary people will be wondering how on earth a bank which has made such huge losses for six consecutive years can find a penny in bonuses for its bankers, let alone hundreds of millions.’ Labour also said the Government should reject any request by RBS to pay bumper bonuses for 2014 following the introduction of an EU cap. The punishing losses mark another setback for plans to sell RBS back to the private sector. Chairman Sir Philip Hampton predicted last May that the Government should be able to start selling shares by the middle of this year. But Mr McEwan conceded that the bank was not strong enough to ‘be privatised at a profit for the taxpayer in the immediate future’. The New Zealander replaced Stephen Hester as chief executive last summer. His predecessor was ousted – with a pay-off worth up to £5.6million – after intervention by Chancellor George Osborne. The Treasury had become increasingly concerned that he was not the right man to lead the bank through privatisation. Mr McEwan said the ‘days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world are well and truly over’ and instead laid out plans for it to become the ‘best bank in the UK for customers’. However, he admitted it would take time to win the public’s trust. ‘We are the least trusted company in the least trusted sector of the economy,’ he said. ‘So the goal of my plan is very simple. We have to be a bank that earns your trust.’ Critical: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Business Secretary Vince Cable led a chorus of criticism over the bank's latest pay bonanza . The lender, which also owns NatWest and Ulster Bank, announced a series of measures to win back the public. These include an end to better rates for online customers and ditching ‘sweetener’ payments used to attract new account holders. But Mr McEwan also became the latest bank boss to warn of plans to shut branches, as more customers bank electronically. He said the busiest branch is ‘the 7.01 from Reading to Paddington’ as increasing numbers of customers use RBS’s mobile app. ‘We have to accept there will be less branches,’ he said. RBS also said it aims to trim £5billion from its running costs by 2017. Mr McEwan said this would involve ‘difficult choices on jobs in the years ahead’. More than 41,000 workers have lost their posts since the bank was bailed out.","Loss equates to more than  £1,500 for every taxpayer in the UK .

"As research topics go, it has to be one of the most bird-brained. A university has received £2million of taxpayers’ cash to investigate how humans have got on with chickens over the past 8,000 years. The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) awarded the grant to a three-year study, led by Bournemouth University, called ‘Cultural and Scientific Perceptions of Human-Chicken Interactions’. Mark Maltby (pictured) reader in Archaeology at Bournemouth University is involved in the three year study. The controversial £2m grant, will be used to fund experts from six universities while they examine and collate data, write articles and go on field trips to examine the history of the chicken . But critics have reacted with fury . that public money is going to such a project while funds for the . disabled and sick are being cut. Some . of the cash will even be used to send students to live in Cuba and . Ethiopia to learn about how  people there interact with chickens. The study begins in January, and  will involve archaeologists, PhD  students, geneticists and anthropologists. Project . leader Mark Maltby, reader in archaeology at Bournemouth University, . said: ‘What we uncover about chickens may lead us to find out more of a . wider history about the people keeping them.’ And . he defended the size of the grant, saying it will be shared between . university researchers at Bournemouth, Roehampton, Nottingham, Durham, . Leicester and York. The results of the research will be used in a series . of exhibitions in museums across Britain. Some of the funding will be used to send students to live in Cuba and Ethiopia (pictured) to study how people there interact with chickens. But taxpayer campaign groups are crying fowl over the publicly funded project and have branded it a 'ridiculous study' The three-year investigation will start in January and will be carried about by academics including archaeologists, PHD students, geneticists, and anthropologists. Researchers will examine when domesticated chickens spread across Europe and when humans started using them for meat and eggs . A . spokesman for the AHRC  said: ‘Today there are well over 20billion . chickens worldwide, yet we still know very little about their social and . cultural history. pugh . Our attitudes towards chickens are complex – from the . rituals of the roast dinner  on Sunday and the convenience of fast . food, to named birds kept in back yards. ‘This . project will conduct detailed analysis of their natural and cultural . history in the West and the findings will be shared with poultry . breeders and schoolchildren.’ But . Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said yesterday: ‘This is . frankly an absurd sum of money to spend on what appears to be a . ridiculous study. ‘Given the . limited budget and important challenges facing the UK, research like . this should be way down the pecking order for taxpayer-funded grants.’ Meanwhile, . the Dorset Blind Association is struggling to secure £40,000 of funding . to maintain services it offers to vulnerable people. Its . chief executive, Jonathan Holyhead, said: ‘I am really struggling to . see why funding something of this nature should take priority over a . charity supporting disabled people. ‘I am also struggling to understand the need for this research, especially given how tight funding is for a charity like ours. ‘We have spoken to the local authority several times about funding without success.’","The money will be used to send students to live in Cuba and Ethiopia as well as to pay academics for collating data and writing reports .

"Racing through the mountain range on horseback, the Kazakh people practice their ancient tradition of hunting with golden eagles. The eagles soar through the air at speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first, during an annual festival celebrating the heritage of the Turkic group. The Golden Eagle festival is held every October in Bayan-Olgii, a province in western Mongolia. Photographer captures the Kazakh people practising their ancient tradition of hunting with golden eagles . Belgian photographer and software developer Stefan Cruysberghs captured these stunning photographs when he travelled to the region to witness the occasion first-hand. The 38-year-old, of Lommel, Belgium, said: 'The world is evolving fast, but these Kazakh people still practice the ancient art of training and hunting with golden eagles, and they do it with a lot of passion. 'The competitions during the Golden Eagle Festival show the long-term and trusting relationship between the eagle and the hunter. 'During the first competition each golden eagle is released from the top of a mountain and the birds race to catch some meat which is held by an eagle hunter on his galloping horse. 'The eagle and hunter are communicating with each other via cries, and whichever hunters' eagle reaches the meat the fastest, wins the game.' On horseback, the Kazakh people compete in the Golden Eagle Festival in Bayan-Olgii . The eagles reach speeds of up to 200mph as they race to reach their keeper first during the annual festival . Starting young: 13-year-old Ashol-Pan is just one of the many competitors at the Golden Eagle Festival . The Kazakhs of the Altai mountain range in western Mongolia are the only people that hunt with golden eagles, and today there are around 400 practising falconers. The tradition of hunting with golden eagles is said to have been started by the nomadic Khitans from Manchuria in northern China around 940AD. Other activities held during the Golden Eagle festival include horse racing, archery and Bushkashi, which is a goatskin tug of war on horseback . The festival also sees awards handed out for Best Turned Out Eagle And Owner, Best Eagle At Hunting Prey and Best Eagle At Locating Its Owner From A Distance. Discussing the bond between eagles and their human counterparts, photographer Stefan says: 'Young female golden eagles are caught in the wild and aren't given any food for several days. 'They will then start to accept food from humans and when trust between hunter and bird is gained, the hunter will start training the eagle. 'They become a part of the family and a long-term relationship is created. 'The relationship between the eagle and hunter only lasts for six to eight years and they take part in the competitions together year after year. 'After that, the female eagle is released back into the wild so she can breed.' Eagle hunter Berik sits with his eagle at the festival in Bayan Olgii, a province in western Mongolia . Belgian photographer and software designer, Stefan Cruysberghs, headed to Mongolia to see the festivities for himself . The Kazakhs of the Altai mountain range are the only people that hunt with golden eagles, and today there are around 400 practising falconers . Every October up to 70 eagle hunters and a host of tourists gather to celebrate Kazakh customs in the shadow of the Altai Mountains during the annual two day Golden Eagle Festival. The hunters wear traditional costumes, complete with fur coats made of marmot, fox or wolf skins which have been caught by their eagles. The more extravagant the coat the more respected the hunter is. Stefan says: 'The Kazakh eagle hunting tradition was always male-dominated, but nowadays some fathers teach their young daughters the art and skills of the ancient eagle hunter tradition. 'This year there were two young girls at the Golden Eagle Festival, it is great to see that young people still embrace their cultural heritage.'

"Ed Miliband says he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions to reinvigorate British politics . The public could be given the chance to grill the Prime Minister every week in Parliament if Ed Miliband wins the next election. The Labour leader said he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions to reinvigorate British politics. But the plan risked backfiring, because only those willing – and able – to travel into central London would ever stand a chance of taking part. And just a year ago Labour complained about the cost of David Cameron's events taking questions from the public across the country. In the latest stage of Mr Miliband’s summer relaunch, he revealed he is in talks with Commons Speaker John Bercow about staging regular public Q&A sessions in Westminster. 'I think what we need is a public question time, where regularly the prime minister submits himself or herself to questioning from members of the public in the Palace of Westminster on Wednesdays,' he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. 'Why is that important? Because I want to let the public in to our politics. 'At the moment there is the glass that separates the public in the gallery from the House of Commons, but there is a gulf miles wide between the kind of politics people want and what Prime Minister's Questions offers.' However, Downing Street insiders were quick to point out that David Cameron has been taking part in regular question and answer events for more than eight years. In opposition they were known as Cameron Direct, and since taking power the PM Direct events have been held in factories, warehouses, offices and community halls across the country, . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, also subjects himself to weekly grillings on his radio phone-in on LBC 97.3. Mr Miliband admitted his plan was in part inspired by the success of Mr Clegg’s broadcasts. 'He got a whole load of bile about it when he did it and I remember saying to people 'actually, it's good thing to do'. 'I will do that in terms of radio phone-ins but I want to do more.' Mr Miliband argues that the weekly bouts in the Commons chamber leave voters detached from the political process . Labour said it hoped the Public Question Time would be held at least once a fortnight and possibly weekly in Parliament if the Speaker allows it. People asking the questions ‘would be chosen by a method to ensure a wide representation of the country and political backgrounds’. Those invited 'would not just be cheerleading Labour supporters', Mr Miliband insisted. Embarrassingly, a year ago Labour criticsed Mr Cameron for holding Q&A sessions with voters. In two years, the cost of 12 PM Direct events came to £50,000, which Labour MP Pamela Nash was 'a lot of taxpayers' money to be wasting on what are essentially publicity events'. However, Labour insisted what Mr Miliband was proposing was a 'formal' chance to hold the Prime Minister to account, and not just a campaign event. Downing Street said it would consider the idea, but raised doubts about how voters from places like Cumbria, Northern Ireland or Penzance would get to London to take part. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister is open to new ways of engaging with the public. He already holds regular PM Directs, where he takes questions from members of the public in towns and cities across the country.' But a government source added: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are talking about fixing the economy and getting people into work. Ed Miliband is talking about his image and tweaking parliamentary procedure’. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has been taking questions from the public for more than a year on his weekly radio phone-in . David Cameron started holding Cameron Direct events in opposition, and they have continued since taking power, including this one at Asda in Leeds in 2012 . Mr Bercow's office said it would examine any proposals submitted by the Labour leader - which it said echoed similar reforms already submitted to a review. 'The Speaker will look at Mr Miliband's suggestions with interest, when he receives them. Clearly, any changes would be a matter for the House,' his spokeswoman said. 'The Speaker's special Commission looking at the effects of the digital revolution on our democracy has received similar suggestions from people outside Parliament. 'However, it is clear that within Westminster there is also an appetite for further reforms to the way the House of Commons conducts itself.' Mr Miliband said voters 'deserve a better debate' than one unduly focused on image. 'This isn't C-List celebrity, this isn't an ugly person's showbiz contest, this is about more than that.' He went on: 'I will talk about a different kind of leadership which has listening as part of leading.' He defended his decision to seek a chance to speak directly with US President Barack Obama last week - rejecting suggestions it had been an example of the sort of 'trivial' politics he criticised.","Labour leader says he wants weekly or fortnightly sessions in Westminster .

"A white man who shot dead a black 17-year-old during an argument over loud music at a gas station has been found guilty of first-degree murder. Michael Dunn showed no emotion as he was convicted of the November 2012 murder of Jordan Davis, whom he killed when he fired 10 times into an SUV carrying four teens, WJAX reported. After the verdict, Davis' parents Ron Davis and Lucia MacBath both let out a quiet gasp then hung their heads and cried, CNN reported. Dunn later turned and shook his head at his father. The 47-year-old software developer faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced. A tentative sentencing date was set for October 17 but it will be confirmed next week. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Michael Dunn looks back at his parents after he is convicted of first-degree murder  Wednesday . Convicted:  Dunn, pictured left ahead of the verdict on Wednesday, was found guilty of killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, pictured right, who was shot dead after an argument about loud music in November 2012 . He had already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February and faces at least 60 years in prison on those counts alone. But in February, the jury was deadlocked on the first-degree murder count, meaning it had to go to trial again this month. The jury reached its verdict in the retrial on Wednesday after more than five hours of deliberations. The shooting unfolded after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in a car at a gas station in November 2012. Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis, who was sitting in the passenger side of the car. Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away. Emotional: Lucia McBath, the mother of Jordan Davis, hugs Detective Mark Musser of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office after the verdict in Florida on Wednesday . Heartbroken: Davis' father, Ronald Davis, leaves the courtroom ahead of the deliberations on Wednesday . Attack: An evidence photograph presented during the retrial shows the bullet holes in the side of the car . Murder weapon: Evidence images show Dunn's 9mm gun - the one he used to kill the teenager in 2012 . One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' and intended to kill the boy. 'He wasn't shooting at the tires. He wasn't shooting at the windows. He was shooting to kill, aiming at Jordan Davis,' prosecutor Erin Wolfson said. The defense argued that Dunn had shot at the car repeatedly because he felt in imminent danger. The four teenagers were unarmed and no weapons were found inside their car. During testimony this week, Dunn's fiancee told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. Unaware: Earlier this week Dunn's fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. She only knew about his role the next day . Support: Dunn's parents Sandra and Phillip leave court as deliberations begin during his retrial Wednesday . Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel. The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon.","Michael Dunn, 47, fired his gun at a car carrying 17-year-old Jordan Davis after an argument about rap music at a gas station in Florida in 2012 .

Their crime was captured on CCTV cameras installed by owners . Their 'peculiar' behaviour was captured on CCTV installed by staff at the restaurant which was closed for two days following the incident. 'A lot of damage has been done, they went through a lot of our vegetables and some of what was sitting out. 'The fridges were open so all of the food in there was gone as well,' said Euan Bryson, a manager at the restaurant. 'The whole scenario is quite peculiar though, all they took out the building is £2.50 from a tip jar and a couple of these vegan sweets. 'The building has thousands of pounds worth of artwork by local artists and our coffee machine is really expensive too. The men stole a handful of vegan sweets and a meagre £2.50 but left behind thousands of pounds worth of artwork and expensive kitchen equipment . At around midnight the men make their exit, stumbling back onto the street through the front door. Police Scotland said enquiries were ongoing . The restaurant was closed for two days after the theft, but owners say they are glad nothing more valuable was stolen . 'One of the staff had left their drone camera which is worth about £1,000 as well but they didn't take any of it.' Two expensive kitchen knives which the thieves are seen brandishing in the footage were however stolen. 'There's quite a sinister element to it, at one point in the tape we saw one of them hiding behind the staircase clutching the knife as though he was ready to pounce. 'The knife he had is made in the same way as a Samurai knife, it's very sharp and a viable weapon. 'I hope they are found soon, the local police are very good.' Police Scotland confirmed inquiries into the incident were ongoing.","The thieves were filmed breaking into the Artisan Lounge in Ayrshire .

"Watching television for more than two hours a day increases the risk of raised blood pressure in children, warns a study. Those aged two to ten were 30 per cent more likely to have high blood pressure than youngsters who spent less time in front of a TV or computer screen. Lack of physical activity increased the risk even more – by 50 per cent – scientists found in the project covering 5,221 children in eight European countries. Telly addicts: Those aged two to ten who watched more than 2 hours of TV a day were 30 per cent more likely to have high blood pressure than youngsters who spent less time in front of a screen . Lead researcher Dr Augusto Cesar de Moraes, from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, said: 'The study shows the number of new high blood pressure cases and the connection between physical activity and different sedentary behaviours with the risk of high blood pressure.' He warned that the condition can cause cardiovascular problems later in life. 'For example, it increases the risk of ischemic heart disease,' he said. Over two years, a high incidence of elevated blood pressure was seen in the children – 110 cases per 1,000. Honest play: Lack of physical activity like playing outdoors increased the risk even more – by 50 per cent – scientists found in the project covering 5,221 children in eight European countries . In the International Journal of Cardiology, researchers concluded: 'The figures are worrying, given that sedentary behaviours are common in infancy and subsequently, later in life.' A child's blood pressure is not a specific measurement but is seen as high if it is above that of 95 per cent of those of the same age, height and gender.

"The Conservative Party was facing a furious backlash in Liverpool  yesterday, after secret papers revealed ministers had urged Margaret Thatcher to abandon the city in the wake of the Toxteth riots. Cabinet papers released under the 30-year rule show senior ministers in Mrs Thatcher's government urged her not to waste public money on the 'stony ground' of Merseyside, suggesting it would be like 'trying to make water flow uphill'. The sceptics were led by then Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe, who suggested ministers should  consider a policy of 'managed decline' for the city. Margaret Thatcher was secretly urged to abandon Liverpool to 'managed decline' in the wake of the Toxteth riots, secret files released today reveal . Margaret Thatcher's senior ministers told her not to waste public money on the 'stony ground' of Merseyside, suggesting it would be like 'trying to make water flow uphill' Mrs Thatcher was warned by Home Secretary William Whitelaw that 'emergency legislation could not be ruled out' The advice was rejected by Mrs Thatcher, . who famously dispatched environment secretary Michael Heseltine as . 'minister for Merseyside' to lead a programme of  urban regeneration. The outbreak of rioting in the rundown . Toxteth district in July 1981 came amid a wave of disturbances in . cities across England. Behind the scenes, ministers were divided on the . best way to respond. Lord Howe yesterday said he had no . recollection of arguing for Liverpool to be allowed to decline, and . suggested he may have been misquoted. He said it was a 'gross . misunderstanding' to suggest he wanted to abandon Liverpool, adding: 'I . don't recall how that argument got into the discussion at all. 'It certainly doesn't sound very . considerate. 'But certainly I think the Chancellor is so often arguing . against spending money as being the only answer. 'Michael Heseltine and I together . introduced enterprise zones in Merseyside as well as in many other . places which was a better way, if you like, of making help available as . quickly as possible. 'As a former Merseyside MP, I  am . surprised to find myself  ever having argued quite as I am  quoted to . have done on Liverpool.' But Labour politicians in the city seized on . the papers as fresh  evidence of a Conservative Party bias against the . city. Council leader Joe Anderson said the suggestion of managed decline was 'absolutely shocking'. Denial: Lord Howe, left, and Michael Heseltine, today said that abandoning Liverpool was ever really an option . Previously secret files reveal how Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government struggled to deal with the worst outbreak of civil disorder since Victorian times. Pictured, the 1981 Brixton riots . Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine  at a press conference in Liverpool where he unveiled his 13 point plan to start tackling the problems of riot torn Merseyside before returning to London after his two and a half week fact finding mission to the area in August 1981 . Riots: Two cars are turned over after a night of violent rioting in Liverpool in July 1981. Margaret Thatcher was secretly urged to abandon Liverpool to a fate of 'managed decline', it was revealed today . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Industry Secretary Sir Keith Joseph at a press conference after a meeting with a TUC delegation at No. 10 Downing Street . Just as with the London 2011 riots, the Cabinet of 1981 blamed the disorder on the rise of technology and the lack of decent parenting . As rioting erupted just weeks before the Royal Wedding, Margaret Thatcher agreed to give police all the equipment they needed to maintain order. Giving officers guns was better than having troops on British streets on the mainland for the first time. Minutes said: 'If necessary the police should be properly equipped, and even armed, before such a step was taken.' The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir David Nee was concerned about security arrangements for the Royal Wedding, he told the Prime Minister at the start of July. She went away with a list of equipment needed - from riot shields to protected vehicles, longer truncheons, ribber bullets, protective head gear and a water cannon. However, the trouble began to subside and calls for a new Riot Act were ignored. He said there were parallels with cuts . to council funding in the city by the present Government, adding: 'With . the funding allocation we have got now, it certainly strengthens the . argument that nothing has changed in 30 years. 'That is the reality of what people in Liverpool feel now.' Prominent former Labour MP Peter . Kilfoyle said: 'I frankly do not think they cared. 'They thought they . were electorally immune and did not anticipate what was to happen – a . complete rejection of Conservatism not only in Liverpool but in other . northern cities.' Mr Kilfoyle accused the current . Government of reviving an  alleged anti-northern bias, saying policies . were 'deliberately contrived to make sure that there is “stony ground on . the banks of the Mersey” again'. Lord Heseltine yesterday insisted the . idea of abandoning Liverpool never really became an option. He was sent . to the city to look at ways of improving the situation. He said: 'It never really got any . traction for the simplest reason that the Cabinet Minister responsible . for so much of the policy that affected the city was me. 'I simply wouldn't countenance that . you could say that one of England's great cities, a world city, was . going into managed decline here. 'That would simply be unthinkable to the approach that I believed to be necessary to a very important part of our history.'

"Poignant floral tributes including one with a note saying 'sorry we couldn't save you' have been left where a young woman was killed  when a giant window frame fell on top of her as she passed by. The tragic redhead, believed to be in her 20s, was fatally injured when a gust of wind dislodged the concrete frame and hit her as she ate a banana in front of shocked shoppers yesterday. It came from a multi-million-pound six-storey office block in Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London, and today flowers and messages have been placed metres from where the giant frame still lies. The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said this morning they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.' Tragedy: . A heavy four metre high window frame that had been propped up against a . wall fell on top of the woman as she passed by Hanover Square, just off . Oxford Street, in central London . Shock: . The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new . multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to . the scene and battle to save the woman but she was declared dead . A police spokeswoman said both the police and Health and Safety Executive would probe the incident and the young lady was unlikely to be named until this weekend at the earliest. She said a post mortem would be done tomorrow morning at Westminster's Coroners Court, and then her identity will be revealed. The spokeswoman added: 'It a joint investigation between the Metropolitan Police Service and the health and safety executive. 'The post mortem is scheduled for tomorrow morning at Westminster's Coroners Court. 'We believe we know the identification of the woman but no formal identification has been done at this stage. 'I believe her family has been informed. 'There have been no arrests.' Last night witnesses claimed the ‘very . heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, . and that  barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed. The accident happened at 11.30am in . Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive . offices. An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, . the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite. Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high . frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I . saw the frames delivered yesterday,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they . were lifted in by crane.’ Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane . Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive have launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds . A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off  the woman . Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby . Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn . left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana. ‘The next thing they saw was this . window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so . quickly.’ A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who . did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the . frame off  the woman. ‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground. I was hoping . it was a coat underneath – but then I saw an arm. ‘There was a woman who said she was a doctor who wanted to perform CPR, and somebody was giving her mouth-to-mouth. ‘Her eyes were open and I saw her hand . move and then I saw her last breath, and then the light went out – . she’d gone. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ Building site: Workmen were installing windows in a six-storey office block in Hanover Square in London when the incident happened . Beverley Hazel, from Kennington, South London, was on her way to work at 11.30am when she saw the woman lying in the road. She said: ‘She was very young and . slight. I’ve got two daughters, one younger and one older than this . woman. I was in bits. If it had been my daughter I would have wanted . someone with her.’ A spokesman for Westgreen Construction . Ltd, of Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, which is managing the building . project,  said: ‘We will do whatever is necessary. This is a terrible . accident.’ The woman’s body, which had been covered by a yellow police tent, was removed by a private ambulance at 6.45pm yesterday.

"Dutch Police arrested two men accused of selling ecstasy on Wednesday in the city of Zetten. The men were accused of selling the drug on the popular and controversial website Silk Road. The 24-year-old and 29-year-old were caught, 'red-handed during the manufacturing of ecstasy in a container behind their home in Zetten. The suspects were arrested with a thick layer of MDMA powder in their hair,' reports The Daily Dot. The men's Blackberry phones were wiretapped for about a month prior to their arrest. Dutch police seized thousands of dollars worth of powdered MDMA and of ecstasy similar to the ecstasy pictured here . Police found trays of MDMA powder, used stamps, cutting tools, and a tablet machine. When going to their homes in the city of Arnhem they found ecstasy and MDMA worth 26,000 euros in one's home, and drugs worth 80,000 euros in the other home. The vendors went by the name XTC Express and they were extremely popular among Silk Road users. The 300mg pills were very potent and got great reviews from customers. XTC Express shipped ectsacy pills with skulls on them from Germany for 158 bitcoins. A bitcoin is a form of peer to peer online payment system that avoids banks or central authority. Bitcoins make transactions almost impossible to track--almost. Illicit drug website Silk Road was seized, its founder arrested, and vendors from around the globe are being investigated and taken into custody . One Australian Silk Road user reached out to the forums to see if anyone knew what happened to an order he'd placed from vendor that was due to arrive in September. It is unknown as to whether the delivery was lost or intercepted by law enforcement officials. Silk Road's founder Ross William Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on Oct. 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a cooperating witness, according to authorities and court papers. The entrepreneur's charges go way beyond facilitating drug trafficking like the transactions commissioned from XTC Express. Silk Road founder Ross William Ulbricht (left) went by the alias 'Dread Pirate Roberts' based on the character from the film The Princess Bride (right) Ulbricht is charged in Baltimore federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who went under the name 'FriendlyChemist' who was arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the former worker would turn on him and blackmail him. Ulbricht using his screen name 'Dread Pirate Roberts' is said to have hired a hit man to kill the father of three from British Columbia for 500,000. An undercover agent posing as a drug dealer got Ulbricht to send him 27,000 worth of cocaine and after fabricating a story that one of his employees was arrested and needed to be 'silenced' he agreed to have the man killed for 80,000 and asked for a form of evidence like a photograph of the man's face. Ross William Ulbricht's face is now unmistakeable. The identity of the dutch ecstasy vendors is not yet disclosed.","The vendors had great reviews from Silk Road customers .

"From raunchy pop videos to violent film trailers, there are plenty of reasons why parents may not want to let their children browse YouTube alone. But a new child-friendly version of the video site is set to launch, which would mean safer browsing. The app is expected to collate a host of age-appropriate videos from the likes of DreamWorks, National Geographic and YouTubers as well as offering parental controls. A new child-friendly version of the video site is planned, which would mean safer browsing. The app is expected to collate a host of age-appropriate videos from the likes of DreamWorks and, National Geographic and YouTubers as well as offering parental controls . It will become available in the US from the Google Play store  on February 23 - for Android devices only - but a UK launch date has yet to be confirmed. Shimrit Ben-Yair, the project's group product manager, told USA Today that the site has seen a 50 per cent increase in viewing time year-on-year, but that the growth has been around 200 per cent for family entertainment channels. ‘Parents were constantly asking us, can you make YouTube a better place for our kids,’ she said. In answer, the company has come up with an app that is simple to use and eliminates features such as viewer comments from the design. The home screen comprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons (pictured): a TV set for popular TV shows such as Yo Gabba Gabba, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos . The home screencomprises eight tiles showing different videos as well as four icons: a TV set for popular TV shows such as Sesame Street, a light bulb for educational programmes, a radio for pop songs and a light bulb for popular videos. The categories are called: Shows, Music, Learning and Explore. ‘The images are big as are the tap targets for small fingers, and since most younger children can't type they can search with voice,’ Ms Ben-Yair said. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. A stock image of Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street is shown . If children try and search for a raunchy video, for example, the app simply blocks the request and a box that reads ‘Try something else’ pops up. They will be able to search for topics they are curious about though, such as spaceships and find how-to-make a volcano and maths tutorials, for example. Research show that children are just three clicks away from adult content on YouTube . The app will also give parents more power over their children’s viewing habits. It will give them features to control the time children spend on the app so that it shuts down after a number of minutes or hours. It can be re-started again once a password is entered. There will also be an option to mute videos - a feature tested by families and NGOs. MailOnline has learned the app will launch with content from Jim Henson TV, DreamWorks, National Geographic, and a handful of popular YouTubers and new series, such as Thomas the Tank Engine. 'The news that YouTube plans to launch a kid-friendly video app will be welcomed by security savvy parents,' said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab. 'Our research shows that children can be as little as three click away from inappropriate or adult content on the video platform. 'Examining YouTube’s ""suggested"" videos which sit visibly alongside clips or episodes of popular children’s television programmes such as Peppa Pig, Rastamouse and Dora the Explorer, our researchers have found that, on average, users are just three clicks away from content better suited to a more mature audience.' The child-focused app will in part compete with Netflix’s Kids service and Vine’s child-friendly app showing age-appropriate video clips. The move would appear to be part of Google's strategy to appeal to younger users. YouTube is owned by the search giant. Google recently acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic, and has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome and Search, as well as YouTube. Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to develop a new version of the View-Master, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’. To release the phone’s virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel’s app is needed. View-Master gets a make-over! Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google to the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery. An illustration of the new device is shown . The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive. Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’. By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,' the company says. The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10). Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year.","App will collate child-friendly videos, songs and educational resources .

Speaking about her beauty regime, the TV presenter said: 'My number one beauty secret would be anything that is quick, easy and fits into my life without me having to make too much effort. 'I've got a really amazing body wash at the moment, it's a Sanctuary Spa 2 day moisture shower oil and that's really good because when I get out of the shower I don't have to moisturise so that really works,' she said. As for her glowing skin, Holly swears by face and body exfoliators. She said: 'I love Liz Earle's Cleanse . & Polish, I love the smell of it in the morning when I wake up and . it's really good at taking off those lasting bits of make-up at the end . of the day. Budget beauty: She may be able to afford the most lavish products, but fans will be delighted to know that most of her beauty secrets are under £10 . 'I also love the Sanctuary Spa 4 Day . Moisture Oil Scrub, I use a lot of body scrubs just because I think it . keeps your skin more even-toned, especially in the summer.

As for her luscious lips she . explained that a good lip balm like a Sisley lip balm is very important . because she is constantly putting lipstick on and off and being under . the light whilst filming really dries her lips out.

I have had to practise for a really long time to put those on though.' She . added: 'It depends where I'm going but if I want to vamp it up and go . for a red lip then my favourite is MAC Red or Speed Dial, which is a . really nice pinky nude colour.' Holly was recently voted as having the . best celebrity smile, with dentists . even claiming that many patients actively request the pearly whites of . 32-year-old Miss Willoughby when having whitening treatments. But what's the secret behind her Hollywood smile? 'Being on telly and saying ""good morning"", the first thing people see is your smile and having a white, bright, shiny smile is really important to me and my job. 'So Oral-B 3D White Lux is a brilliant toothpaste because it keeps the dentist happy by beating tartar and the important things but it makes me happy because it keeps my teeth white, which is just what I need and how I like them,' she revealed. While she is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful people in the public eye, Holly admires the looks of two very different looking women.

Get her look: Holly swears by Oral-B 3D White Lux toothpaste and Lancome's Liner Plume High Definition Eyeliner, £22 . She said: 'There are so many gorgeous beautiful women out there but different women for different things. 'I look at Dita Von Teese and think she is a really mysterious dark sex goddess and a beautiful woman who is committed to her look, and she looks so feminine and striking so I really admire her for that. 'But then on the flip-side, I love the look of someone like Heidi Klum who probably looks the exact same when she gets out of bed in the morning. 'She probably doesn't have to put any make-up on and she has this really fresh, beautiful face and she is just effortlessly natural.' Idols: Holly loves Dita Von Teese's 'sex goddess' look and Heidi Klum's natural looks . Holly is currently busy as a presenter on This Morning, has just released a children's book with her sister and is working with Very on her clothing range, but she still has big plans for the future. Asked if she would ever consider unveiling her own beauty range, the starlet said: 'I get asked quite a lot if I would ever bring out my own range of beauty products. 'Maybe, I do have an interest in it. I really love that side of things. I love getting a new product and thinking: ""ooh how does this one work?"" 'But I do have my favourite things that I use over and over again. I'm not really very experimental with changing things up so would I? 'I think it's more down to a time issue with me. I have enough on my plate as it is and I want to do the things I'm committed to as well as I possibly can so maybe in the future but not right now.' The future's bright: Asked if she would ever consider unveiling her own beauty range, the starlet said she has thought about it but wants to focus on her current projects at the moment .

"These incredibly detailed images are so complex, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were close-up photographs of living cells or images created using algorithms on a computer. But, instead they’re meticulously handcrafted sculptures built using just strips of paper and a scalpel. The artwork, called Outbreak, was designed to show some of the smallest structures found inside the human body, including cells, microbes, pathogens and neurons. London-based paper artist used images and diagrams of microbes, bacteria and cells to create an exhibition called Outbreak. Each petri dish (pictured) contains a loose representation of bacteria. This bacteria is seen spreading across the petri dishes to represent how it 'metaphorically threatens' the development of healthcare . The installation was created by London graduate Rogan Brown. Although each of the images are based on the human biome, which includes microorganisms that live on humans, they are not designed to be scientifically accurate. The human microbiome, or microbiota, . is the collection of microorganisms that live on human skin, in the . saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the . gastrointestinal tract. It includes bacteria, archaea, fungi and single-celled eukaryotes, which are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. The human body has about 100 trillion cells, and carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines alone. Some of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are, instead, a combination of structures and images within these cells, across parts of the body. Outbreak was inspired by Brown’s participation in a seminar held at the Eden Project in Cornwall. ‘The Eden Project recently won a Wellcome Trust grant to create an exhibition space based on the Human Biome - the bacteria that scientists are only now beginning to understand,’ Brown told MailOnline. ‘The seminar was attended by a number of eminent bacteriologists and a handful of artists. ‘My contribution was really to create a stylised visual representation of this largely invisible microbiological world: I wanted to make something based on electronmicroscope photos of microbes, which gives people a glimpse of this strange, exotic world and that encourages them to see the beauty in it. The artwork (pictured) was designed to show some of the smallest structures found inside the human body, including cells, microbes, pathogens and neurons. Although each of the images are based on the human biome, which includes microorganisms that live on humans, they are not designed to be scientifically accurate . The left-hand image is a representation of a spore, found in bacteria, that is a resistant structure used to help the bacteria survive. The right-hand image is called Bacteria Deleria. It is designed to represent the bacteria that can lead to delirium and confusion, such as those found in brain infections . This sculpture, called Clone, is designed to represent a group of identical cells that share a 'common ancestry.' All the granulosa cells in a Graafian follicle, in the ovaries for example, are clones . ‘This is part of an attempt to change perceptions about microbes from negative to positive as the vast majority of the bacteria in our bodies play a very positive and important role in helping us to break down food, extract vitamins as well as fighting illness and so.’ Brown’s latest project work took four months to complete, and many of the pieces were limited. This is because visual representations of bacteria are often decontextualised electronmicroscope photos, or simplified diagrammatic representations. ‘The lack of visual material is in part due to the infinitesimally small size of bacteria and also to the fact that scientists have little interest in visual representations. 'They ""see"" microbes through complex experiments using very complex laboratory equipment; aesthetics don't really interest them. Other art in Brown's collection show cross sections of fruit kernels. Kernels are typically the softer, usually edible part, contained in the shell of a nut or the stone of a fruit. This paper sculpture reveals the complex structure inside a kernel, such as those found in cherries . The left-hand image shows the cross-section of a pod, similar to a cocoa pod. The seeds of the pod are shown around the centre, protected by the outer shell. Meanwhile, the right-hand image shows the cross section of the seed, that sits inside the pod . ‘So the images you see in Outbreak are imagined representations based on looking through thousands of pictures and diagrams of microbes at different scales and in different states.’ Brown continued that it is the repeated patterns and motifs and fractals of the structures that inspired him. ‘Science is at a very early stage in its understanding of bacteria in the human body; for the moment the scientists are merely identifying the varieties of microbes that inhabit us; the scale of the biome is so vast that it will take many years to do just this, to label and name the different types of microbe. This image represents the growth of bacteria. Brown told MailOnline that it is the repeated patterns and motifs and fractals of the structures that inspired him. He said: 'The aim is to convey the limitations of science when confronted by the immense power, complexity and, above all, scale of nature' Brown's work, including this image of small kernel, is inspired in part by the tradition of scientific drawing and model making, and particularly the work of artist-scientists such as Ernst Haeckel . ‘I make reference to this in the installation by the use of the Petri dish-style domes each containing a different microbial form, but the process is overrun by the sheer excess of bacteria that metaphorically threatens the whole project. ‘The aim is to convey the limitations of science when confronted by the immense power, complexity and, above all, scale of nature.' Other artwork in Brown’s portfolio shows the cross section of fruit kernels and cocoa pods. They are designed to show the complex nature of these organisms and, again, are visual representations rather than scientifically accurate portrayal. ‘I am inspired in part by the tradition of scientific drawing and model making, and particularly the work of artist-scientists such as Ernst Haeckel,’ continued Brown. ‘But although my approach involves careful observation and detailed ‘scientific’ preparatory drawings these are always superseded by the work of the imagination; everything has to be refracted through the prism of the imagination, estranged and in some way transformed.’","Outbreak was inspired by a seminar held at the Eden Project in Cornwall .

"When you can't force your own employees to get on board with a product, what hope does a company have convincing the rest of us? Such is the case this week at internet giant Yahoo, who have been left red-faced after an staff memo found its way out of the Silicon Valley headquarters, according to All Things D. The note - from Yahoo senior vice president of communications products, Jeff Bonforte, and CIO, Randy Roumillat - details how only 25 per cent of employees use the company's email offering. Struggling: Following thousands of complains from furious users following a redesign in October, it has now been revealed that Yahoo mail is not even resonating among company employees, with only 25 per cent using it as their email destination, according to a leaked memo . Home: The leaked memo, from Yahoo senior vice president of communications products, Jeff Bonforte, and CIO Randy Roumillat, came from inside Yahoo's Silicon Valley headquarters . To add insult to embarrassment, that is after executives exhorted everyone to make the switch from Microsoft's outlook. Taking a swipe at their competitor, the title of the Yahoo email memo was: 'Windows 95 called and they want their mail app back.' Another part of the quirky note to staff says that '(Outlook is) an anachronism of the now defunct 90s PC era'. Some tech insiders have suggested the memo was written with the expectation it could leak to the media. Memo writer: Yahoo senior vide president of communications products, Jeff Bonforte (pictured) wrote the quirky email with CIO Randy Roumillat . 'Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl,' the pair wrote, according to All Things D. 'We have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to Yahoo Mail. 'It doesn’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana. 'At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed.' No comment: Yahoo president, Melissa Mayer, is yet to comment on the staff memo being made public . Yahoo Mail has come under fire in recent weeks following an expansive re-design in October. Many of the 300 million users have complained . As part of the changes, Yahoo removed the ability to see multiple emails at once. There was such outrage over the new Yahoo Mail that a Change.org petition called 'Yahoo: Bring back the old version of Yahoo Mail!'', which has garnered almost 39,000 signatures. Yahoo has said that it's 'listening to all of the community feedback' regarding the changes. Hello Yahoos,Earlier this year we asked you to move to Yahoo Mail for your corporate email account. 25% of you made the switch (thank you). But even if we used the most generous of grading curves (say, the one from organic chemistry), we have clearly failed in our goal to move our co-workers to Yahoo Mail.It’s time for the remaining 75% to make the switch. Beyond the practical benefits of giving feedback to your colleagues on the Mail team, as a company it’s a matter of principle to use the products we make. (BTW, same for Search.)For some reading this email, you are saying, “Jeff, shut up, you had me at hello.” *hug* Jump over to yo/dogfood, click “Corp Mail/Cal/ Messenger” and you are ready to join our brave new world at yo/corpmail or https://mail.yahoo-inc.com.For others, you might now be running in your head to a well worn path of justified resistance, phoning up the ol’ gang, circling the hippocampian wagons of amygdalian resistance. Hold on a sec, pilgrim.First, it doesn’t feel like we are asking you to abandon some glorious place of communications nirvana. At this point in your life, Outlook may be familiar, which we can often confuse with productive or well designed. Certainly, we can admire the application for its survival, an anachronism of the now defunct 90s PC era, a pre-web program written at a time when NT Server terrorized the data center landscape with the confidence of a T-Rex born to yuppie dinosaur parents who fully bought into the illusion of their son’s utter uniqueness because the big-mouthed, tiny-armed monster infant could mimic the gestures of The Itsy-Bitsy Pterodactyl. There was a similar outcry when we moved away from Outlook’s suite-mates in the Microsoft Office dreadnaught. But whether it’s familiarity, laziness or simple stubbornness dressed in a cloak of Ayn Randian Objectivism, the time has come to move on, commrade [sic...go deep in this pun, it is layered].Using corp mail from the Y Mail web interface is remarkably feature rich. It supports booking conference rooms, folders, calendar, filters and global address book. Plus, you get built-in Messenger, smart conversation threading, powerful keyboard shortcuts, the new quick actions, attachment preview and our beautiful new rich themes. In the rare case you do need Outlook, like adding a delegate for your calendar, you can still fire up Outlook for 30 seconds.But wait there’s more. By using corporate Mail, you’ll automatically get to dogfood our new features first. I’m especially excited about a new feature premiering in just a few more days: smart auto-suggest, powered by a platform from the still-have-that-new-acquisition-smell Xobni team. We have been testing this feature with select users in and out of the company and the response has been fantastic: “Whoa!”, “Amazing”, “Already in love with it. Woot!” and, my favorite, “So nicely integrated that it appears as if it’s always been there. I already can’t imagine it not being there again.” Feeling that little tingle? Take a deep breath, you can do this. We want you on board, sailor!Please note, on the mobile side, corp mail is not yet supported in our Mail app for Android or iOS, but that will change (PB&J!). And, like all dogfood offerings, there is a feedback link in the product. Use it generously so we can make the improvements to make Yahoo Mail the unquestioned inbox champion of the world.

"A scientist has suggested the search for MH370 should be extended thousands of miles north to a Kyrgyzstan valley where a cloud of smoke was seen at about the time the plane could have crashed. Space scientist and physicist Duncan Steel, who is based in Wellington, New Zealand, admitted that the search for the missing plane in the Indian Ocean appeared to be in the wrong place. Suggesting that the Boeing 777 jet with 239 passengers and crew on board most likely ended up much further south, he also turned his attention to a valley in the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan. Scroll down for video . A New Zealand scientist has suggested the search for missing MH370 should be extended to Besh-Tash Valley in Kyrgyzstan (pictured) In an interview with the South East Asian news agency Bernama today, Mr Steel, who works with Nasa, suggested that some consideration should be given to the 'northern corridor' of the plane's possible flight path until the possibilities could be ruled out. 'For example, someone should go and take a look at the suggested crash site in the Besh-Tash Valley (Kyrgyzstan) which was indicated by a smoke plume just when the aircraft would have been expected to have crashed,' he said. 'In reality, that might be only a one-in-1,000 possibility, but why not go and take a look so as to exclude it?' British-Australian Mr Steel, who is a visiting Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Buckingham, said his own conclusions matched what has now been established by the authorities - that the sonic pings in the Indian Ocean were not from the MH370 emergency locator beacon. Based on . available information from the released raw data, he said, it was most . likely that the aircraft headed south at near 500 knots and ended up . much further south than the current search area. He . praised British satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat for doing . a good job of pulling out the data and analysing it, noting that the . company's analysis of its satellite data was good. 'However, . that does not mean I am sure they are correct because we have not been . given vital information about the composition of the BFOs (Burst . Frequency Offsets) and the modelling that Inmarsat performed. 'If we had that information, we could check on what was done to verify it or possibly find errors,' he said. Mr . Steel told MailOnline: ‘I have great misgivings about the present and . recent search regions in the Indian Ocean. Whilst it seems very likely . that the aircraft did go south into the Indian Ocean, as in all . scientific analyses various assumptions need to be made. ‘It may well be that the Inmarsat engineers were correct in their deduction that it went south. But true scientists are always sceptical, and so we keep beavering away until such time as we convince ourselves that what has been stated is true.’ He told MailOnline that Chinese professor Dr Yaoqiu Kuang had looked at the last definite arc of possible locations of the aircraft, and considered possible crash locations in remote places. The expert then found satellite imagery which showed an apparent smoke plume in the Besh-Tash Valley near Talas in Kyrgyzstan, a remote location at a relatively high, snow-covered altitude. Dr Kuang then discovered other satellite imagery obtained just a few hours later showed no smoke plume, which would appear to be consistent with a possible aircraft crash. Meanwhile . former Malaysian Airlines chief pilot Captain Nik Ahmad Huzlan Nik . Hussain said he had no reason to disbelief the analysis and calculations . by Inmarsat and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. Space scientist Duncan Steel said the search for MH370 appeared to be in the wrong place. Pictured are Malaysia Airline passenger jets are shown parked on the tarmac at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in March 2014 . The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area in the Indian Ocean on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic 'pings' whose data the search was based off were unlikely to have been coming from the plane's black-box. The new search for the aircraft is anticipated to begin in August and take up to one year . A Chinese survey ship has already begun mapping of the new ocean floor, expected to continue for the next three months . He said the calculations had been verified by experts familiar with the fields of satellite communications from a technical angle. However, . he added that there are margins of error caused by utilisation of assumptions, which . may result in the widening of the search area. In Doha, . Qatar, the president of the Emirates airline, Tim Clark, told the annual . meeting of the International Air Transport Association that more . analysis was needed to find the missing jet. 'We . need to know more about what actually happened to this aeroplane and do . a forensic analysis of it. I think we will find it and get to the . bottom of it.'","NZ-based scientist Duncan Steel: Search should include Besh-Tash Valley .

"The Liberal Democrats sparked fury last night after saying they would not suspend an MP who had said he would be ready to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel. David Ward, Lib Dem MP for Bradford East, initially apologised after he was accused of inciting violence following a post on Twitter last month in which he said: 'The big question is - if I lived in Gaza would I fire a rocket? - probably yes.' Last night, after an investigation lasting three weeks, the Lib Dem chief whip Don Foster said he did not believe Mr Ward's comments were 'in any way anti-Semitic' or motivated by anti-Semitic intentions. And he said he did not believe the tweet brought the party into disrepute. David Ward, Lib Dem MP for Bradford East, said on Twitter: 'The big question is - if I lived in Gaza would I fire a rocket? - probably yes' Mr Foster said that Mr Ward had accepted his tweet offended some people and has insisted he would make sure his comments in the future are 'difficult to misinterpret' while also condemning violence from both Israelis and Palestinians. The chief whip said he took into account Mr Ward's comments condemning violence on both sides before the tweet, his calls for a ceasefire, criticism of Hamas, explanation that the tweet sought to envisage how a Palestinian may feel and his apology. Labour MP Ian Austin said: 'Most people will think David Ward said he thought terrorism was acceptable when he said he'd probably fire a rocket at Israel. 'If that doesn't bring the Lib Dems into disrepute you have to ask what would.' Mr Foster recognised his decision 'will not satisfy some people'. In a statement, Mr Foster said: 'David has subsequently repeated his apology and placed it and his explanation on his website. 'In light of that apology, the assurance by David Ward that he would do all he could to ensure comments he made would be in a form that would be difficult to misinterpret, and that he will continue - in relation to the Israeli/Palestinian situation - to condemn violence on both sides and support moves for a cease fire, I do not intend to take further action in relation to the tweet. Light streaks and trails are seen as rockets are launched from Gaza towards Israel before a 72-hour cease fire was due to expire . 'I am conscious that this decision will not satisfy some people. To them I would say, at a time of considerable international unease in the Middle East, comments have been made by politicians from all parties that have been unwelcome by some or other section of society. 'The question I have had to answer is not, did the comments by David Ward cause offence to some people (within the party or outside), but did they bring the party into disrepute? 'David accepts that his tweet did cause offence to some people. He recognises that the use of Twitter as a form of communication can lead to misinterpretation and accepts the need for greater care in the future. 'However, I do not believe it was in any way anti-Semitic or motivated by anti-Semitic intentions and I do not believe his tweet brought the party into disrepute. I believe that his statement including an apology on July 23 should draw a line under this matter.' Following last month's tweet, the Board of Deputies of British Jews called on Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg to withdraw the party whip from Mr Ward. The MP subsequently said his comments were not intended to support Hamas rocket attacks, adding: 'If they gave the opposite impression, I apologise.' Mr Ward's membership of the party has previously been suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about Israel and the Jews. Palestinian negotiators were last night considering a proposal to end the month-long Israel-Hamas war as the latest 72-hour cease-fire in the Gaza Strip was due to expire. Since the truce went into effect Sunday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets. The ceasefire gave both sides time to negotiate a more sustainable truce and a roadmap for the coastal territory. A member of the Palestinian delegation to talks in Cairo said his team was considering an Egyptian proposal for easing parts of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, bringing some relief to the territory. But other key areas were still left unresolved, including Hamas' demand for a full lifting of the blockade and Israeli calls for Hamas to disarm. These would have to be left to later talks. Yesterday Ismail Haniyeh, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, said that 'achieving a permanent truce can come only through lifting the blockade on Gaza.' Amid the cease-fire, an Associated Press video journalist and a freelance Palestinian translator working with him were killed when ordnance left over from the war exploded as they covered a story about the conflict's aftermath. Italian national Simone Camilli, 35, and Ali Shehda Abu Afash, 36, died when an unexploded missile believed to have been dropped in an Israeli airstrike blew up as Gazan police engineers worked to neutralise it in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya.","David Ward, Lib Dem MP for Bradford East, initially apologised .

"Judging by the overwhelming response to this Kickstarter campaign, it is the invention that travellers everywhere have been waiting for. A couple from New York have invented state-of-the-art, zipperless luggage that features a sliding door, a phone charger, a digital scale and GPS tracker. Just three days into their 59-day funding period, the Trunkster team have already raised more than $137,000 (£85,000) - far surpassing their $50,000 (£32,000) goal. 'Game-changer': A New York duo have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund their new suitcase design . State of the art: The 'Trunkster' features a sleek zipperless sliding door that opens at the touch of a button . Gaston Blanchet and Jesse Potash, from New York, are keen travellers who set about creating their ultimate suitcase after tiring of 'brittle zippers, cumbersome flaps, flimsy handles, and unreliable wheels' on traditional luggage. They came up with the 'game-changing' design for the sliding door on the luggage  which opens at the touch of a button. 'We're all too familiar with that frustrating moment when you realise you quickly need something out of your bag,' The Trunkster team writes on their Kickstarter page. Charge on the go: There are a host of smart features including a removable battery pack to charge devices . 'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag and flap it open. The rolltop door lets you instantly access your belongings in one swift motion.' The suitcase, which comes in both checked ($600) and carry-on ($500) sizes, is made from brushed airplane grade aluminum and 100 per cent virgin polycarbonate that is durable, lightweight, and scratch resistant. As well as the nifty sliding door, there are also a whole host of features that make this suitcase truly smart. No more overweight fees: The handle has a built-in digital scale to weigh luggage . Dude, where's my bag? As an optional extra, the suitcase can come with GPS tracking . There is a removable battery pack that can charge a device up to nine times, and can even be separated to be used independently of the luggage. As an upgrade, the suitcase can also have a built-in GPS tracking system that uses the same technology as Apple's 'Find my iPhone'. If your luggage goes missing, it can be tracked by any connected device. This optional extra costs $40. Popular: Three days into the campaign, backers have pledged $137,409 - far surpassing the $50,000 goal . Big and small: The design will come in both checked ($600) and carry-on ($500) sizes . Zipperless entry - a rolltop sliding door . Removable battery and USB charger . Built-in digital scale . Complete control handle . GPS enabled as an upgrade . Five-year warranty . A side-to-side handle is designed to not infringe on the space inside the suitcase as with traditional cases. The built-in digital scale in the handle will make balancing the suitcase on the bathroom scales - and worse yet, being told in front of a long queue of passengers that you luggage is overweight - a thing of the past. The scale also converts pounds to kilograms. Sponsors of the Kickstarter campaign will also benefit from a 'no questions asked' five-year warranty. The estimated retail price will be $500 for the carry-on and $600 for the checked. They will be shipped worldwide. Concept: 'With Trunkster’s revolutionary sliding door, you no longer have to unzip your entire bag' Trunkster's Kickstarter campaign was launched on November 18, and in those three days more than 350 backers have made pledges totalling $137,409 (£87,791). Some 125 backers have made a pledge of $205, which gets them a carry-on Trunkster in return, while 94 backers have pledged $245 to receive a checked one. 41 backers have donated $450 to get both. The fundraising period of their projected timeline still has 56 days left, with production to start in January, and delivery expected by August.","Trunkster's Kickstarter campaign received $137,000 funding in three days .

"A major component of blood has been grown in the laboratory by scientists, bringing man-made blood transfusions a step closer. Biomedical engineers have for the first time produced functional blood platelets - the cells that cause clots to form - from human bone marrow grown in the laboratory. The achievement raises hopes that it will soon be possible to produce fully functional blood in a similar way. Scientists have managed to grow fully functioning platelets like the one above surrounded by red blood cells . This would allow doctors to create tailor made blood transfusions for patients during surgery - helping to overcome blood donor shortages. Artificial blood that could one day be used in humans without side-effects was created by scientists in Romania towards the end of last year. The blood contained water and salts along with a protein known as hemerythrin that is extracted from sea worms. Researchers from Babeş-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, hope it could help end blood supply shortages and prevent infections through donations. Dr Radu Silaghi-Dumitrescu added that it may even lead to the creation of ‘instant blood’ that can be transported and turns into artificial blood when water is added. So far the artificial blood has been tested on laboratory mice who didn't experience any adverse side effects. Donated blood also carries risks as unless it matches the bloody type of the recipient it can be rejected, while it can also carry diseases like hepatitis and HIV, making it unusable. Scientists hope that by using a patient's stem cells, it should be possible to grow blood that is a perfect match. The new research demonstrates that it is possible to use human stem cells to grow bone marrow on a matrix of porous silk, which then create blood cells. The scientists from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and the University of Pavia in Italy were able to produce millions of human platelets. They believe these could be used to help treat emergency room patients with serious injuries by helping blood clots to form. They could also be used to help soldiers who are injured on the battlefield. Dr David Kaplan, chair of biomedical engineering at Tufts University who was a co-author of the study, said: 'The need for platelet production systems to treat patients with related diseases is significant. 'The platelets can be generated on demand, avoiding the complications of storage problems, and in greater quantities and with better quality and control in terms of morphology and function.' Platelet-producing bone marrow cells (shown in blue) released filament-like 'proplatelets' (green) in the study . The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Blood, used silk portien to build a bioreactor in which to generate the platelets. they used microtubes of spun silk, collagen and fibronectin that were surrounded by a silk sponge. The researchers then took bone marrow stem cells and embedded them on the silk along with cells that form the lining of blood vessels. Dr Kaplan said: 'Silk protein possesses a unique molecular structure that enables it to be modeled in a wide variety of forms, stiffnesses and characteristics that have been shown to affect platelet formation and release.' They then tested the resulting platelets that were formed from the bone marrow and found they were capable of aggregating and clotting just as they do in the human body. The scientists say that the platelets could be used to help study diseases that are caused by problems with platelets but they could also be used a way of helping heal wounds, ulcers and burns. Blood transfusions save thousands of lives a year by replacing blood loss during surgery or during accidents . Dr Alessandra Balduini, a biomedical engineer at Tufts University and the University of Paiva who led the work, said: 'There are many diseases where platelet production or function is impaired. 'New insight into the formation of platelets would have a major impact on patients and healthcare. 'In this tissue system, we can culture patient-derived megakaryocytes - the bone marrow cells that make platelets - and also endothelial cells, which are found in bone marrow and promote platelet production, to design patient-specific drug administration regimes.' He added that the work could one day lead to replacement blood being grown in the laboratory. He sadi: 'I believe that the first step in order to be able to grow blood for patients is to have a model that closely represents the main features of the physiological organ. 'The use of silk as biomaterial has incredible potential to accelerate this process.' Several research groups around the world have been able to grow red blood cells - the cells that carry oxygen around the body - from stem cells found in the umbilical cord. In 2010 pluripotent stem cells were used to generate red blood cells, also raising hopes that blood could be generated using DNA taken from adult skin cells. However, many researchers believe it could be another 10 to 15 years before it is possible to produce blood products from stem cells that can be used clinically. Writing in the Yonsei Medical Journal last year, Dr Hyun Ok Kim from the Yonsei University College of Medicine, said: 'Despite many advances in stem cell-derived hematopoiesis research, we are still in the beginning stages of making RBCs available, in both quantity and quality, for clinical use. 'Bone marrow-derived stem cell differentiation of RBCs seems to be a physiologic and natural way of RBC procurement and would be an attractive option if functionality and production quantity can be optimized.'","Scientists at Tuft University in Massachusetts grew bone marrow on silk .

"It could be the mightiest wind ever seen - strong enouigh to stop a galaxy from producing stars. Nasa's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and ESA's (European Space Agency) XMM-Newton telescope have spotted  fierce winds from a supermassive black hole blow outward in all directions. The  phenomenon had been suspected, but now researchers have proved the winds are powerful enough to inhibit the host galaxy's ability to make new stars. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of active galaxy NGC 3783. Observations have revealed cosmic winds emerging from near the black hole at the center of NGC 3783 and galaxies like it. Supermassive black holes blast matter into their host galaxies, with X-ray-emitting winds traveling at up to one-third the speed of light. In the new study, astronomers determined PDS 456, an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light-years away, sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns. 'We know black holes in the centers of galaxies can feed on matter, and this process can produce winds. This is thought to regulate the growth of the galaxies,' said Fiona Harrison of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, the led the study. Harrison is the principal investigator of NuSTAR and a co-author on a new paper about these results appearing in the journal Science. 'Knowing the speed, shape and size of the winds, we can now figure out how powerful they are.' Supermassive black holes blast matter into their host galaxies, with X-ray-emitting winds traveling at up to one-third the speed of light. In the new study, astronomers determined PDS 456, an extremely bright black hole known as a quasar more than 2 billion light-years away, sustains winds that carry more energy every second than is emitted by more than a trillion suns. 'Now we know quasar winds significantly contribute to mass loss in a galaxy, driving out its supply of gas, which is fuel for star formation,' said the study's lead author Emanuele Nardini of Keele University in England. NuSTAR and XMM-Newton simultaneously observed PDS 456 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014. The space telescopes complement each other by observing different parts of the X-ray light spectrum: XMM-Newton views low-energy and NuSTAR views high-energy. Previous XMM-Newton observations had identified black hole winds blowing toward us, but could not determine whether the winds also blew in all directions. XMM-Newton had detected iron atoms, which are carried by the winds along with other matter, only directly in front of the black hole, where they block X-rays. Combining higher-energy X-ray data from NuSTAR with observations from XMM-Newton, scientists were able to find signatures of iron scattered from the sides, proving the winds emanate from the black hole not in a beam, but in a nearly spherical fashion. Supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies blast out radiation and ultra-fast winds, as illustrated in this artist's conception. NASA's NuSTAR and ESA's XMM-Newton telescopes show that these winds, containing highly ionized atoms, blow in a nearly spherical fashion. 'This is a great example of the synergy between XMM-Newton and NuSTAR,' said Norbert Schartel, XMM-Newton project scientist at ESA. 'The complementarity of these two X-ray observatories is enabling us to unveil previously hidden details about the powerful side of the universe.' With the shape and extent of the winds known, the researchers could then determine the strength of the winds and the degree to which they can inhibit the formation of new stars. Astronomers think supermassive black holes and their home galaxies evolve together and regulate each other's growth. Evidence for this comes in part from observations of the central bulges of galaxies -- the more massive the central bulge, the larger the supermassive black hole. NuSTAR (left) and XMM-Newton (right) simultaneously observed PDS 456 on five separate occasions in 2013 and 2014. This latest report demonstrates a supermassive black hole and its high-speed winds greatly affect the host galaxy. As the black hole bulks up in size, its winds push vast amounts of matter outward through the galaxy, which ultimately stops new stars from forming. Because PDS 456 is relatively close, by cosmic standards, it is bright and can be studied in detail. This black hole gives astronomers a unique look into a distant era of our universe, around 10 billion years ago, when supermassive black holes and their raging winds were more common and possibly shaped galaxies as we see them today. 'For an astronomer, studying PDS 456 is like a paleontologist being given a living dinosaur to study,' said study co-author Daniel Stern of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena. 'We are able to investigate the physics of these important systems with a level of detail not possible for those found at more typical distances, during the 'Age of Quasars.''","PDS 456, an extremely bright black hole 2 billion light-years away studied .

"The grieving family of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have criticised the timing of a new book that claims the plane may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up. The family of missing Brisbane man Rod Burrows say they are at pains to understand how still, after 71 days of ongoing global search efforts, no one knows what happened to the missing plane which vanished on March 8 and how a book could be released so soon after. Flight MH370: The Mystery makes the incredible claim that the airline was shot down by US-Thai joint strike fighters accidentally as part of a training drill gone horribly wrong. The book goes on to claim the search party was purposely  sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. Scroll down for video . Flight MH370 has been missing since March 8 - but could have transmitted a GPS fix on its location if its tracking software had received a £6 upgrade, it's been claimed . Huge task: The search for MH370 is the most expensive and extensive ever undertaken . Investigation: The book weighs all the theories about what happened to MH370 . Irene Burrows, Rod's mother, told the Sun Herald that the book had been released too soon, and that despite the speculation, it offers no concrete answers. 'There's absolutely no answers,' she said. 'It's devastating for the families, it's been 10 weeks tomorrow and there's nothing.' She said both her and husband George are still trying to comprehend what happened, and that a book full of conspiracies released just 71 days after its disappearance, does nothing to alleviate the pain of losing their son. But according to the book's author, Nigel Cawthorne, there may never be a clear answer. He writes in the book how the Burrows, and hundreds more in their situation, will 'almost certainly' never know the real story behind how the ill-fated plane vanished on March 8. He writes: 'Did they die painlessly, unaware of their fate? Or did they die in terror in a flaming wreck, crashing from the sky in the hands of a madman?' It is then that Cawthorne makes the incredible assertion that the plane was shot down accidentally over the South China Sea by a joint US-Thai joint strike fighter team, and the searchers sent in the wrong direction as part of a cover up. He describes how a man, while working on an oil rig in the ocean at about the same time the plane's transponder went off, saw a burning plane and how this was right near the military exercise being conducted with personel from various other countries. He claims that these countries may have then sent searchers in the wrong direction in order to cover their tracks. 'After all, no wreckage has been found in the South Indian Ocean, which in itself is suspicious.' He said with the amount of disinformation regarding MH370, it is best to be skeptical. Cawthorne also raises more doubt into toe plane's disappearance, claiming it could have been located if its tracking software had been upgraded - something that costs just £6 ($10) per flight. According to Cawthorne the Boeing 777-200ER had a ‘data package’ that only transmitted the most basic flight information, so authorities weren’t able to get a GPS fix on it. For just $10, however, this package could have been improved, the book says, resulting in far more detailed information about the 777's movements being pinged. ‘For US$10, you could have told within half an hour’s flying time where the plane would have gone,’ a source told the paper. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, has called for real-time tracking of planes and improvements to their communication systems to prevent a repeat of the 370 tragedy. In an opinion piece published on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Najib called for changes that would ‘make it harder for an aircraft to simply disappear, and easier to find any aircraft that did.’ ‘One of the most astonishing things about this tragedy is the revelation that an airliner the size of a Boeing 777 can vanish, almost without a trace. In an age of smartphones and mobile Internet, real-time tracking of commercial airplanes is long overdue,’ he said. Inmarsat Plc, a British provider of global mobile satellite communications services, said Monday it will offer free basic tracking services for planes flying over oceans. The service will be available to most of the world's long-haul commercial fleet. The Malaysian plane sent a signal to an Inmarsat satellite, but not location data. Engineers conducted a novel analysis of those signals to determine the plane's flight path, but the effort took time. Australia's Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor for MH370's black box . Najib also urged the aviation industry to consider changing planes' communications systems so that they can't be disabled midair. The government has said someone severed the plane's communication systems with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370. He said the capacity of the cockpit data recorder, one of a plane's two black boxes, should be extended from two hours currently to recording the entire flight, while its location beacons should be made to last at least 90 days, instead of 30 days now. ‘The global aviation industry must not only learn the lessons of MH370 but implement them,’ he added. Najib reiterated that Flight 370 was one of world's greatest aviation mysteries. ‘Nobody saw this coming, nobody knows why it happened, and nobody knows precisely where it is,’ he said. He said the government has done its best but admitted there were mistakes in the early days of the crisis, with a disorderly public communication and a slow start to search efforts. He said an independent investigation is ongoing so the government can learn from mistakes. A Malaysia Airlines employee writes a message expressing prayers and well-wishes for passengers of MH370 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport mosque . Najib assured families of passengers that Malaysia will ‘keep searching for the plane for as long as it takes.’ Australia is leading the search, which is moving into a second phase in which commercial underwater operators will be contracted to scour a vast expanse of seabed with sonar equipment looking for wreckage for the next one year. An Australian ship on Tuesday returned to the area where underwater sounds consistent with black boxes were heard in April, the search coordination center said. The ship had returned to port briefly to be resupplied. The Ocean Shield is carrying a robot submarine, the Bluefin 21, to survey the ocean floor. A spokeswoman for John Blake, the publishers of the book, said: . “The tragic disappearance of Flight MH370 is an extraordinary and terrible . mystery. Inevitably hundreds of wild theories are circulating about what has . really happened. 'Nigel Cawthorne is a serious and highly respected author and . journalist. He has spent weeks scientifically analysing all the available data . to produce the book, which is a serious and measured . study of this tragedy.”","New book Flight MH370: The Mystery claims the plane was shot down accidentally and its tracks covered up .

"The vitamin-like supplement coenzyme Q10 could halve death rates among people with heart failure and reduce hospital admissions . Supplements of a popular energy-booster could halve death rates among people with heart failure, claim scientists. The vitamin-like supplement coenzyme Q10 also reduces hospital admissions, says a major new study. It is the first drug shown to save the lives of heart failure patients in more than a decade - and it is available over the counter in health food shops. CoQ10 - which can be taken with statins - should now be added to conventional treatment for such patients, according to Professor Svend Aage Mortensen, who led the study. Professor Mortensen said: ‘CoQ10 is the first medication to improve survival in chronic heart failure since ACE inhibitors and beta blockers more than a decade ago and should be added to standard heart failure therapy. ‘Other heart failure medications block rather than enhance cellular processes and may have side effects. 'Supplementation with CoQ10, which is a natural and safe substance, corrects a deficiency in the body and blocks the vicious metabolic cycle in chronic heart failure.’ More than 900,000 Britons live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it. Heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and it can lead to serious complications. CoQ10 is a substance similar to a vitamin which is made by the body and found in every cell, where it is used to produce energy. However, CoQ10 levels are decreased in the heart muscle of patients with heart failure, who are often taking statin drugs that in turn deplete the body’s supplies still further. Previous research has shown CoQ10 improves symptoms, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure with no side effects. But until now, no trials have been big enough to prove that supplements increase survival. The latest study from researchers at the University of Southern Denmark, Copenhagen randomly allocated 420 patients with severe heart failure from a number of countries to CoQ10 or placebo - a dummy drug - and followed them for 2 years. Heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles . CoQ10 halved the risk of patients suffering death or serious deterioration of symptoms, including hospitalisation. Altogether 29 (14 per cent) patients in the CoQ10 group had such an event compared with 55 (25 per cent) patients in the placebo group. CoQ10 also halved the risk of dying from all causes, which occurred in 18 (9 per cent) patients in the CoQ10 group compared to 36 (17 per cent) patients in the placebo group. The substance is essential to survival and as well as being important for energy production in cells, it also functions as an antioxidant, which protects the body from damage caused by harmful molecules. CoQ10 is naturally present in small amounts in a wide variety of foods, with higher levels in organ meats such as heart, liver, and kidney, as well as beef, soy oil, sardines, mackerel, and peanuts, but levels obtained through diet are insufficient to impact on heart failure. CoQ10 is available over the counter as a food supplement and many doctors advise patients on statins to take it as well in order to offset the cell energy-depletion caused by statins. But Professor Mortensen cautioned: ‘Food supplements can influence the effect of other medications including anticoagulants and patients should seek advice from their doctor before taking them.’ He added: ‘We have no controlled trials demonstrating that statin therapy plus CoQ10 improves mortality more than statins alone.’ Nevertheless, he supported the use of CoQ10 by heart patients on statins because of their effect on supplies of the naturally-occurring nutrient.","Coenzyme Q10 is first drug shown to reduce heart failure deaths in a decade .

"Charlie Rose interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at his palace in Damascus this morning and will air the entire interview tomorrow, just one day before President Obama is set to address the nation. While Congress debates whether or not to carry out military strikes against Syria, President al-Assad told Mr Rose that he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on August 21 that killed 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children. Speaking from Beirut, Lebanon on Face the Nation, Mr Rose relayed some of what President al-Assad said in their interview. Scroll down for preview . Denial: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad spoke to Charlie Rose in an exclusive interview where he said that he had no knowledge of a chemical weapons attack and that no such attack could be proved . While he insists he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on the suburbs of Damascus last month, 'he does accept some of the responsibility'. Mr Rose asked the president whether or not he felt any remorse. 'He said ""Of course I do,"" but it did not come in a way that was sort of deeply felt inside. It was much more of a calm reaction of anybody who's a leader of a country would feel terrible about what's happened to its citizens,' Mr Rose said. Mr al-Assad said 'there's not enough . evidence to make a conclusive judgement' about whether the attack . happened or not, but also suggested that the rebels might have had . something to do with it. Sit down: Excerpts were aired Monday morning and the full interview will come Monday evening, the same day that President Obama will be trying to convince members of Congress to support a military strike against Syria . Threats: Assad said that if America makes an attack, they should 'expect everything' But the Obama Administration has been making a case counter to that claim. Today, . White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough said there was 'no question . in my mind' that President al-Assad carried out the August 21 attack . that seemed to use the toxic Sarin gas. The . administration has been circulating video of civilians taken after the . attack, showing them convulsing and struggling to breathe  - common . reactions of Sarin exposure. Secretary . of State Kerry said that the images and footage of the aftermath are . enough to prove that a chemical attack happened. Though some are . pointing out that it doesn't prove that the Assad regime carried them . out. The Syrian perspective: Charlie Rose interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this morning in Damascus and will air the interview tomorrow evening. The two have spoken twice before. Above, a picture from their exchange in 2010 . 'He does accept some of the responsibility': While Mr al-Assad said he had nothing to do with the chemical weapons attack on August 21, he did express remorse over the 1,400 killed including hundreds of children . When asked by reporters in London what he thought about President Assad's claim that there wasn't enough evidence, Mr Kerry said 'the evidence speaks for itself'. President al-Assad on the other hand . wouldn't say whether he thinks Congress will vote to approve the . military strikes, only that they are  'as prepared as they could be' for . one. He also suggested that there would be a retaliation strike, but would not talk about what kind of response. In . the interview he gave a message to the American people 'that it had not . been a good experience for them to get involve din the Middle East'. Crimes against humanity: Congress is currently debating whether or not to authorize military strikes on Syria following the alleged August 21 chemical weapons attack that killed 1,400 including hundreds of children . Making their case: President Obama's administration has been using images and footage after the attack to convince Congressmen to OK the strikes . This isn't the first time that Mr Rose has spoken with the Syrian president. He's interviewed him on two prior occasions, once in 2006 and again in 2010.

"A new 3D computer simulator has been designed to help doctors and midwives prepare for unusual or potentially dangerous births. The programme creates a model of the inside of a woman’s body that can simulate the act of giving birth. It takes important factors into account that can help predict how easily a baby will be delivered, including the shape of the mother’s body and the position of the baby. Computer scientists are creating a virtual birthing simulator that creates a view of the inside of a woman¿s body that can simulate the act of giving birth (pictured). They said it can give 'patient-specific birth predictions' that will help doctors and midwives deliver babies more safely . Computer scientists at the University of East Anglia, who invented the programme, said it will provide ‘patient-specific birth predictions'. Speaking at the International Conference on E-Health and Bioengineering in Romania, Dr Rudy Lapeer, who has led the project, said: ‘We are creating a forward engineered simulation of childbirth using 3D graphics to simulate the sequence of movements as a baby descends through the pelvis during labour. ‘Users will be able to input key anatomical data, such as the size and shape of the mother’s pelvis and the baby’s head and torso. ‘By doing this you will be able to set different bespoke scenarios for both the mother and baby,’ he said. The simulation software will see ultrasound data used to re-create a geometric model of a baby’s skull and body in 3D graphics as well as the mother’s body and pelvis. Programmers are also taking into account . the force from the mother pushing during labour and are even modelling a . ‘virtual’ midwife’s hands that can interact with the baby’s head. The simulation software will see ultrasound data used to re-create a geometric model of a baby's skull and body in 3D graphics as well as the mother's body and pelvis . Dr Lapeer said: ‘Because this programme is patient-specific, doctors and midwives will be able to see how a birth may take place before it has happened on a case-by-case basis. For example, you would be able to see if a baby’s shoulders will get stuck. ‘We hope that this could help to avoid complicated births altogether by guiding people in the medical profession to advise on caesarean sections where necessary.’ The computer programme can currently run through scenarios based on previous births as well as modelling the physics of childbirth in unfamiliar birth scenarios, according to LiveScience. The simulator can be used to train midwives, who currently learn by watching videos of births or using mannequins, neither of which show how a baby moves inside its mother. While the programme currently models one baby and pelvis, it does not recreate the movements of a foetus, or the movements of the muscles of the mother’s pelvis but the researchers hope to build on their innovation so that it can handle additional factors.

Residents in the Pocono Mountains were today ordered to stay inside after police reportedly exchanged gunfire with a survivalist fugitive who shot dead a state trooper last week. Donning bulletproof vests, officers have hunkered down in the wooded Canadensis neighborhoood where Eric Frien, one of the FBI's most wanted men, lived with his parents. They have told locals in the townships of Price and Barrett to remain inside, while others have been asked not to travel to the area due to heavy police activity. Those who had been kept away from the area were allowed to return to their homes this morning, but told to shelter in place. However, around 20 people who couldn't get back to their homes were required to take refuge at the Barrett Township firehouse, said township supervisor Ralph Megliola. This morning, roads remained closed as police carrying heavy rifles intensified their search for 31-year-old Frein following a long night that included gunshots. An unmarked helicopter was heard flying overhead, its lights off. After daybreak, two FBI agents in a black SUV donned tactical gear before heading toward the search area.

Above, displaced resident Jason Neff  comforts his wife Jennifer . Authorities will not say whether they believe they have Frein surrounded. Their last communication came shortly after 9pm yesterday when a spokeswoman asked the media to relocate at a staging area further away from the scene. Shots were fired in the area around 6:40 p.m. Friday, a Monroe County 911 dispatcher said. An official told CNN there were gunshots between police and 'an individual believed to be Frein,' the channel said. The source also said police were outside where someone got inside a home using forced entry. Today, residents Al and Debbie Mundy said they had to spent the night in their pickup after going out for groceries yesterday evening. When they got to the end of the road, a state trooper told them they would not be permitted back into the neighborhood, they said. 'They would not let us turn around to go a quarter-mile back to our house,' said Mr Mundy. Meanwhile, Canadensis resident Richard Barry told of how he did not return home from work in time before the roadblocks went up. He said that family members who were at home had told him police were going through their yard and the dog was barking. 'I'm hoping that sooner or later he (Frein) just says ""I give up. You win"",' Mr Barry added. On patrol: This morning, roads remained closed as state police intensified their search for 31-year-old Frein .

Authorities will not say whether they believe they have Frein surrounded. Their last communication came shortly after 9pm yesterday. Above, Mr and Mrs Negg speak with a state trooper . Shelter: The Pennsylvania State Police today asked all residents of Barrett and Price townships (pictured) to continue to shelter inside. The force told locals to remain away from windows or openings to the outside . As many as 200 officers at a time are trying to flush out Frein. Authorities are hoping to catch the gunman they allege opened fire on a state police barracks a week ago, killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding a second trooper. Police had previously been focusing their search on tens of thousands of acres of undisturbed forest that offered the self-taught survivalist ample opportunity to hide. But in the current search, authorities believe Frein is hiding in the patch of forest near his hometown of Canadensis and the state police barracks in Blooming Grove where authorities say he killed Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Police have said Frein nurses an unspecified grudge against law enforcement and government and consider it unlikely he will target the public. Pennsylvania State Police told Fox29 reporter Dave Kinchen that Frein may be carrying two firearms. Active: Frein, who has participated in Cold War military reenactments, is part of a group called Eastern Wolves . Authorities are seen in the search for Eric Frein . A '[b]ig tow truck' and '[t]hree police vehicles' drove away from the area late Friday evening, Peter Cameron of The Times Tribune reported. ABC News reported Frein has participated in Cold War military reenactments and is a member of a group called Eastern Wolves. Reenactor Roman Kamensky told the news site 'If he's re-enacting anyone, it's Rambo from the very first movie,' referencing the 1982 film 'First Blood.' 'He put a bad light on us,' Kamensky also said. 'We respect cops, we don't try to kill cops.' Kamensky explained to ABC News 'We attended the same events. Red Alliance is a global [military simulation] community, so when you find someone in the Tri-state area, you try to meet up.' Speaking about Eastern Wolves, Kamensky said 'From what I've seen, they haven't been doing much. Most of them are just casual guys from Pennsylvania. They have some land over there. They host their events and locals come out and they just play Airsoft.' Where is he? The FBI shared Frein's image in New York City's Times Square . Victims: Cpl. Bryon Dickson, left, was killed last week and Trooper Alex Douglass, right, was wounded . In a news conference, Lt. Col. George Bevins said 'Information has been received that Frein currently has his head shaved tightly on both sides with long hair on top.' 'It's wider than a mohawk on top,' Bevins said. 'His hairstyle is completely different from the hairstyle that Frein has worn for years. Investigators believe that this change was made as part of the mental preparation to commit this cowardly act.' Eastern Wolves member Stephen D'Arcangelo told NBC News 'That stuff about wanting to commit mass murder and kill cops? I never heard him say anything like that.' 'With the mohawk thing and the military uniform, they're making him sound like Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" and he wasn't that dude,' he also said. Police say they are methodically eliminating places where Frein could take refuge, including hunting cabins, campsites and vacation homes in the Pocono Mountains. Mohawk: The FBI said Frein might currently have a mohawk . Have you seen me? A wanted poster for Frein is seen in a Philadelphia convenience store . It's difficult. The terrain in this area of Pennsylvania is so impenetrable in spots that police choppers can't see through the forest canopy. The suspect also has his pick of places to break into and steal food. Pike County alone boasts more than 14,000 seasonal or recreational homes. NBC News reported that Frein was in jail for three months after failing to appear for his own trial, stemming from his alleged theft of relics from World War Two. 'He was locked up until he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to time served and restitution,' the news site said. Frein, publicly identified as a suspect Tuesday, is already drawing comparisons to Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber who eluded authorities for years in the woods of western North Carolina. Similar? Frein, publicly identified as a suspect Tuesday, is already drawing comparisons to Eric Rudolph, pictured. Rudolph bombed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and hid for years in the woods of western North Carolina . Like Frein, Rudolph was described as an anti-government survivalist who lived off the land, but authorities say one of his earliest moves after going on the run in 1998 was to swipe a six-month supply of food and a pickup truck from a neighbor's house. He left the man $500. Frein's sister Tiffany said 'He did something messed up, but he's still a human and he has feelings' to NBC News Wednesday. 'We're not trying to protect him,' she also said. 'He has to suffer the consequences. But he's still our family. I don't know where he is or what he's doing. I hope it's a big misunderstanding.' The FBI has posted his image in Times Square and says there is a $100,000 information reward. Funeral: Pennsylvania State Troopers prepare for the start of Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Bryon K. Dickson II's funeral Thursday . In a release, the agency said 'Frein is known to be a heavy smoker, a weapons enthusiast, and a survivalist. He claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa, and he has studied Russian and Serbian languages. He may have shaved his head on both sides and have long hair on top. 'He was last seen with no facial hair and was wearing a brown and gold windbreaker, khaki shorts, and sneakers. He was carrying a dark green backpack with black trim. Frein has ties to the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, including the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.'

"Two RAF jets were scrambled from their base in Cyprus to urgently investigate Syrian planes that had crossed into international airspace, it has emerged. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that unidentified planes legally crossed into Cypriot skies from the east of the country last Monday. But it is understood the behaviour of the aircraft raised suspicions at RAF Akrotiri, less than 200 miles from Syria, prompting the rapid response. A pair of Typhoons were launched from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus after two Syrian planes entered the nation's airspace. File pictures . The MoD deployed six Typhoon jets at the base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, las month as a 'purely a prudent and precautionary measure to ensure the protection of UK interests' The aircraft retreated before any action was taken by the two RAF air-defence Typhoons. A pair of Turkish F-16s are also believed to have been launched in support of the investigation from their base in Incirlik, Turkey. The Syrian planes are believed to have been Russian-made Sukhoi Su-24s, a heavily-armed fighter bomber that can reach Cyprus, 200 miles from Syria, in just 15 minutes. A spokesman for the MoD said: 'The MoD can confirm that Typhoon Air Defence Aircraft operated from RAF Akrotiri on Monday to investigate unidentified aircraft to the east of Cyprus; the aircraft were flying legally in international airspace and no intercept was required.' A military source told the Sunday People: 'Recent intelligence reports have warned of an attack on Akrotiri. 'The RAF Typhoons were launched after sensitive airborne early-warning radarpicked up the ""contacts"" floying low and fast.' Akrotiri is one of Britain's largest overseas bases and is home to more than 1,300 personnel. It was used in the air campaign against Gaddafi's Libya in 2011. It comes amid rising global tensions with Syria as the U.S. seeks to build support for military strikes against President Bashar Asssad's regime. The Syrian planes were believed to Russian-made Su-24s, a fighter bomber . Number 10 indicated last week that Britain is not expecting its military bases such as RAF Akrotiri to be used by allies in any air strikes. RAF Akrotiri is used by the RAF as a base for overseas operations in the Middle East and also for training. A week ago, six RAF Typhoon jets were sent to Cyprus in what the MoD called a 'prudent and precautionary measure'. On its website, the MoD says Typhoon Jets provide the RAF with a 'multi-role combat aircraft, capable of being deployed in the full spectrum of air operations, from air policing, to peace support, through to high-intensity conflict'.","RAF fighters sent to intercept Syrian planes in Cypriot airspace .

"The world's oldest primate - dating back 55 million years and small enough to fit in the palm of a hand - has been discovered by scientists.

Even though it weighed under an ounce, the minute animal provides a vital missing link in human evolution.

Scroll down for video . Named Archicebus achilles and smaller than the pygmy mouse lemur, the tiniest living primate, it was unearthed near the Yangtze River in central China. Even though it weighed under an ounce, the minute animal provides a vital missing link in human evolution . Researchers say the new skeleton, which . is described in the journal Nature, supports the more recent view that . Asia was the continent of origin for primates, not Africa as previously . believed. Small eye sockets reveal it was active by day. Paleontologist . Dr Xijun Ni, who led the research, said: 'This region would have been a . large series of lakes, surrounded by lush tropical forests during the . early Eocene. 'Our analysis shows this new primate was very small and would have weighed less than an ounce. 'It had slender limbs and a long tail, would have been an excellent . arboreal leaper, active during the daytime, and mainly fed on insects.' Closest living relatives: the tarsier (L) is considered endangered and only found on islands in South East Asia; the pygmy mouse lemur is the tiniest living primate and is found on the island of Madagascar . Tree-dwelling Archicebus would use its chimpanzee-like opposable big toe to cling onto the branches. Dr . Christopher Beard, of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in .

'Archicebus differs radically from any other primate, . living or fossil, known to science and represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution' Dr Christopher Beard . 'It looks like an odd hybrid with the feet of a small monkey, the arms, legs and teeth of a very primitive primate, and a primitive skull bearing surprisingly small eyes. 'It will force us to rewrite how the anthropoid lineage evolved.' The skeleton was digitally reconstructed using state of the art scanning techniques, allowing to establish the fossil was radically different from any other primate, living or extinct. Anthropologist Dr Dan Gebo, of Northern Illinois University, said: 'This is the oldest primate skeleton of this quality and completeness ever discovered and one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented. 'The origin of primates sets the first milestone for all primate lineages, including that of humanity. 'Although scientists have found primate teeth, jaws, occasionally skulls or a few limb bones from this time period, none of this evidence is as complete as this new skeleton from China. 'With completeness comes more information and better evidence for the adaptive and evolutionary themes concerning primate evolution. It takes guessing out of the game.' Dr Ni, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, first came across the fossil years ago while doing fieldwork. It had been found by a local farmer and was later donated to the university. It was encased within a rock that was split open to reveal fossils and impressions of the primate on each side of the two halves. The quarry where it was discovered was once a lake where many ancient fish and bird fossils from the same era known geologically as the Eocene have been dug up. Dr Ni said: 'Archicebus marks the first time we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence between tarsiers and anthropoids (primates that include monkeys, apes and humans). 'It represents a big step forward in our efforts to chart the course of the earliest phases of primate and human evolution.' Their study included a three dimensional, high resolution reconstruction, aided by high tech scanning of the fossil at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France.","Archicebus achilles was found near the Yangtze River in China .

"People who were injured in the nerve gas attack that killed 1,429 people in Syria have been flown to the UK for secret treatment and tests, according to a rebel leader. Ahmad Asi al-Jarba, the president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said a 'small number' of victims were in the UK and the deadly gas Sarin was found in their bodies. 'The president was told (on Thursday) during a meeting that the results from the examinations confirmed sarin gas on these individuals,' said Hadi Albahra, the secretary of the political committee within the coalition. Horror: A video that reportedly shows victims of the sarin gas attack in a neighbourhood in Damascus. A few victims are being treated and tested in the UK, reports a Syrian opposition official . The two or three victims are from the Ghouta area and would remain in Britain until they have recovered, reports The Sunday Times. He added: 'They are in a stable condition but they found traces of sarin gas inside their systems.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it could not confirm the Syrian statement. The news comes as a survey revealed that British voters oppose military action over Syria - even if it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people. Syria claims rebels carried out the August 21 attack. The Sunday Telegraph poll shows a large proportion of voters do not want a second Commons vote on military intervention, even if the UN confirms the attacks. A Syrian man mourning over a dead body after the alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces . A total of 46 per cent say MPs should not vote again if proof is found, while 36 per cent say they should. Meanwhile 47 per cent says Britain should take no military action, but continue to provide aid. Nearly 20 per cent say Britian should take military action along with the U.S. The White House is making a big push to rally members of Congress and the American public behind President Barack Obama's plan for a U.S. military strike against Syria. Recent opinion surveys show intense American skepticism about military intervention in Syria, even among those who believe Syria's government used chemical weapons on its people. Anger: Protesters against U.S. military action in Syria march to Capitol Hill from the White House in Washington on Saturday, . At least 150 people picketed outside the White House on Saturday to oppose any military action against Syria. Demonstrations also took place in New York City, Boston and Indianapolis and in Louisiana and Michigan. Syria's use of chemical weapons is 'an evil we must stand up to one way or another', William Hague said today, but insisted the Government was not 'gung-ho' about military action. The Foreign Secretary will hold talks in London tomorrow with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as Washington seeks to bolster international support for an armed response. He insisted the US remained 'very committed' to the so-called special relationship despite MPs defeating David Cameron to vote against a strike against Bashar Assad's regime. An F/A-18F Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea.

Mr Hague said he was determined to ensure Britain does not 'matter less' in the world in future. Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said he recognised there was 'a lot of public unease about intervention overseas'. 'Be reassured that we have learned lessons of Iraq. We are not seeking to be drawn into wars in the Middle East. We now make decisions in a completely different way,' he said. 'We are not a Government that is gung-ho about military action.' But he said Britain must also not 'turn in on ourselves'. Mr Hague added: 'Britain has great and positive influence in the world, and we must make sure that we retain that. I am very determined, as the Prime Minister is, that we will not matter less.' Foreign Secretary William Hague on the Andrew Marr Show. He said the British Government is not 'gung-ho' about military action . The Government was 'not planning to go back again' to the Commons for another vote, he said. 'If circumstances change dramatically, then of course everybody would be looking at things in a different light,' he accepted. But he said there was 'no guarantee' that Labour would not repeat its 'rather opportunistic and partisan' decision to oppose the Government motion. 'On major issues of international peace and security, oppositions should be able to rise above that. So there would be no guarantee on a future occasion that they would not behave in that way again.' Mr Hague said it was right for the UK to supply the Syrian National Coalition with non-lethal equipment. 'Terrible things do happen on both sides but that does not mean that everyone in Syria is evil. As in any country, there are millions of people who just want peace and democracy and freedom.'","A rebel leader says people hit by gas attack are in the UK .

"Barack Obama spins daily rhetoric about helping the job market recover from the recession, but now he's come up with a rather more practical approach to helping one woman's husband get work. The President last night asked a video chat questioner to send him her husband's CV, insisting he wanted to find out why the man has been out of work despite his skills as a semiconductor engineer. He told mother-of-two Jennifer Wedel, 29, of Fort Worth, Texas, that he believed such high-tech fields are in great demand and her 40-year-old husband ‘should be able to find something right away’. Scroll down for video . Help: President Barack Obama asked a video chat questioner to send him her husband's CV, insisting he wanted to find out why the man has been out of work despite his skills as a semiconductor engineer . ‘I meant what I said, if you send me your husband's resume, I'd be interested in finding out exactly what's happening right there,’ President Obama told Mrs Wedel on a Google Plus live video chat. But Mrs Wedel told President Obama that despite what he said, her husband had been out of work for three years. She wanted to know why foreign workers were getting visas for high-skilled work. Jennifer Wedel describes herself as a 'good Republican' and revealed she didn't vote for President Obama four years ago. But she has been 'so disappointed' with the latest race for the White House that she doesn't expect to back the GOP this time. 'I haven't seen anybody who would have been a good replacement,' she told The Atlantic. 'I know how Obama is now. I know how he rolls. So I'd probably vote him back in.' Mrs Wedel works in insurance for State Farm. Her husband meanwhile was employed by Texas Instruments for seven years until he lost his job. The exchange came as the President . appeared in a live video chat room known as a ‘Hangout’, part of . Google's social networking site Google Plus. He was answering questions submitted via YouTube, as well as interacting live with Mrs Wedel and four others. The post-State of the Union session was part of the White House focus on social media. In past such events - with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube sessions following previous State of the Union addresses - President Obama answered questions submitted via online networks. But Monday's event allowed him to interact with a selection of his questioners, leading to more substantive exchanges as they pushed him on his stances. Query: He told Jennifer Wedel of Fort Worth, Texas, pictured, that what he was hearing from industry suggested high-tech fields are in great demand and her husband 'should be able to find something right away' Family: Mrs Wedel, left, is pictured in her Google+ profile photo with her unemployed husband, right . Mrs Wedel's insistence that the President's claims about the demand for high-skilled workers weren't being born out for her husband led to the offer to take a look at his resume. ‘I'll have to take you up on that,’ she . told him. And President Obama came back to it after covering a range of . issues in the 45-minute session, telling her: ‘Remember to send me that . information!’ 'I meant what I said, if you send me your husband's resume, I'd be interested in finding out exactly what's happening right there' President Barack Obama on resumes . President Obama got a variety of questions on the economy and his policies on innovation and small businesses. An unemployed Occupy protester sent a video asking him: ‘I need help. I'm 53. What am I going to do?’ ‘The most important thing I can do for folks who are out of work right now is grow the economy,’ President Obama responded in part. He also said unmanned drone strikes were being used justly. ‘I think that there's a perception somehow that we're just sending in a whole bunch of strikes willy-nilly,’ he said. ‘This is a targeted, focussed effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists.’ He was also asked about online piracy. Congress recently delayed action on legislation cracking down on online piracy after opposition from internet companies including Google. Contenders: The exchanges came a day ahead of the key Republican primary in Florida today, as GOP presidential hopefuls - especially Mitt Romney, left and Newt Gingrich, right - attack President Obama daily . President Obama said he thought it was possible to protect intellectual property that creates jobs in the U.S., while still respecting the integrity of the internet as an open system. The exchanges came a day ahead of the key Republican primary in Florida today, as GOP presidential hopefuls - especially Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich - attack President Obama daily. 'The most important thing I can do for folks who are out of work right now is grow the economy' President Barack Obama on jobs . But none of the questions put to him were about the presidential race. They were about the State of the Union and people's lives now. There were also light moments, as Mrs Wedel asked President Obama if he would show off his dance moves. He refused and said his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama, mocks his dancing. Another questioner asked how they plan to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary in autumn. But as it's shortly before the election, President Obama said he wasn't sure how romantic it would be. More than 133,000 questions were submitted and voted on by YouTube users. Google officials selected the questions to ask based in part on those results. Some 1,630,870 votes were cast. Although many of the questions that . appeared online were about Obama's stance on legalising marijuana - . something he has said he opposes when asked in the past - that did not . come up. Interest: The number one voted question was about the potential extradition to the U.S. of Richard O'Dwyer, a young British student accused of breaking copyright laws. He is pictured with his mother Julia this month . Organisers said the number one voted question was about the potential extradition to the U.S. of Richard O'Dwyer, a young British student accused of breaking online copyright laws. The 23-year-old is accused of creating a . website from his university bedroom in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, which . listed sites where films could be downloaded in infringement of . copyright. 'I think that there's a perception somehow that we're just sending in a whole bunch of strikes willy-nilly. This is a targeted, focussed effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists' President Barack Obama on drones . His lawyers say this in itself is not an offence under British law but earlier this month a court cleared him for extradition to the U.S., where he could face ten years in a high-security prison. President Obama said he wasn't personally involved in the case but the administration wanted to ensure that intellectual property is protected ‘in a way that's consistent with Internet freedom’. The student’s mother Julia O’Dwyer said the U.S. has ‘excessive use of the extradition laws between our countries’ and the ‘UK government’s passive acceptance’ of this is ‘shameful’. ‘It’s up to Mr Obama to put a stop to the ridiculous and appallingly harsh attempts to extradite Richard and others facing similarly unnecessary treatment,’ Ms O’Dwyer added. The O’Dwyer case has chilling similarities to that of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon, who hacked into Pentagon computers from his North London bedroom while searching for evidence of aliens.

"A new exhibition in Germany about archaeology under the Nazis shows how the regime launched a 'Last Crusade' expedition in wartime to find the Holy Grail from the Last Supper of Christ. In the 1989 Last Crusade movie, Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford was on the quest for the grail - and he was in competition with the Nazis. Now truth turns out to be stranger than fiction in the exhibition 'Dig for Germania. Archaeology under the Swastika' in Bremen. It tells how S.S. chief Heinrich Himmler allegedly visited Spain during the war because he believed the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona. Real-life echo: In the Last Crusade movie, Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford was on the quest for the grail - and he was in competition with the Nazis . The chief architect and manager of the Nazi Holocaust believed that finding the grail 'would help Germany win the war and give him supernatural powers.' Squads of S.S. men searched in vain for the grail. The S.S. budget for such projects was vast as the Nazis intended their finds to rewrite history to prove Germans were the greatest race in all history. Before Hitler came to power there were just a handful of professorships in archaeology; afterwards there were 24, all tasked with promoting this claptrap theory while finding as many rare artefacts as possible from around the globe. 'If we want to again become a large, . single people, we must build on the time, where the Nordic racial . nucleus was still pure and unadulterated and which combined with a . splendid culture which influenced all over Europe,' said Hans Reinerth, . Hitler's favourite archaeologist. Hocus pocus: Heinrich Himmler, left, shared the hocus-pocus belief with his boss Adolf Hitler, right, that Jesus Christ was actually descended from Aryan stock and visited Spain in search of the Grail . Hunting on a hunch: Himmler believed the grail was at the Montserrat Abbey near Barcelona but never found it . Far . from being the 'King of the Jews,' Himmler shared the hocus-pocus . belief with his boss Hitler that Jesus Christ was actually descended . from Aryan stock - the race which Hitler decreed was to rule the world . for 1,000 years. 'This is the time of Germanic . antiquity, the German prehistory', he added. Visitors to the exhibition . are informed: 'The Nazis sought to establish the image of blonde, . blue-eyed heroes and conquerors who were the ancestors of the Germans . and that their race was summoned for world domination.' When the Nazi war machine rolled . eastwards to conquer the Soviet Union in 1941, the archaeologists were . in their wake, using slave labourers to dig up evidence of 'German . superior race-colonies' that inhabited the lands back in the distant . past. The exhibition tells the visitor that many died in the hunt for . artefacts trying to underwrite this racial myth. Nazi hunters: The exhibition is at Bremen's Focke Museum, pictured, and is called 'Dig for Germania. Archaeology under the Swastika' 'Archaeologists . often planned these crimes or worked on their own initiative', said . historian of Dirk Mahsarski, who curated the exhibition hall at the . Bremen Focke Museum. 'There are a whole bunch of archaeologists of whom . we can safely say that they knew about the Holocaust and the suffering . of forced laborers.' The exhibition chronicles how two of the Third Reich's most powerful men - Himmler and Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi party racial philosopher - competed with separate archaeological teams to dig for artefacts to support Nazi theories. Himmler even sent a team of S.S. men to Tibet before the war to try to discover the mythical lost kingdom of Shangri La. Mostly the Nazis discovered pottery and bits of jewellery, all of which were used to promote their berserk racial theories; the treasure, like the Holy Grail, eluded them.","Revealed in exhibition 'Dig for Germania.

"They are some of the world’s most-loved animals, but almost 95 per cent of lemurs are threatened with extinction, according to the latest global assessment of at-risk species. The Brazilian three-banded armadillo, which is the mascot for this year’s World Cup, remains vulnerable to extinction, and is joined by a host of other creatures whose future looks equally bleak. Almost four-fifths of slipper orchids, which are found in North America, Europe and temperate regions of Asia, are also at risk of dying out, while the Japanese eel - a traditional delicacy and Japan’s most expensive food fish - is endangered. Almost 95 per cent of lemurs are threatened with extinction, according to the latest global assessment of at-risk species. Endangered ringtailed lemurs are pictured . A total of 22,103 species are listed as being either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The latest update shows that 94 per cent of lemur species in Madagascar are threatened with extinction. More than a fifth are critically endangered, inlcuding the largest living lemur, the Indri. Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur, and 20 are vulnerable to extinction. Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food. More than 73,000 species were assessed by conservationists for the IUCN Red List, which is marking its 50th anniversary this year. The animals and plants are among the 22,103 species assessed by experts as being in the three 'at-risk' categories of critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The latest update shows that 94 per cent of lemur species in Madagascar - the only place they are found - are threatened with extinction, making them one of the most threatened groups of animals on Earth. Of the African island nation’s 101 remaining lemur species, more than a fifth are critically endangered, including the largest living lemur, the large-bodied Indri. Almost half of the species are endangered, including the world’s smallest primate, Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur and 20 are vulnerable to extinction.

Berthe’s mouse lemur and the brown mouse lemur (pictured right) Lemurs are threatened by destruction of tropical forest habitat, with illegal logging on the increase in the face of political uncertainty and rising poverty in Madagascar, where some people hunt them for food. ‘Despite profound threats to lemurs, which have been exacerbated by the political crisis in Madagascar, we believe there is still hope,’ said Dr Chistoph Schwitzer, on the IUCN’s primate specialist group who is also Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society. ‘Past successes demonstrate that collaboration between local communities, non-governmental organisations and researchers can protect imperilled primate species,’ he said. Dr Thomas Lacher of Texas A&M University explained that the high threat level to lemurs required significant action as the animals play a critical role in the threatened ecosystems in Madagascar. ‘They also represent an important source of tourism revenue for the country, and as a result are a clear case where conservation can provide local economic benefits,’ he said. A global assessment of temperate slipper orchids found that 79 per cent of the popular ornamental plants, which have characteristic slipper-shaped flowers that trap insects to ensure pollination, are threatened with extinction.

Almost four-fifths of slipper orchids (pictured), which are found in North America, Europe and temperate regions of Asia, are at risk of dying out. Elsewhere, the banana orchid - the national flower of the Cayman Islands - has been assessed for the first time and listed as endangered, due to loss of its habitat . Their plight is the result of destruction of their habitat and over-collection of wild species for trade, even though international trade is regulated. The freckled cypripedium, which has fewer than 100 individuals left in south-eastern Yunnan in China and the Ha Giang province of Vietnam, is endangered due to over-collection and deforestation. Hassan Rankou, on the IUCN’s orchid specialist group, which is based at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said: ‘What was most surprising about this assessment was the degree of threat to these orchids. ‘Slipper orchids are popular in the multimillion-dollar horticultural industry. Although the industry is sustained by cultivated stock, conservation of wild species is vital for its future.’ Elsewhere, the banana orchid - the national flower of the Cayman Islands - has been assessed for the first time and listed as endangered, due to loss of its habitat for housing and tourism developments. The Japanese eel is listed as endangered due to its loss of habitat, overfishing, barriers to migration, pollution and changes to oceanic currents. This eel is shown in a plastic bag on the way to a restaurant in Tokyo . All eight species of African violets, found in the Eastern Arc mountains of East Africa, were assessed and all but one are at risk of extinction, with three critically endangered. The Japanese eel is listed as endangered due to its loss of habitat, overfishing, barriers to migration, pollution and changes to oceanic currents. The Red List update also includes a re-assessment of the Brazilian three-banded armadillo, which is believed to have declined by more than a third over the last 10-15 years due to loss of half its scrub land habitat and remained listed as vulnerable to extinction. But there was good news for Israel’s Yarkon bream, a fish species whose status went from extinct in the wild to vulnerable, as a result of a captive breeding programme and release of 9,000 fish into restored habitat in the country’s rivers. More than 73,000 species were assessed by conservationists for the IUCN Red List, which is marks its 50th anniversary this year. The latest update listed 4,554 species as critically endangered, 6,807 species as endangered and 10,742 species as vulnerable to extinction.","Figures come from International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)

"Due to its complex nature, scientists have only really been unravelling the mysteries of the brain over the last few decades. And now researchers have discovered that the brains of mice contain at least seven unknown types of cells, including a nerve cell. These findings are significant because they could shed light on diseases such as multiple sclerosis, explained the researchers. Researchers have discovered a number of unknown types of brain cells, including a nerve cell, in the brains of mice. They used a process called single cell sequencing to produce a detailed map of brain cell types. The finding could shed more light on the human brain (a stock image of human brain cells are shown) Using a process called single cell sequencing, scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced a detailed map of brain cell types and the genes active within them. It is the first time the method has been used on such a large scale and on such a complex tissue. Researchers studied more than 3,000 cells, one at a time, to identify a number of previously unknown types. ‘If you compare the brain to a fruit salad, you could say that previous methods were like running the fruit through a blender and seeing what colour juice you got from different parts of the brain,’ said Sten Linnarsson, senior researcher at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics. Researchers studied more than 3,000 cells, one at a time, and managed to identify a number of previously unknown types. They then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell, which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles. From this, the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell . Scientists analysed 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice. They then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell, which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles. From this, the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell. These included specialised neurons, blood vessel cells and glial cells, which take care of waste products, protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients. They also discovered unknown cell types, including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex. Six different types of unknown oligodendrocyte, which are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells, were also identified. ‘But in recent years we've developed much more sensitive methods of analysis that allow us to see which genes are active in individual cells. ‘This is like taking pieces of the fruit salad, examining them one by one and then sorting them into piles to see how many different kinds of fruit it contains, what they're made up of and how they interrelate.’ The discovery that all living organisms are made of cells was discovered almost 200 years ago by German scientists. Since then, researchers have learnt that the nature of a particular body tissue is determined by its cells, which are determined by what genes are active in their DNA. However, little is still known about how this happens in detail, especially in the body’s most complex organ - the brain. After the scientist analysed the 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice, they compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each one, enabling them to sort the cells into virtual piles. They identified 47 different kinds of cell, including a large proportion of specialised neurons, as well as blood vessel cells and glial cells, which take care of waste products, protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients. The researchers identified unknown cell types, including a nerve cell plus six different types of oligodendrocyte. These are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells. A stock image of cross sections of myelin sheaths surrounding axons of the central nervous system are shown . Then, they identified unknown cell types, including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex plus six different types of oligodendrocyte. These are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells. The study, published in the journal Science, could shed more light on diseases that affect the myelin - or white matter - such as multiple sclerosis. The disease is caused by the destruction of the white matter that forms a sheath around the axons of the central nervous system. 'Demyelisation' leaves scars or 'plaques' that cause various symptoms, including declining visual clarity, difficulty moving and speech problems. Co-leader of the study, Jens Hjerling-Leffler, said: ‘We have created a much more detailed map of the cells of the brain that describes each cell type in detail and shows which genes are active in it. ‘This gives science a new tool for studying these cell types in disease models and helps us to understand better how brain cell respond to disease and injury.’ There are estimated to be 100 million cells in a mouse brain, and 65 billion in a human brain.","Swedish researchers  found seven unknown  cells in the brains of mice .

"A young herring-gull will need specialist care for years after cruel yobs attacked it with spray paint. The bird was taken in by Whitby Wildlife Sanctuary, North Yorkshire, after she was found covered in thick red paint. The baby gull, who rescuers have named Poppy due to her new colour, is only a few months old and now faces a couple of flightless years while waiting for the damaged feathers to fall out. A young herring-gull was discovered with her feathers painted red after it was taregted by yobs . Alexandra Farmer, 25, who runs the sanctuary, said Poppy will not be able to live among the other gulls because she will be the victim of bullying. She said: 'She will be staying here at the sanctuary for a couple of years. 'She won't be able to fly now because the paint has made the feathers rock hard and stiff. She keeps looking at her feet because they are so red but there is not way to wash it off. 'It will take a couple of years for the paint to come off in the malt. There is no way to cut the feathers for them to grow back so you would have to pull them all out which I am not going to do. 'I already have a gull pen with about 30 other rescue gulls but she is likely to be bullied. 'I'm going to build a new pen just for her because the gulls will know that something is wrong and they will pick up on that.' The bird, named Poppy, will need specialist care for two years after the paint ruined her feathers. She is being held by wildlife expert Alexandra Farmer . She explained that the sanctuary had received calls earlier in the week from concerned members of the public who had spotted Poppy, so they put an appeal out on the lookout for the injured gull before she was found alone on an industrial estate yesterday. Poppy will now need  to be nurtured back to health. 'She is only a baby and so she is unable to fly at the moment which means she is fairly easy to get hold of,' she said. 'It looks like the paint that is used on the road. I think two people must have painted her because they have lifted her wings to paint underneath. One person would have held her and the other would have painted. 'She's going to need a lot of TLC. The paint is very fumy and I've had to keep her in a well aerated room. She smelt terrible when she was found and that amount of fumes would make breathing quite difficult. The baby gull, who rescuers have named Poppy due to her new colour, is only a few months old and now faces a couple of flightless years while waiting for the damaged feathers to fall out . An appeal was put out to find Poppy after concerned members of the public saw she has been targeted . 'They have painted her face and so I am taking her to the vet to make sure she didn't breathe too much of it in.' The sanctuary owner is now building Poppy her very own pen - kitted out with a paddling food and an abundance of food. She said: 'Once she is outside in her pen she will have lots of baths and her own paddling pool. Because we are based in Whitby a lot of fishmongers give fish cut offs so she will have plenty of food. 'The bird isn't suitable for the wild and is not suitable to be with her own kind. The feathers are ruined and because she is a sea bird she needs to be well oiled which means she is no longer waterproof. People need to know the dangers. It's just disgusting that people can do this.' A police spokesperson said officers received a call from a member of the public who had found the young seagull on Stainsacre Lane Industrial Estate in Whitby covered in red paint. 'Police will be working with the RSPCA to find out who was responsible. 'Anyone who has any information about the incident or knows who is responsible, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101.'","The young herring-gull was sprayed all over with red paint by cruel yobs .

A distraught Michael Jace pictured outside his LA home on Monday night. He has been booked in connection with his wife's murder . His booking sheet shows that he was booked at 3.37am and is being held on $1,000,000 bail . Jace was reportedly home alone when his wife arrived with their children from baseball practice. Shortly before Jace called 911, police received calls from neighbors in the Hyde Park area . who heard shots being fired inside the property after hearing arguing. According to paperwork obtained by TMZ, Jace filed for bankruptcy in March 2011. He filed for Chapter 13, restructured his finances and reduced his mortgage, but owed $411,000 on the home where his wife was killed and it was on the brink of a foreclosure. Jace was taken into custody and was later booked for his wife's murder, the LAPD confirmed on Tuesday. His bail has been set at $1million and according to police, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence. According to TMZ, the 6ft 4in actor remained on the phone as instructed by dispatchers until LAPD officers arrived. When officers entered the house they found April Jace, a mother-of-three, dead from gunshot wounds. Police confirmed that at least two children - the third child is from a previous relationship - were in the home at the time of the shooting. They have been placed in protective custody but officers were reportedly furious it took Children's Services four hours to get to the station and take the children to a family member. The kids were distraught, TMZ sources said. The Shield star Michael Jace, 48, was arrested on Monday night at his home. Neighbors reported shots fired inside the home before Jace himself dialed 911 and reportedly said he had shot his wife .

"Scottish viewers could lose access to some BBC programmes if they decide to leave the UK in this year’s referendum, the Culture Secretary warned yesterday. In a riposte to Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond – who has promised Scots would keep programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders under independence – Maria Miller insisted the Corporation belongs to the UK as a whole. The cabinet minister was asked at the Oxford Media Convention whether the BBC should shut down its Scottish transmitters in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote. Warning: In a riposte to Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond (left), Culture Secretary Maria Miller (right) insisted the Corporation belongs to the UK as a whole . She replied: ‘When it comes to voting in September I think we have to think what that vote is about. ‘It’s about whether or not Scotland wants to remain a part of the UK, and if the vote is they don’t want to do that then it’s actually a vote to leave the institutions of the UK and the BBC is one of those institutions.’ Mrs Miller said she could not yet give any detail on what television would be available in an independent Scotland. But she added: ‘I think it’s important that that principle is clear and that it is part of the decision making process when it comes to the referendum.’ TV favourites: Mr Salmond has promised Scots would keep programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing (left) and EastEnders (right) under independence . In November, the Scottish Government published a White Paper that promised a new Scottish Broadcasting Service – using the BBC’s assets in Scotland – would continue to air BBC programmes. 'It's about whether or not Scotland wants to remain a part of the UK, and if the vote is they don’t want to do that then it’s actually a vote to leave the institutions of the UK and the BBC is one of those institutions' Maria Miller, Culture Secretary . It said viewers would benefit from similar deals to those in force in the Republic of Ireland, where many BBC shows are screened on local channels. The White Paper said: ‘This will ensure that the people of Scotland will still have access to all current programming, including EastEnders, Doctor Who, and Strictly Come Dancing and to channels like CBeebies.’ Mr Salmond said a Scottish public service broadcaster would be ‘based on the existing staff and assets of BBC Scotland.’ 'We have to see': BBC director general Tony Hall refused to speculate on the future of the BBC in Scotland . Speaking at the same event, the BBC’s director general Tony Hall refused to speculate on the future of the BBC in Scotland. He said: ‘My view is we have to see.

But we will wait and see when the polls come through on September 18. ‘What I’m concentrating on the moment is that journalists who are covering the story have got my backing to be impartial and independent and to cover this campaign in Scotland, and really importantly in the rest of the UK, the best they can.’","Alex Salmond promised Scots would keep shows such as EastEnders .

"A German newspaper has reported claims President Assad's government inflicted a chemical weapons attack without receiving his personal permission . Syrian government forces pleaded for the use of chemical weapons for four-and-a-half months before an attack was launched on August 21, it has been reported. A German newspaper claims Syrian brigade and division commanders had been repeatedly denied permission to use the chemicals by President Bashar al-Assad before the attack which claimed more than 1,400 lives. According to Bild am Sonntag, German spies obtained information which suggested military forces went ahead with the attack without receiving Presidential permission. The newspaper reported German Intelligence had gained the information while intercepting radio messages aboard a naval vessel that was sailing close to the Syrian coast. Germany's foreign intelligence agency, BND, could not be reached for comment. Just last week the head of the BND, Gerhard Schindler, gave confidential briefings to defence and foreign affairs committees, reportedly warning those present the Syrian civil war could last for years to come. Committee members present at the meeting said Mr Schindler told them although it had no absolute proof, the BND had 'much evidence' to suggest President al-Assad's government was responsible for the attack. German spies reportedly intercepted a phone call between a Hezbollah official and the Iranian Embassy in Damascus in which the former alleged President al-Assad had ordered the attack. The German armed forces' chief of staff, General Volker Wiekler also informed lawmakers that ties between Syrian rebels and al-Qaeda linked forces were becoming 'stronger and stronger', it was reported. Syrian government forces, pictured here in the northeast village of Maaloula yesterday, had reportedly been asking for the use of chemical weapons for months . Like other European Union members, Germany has blamed the Syrian government for the brutal attack, but has urged waiting for U.N. weapons inspectors' report before encouraging any military response. In an interview with the same newspaper, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany would not take part in any military intervention but that chemical weapons should not be allowed to be used without a response. President al-Assad said in an interview filmed this morning he had nothing to do with the attack which claimed the lives of hundreds of children, but that he does claim 'some responsibility'. Action: US and Britain's leaders have demanded action against the Assad regime for allegedly launching chemical weapons attacks which have killed more than 1,400 people . Horror: Hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the Syrian capital of Damascus . Mr al-Assad told interviewer Charlie Rose 'there's not enough evidence to make a conclusive judgment', before alluding Syrian rebel forces were behind the attack. When asked whether he thought US Congress would vote in favour of a strike, the leader said he didn't know but was 'as prepared as they could be' for military action. President al-Assad then warned the American people 'it had not been a good experience for them to be involved in the Middle East' in the interview which will be aired in the US on Monday night. World leaders failed to reach agreement on how to address the situation at a G20 summit held in St Petersburg this weekend.","Government forces reportedly pleaded for chemical weapons use for months .

"Paralympic Games organisers have been accused of discriminating against the disabled after forcing wheelchair users to book tickets on phone lines costing up to 40p a minute. A Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed that those trying to book wheelchair tickets for events have to ring an 0844 number in order to buy tickets or check availability. Able-bodied people can simply buy them online from organiser LOCOG without incurring extra costs. Members of the Great Britain Women's Wheelchair Basketball team practise in St Paul's Cathedral. Organisers have been accused of discrimination after forcing wheelchair users to book tickets through an 0844 number . The London 2012 website showing the need for disabled people to ring the premium rate number to book wheelchair space tickets (right) Some disabled people now claim they have abandoned hope of attending the Games after being kept on hold for long periods running up large bills before eventually being told there are no tickets available. Hundreds have complained about their treatment on blogs and social networking sites and some have joined a campaign group on Facebook called 'Stop the Olympics from discriminating against wheelchair users!' Calls cost 5p a minute from a BT landline and up to 40p a minute from a mobile on the Orange network, 35p on Vodafone and Three, and 25p on O2. Some networks also charge a connection fee. Many disabled people have to call the number on a mobile because they have specially adapted phones that are easier to use than landlines. One woman, who has a disabled five-year-old son, said she called the ticket hotline more than 20 times on her Orange mobile phone and on some occasions spent up to half an hour on hold. Such a call to the 0844 number would cost £12. Wheelchair user Sarah Bard, 32, from Nottingham, who has to use a specially adapted mobile phone, said she had given up trying to buy tickets after calling the hotline from her mobile six times and each time being put on hold for up to 15 minutes. She said: 'Locog have designed the system to restrict us. Why are they advertising an 0844? It is discriminatory towards the disabled. 'My able-bodied friends can go online and check availability, see when the latest seats become available and buy them with no added charges. Wheelchair users, meanwhile, get left with only one option and that costs us extra money.' Last night former Labour Sports Minister Gerry Sutcliffe, chairman of the all-party disability sports group at Westminster, branded the phone charges 'unacceptable' and called on LOCOG to remove them. He said: 'This is completely ridiculous. Wheelchair users should be able to book their Paralympic tickets online just like everyone else. 'I shall be contacting LOCOG as soon as possible to ask them to remove these charges and reimburse people who have incurred unnecessary expense so far. The Paralympics is about breaking down barriers – not subjecting wheelchair users to charges that other people don't have to pay.' Disabled marathon runner Claire Lomas lights the Olympic cauldron for the Paralympic Games . Wheelchair users who want to buy tickets to the Games, which start on Wednesday, are directed on LOCOG's website to a section called 'Ticket information for disabled people'. This page informs them that they must call the phone line. The website says: 'If you require a wheelchair space, you can purchase tickets by calling the London 2012 Accessibility team on 0844 847 2012.' At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, tickets for people with wheelchairs were sold online and through dedicated phone lines with no additional charges. The disclosures are likely to prove embarrassing for LOCOG, which boasts on its website that it has 'created a ticketing process which is inclusive and accessible' and claims 'it is important to us that people of all abilities can purchase tickets easily'. The group on Facebook campaigning against the ticketing – which has 688 members – was founded by Terrijayne Butler, 33, whose 11-year-old son Reece has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. She wrote an open letter to LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe complaining about the issue and sent her website's link to his personal Twitter account but says she has had no response. Former Labour Sports Minister Gerry Sutcliffe branded the phone charges 'unacceptable' and called on LOCOG to remove them . She said: 'My fear was that my phone bill would end up being more than the actual tickets for the family. I know some people who have got through fairly quickly but others who have told me they have been waiting for more than half an hour only to be cut off. 'It is severely depressing that disabled people are being treated as second-class citizens like this.' When a Mail on Sunday reporter called the number yesterday, after getting through it took 11 minutes of talking to an operator to find out which tickets were available. Our reporter was told the only available wheelchair tickets were for Goalball and cost £15 for adults and £5 for concessions. A companion would be able to attend free. There were also ground passes available for the Olympic Park and ExCeL centre. Richard Hawkes, chief executive of disability charity Scope said: 'At a time when disabled people report that attitudes towards them are deteriorating, the Paralympics offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to make a hugely positive difference. 'Despite increasing the number of wheelchair accessible seats in the Olympic Stadium, there doesn't appear to be any additional provision made for disabled people who want to buy these tickets. 'The majority of people these days want the convenient and cost effective option of making their purchases online and disabled people are no different.' Alex Rankin, from disability charity Aspire, said: 'It could be in breach of the Equality Act. LOCOG should investigate how they can refund the cost of the call to all those people. It is unfair and unjustified to discriminate in this way.' And Bobby Ancil, from Muscular Dystrophy campaign Trailblazers, said: 'Forcing disabled people to call premium rate numbers to book tickets is simply unjustifiable.' Last night LOCOG said it did not make any revenue from the phone line. It is unknown if Ticketmaster, who handles the ticket sales, makes anything from the calls. LOCOG also said it had not received any complaints about the cost of calls and that the average length of calls to the phone line was less than two minutes. A spokesman said: 'All spectators were able to apply for tickets online for more than a year. 'From November 2011, we provided a bespoke phone line to ensure customers could discuss their individual accessibility needs. 'We really are trying our best. There are so many needs – soldiers and others who need legroom for their prosthetic limbs. We try to switch them and need to talk to them. We are proud to do more for spectators with accessibility needs than any other sporting event in this country. We offer free Games mobility scooters at Games venues, free blue badge parking, and a free companion seat for every wheelchair space. By May just under 1.5 million of the total 2.5 million Paralympics tickets were still unsold. By August 7, about 1.1 million tickets remained, by August 14 about 400,000 were left and last night there were 200,000 unsold.","Organisers accused of making disabled people use 40p-a-min booking line .

"A freight train derailment caused major disruption to travellers on one of Britain's busiest rail lines today. Services on the West Coast Mainline between Milton Keynes and London Euston were cancelled during the morning rush hour after the electric locomotive came off the tracks at Bletchley in Buckinghamshire at 2.20am. The driver, the only person on board, is thought to have escaped with minor hand injuries. Crash: The loco caused substantial damage to overhead lines and is still in place . Disruption: Two of the four passenger lines in Bletchley are open, but the fast lines remain closed while repairs are carried out . Accident: The derailed locomotive, which was being operated on its own when it came off the tracks . The derailed locomotive was being operated by Virgin Trains . The engine – which wasn’t hauling any carriages at the time – belonged to Virgin Trains, on lease from Freightliner. Virgin Trains, Southern and London Midland advised passengers to seek alternative routes until the line was cleared. A Virgin Trains spokesperson told MailOnline that it would not be commenting on the incident as an investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch is underway. She advised passengers travelling from London to Birmingham to switch to Chiltern Railways from London Marylebone, and passengers from Manchester to travel south via Leeds. She added that maps showing alternative routes are being handed out at Manchester Piccadilly and London Euston stations and that passengers should check the National Rail website for updates. Robin Gisby, Network Rail managing director, network operations, said: 'Unfortunately there is quite substantial damage to the tracks and overhead lines following this morning’s incident. Key area: The train derailed near Bletchley station on the West Coast Main Line . Diversion: Passengers at London Euston travelling to Birmingham are being advised to use Chiltern Railways from Marylebone instead . 'Our engineers have been on site since the small hours to assist investigators and are now carrying out repairs to the tracks and overhead lines which have been damaged.' A Network Rail spokesman added that two of the four lines running through Bletchley are now open, but that the loco is still in place while the cause of the crash is investigated, so full service cannot resume just yet. The cold weather is not thought to have played a part in the accident.","'Substantial damage to the tracks and overhead lines,' say Network Rail ."
"Labour does not understand or appreciate the importance of family life, according to a former guru of Ed Miliband. In a highly critical interview, Maurice Glasman also said it was no surprise that religious people would be sceptical about the party’s policies. The academic claimed Labour had been ‘captured’ by an ‘aggressive public sector morality’ interested only in the individual and the collective. Maurice Glasman, pictured, warned Ed Miliband that people with religious faith are 'sceptical' about Labour . The comments will give fuel to pro-family groups who have attacked Labour for opposing measures designed to help families, such as the married couple’s tax allowance. Lord Glasman’s comments came in an interview with the Catholic Herald newspaper. He was asked why the faithful should listen to Labour, given that the party offended many traditionalists by forcing Catholic adoption agencies to arrange adoptions for gay couples. He said: ‘That’s a completely legitimate concern. I understand the scepticism from Catholics, from all faithful people. There’s a lack of understanding and a lack of appreciation for family. ‘The first thing is to acknowledge that Labour has been captured by a kind of aggressive public sector morality which is concerned with the individual and the collective but doesn’t understand relationships.’ Lord Glasman was given a peerage by Mr Miliband, has written speeches for the Labour leader and was seen as a close adviser. In 2009, he coined the term ‘Blue Labour’ arguing that the party should return to its working-class roots and embrace community values and volunteering. At one point party insiders dubbed him Mr Miliband’s ‘de facto chief of staff’. The 53-year-old has called for Labour to take a tougher line on immigration and focus more on helping the working classes. But he fell out of favour and he has since criticised Labour policy on a number of issues. Lord Glasman, pictured, said the Labour Party had been 'captured' by an aggressive public sector morality . In the interview, Lord Glasman said he would want a Labour government to reward couples who stay together. ‘I’d like to see us redistribute resources to people who care – for each other, for children – so that couples can have a night out on a little date. I would have a weekend away for five years of marriage. ‘A week’s holiday for ten years of marriage. Maybe a cruise for 25 years. Just a present, an acknowledgement that this is not easy – to stay together, to care for others, to be faithful and to forgive and rebuild. ‘The whole direction of society is to reward freedom and so some generosity for people who make it work and do their duty – that’s what I mean when I say “rewarding virtue”.’ Lord Glasman is a senior lecturer in political theory at London Metropolitan University, and director of its faith and citizenship programme. He has argued that Britain should renegotiate free movement rules that have allowed millions of EU migrants to come to this country. He has also criticised Labour for being ‘hostile to the English working class’ and for drawing its leadership from too narrow a group of Oxbridge graduates. Three years ago, the peer criticised Labour for ‘lying’ about the scale of immigration, and claimed that the previous Labour government had used mass immigration to control wages. A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Maurice’s views do not represent the Labour Party.’ At one stage, Lord Glasman was acknowledged as Ed Miliband's 'de facto chief of staff'","Maurice Glasman warned Labour that they are alienating religious people .

"Their crude camera was smuggled into the camp in sausages and carefully hidden away in a hollowed out dictionary. The precious 8mm film stored in the soles of their home made shoes. Had they been discovered it would have likely meant a firing squad. But for a group of daring French World War Two prisoners incarcerated in a German POW camp in 1940, it was a risk worth taking. Scroll down for video . Candid camera: Footage taken using the French POWs' secret camera shows prisoners milling around the compound in the Nazis' Oflag 17a camp in Austria . And not only did they use the secret device to film daily life around the Oflag 17a camp in Austria, but they even went so far as to film the digging of a tunnel used for their own great escape. The 30 minutes of footage they captured entitled Sous Le Manteau (Under The Cloak) now serves as a unique historical record giving a fascinating glimpse into what life was really life in the Nazi-run prison camps. The incredible story of the French prisoners' secret camera is being celebrated in Paris this week after the only living prisoner who managed to escape the camp and make it back to France celebrated his 100th birthday, the BBC reports. Lt Jean Cuene-Grandidier was among 5,000 officers marched to Oflag 17a situated close to the Czechoslovakian border following their defeat in the battle of France. Covert operation: The camera was hidden in a hollowed out dictionary and the film was stored in the soles of their home-made shoes . Originally built for German troops it was a sprawling camp composed of 40 barracks and surrounded by two lines of barbed wire with lookout towers and floodlights guarding the perimeter. Life was bleak and monotonous and with little food many of the prisoners were left on the brink of starvation. But they refused to allow their spirits to be broken. Realising that when the German soldiers checked food deliveries they only cut down the middle, the prisoners arranged for camera parts to be brought in smuggled in the ends of sausages. Once assembled a hollowed out dictionary from the camp library served as the perfect hiding place with the spine of the book opening up like a shutter. High security: The camp was surrounded by two lines of barbed wire and with lookout towers and flashlights used to guard the perimeter . A cape-wearing POW is seen holding the dictionary used to hide the camera as he stands next to one of the barracks. The 30-minute film produced was entitled Sous Le Manteau (Under The Cloak) Considering the conditions and the basic equipment the quality of the footage is quite remarkable. The cameramen would become so bold they even filmed the guards tearing their barracks apart in a surprise search. But perhaps the most striking footage shows badly malnourished prisoners digging their own escape tunnel. Lt Cuene-Grandidier who has been presented with France's highest award - the Legion d'honneur, recalled the escape attempt. He said: 'In the early days we tried digging a number of tunnels from the huts in which we were barracked. 'It was viewed as a form of resistance. We were never punished. The Germans seemed to accept it, though it never worked. The distances to the wire were too great. And in any case the guards were clever. They always found the tunnels we started. They were looking for the earth we'd removed.' Brazen: A German guard is filmed walking past one of the barracks . In total the prisoners of Oflag 17a dug 32 tunnels. Most were discovered by the guards but one attempt did prove successful. The Germans had permitted the prisoners to build a theatre which they decorated with branches to obscure the view of the guards. Situated between the barracks and the wire it meant the distance they had to dig was far shorter. In addition the prisoners had been issued with shovels to dig their own air raid trenches folowing a complaint fromn the International Red Cross. Using these valuable tools they braved suffocating conditions to burrow 90m underneath the perimeter and on September 17 1943 they were ready to go. Over two nights, 132 men slipped out into the darkness. They had been provided with civilian clothes and forged papers. Each had been ordered to travel in different directions to reduce the possibility of capture. Gruelling: A French POW is seen inside the tunnel through which 132 prisoners made their escape. Only two managed to make it back to France . Lt Cuene-Grandidier recalled: 'The short length of the tunnel and the number of people inside, meant we had to lie in the foetal position. 'There was so little air. Some of the men fainted. We waited almost 10 hours to go, all the time imagining the worst; the German firing squad that would surely be waiting at the end of the tunnel.' But getting onto the other side of the perimeter was just the first step and finding themselves deep in enemy territory hundreds of miles from France, the odds were stacked against them. Of the 132 who broke out, 126 were recaptured within the first week. Only Lt Cuene-Grandidier and one other prisoner managed to return to France. The story of Lt Cuene-Grandidier's escape sounds like the plot to a Holywood film. After making his way to Vienna, he worked as a hospital nurse treating German soldiers for venereal disease. After securing a weekend pass to Paris he travelled by train with German officers. His work treating their embarrassing problems must have held him in good stead as one even offered to drive him home in a German army staff car. But Lt Cuene-Grandidier's loyalty was never in doubt and Within weeks he had joined the Resistance.","Prisoners were being held in the Oflag 17a camp in Austria .

"A year on from the launch of Tesco’s hugely popular Hudl tablet, the retail giant has released its next-generation model. Unveiled at an event in London, the hudl2 has an 8.3-inch screen - an increase in size from the original 7-inch model – and runs on Android KitKat 4.4.2. It will be available from Tesco stores, and online, from 9 October for £129. Unveiled at an event in London, the hudl2 (pictured) has an 8.3-inch screen - an increase in size from the original 7-inch model – and runs on Android KitKat 4.4.2. It will be available from Tesco stores, and online, from 9 October for £129 . Clubcard customers can also purchase the hudl2 through Clubcard Boost – a scheme that doubles the value of Clubcard vouchers - meaning the price drops to £65. The original Hudl launched on 1 September 2013 and more than 35,000 models were sold in the first two days of release. In total, Tesco claims it has sold more than 750,000 devices in the past 12 months. The price of the original Hudl has been dropped from £129 to £99. In addition to boosting the screen size, the hudl2 has updated its cameras. The hudl2 is available in eight colours including, what the company dubbed, Jazzy Blue, Zesty Orange, Slate Black, Rocket Red, Tropical Turquoise, Dreamy White, Perky Purple and Bubblegum Pink (pictured) The original Hudl has a 3MP rear-facing camera, and 2MP camera on the front, while the hudl2 has a 5MP rear, but has dropped the front-facing device to 1.2MP. This puts the cameras on the hudl2 in direct competition with those on Google’s Nexus 7 (2013) and Apple’s iPad mini with Retina Display. The resolution of the hudl2 has been increased to 1920 x 1200, up from 1400 x 900 on the original, but the larger screen on the newer model means the pixel-per-inch (PPI) density is only marginally better; 272 compared to 237. PPI is an indicator of image sharpness, clarity and colour. Elsewhere, Tesco claims the hudl2 has an eight-hour battery life - which matches the original model - when watching videos, and 16GB of on-board memory, which can be expanded to 48GB. And inside, it is powered by an Intel Atom quad-core processor. Tesco has also partnered with The Parent Zone to develop a filter on the hudl2 meaning children and parents can use one device safely. The built-in app makes it easier for parents to set up profiles for up to seven users. Each of these can be tailored based on age and suitability, including setting a time limit to pre-determine how long a child spends using the tablet.

In this photo released by Vietnam Coast Guard, a Chinese ship, left, shoots water cannon at a Vietnamese vessel, right, as a Chinese Coast Guard ship, centre, sails alongside in the South China Sea, off Vietnam's coast . The . clash has been continuing for several days since a Chinese flotilla of . military and civilian ships moved into the disputed area of the South . China Sea on May 1. Vietnam . promptly dispatched marine police and fishery protection vessels to the . area but they were harassed as they approached, said Ngo Ngoc Thu, vice . commander of Vietnam's coast guard. He . said Vietnam had not carried out any offensive actions of its own in . waters close to the rig, which is around 140 miles off the Vietnamese . coast. 'Our maritime police . and fishing protection forces have practiced extreme restraint, we will . continue to hold on there,' said commander Ngo. 'But if (the Chinese ships) continue to ram into us, we will respond with similar self-defense.' He . showed video at a news conference of Chinese ships ramming into . Vietnamese ones and firing at them with high-powered water cannons. Attacks had occurred repeatedly over the past three days, he said. Vietnam . has sent no naval vessels to the area, despite the presence of Chinese . navy warships, but the standoff raises the possibility that more serious . clashes could yet break out. 'All restraint has a limit': Coast Guard Deputy Commander Ngo Ngoc Thu speaks during a press conference today on the clash off Vietnam's coast . 'No . shots have been fired yet,' said a Vietnamese navy official, who could . not be identified because he was not authorised to speak to media. 'Vietnam won't fire unless China fires first.' Another . Vietnamese official, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said that . Vietnam's ships were outnumbered by the Chinese flotilla. He said the . ships were trying to stop the rig from 'establishing a fixed position'. Western . analysts have called China's stationing of the oil rig one of its most . provocative steps yet in a gradual campaign of asserting its sovereignty . in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire sea, rejecting . rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. Chinese . Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying insists the rig, owned by . Chinese state-run oil company CNOOC, is in China's territorial waters . and therefore drilling is 'normal and legal.' 'The . disruptive activities by the Vietnamese side are in violation of . China's sovereign rights,' she said. China had previously said no . foreign ships would be allowed within three miles of the rig. In . a strongly worded statement in Washington on Tuesday, State Department . spokeswoman Jen Psaki called China's action 'provocative and unhelpful . to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.' Asked . about the U.S. statement, Ms Hua hit back. 'we want to tell the U.S. that the U.S. has no right to make irresponsible and unwarranted remarks . on China's sovereign rights,' she said. Vietnam has limited leverage in dealing with its giant neighbour and vital economic partner. While . it is no longer as isolated as it once was, as once of the world's last . few Communist countries it can't expect much diplomatic help from . powerful friends. It appears likely to try to rally regional support against China's actions. Vigilant; A Vietnamese naval soldier stands quard at Thuyen Chai island in the Spratly archipelago, where Vietnam has previously fought off oil rigs placed by a U.S. company working in collusion with China . Jonathan . London, a Vietnam expert at the City University of Hong Kong, said the . country had basically found itself caught between a rock and a hard . place. 'China seems intent . on putting down its footprint squarely in contested waters and force . Hanoi's hand,' he said. 'It appears a critical juncture has occurred and . one would expect Hanoi to be weighing its options. 'Hanoi's . back is against the wall, though China's policies - which according to . virtually everyone except China are baseless legally - have brought . about this situation.'

The Vietnamese and Chinese navies clashed again in 1988 in the disputed Spratly Islands, leaving 64 Vietnamese sailors dead. In 1992, China awarded a contract to U.S. energy company Crestone to explore for oil and gas in the Spratly Islands. Vietnam protested the move. Two years later, Vietnam's navy forced the company's oil rigs to leave the area.","Officials in Hanoi say several boats have been damaged and six sailors hurt .

"Lenovo has come under fire for selling laptops that come pre-installed with a 'horrifically dangerous' software named Superfish. The Chinese computer manufacturer says Superfish helps users find products online by analysing images and presenting similar, cheaper products. But security analysts claim that what Superfish actually does is serve intrusive ads, as well as compromise private information such as bank details and passwords. The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015 . The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015. And users have been raising concerns about Superfish since September . The biggest concern is that Superfish makes people vulnerable to something known as a 'man in the middle' attack. 'The way the Superfish functionality appears to work means that they must be intercepting traffic in order to insert the ads,' said Eric Rand, a researcher at Brown Hat Security. 'This amounts to a wiretap. Superfish adware breaks HTTPS – or encrypted - connections to serve up product information. Pictured is an example found by Twitter User Kenn White. This inadvertently opens up a back door to hackers . The software allows hackers to impersonate the security certificates of encrypted websites, allowing them to potentially see and steal private data. This is possible because the Superfish adware breaks HTTPS – or encrypted - connections to serve up product information. This inadvertently opens up a back door to hackers. The Superfish software appears to affect Internet Explorer and Google Chrome on the Lenovo laptops sold between September 2014 and January 2015. Users can find out if they are affected by looking at Windows' list of trusted certificates by opening up the Control Panel and searching for 'certificates'. If Superfish Inc is one of them, the computer may be vulnerable to attack. Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system. While the site visited appears secure, when its certificate is analysed it's shown to belong to Superfish, rather than the site visited. Anyone with the password that unlocks that certificate would be able to bypass the computer's web encryption. This morning, researchers found and published the password, meaning the software can now be used as a channel for attack . 'This means that hackers at your local cafe Wi-Fi hotspot, or the NSA eavesdropping on the internet, can use that private-key to likewise intercept all SSL [encrypted] connections from Superfish users,' Robert Graham of Errata Security told Forbes. He added this amounted to 'an egregious security failure…its intent is so that Superfish can 'hack' you, and it opens the system up to hacks by others.' Users can find out if they are affected by looking at Windows' list of trusted certificates by opening up the Control Panel and searching for 'certificates'. If Superfish Inc is one of them, the computer may be vulnerable to attack. In a statement earlier today, Lenovo said the company had 'thoroughly investigated this technology and [does] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns' Rather than simply uninstalling the programme, users are advised to back everything up on their systems and install a new operating system. A Lenovo community administrator, Mark Hopkins, wrote in January that the software would be temporarily removed from current systems. Writing for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Joseph Bonneau says the software is 'horrifically dangerous'. He added: 'Lenovo has not just injected ads in a wildly inappropriate manner, but engineered a massive security catastrophe for its users.' In a statement earlier today, Lenovo said the company had 'thoroughly investigated this technology and [does] not find any evidence to substantiate security concerns.' However, Superfish will no longer be pre-installed and has been disabled on all products in the market since January, when Lenovo also stopped pre-installing the software. Lenovo has not yet responded to DailyMail.com for comment. Concerns about cybersecurity have dogged Chinese firms, including telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd over ties to China's government and smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc over data privacy.

"At 302ft (92 metres), the Airlander 10 is the world’s longest aircraft. The part plane and part airship was first designed in 2010, but a series of budget cuts  left it sitting in hanger in Bedfordshire. Now, a £3.4 million ($5.25 million) grant from the UK government is set to get the giant ‘flying bum’ aircraft off ground next year. At 302ft (92 metres), the Airlander 10 is the world’s longest aircraft. The part plane and part airship was first designed in 2010, but a series of budget cuts and money woes have left it sitting in hanger in Bedfordshire. While the aircraft was originally designed for surveillance and reconnaissance by the US Army, the UK government is hoping to use it to transport cargo cheaply, according to The Verge. The ship, previously named HAV304, is capable of carrying around 20,000 pounds (nine tonnes) of cargo for up to five days at a time without landing. It is also 10 to 20 per cent cheaper than a helicopter to operate. The giant aircraft is currently being held at Cardington, UK, which in the only hangar big enough to accommodate the 113ft (34m) wide and 85ft (26m) high beast. The UK government's innovation agency has also enabled the company behind the ship, Hybrid Air Vehicles, to start a full engine test program, enabling it to double its staff in 2014.

The giant aircraft is currently being held at Cardington, UK, which in the only hangar big enough to accommodate the 113ft (34m) wide and 85ft (26m) high beast . Volume: 1,340,000 ft³ ( 38,000 m³) Length:  302 ft (92m) Width:    143 ft (43.5m) Height:   85 ft (26m) Endurance: 5 days manned Altitude: up to 20,000 ft (6,100 m) Speed:  92 mph (148 km/hr) Weight:  44,100 lbs (20,000 kg) Payload capacity: 22,050 lbs (10,000 kg) Last year, Bruce Dickinson, lead singer of Iron Maiden and a high-profile investor in the aircraft, compared the ship to Thunderbird 2 and described it as a 'game changer.' 'It will be able to cross the Atlantic and launch things right where they need to be,' he told Radio 4’s Today programme. 'It can reach about 100mph and stay airborne for about three-and-a-half weeks.' While it looks like giant airship, it has a unique aerodynamic shape that means it can also create lift just like an aeroplane wing. The cambered shape provides up to 40 per cent of the vehicle’s lift. Bruce Dickinson, the lead singer of the band Iron Maiden, sits at the controls on the flight deck of the helium-filled Airlander aircraft in a giant airship shed last year. The Airlander, which was originally developed for the US military before the project was cancelled due to budget cuts . At 300ft, the aircraft, originally called the HAV304, is longer than the biggest airliner, the Airbus A380, which is 239.5ft. It is also almost 30ft (8m) longer than the airlift cargo aircraft Antonov An-225, which was until now the longest aircraft ever built . This allowed engineers make the machine heavier than air, removing the need for crew to hang onto ropes to hold it down. A number of ballonets fore and aft in each of the hulls provide pressure control. The aircraft is powered by four 350 hp, four litre V8 direct injection, turbocharged diesel engines. Two engines mounted forward on the hull and two on the stern of the hull for cruise operation. The plan is that the Airlander 10 will eventually lead to the development of the Airlander 50, which would be able to transport 50 tonnes of freight. The huge aircraft combines the best of aeroplane, airship and helicopter design. HAV believes there could be a world market for between 600 and 1,000 of these aircraft.

For the time being, the company plans to produce around 10 a year for the next four or five years. This is expected to lead to the creation of 1,800 jobs in the Bedfordshire area. ‘The growing aerospace sector has the potential to generate thousands of new jobs and billions of pounds to the UK economy in contracts,’ business secretary Vince Cable said today. ‘That is why so much effort is being put in by government and industry to ensure we stay ahead of the competition and build on our strong position as second in the world for aerospace.’ He added: ‘As part our long-term industrial strategy we are jointly funding £2 billion of research and development into the next generation of quieter, more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly planes. ‘That includes backing projects like HAV's innovative low-carbon aircraft which can keep us at the cutting edge of new technology. Here is a British company that has the potential to lead the world in its field.’ The designers are planning an even bigger version that will eventually be able to carry 50 tonnes at a time .","Known as the Airland 10, aircraft is currently at hanger in Bedfordshire .

"Machines sold under Hotpoint, pictured above, and Indesit are being recalled of fears of an electrical fault which could lead to fires . Hotpoint is recalling hundreds of thousands of dishwashers over fears they are catching fire due to an electrical fault. The company said there had already been 18 'incidents' involving the overheating of faulty dishwashers which were sold under the Hotpoint and Indesit brands. The new recall, which involves machines mainly manufactured between 2008 and 2010, is separate from the 283,000 Hotpoint dishwashers which were previously recalled. In that incident, more than 844,000 dishwashers made by Hotpoint and Bosch were sold with an electrical component fault, which can lead to a blaze. The firm said customers who have registered their machines will receive a letter from the manufacturers explaining how to check if their dishwasher is one of those being recalled. But it is also urging customers to get in contact to arrange a visit by an engineer if the machine carries the model number FDW70, FDW75, FDW80 or FDW85A with a serial number between S/N 50401 and S/N 80531. The company said: 'As the leading white goods manufacturer, Indesit Company continually monitors the specification and performance of its products. 'As part of this ongoing process, we have identified that there is a low risk that a component fitted to a limited number of Hotpoint and Indesit dishwashers manufactured predominantly between January 2008 and July 2010 sold in the UK may cause overheating and in rare cases a potential fire hazard. 'This fault can be easily and quickly repaired by our qualified engineers who will visit affected customers’ premises and fit a newly manufactured component free of charge. 'We are currently in the process of directly contacting all the registered customers we have on our database as an owner of one of these appliances.' In May, an investigation found thousands of dishwashers remained unaccounted for following the separate safety recall. The dishwashers were sold under two brands - the Bosch Dishwasher FD 7901 to FD 8504 and the Hotpoint Dishwasher with serial numbers beginning DWF3 and DC26.

"Katherine Russell, the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsraneav, has a criminal record and is a confessed shoplifter, MailOnline can reveal. A police report obtained by MailOnline reveals that the 25-year-old Islamic convert was arrested in 2007 for stealing $67 worth of clothing from an Old Navy store in Warwick, Rhode Island. And in an intriguing twist, Russell, who was 18 at the time, told officers she was married though she was living at parent’s North Kingstown home and did not meet Tsranaev until some two years later. The startling revelation of this tawdry incident raises fresh questions over the past and character of the 'all-American girl' 'brainwashed' according to some, by her fanatic husband. Since her husband's death, Russell has been doing everything she can to distance herself from Tsarnaev . Katherine was arrested along with an unnamed female minor on 26 June 2007. Then, the police report states, she was 'skinny' with hazel eyes and red or auburn hair – now firmly concealed by the Hijab. She is described as unemployed and married. Old Navy store security guard Linda Lewis stopped the girls having watched Katherine and her companion enter the store, select several items and put them in their handbags. In 2011 Tamerlan’s mother, Zubeidat was charged with stealing several designer dresses worth $1600 from a store in suburban Natick. Katherine’s foray was hardly on the . same scale.  She took five items valuing $67; her friend took three with . a total item of $125. Family: Russell was 18 when she was arrested - before her future mother-in-law, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, right, was arrested for allegedly stealing $1,600 worth of goods from a different clothing store . Scene: She was allegedly caught stealing $67 worth of goods from this store in Warwick, Rhode Island . She was placed in handcuffs and taken to Warwick Police Department. According to the store Loss Prevention Agent Lewis: ‘They admitted to shoplifting the items and handed the over without further incident.’ Katherine was summonsed to appear at Kent County Courthouse where her charge was dismissed on paying a $200 fine and doing community service. That fall Katherine enrolled in a Communications course at Suffolk University, Boston, an act that led to her meeting Tsranaev in a nightclub and the relationship that would ultimately derail her college dreams completely. The revelation comes after it emerged . that  Tsarnaev displayed a disturbing pattern of verbal abuse and . violence toward women, including his wife, according to those who knew . him. Widow: Russell, the wife of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her family home with her lawyer Tuesday morning . Low profile: She reportedly spoke with investigators for the first time since the bombings on Tuesday . Close friends of his wife claimed that Tsarnaev, 26, was combative, angry and controlling. Russell . spoke to federal authorities for the first time on Tuesday, after she . was spotted leaving her Rhode Island family home with her lawyer and . three federal investigators. She returned home nearly four hours later . with her mother. Katherine Russell's lawyers released this statement on Tuesday morning at her request: . 'As you know from news reports, Katie married her husband in June of 2010. Since then, she has been living in Cambridge, raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves. 'Katie grew up in Rhode Island and has always remained close to her parents and sisters here, as well as her extended family. 'She is fortunate to have the support of her loving family now, as they, too, struggle to come to terms with these events and the deep sorrow we all feel following the events of last week. 'Meanwhile, she is doing everything she can to assist with the investigation. 'The injuries and loss of life - to people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family. 'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all. 'As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims - students, law enforcement, families and our community. In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events.' Afterwards, her lawyers released a statement at her request that claimed she has been 'doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.' 'The injuries and loss of life - to . people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound . distress and sorrow to Katie and her family,' the statement read. 'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.' Three of Russell's friends told . National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult . Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.' He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said. Russell's lawyer, Amato DeLuca, said she was a student at Suffolk University when she was introduced to Tsarnaev at a nightclub. He didn't specify the exact date that they met, though it's believed to be sometime during 2009. Tsarnaev was seeing another woman at the time, he said. 'They went out for a while, and then they stopped and then they went out again,' DeLuca said. It's possible the other woman that Tsarnaev was apparently dating was 25-year-old Nadine Ascencao of Brookline, Mass. Tsarnaev was arrested in July 2009 for allegedly slapping Ascencao, according to court records. Ascencao . was 'crying hysterically' and called 911 to report that she was 'beat . up by her boyfriend,' Cambridge Police Officer Angela . Pereira wrote in the arrest report. Tsarnaev told Pereira and another officer that his girlfriend 'was yelling at him because of another girl.' Asked whether he had hit Ascencao, Tsarnaev stated, 'Yes, I slapped her.' He specifically stated that he struck the left side of her face. Eleven months later, Tsarnaev was apparently no longer dating Aschencao. He had persuaded Russell to convert from Christianity to Islam and the couple married on June 21, 2010. Around the same time, Russell . became pregnant with Tsarnaev's baby. She . dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and . family. Rage: Tsarnaev was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture . Champ: In this Feb. 17, 2010, photo, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, accepts the trophy for winning the 2010 New England Golden Gloves Championship from Dr. Joseph Downes, right . Mary . Silberman, whose apartment backs up to Tsarnaev's Cambridge home, said she often heard loud arguments late at night that mostly . consisted of a woman's voice yelling at a man. 'It wasn't enough to call the police,' Silberman told Reuters. 'It didn't sound like anyone was in physical danger.' But the shouting was often loud enough to keep her awake at night. She could also hear the couple's daughter, Zahara, now three years old, wailing at night and she often wondered why the mother wasn't responding, she said. As the girl grew into a toddler, Silberman said she would see Zahara staring out the window. Since Tsarnaev's death, Russell has been staying with her family in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Her lawyer, Amato DeLuca, told CNN on Monday that the 24-year-old is 'very distraught' and 'cries a lot.' Regarding the bomb plot, DeLuca said, 'She knew nothing about it at any time.' 'The . whole family is a mess, to put it bluntly,' he said. 'They're very . distraught. They're upset. Their lives have been unalterably changed. They're upset because of what happened, the people that were injured, . that were killed. It's an awful, terrible thing.' Timeline: Sometime around 2008, Tsarnaev's erratic and violent behavior escalated as he stopped smoking and drinking and suddenly became heavily involved in Islam . Tsarnaev, who had appeared in surveillance photos wearing a black cap and was identified as Suspect No. 1, died days after the bombing . Russell works 70 to 80 hours a week as a home health aide, according to family members. Tsarnaev was unemployed. Judith Russell, the 24-year-old's mother, read an emotional statement to the media outside the timber-framed detached family home. ‘Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child,' she said. 'We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.’ She added: ‘In the aftermath of the Patriots’ Day horror, we now know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev.’","Katherine Russell arrested for shoplifting from Old Navy in 2007 .

"Father-of-six Tyree Landrum was driving to one of his three jobs when he came across a line of Ferguson protesters blocking the road in the middle of the San Diego rush hour. Furious that the demonstrators might make him late to work and risk him getting fired, he decided to get out of his car on the I-5 in La Jolla to confront the group of students. He then told a photographer for ABC News 10: 'If I don't get there, I'm going to get fired. I've got six f****** kids to feed.' Mr Landrum's reaction on Wednesday has since gone viral, and has drummed up support from hundreds on social media. Meanwhile demonstrations have continued across the country in the wake of the decision by a grand jury not to indict Darren Wilson who shot unarmed teen Michael Brown. Scroll down for video . Anger: Father-of-six Tyree Landrum shows his frustration as he arrives at a group of Ferguson protesters on the I-5 in San Diego who are making him late for work . Frustration: Hundreds of motorists were prevented from getting to their final destination because of the demonstration during the morning rush hour . Many other drivers around him shared his anger, including nurses in their scrubs en route the hospital, and got out of their cars. Mr Landrum then approached one protester standing with a bullhorn shouting: 'No justice, no peace.' He ripped the device from him and replied: 'Hey, I feel you; we ain't got no justice either.' A woman then shouted 'arrest them' before a unit of California Highway Patrol and San Diego police arrived at the scene - half an hour after the protest started. As officers began talking to them, one motorists said: 'You're spending the night in jail! That's right, you're spending the night in jail tonight.' Face-to-face: Mr Landrum, who works three jobs in a bid to provide for his six children, then walked up to the protesters to confront them . Tussle: At one point, Mr Landrum wrestles the bullhorn from one of the demonstrators . However they were not arrested because police said the protest was peaceful. Mr Landrum's rant to the protesters went viral on Facebook, with many people coming out in support. Reflecting on his actions, he said that he didn't consider himself a hero but an everyday person and regrets losing his temper. 'I'm nobody special, just doing what I thought was right,' he told the station. 'And then he put this bullhorn in my face, and I'm like get this bullhorn out of my face. At that point, I was confused, frustrated and completely angry.' Mr Landrum was late to work, however his boss reportedly understood the situation and did not take any action. Ryan Fusco, a total stranger, was taken back by what Mr Landrum with and decided to help his family. He started a YouCaring campaign to help him buy Christmas presents for each of his six children. Fusco told the station: 'He's obviously doing all he can to support his family. The sincerity, the passion, his willingness to stand up and do something really spoke to me.'

"Volunteer fire departments all across the U.S. could find themselves out of money and unable to operate unless Congress or the Obama Administration exempts them from the Affordable Care Act. 'I thought the kinks were worked out . of Obamacare at the first of the month,' Central Florida volunteer . firefighter Carl Fabrizi told Sunshine State News. 'Man, oh, man, this could potentially destroy some real good companies in Florida.' The U.S. Department of Labor takes the term 'volunteer' literally, but the IRS says volunteer firefighters are technically employees if they're on the job more than 30 hours per week, making them subject to Obamacare's employee-mandate rules. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Firefighters battled a blaze in the aftermath of a Nov. 18 tornado in Washington, Illinois. The vast majority of U.S. firefighters are community volunteers . Wildfires like this August 2013 disaster near Banning, California bring volunteer firefighters out of the woodwork to risk their lives . Since the Obamacare law doesn't specifically carve out an exemption for them, fire departments where 50 or more people work – either as volunteers or officially as employees – are expected to provide health insurance for every one of them. In towns with more than one volunteer fire department, all the staffers will likely be lumped together for tax purposes, pushing many municipalities above the 50-worker threshold. That could cost departments of life-savers hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Those that dump their volunteers into the federal insurance exchanges would still have to pay an annual $2,000 fine for each 'employee' after the first 30. 'I can tell you right now we can’t afford it,' East Derry, Pennsylvania Fire Company Chief Edward Mann told the Patriot-News. 'While a volunteer fire department may not have a payroll, the rest of it isn’t free. The only part that is free is the labor.' Mann's concerns are likely to get at least some attention in Washington: He's also the state fire commissioner in Pennsylvania, where 97 per cent of fire departments are fully or mostly staffed by volunteers. That's the highest percentage in the U.S. Employees? Volunteer firefighters count toward an employer's worker totals under the Affordable Care Act, since the law doesn't carve out a exception for them . 'A public safety disaster': Volunteer fire departments could close down unless the government exempts them from Obamacare . Nationally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reports that volunteer fire departments make up 71 per cent of America's 1 million firehouses. Another 16 per cent are 'mostly volunteer.' It's unclear how many of those departments involve at least 50 people, making the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act's latest unintended consequence difficult to calculate. But the International Association of Fire Chiefs has asked the Internal Revenue Service to let all volunteer departments off the hook. The federal government has taken no action so far. Firefighters in Buchanan, Wisconsin are mostly volunteers. They fought this house fire and put it out without a single injury . 'If the IRS classifies volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel as employees in their final rule, fire departments may be unintentionally forced to comply with requirements that could force them to curtail their emergency response activities or close entirely,' the organization said in a statement. A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement that the agency has 'received a number of comments concerning volunteer firefighters and other volunteers in response to proposed regulations issued last December.' 'We are taking those comments into account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer-responsibility provision' of the Affordable Care Act, the spokesperson said. But Bill White, a volunteer firefighter for 50 years and leader of the Dive Rescue Specialists in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, said an IRS rule that officially makes volunteers subject to Obamacare employer mandates would be a disaster. 'We're barely paying the bills that we have now,' he told the Scranton Times-Tribune . Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta fired off a letter to the IRS last week. 'Obamacare has raised more questions than it has answered,' Barletta said in a statement. 'First, are volunteer firefighters considered employees and therefore subject to the employer mandate under Obamacare? And second, how should volunteer time be counted to see if they’re working 30 hours?' Aftermath: On Dec. 4 a home in London Township, Mich. was reduced to cinders -- and volunteers kept the blaze from spreading to forests or other houses . Even big municipalities like Jersey City, New Jersey need volunteer firefighters. This November 27 fire destroyed a downtown store and damaged three others . 'Does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone? Does it include downtime at the station house? Listening to a scanner?' 'If Obamacare is the law of the land, then so is the law of unintended consequences,' he said, 'and there seems to be a lot of that going around these days. Just like the flu.' New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins had his own evaluation of the rule for the IRS, writing in a letter to Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel that it will produce 'a public safety disaster.'","The Affordable Care Act forces companies with more than 50 workers to buy them all health insurance or pay hefty fines .

"Painful: Sam Smith from Litherland,  Merseyside, who suffered second degree burns after spilling a McDonald's hot chocolate over her groin. She is pictured with all the dressings the hospital gave her . A 22-year-old woman has threated legal action against McDonalds after she spilled a cup of hot chocolate on her lap when she went for a drive-thru meal. Sam Smith, of Litherland, Merseyside, says she was so severely injured she may now require plastic surgery after the trip to the Switch Island branch of the global fast food firm. The estate agent suffered second-degree burns from the 85C drink and says going to the toilet is 'torture'. She claims the cup was over-filled, the lid was not attached correctly and the cup holder was not adequate to hold the two beverages. McDonalds is now investigating her claims. Ms Smith told the Liverpool Echo: 'They were too full, and there was a sharp bend and a speed bump in the drive-through, for some strange reason. 'I can't walk properly now, and shuffle around like a frog. Going to the toilet is excruciating.' The area affected is covered in blisters, even though her mother Alison immediately doused her daughter's lap with a bottle of water. Ms Smith had to be treated at a specialist burns hospital in nearby Whiston. She is now considering legal action against McDonalds. Her mother added that she is thinking of starting a campaign highlighting the dangers of hot drinks from drive-throughs. A spokesman for McDonald’s said: 'We are sorry to hear that Mrs Smith’s daughter sustained an injury following her visit to our drive-through restaurant and we hope she makes a speedy recovery. 'The safety and wellbeing of our customers and employees is our first priority and all of our restaurant crew are trained to serve hot drinks in a safe manner, with lids firmly secured. 'We have launched a full investigation and our customer services team will be in touch with Mrs Smith.' Ms Smith had to be treated at a specialist burns hospital in nearby Whiston after the incident at McDonald's Switch Island in Liverpool . Stella Liebeck, 79, suffered third-degree burns when she accidentally spilled hot coffee in her lap after buying it from a McDonald's restaurant in 1992. The grandmother was hospitalised for eight days while she underwent skin grafting, followed by two years of medical treatment. Although the case was presented as frivolous in media reports, it had important and long-lasting implications for civil law in the U.S. A jury awarded her $200,000 in damages, later reduced to $160,000 because it found she was 20 per cent at fault. It also awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The judge later reduced the punitive award to $480,000, even though he criticised McDonald's conduct. Since Liebeck's case, McDonald's has not reduced the service temperature of its coffee. McDonald's policy today is to serve coffee between 80–90C. Experts testified that coffee at that temperature, if spilled, causes third-degree burns in two to seven seconds. Typical at-home coffee machines brew their drinks at about 30 degrees lower. Ms Liebeck died at the age of 91 in 2004.","Sam Smith suffered excruciating injuries when the drink fell onto her .

"A brisk long walk is as good as a run for cutting the risk of heart disease, researchers say. This is because the most important factor is not intensity but the total energy used. In the first study of its kind, researchers found that walking briskly can lower the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes – all problems that can lead to heart disease – as much as running does. Walking can lower the risk of heart-related diseases just as much running, U.S. researchers have found . It had been thought that running was superior because runners travel further. But the benefits of both types of regular exercise were compared among 48,000 adults and found to be almost the same. So long as the energy used is similar, . the health boost is similar, says a report in the American Heart . Association journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology. Paul T Williams, of Lawrence Berkeley . National Laboratory in California, said the findings were surprising but . showed the key factor was the number of calories worked off in each . form of activity. ‘Walking and running provide an ideal test of the . health benefits... because they involve the same muscle groups and the . same activities performed at different intensities,’ he said. He estimates a person would need to . walk 4.3 miles at a brisk pace to have the same amount of exercise as . running 3 miles. It would take twice as long – around an hour and 15 . minutes instead of 38 minutes, he said. The six-year study analysed 33,060 runners and 15,045 walkers. When the same total energy was used . for moderate-intensity walking as for vigorous-intensity running, it . resulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high . cholesterol, diabetes and, possibly, coronary heart disease. Running was thought to be superior because runners travel further but research has found that is not the case . Unlike previous studies, the . researchers assessed walking and running by distance, not by time. Dr . Williams said: ‘The more the runners ran and the walkers walked, the . better off they were in health benefits. If the amount of energy . expended was the same between the two groups, then the health benefits . were comparable.’ Among runners, about half were men. Their average age was 48 for men and 41 for women. Of the walkers, only . 21 per cent were men. Average ages were 62 for men and 53 for women. The . walkers were more likely to be overweight and to smoke. The researchers found that runners’ risk of high blood pressure was reduced by 4.2 per cent, high . cholesterol by 4.3 per cent, diabetes by 12.1 per cent and coronary . heart disease by 4.5 per cent. Among walkers, the risk of high blood . pressure was cut by 7.2 per cent, high cholesterol by 7 per cent, . diabetes by 12.3 per cent and coronary heart disease by 9.3 per cent. But because of the different make-up of the two groups, the results are statistically equivalent, researchers say. Dr Williams said the snag is that runners often expend more energy than walkers – thus reaping more gains. ‘Walking may be a more sustainable activity for some people,’ he said. ‘However, those who choose running end . up exercising twice as much as those that choose walking. This is . probably because they can do twice as much in an hour.’ Official UK guidelines say people . should do 150 minutes of moderate, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise . every week – but three in four Britons fail to achieve this. Doireann Maddock, of the British Heart . Foundation, said the findings show ‘that any brisk physical activity, . not just those long, exhausting runs, can be great news for your heart . health. ‘We know the best type of activity for . your heart is moderate-intensity aerobic activity and that includes . walking –  as long as you feel warmer, breathe harder and your heart . beats faster than usual. ‘Whether it’s walking, jogging or . running, staying active will help control your weight, reduce blood . pressure and cholesterol, and improve your mental health.’","Researchers found walking is just as good as running in reducing risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes .

"A video that appears to show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier has been posted online in a horrific new propaganda stunt. The unverified clip, posted by a pro-government campaign group, claims to show a man - believed to be Abu Sakkar, the well-known founder of Homs' Farouq Brigade - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against President Bashar al Assad. Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.' He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite. It comes as David Cameron warned today he may still sanction military intervention in the war-torn nation amid growing evidence that Assad is using chemical weapons against his own people. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Scroll down for video. Horrific: The amateur video posted on the Internet on Sunday shows Khalid al Hamad, a founder of the rebel Farouq Brigade who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from Homs, cutting into the torso of a dead soldier . Remorseless: After removing what appears to be the dead man's heart, Al Hamad then reaches into the chest cavity . The video, posted on YouTube by and billed as proof of a war crime, is the latest . installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes . of this bloody conflict. Last month, a photograph was released . by a pro-Assad group based in Lebanon that appeared to show a young . rebel fighter barbecuing the severed head of a government soldier. Experts say such images demonstrate that the battlefield has spread from rubble-strewn streets and war-churned fields to the internet as both sides vie to control their . public image and discredit that of their opposition. Meanwhile, human rights groups say it is emblematic of a civil war that has rapidly descended into sectarian hatred and revenge killings. In the most recent video, Sakkar tells the camera: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog,' His rant is greeted by offscreen cheers of his comrades shouting 'Allahu akbar (God is great)'. Gory: Brandishing the organs for the camera to see, Sakkar continues his rant against Assad's government . Earlier this year another sickening video showed a rebel leader eating the heart of a captured soldier . PR war: The video, posted on YouTube by and billed as proof of a war crime, is the latest installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes of this bloody conflict . Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said that he had seen an original, unedited copy of the video and that Abu Sakkar's identity had been confirmed by rebel sources in Homs and by images of him in other videos wearing the same black jacket as in the latest clip and with the same rings on his fingers. 'The mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence,' said Bouckaert. He said that in the unedited version of the film, Abu Sakkar instructs his men to 'slaughter the Alawites and take their hearts out to eat them', before biting into the heart. Abu Sakkar has been seen in previous videos firing rockets at Lebanese Shi'ite villages on the border and posing with the body of a soldier purportedly from the Lebanese Shi'ite militant Hezbollah group, which is helping Assad's forces.

MailOnline cannot independently verify videos from Syria, where access is restricted by the government and security constraints. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister . David Cameron said on Monday he wasn't ruling out taking tougher action . against Syria over growing evidence it was using chemical weapons, . saying he planned to raise the matter with U.S. President Barack Obama. 'Certainly we haven't ruled out . stepping up action in response to what seems to be happening on the . ground,' Cameron told NPR radio. 'The evidence is growing; the lack of . room for doubt is shrinking, and I think this is extremely serious.' Cameron's comments came two days after he urged Russian . President Vladimir Putin to do more to stop the bloodshed in Syria, . after failing to make any major progress towards ending the two-year . conflict. Speaking at a . press conference in Sochi, the Prime Minister said: 'The history of . Syria is being written in the blood of her people. But . Mr Cameron’s visit to the Russian president's summer residence in the . Black Sea resort ended with an admission that they still have 'differing . views' about how to deal with the situation. Shaky start: David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanged pleasantries before a press conference today but failed to make real progress on resolving the Syrian conflict . Mr Cameron said Britain and Russia have 'differing views' on how to resolve the conflict . The UK is leading the argument to amend or lift restrictions to allow weapons to be passed to forces opposed to Bashar Assad's regime. But Russia has remained supportive of the Syrian government, with Mr Putin determined to defend the country's 'sovereignty'. The visit came as details emerged of Britain’s arguments in favour of lifting the arms embargo. Ahead . of his visit Mr Cameron said the atrocities in Syria ‘continue to . mount’ and growing evidence that the Asad regime has used chemical . weapons. He told MPs: . ‘There is a growing body of limited but persuasive information showing . that the regime has used, and continues to use, chemical weapons . including sarin. The room for doubt about that continues to diminish.’ The Syrian conflict started with . peaceful protests in March 2011, but when these were suppressed it . gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which, . according to one opposition monitoring group, has cost more than 80,000 . lives.

"There was no champagne celebration in the nightclubs of Tallinn for Estonian defender Artur Pikk on Sunday night, despite the fact he was making his first start for his country. The 21-year-old left back, who had to stop Jordan Henderson and Calum Chambers, had no time to contemplate a fine performance in which his team almost took a point off England as he is currently on national service and was due back in barracks at midnight. The Estonian army impose a strict curfew with no exceptions so Pikk had to head off immediately after the game to ensure he made it in time to his Tallinn army base. Artur Pikk was back in uniform in the post-match interview room ahead of his military service return . The 21-year-old full back was tasked with taking on Wayne Rooney and co before going back to barracks . Pikk had only played five minutes for his country as a substitute before last night but was chosen by Estonian manager Magnis Pehrsson, and fits in national service around playing for his club team, FC Levadia Tallinn. Meanwhile Pehrsson seemed unimpressed with England’s struggles to break down his team after the sending off of Estonian captain Ragnar Klavan just after half time. Pehrsson said: ‘I felt that England were not that dangerous. When they scored from the free kick, it felt like they should do more to win the game. 'It’s mixed emotions at the end really. I’m proud of my player who fought very hard. We stuck to out tactical plan very well but in football it’s all about the result.’ The FC Levadia Tallinn defender keeps an eye on Arsenal star Jack Wilshere as Estonia blunted England .

"The 99p music download could end after a tax crackdown on online retailers such as Amazon and Apple. The cheap one-click service - which has been credited as killing CD sales - has flourished under previous laws that allow retailers to pay minimal VAT. But now that loophole is being closed by George Osborne in a bid to raise £300million for Government coffers. The age of 99p downloads could soon draw to an end following a tax-crackdown on Amazon and Apple . A measure announced in last week’s Budget would force online companies to pay VAT in the UK. Currently Apple and Amazon sell their wares through Luxembourg, where the value added tax is levied at a meagre three per cent. But new rules coming into force in January would force them to fork out the full 20 per cent for any sales made into the UK. The law will apply to electronic books and smartphone applications and games as well. This could see songs currently sold at 99p being offered at £1.16 each - an increase of 17 per cent. The online price of thousands of other items are also expected to rise. George Osborne announced in the budget that he would rake in a further £300 million in tax - the bulk of which is expect to come from Google and Amazon . Government estimates published last week say the measure could rake in an additional £300million in tax revenues, with the bulk of the money expected to come from Apple’s iTunes store. Although the US giant never publishes a breakdown of its UK revenues, it is thought its music download service raked in sales of around £1billion last year. Tax dodging by US multinationals has become an increasingly political issue. The Chancellor last week pledged his ‘full support’ to international efforts to bring tax laws up to date to stop internet-based firms shifting profits into tax havens. ‘Public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago,’ Mr Osborne declared in his Budget speech. He set out a host of measures designed to prevent firms moving money between divisions to lower tax bills. In documents published alongside the Budget, the Government also promised to look at drawing up new laws that could be used to tax sales. Currently only profits are taxed. One document stated the new rules would ‘tackle specific issues raised by digitisation’. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountants Deloitte, said: ‘That would have to mean something like a tax on sales.’ The Daily Mail will also reveal today that online search company Yahoo has moved its tax base to Ireland. The company, as part of a major restructuring, has created a new holding company based in Ireland to run its European operations - including its UK arm. The company refused to say how the move would affect its tax payments in the UK, which were £437,000 on pre-tax profits of £1.5million during 2012, the most recent year for which figures are available. Firms such as Google and Amazon have been berated by MPs for orchestrating complex structures that see revenues filtered out of the UK and into overseas domains where rates are much lower. Google processes its sales in Ireland, and has also been slammed for funnelling money into notorious tax shelter Bermuda. Amazon claims that Luxembourg is the main hub of its European operations, even though the company employs 15,000 people in Britain compared to just 500 in the tiny Benelux state.","Measure announced in Budget will force online retailers to pay VAT .

"Wearing shorts, underpants, and in one case nothing at all, these villagers in China risked life and limb to catch fish for their dinner. Armed with nothing more than a few nets, bowls and their bare hands, the opportunistic fishermen walked away with some huge catches after the fish were washed from a reservoir. After days of heavy rain the . floodgates of the Tong-shan-yuan reservoir in Quzhou city opened automatically to drain off the surplus water, flushing out the fish with it. Scroll down for video . After days of excess rain in China's Quzhou city the reservoir's floodgates opened automatically to drain off millions of gallons of excess water, washing out hundreds of fish . Using nets, bowls and their bare hands, villagers grabbed as much as they could carry from the runoff water . Hundreds of villagers wearing shorts, . underpants, and in one case nothing at all (left) gathered in Quzhou . city, China, to catch fish washed out of a reservoir as it drained . Authorities allow the townsfolk to catch as much fish as they can carry away, but say they do so at their own risk after several people died in previous years . Along with millions of gallons of water came hundreds of fish which flopped straight into the arms of the waiting villagers. Shi Su, 46, was among the fishermen who gathered along the reservoir's runoff channel to make the most of the bonanza. 'You had to be careful and watch your footing but with a bowl, a net or even your hands it was easy to catch the biggest and best fish,' said Su. One fisherman said that villagers were usually lucky to eat fish once a week, but will now feast for months . In one day of fishing, it was estimated that 15,000lb of fish was caught, including carp, bream and trout . With no safety harnesses or life jackets men waded into the torrent of water in the hopes of catching fish . 'They were pouring out by the barrel-full , fat, juicy and fresh.' 'People would be lucky to eat fish once a week around here.  Now they are stocking the deep freeze compartments of their fridges with fish and will be munching on them for months to come.' In one water run-off day alone an estimated 15,000lbs of freshwater fish was caught, including carp, bream and trout. The huge floodgates on the reservoir opened automatically after days of rain in order to drain the surplus water . While some braved the rushing torrent of water to take their catch, others stayed on the relative safety of the bank and used long nets to reach into the stream . Now that's a fishing pole: Villagers try their hand at catching fish from the banks of a reservoir in China . Villagers set up nets, used poles, kitchen bowls and their bare hands in order to scoop up a prized catch . Lo Meng, 52, a local water authority official, said: 'It is entirely legal for citizens to take as much fish as they can carry, but the risks are entirely theirs. 'Several people in previous years have drowned when they toppled into the raging run-off water.' While some villagers waded into the rushing stream in order to take their prized catch, others waited on the relative safety of the bank and used long nets to catch the fish. Police officers in Quzhou city allow villagers to walk away with as much fish as they can carry . As well as hundreds of amateur fishermen, the event also attracted thousands of spectators . A woman armed with a fishing rod climbs away from the runoff channel after netting her catch for the day .

"You may only know of the Romanovs through watching ‘Anastasia’ but the Russian royal family owned some seriously stylish ornaments. To the Tsars of old, Easter eggs weren’t made of chocolate but were beautifully crafted Fabergé pieces with gold and precious stones. An exhibition of 240 Fabergé objects will be on display exclusively in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada, the largest collection outside of Russia from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. Intricate pieces: A Faberge egg  decorated with a portrait of Peter the Great was given by Tsar Nicholas II to his wife, made by Mikhail Perkhin in 1903 . The exhibition ‘Fabergé, Jeweller to the Tsars’, running from June 14 to October 5, will include four of the last 43 Fabergé eggs that were commissioned by the Romanovs. Carl Fabergé, who lived from 1846 to 1920, was a Russian jeweller whose name has become synonymous with these beautiful and ornate objects, as well as luxury jewellery. As well as showcasing his stunning works, the exhibition will explain the history and traditions of Orthodox Russia and the techniques of the House of Fabergé, which fell with the Tsarist regime. The jewelled and glittering exhibits include enamelled picture frames, gold jewellery encrusted with precious stones, miniature animals carved from precious stones, rock-crystal flower vases and silverware. Quite a nest egg: The Pelican Imperial Easter Egg is made of pink-gold, engraved with symbols of maths and science . Precious: The exhibition includes gold flowers a brooch made from gold, garnet, rubies and diamonds . The star pieces of the exhibition will be  a small hard-stone portrait of a sailor from the imperial yacht Zarnitsa, a rare portrait of Tsar Nicholas II in a column shaped frame, and a portrait of the Grand Duchess Tatiana, second daughter of the last Tsar, thought to be the last artefact of the imperial family before their tragic murder. Beautiful memory: A portrait of the Grand Duchess Tatiana, second daughter of the last Tsar . A taste of old Russia: A silver Russian kovsh - a traditional drinking vessel - is inlaid with amethysts and chrysopase . Dr. Géza von Habsburg, conservation director of the Fabergé Company based in London, said 'With its five imperial eggs, the Fabergé collection of the Virginia Museum of Art is the largest of its kind outside of Russia. 'Its eggs, four of which are travelling to Montreal, are some of the greatest masterpieces ever created by Fabergé, who was, according to connoisseurs, the world’s most famous goldsmith'. Made with love: This Loving Cup is made of silver and decorated with three traditional Russian scenes . Fabergé is best known for his mastery of enamelled decoration, and the exhibition will reveal the full extent of his productions, from cloisonné enamelled Russian goblets to Western decorated cigarette boxes, walking canes and photo frames. But his most famous legacy is his intricate eggs, mainly created for the Tsar of Russia, each containing a very special surprise inside. Mother of all easter eggs: Tsar Nicholas II gave this egg as a present to his mother the Dowager Empress  Maria Feodorovna . Good things comes in small packages: A silver rabbit and statuette of a sailor . One of the four eggs on display is the Tsarevitch imperial Easter egg, made in 1912 by master goldsmith Henrik Wigström. A present for the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, it consists of six sections of lapis lazuli decorated with golden two- headed eagles and splays of flowers, with a diamond monogram of the Russian letters AF. Inside is a miniature portrait of Tsarevitch Alexi, the son of Tsar Nicholas II and Alexandra . Famous legacy: Fabergé is best known for his mastery of enamelled decoration . A very special surprise: Inside the egg is portrait of Tsarevitch Alexi inside a two-headed eagle diamond frame . Tsarina Alexandra was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, making her an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II. Nathalie Bondil, the MMFA’s Director and Chief Curator, says “This first major exhibition on Fabergé to be shown in Canada is a unique opportunity to discover the splendour of the decorative arts of the House of Fabergé, whose fate was tragically linked to the history and fall of the imperial house of Russia in 1917. The jeweller’s symbolic significance and artistry still exert their fascination, from the dollar princesses of yesteryear to the oligarch tsars of today who collect them.’","Exhibition includes four beautiful eggs made for the Russian Tsars .

"The Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban after publicly criticising them has been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Malala Yousafzai, 15, was put forward by three Norwegian MPs, who praised her 'commitment so threatening to extremists that they tried to kill her'. Freddy de Ruiter, from the country's ruling Labor party, said her courage in speaking out, particularly on the subject of a girls' right to education, made her a worthy candidate. Scroll down for video . Courage: Malala Yousufzai is in a UK hospital having a final operation after she was shot in the head in October . Gorm Kjernli said on the party's website yesterday that the teenager had 'made ​​a strong impression on the whole world.' He added: 'She represents a younger generation that uses social media to reach out with their message about girls' right to equal opportunities.' Rare: Only 15 women have won the Nobel peace prize, including Mother Teresa (pictured) The three MPs have submitted their proposal to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Magne Rommetveit said Malala was now 'an important symbol in the struggle against the destructive forces that will prevent democracy, equality and human rights.' Malala was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman at point blank range . as she travelled home from school by bus on October 9. Her attacker boarded the vehicle in Pakistan's Swat Valley and asked for her by name before firing three shots at her in front of her horrified friends. She was singled out after writing a blog criticising the Islamist organisation. Malala was flown to a hospital in the UK a week later, and is now having a final major operation to place a titanium plate over the hole left in her skull. She has received thousands of messages from well-wishers around the world, and continued to speak out on behalf of her cause. The 15-year-old is now an . internationally recognised symbol of opposition to the Taliban's drive . to deny women education, and against religious extremism in a country . where women's rights are often flouted. Kristian Berg Harpviken, head . of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, said: 'A prize to Malala would not only be timely and fitting with a line of . awards to champions of human rights and democracy, but also... would set . both children and education on the peace and conflict agenda.' The nominations have not yet been . formally announced, but yesterday was the deadline for submissions. The . winner will be announced by the in early October. Nominations can be made only by a select group of people worldwide, and the foundation does not disclose the names of nominees until 50 years later, although those who name the candidates sometimes disclose them.

"These neon waves may look supernatural, but they are created by one of nature’s smallest creatures. Millions of plankton glowed like fireflies to light up a Welsh beach, enabling a photographer to capture this eerie spectacle. Scientists believe the phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction. A haunting spectacle: Millions of plankton were recently captured lighting up a Welsh beach, enabling a photographer to capture the rare and eerie spectacle (pictured). Scientists believe the phenomenon is the result of plankton being disturbed, causing them to emit light . Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton. The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light. Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction. Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways. Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat. Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators. Millipedes also glow to put predators off from eating them. Kris Williams caught the ghostly scene at Penmon on Anglesey's east coast where he watched the tiny organisms riding waves and being washed up on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the water. Williams, of Beaumaris, said the effect, called bioluminescence or cold light, looked like lightning in the water. ‘It’s always at twilight, which is around 11pm at this time of year. ‘It's more abundant in summer - I guess the warmer waters trigger it off and it's always been an electric blue - though of varying shades and intensity.’ The photographer said he had seen the glowing plankton around six times in the last 12 to 18 months at Penmon. ‘You tend to see it at high tide and you need a bit of movement to stir up the plankton,’ he said. ‘Some displays are stronger than others but it's incredible to watch. Some friends of mine came down to swim in it last weekend - to get themselves lit up in the water - it was great fun.’ Williams . said that sometimes the effect only affects a small area of water, . while other times it stretches all along the coast. ‘When . the waves break it almost looks like a lightning storm in the wave. When you walk on the pebbles at the water's edge, the pebbles light up. ‘You could put your hand in the water and watch it light up, then see the glowing particles slipping through your fingers.’ Dr Andy Davies, a marine biologist at . Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, explained: ‘The light is . created by small organisms called plankton, which are producing this . light through a complex chemical reaction. Riding waves: Kris Williams caught the ghostly scene at Penmon on Anglesey's east coast where he watched the tiny organisms, riding waves (pictured) and being washed up on the beach, to create dazzling patterns in the water . ‘This whole process is known as bioluminescence. Many organisms use very similar methods to produce light, including fish, jellyfish, squid and even fireflies. ‘It's an example of how organisms have evolved complex responses to external stimulus. Dr . Davies said he had seen bioluminescence only twice in five years, but . said that late spring and early summer are the best times to see the . phenomenon. Bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals, especially in the open sea and in insects. ‘Most . marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the . wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater,’ he said. ‘However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light. ‘Sometimes . thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of . bioluminescent bacteria in the Milky seas effect to watch.’ Lightning bolt moment: Williams said the effect (pictured) called bioluminescence or cold light, looked like lightning in the water. He added that the phenomenon is seen at twilight at this time of year and is more abundant in the summer - perhaps because the water is slightly warmer . An eerie view: Marine Biologist Andy Davies said 'the light is created by small organisms called plankton, which are producing this light through a complex chemical reaction. This whole process is known as bioluminescence. Many organisms use very similar methods to produce light, including fish, jellyfish, squid and even fireflies.'

"Baroness Thatcher’s death unleashed a wave of vitriol and hatred from the Left. The first of several planned ‘Thatcher death parties’ across the country began last night with more than 200 revellers gathering in Brixton, south London. They danced the conga, drank champagne and chanted: ‘Maggie, Maggie, Maggie – Dead, Dead, Dead.’ Happy: A woman drinks from a bottle and holds a front page of a newspaper displaying an image of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as she and others celebrate her death in Brixton, south London . Happy: In south London attendees were carrying banners, with one saying: 'Rejoice, Thatcher is dead' Street party: People celebrate the death of Baroness Thatcher in Brixton, south London . Banners were held stating ‘Rejoice . Thatcher is dead’ by drunken crowds, many of whom were too young to . remember her as prime minister. Similar disgraceful scenes were . witnessed in Glasgow and further ‘parties’ were planned in Bristol, . Liverpool, Newcastle and Manchester. Sickening messages also began flooding the internet minutes after the official announcement. And at a National Union of Students . conference in Sheffield some delegates cheered and applauded when . informed of the former prime minister’s death. Macabre celebrations: Champagne was flowing tonight as the Left took to the streets to celebrate the death of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Jolly affair: The hastily organsied party saw revellers holding signs reading 'Gotcha! Now get the rest' Dancing to the beat: They did an impromptu Highland Fling on the pavements of Glasgow - although it was condemned by the city council . Getting underway: As the party got underway revellers handed out party balloons to help the celebrations . Cause: Revellers said they were 'here to celebrate the death of a woman with blood on her hands  for the Falklands and miners' Eighties Trotskyist firebrand Derek . Hatton, a sworn political enemy of Mrs Thatcher from his days as deputy . leader of Liverpool City Council, sent one particularly vile message. He tweeted: ‘The issue isn’t about . whether she is now dead, I regret for the sake of millions of people . that she was ever born.’ Former London Mayor and Labour MP Ken . Livingstone claimed that ‘almost everything that’s wrong with Britain . today is her legacy’. He added: ‘She created today’s housing crisis, she produced the banking crisis, she created the benefits crisis.’ Chris Kitchen, general secretary of . the National Union of Mineworkers, said: ‘We’ve been waiting for a long . time to hear the news of Baroness Thatcher’s demise and I can’t say I’m . sorry. I will not be shedding a tear for her.’ Eighties Trotskyist firebrand Derek Hatton, left, tweeted his wish that Baroness Thatcher had not been born. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone said . today her policies were 'fundamentally wrong' Paul Kenny, general secretary of the . GMB union, said: ‘Mrs Thatcher will be remembered by many for the . destructive and divisive policies she reigned over which in the end, . even in the Tory Party, proved to be her downfall. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams gave a scathing assessment of Baroness Thatcher’s political legacy in Northern Ireland. Margaret Thatcher had been the IRA’s Number One target – narrowly escaping its devastating 1984 bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton. Adams, whose voice together with those of fellow Sinn Fein representatives was subject to a broadcast ban during the Troubles, hit out at both her role in Ireland and beyond. ‘Margaret Thatcher did great hurt to the Irish and British people during her time as prime minister,’ he said. ‘Her legacy involves the destruction . of communities, the elevation of personal greed over social values and . legitimising the exploitation of the weak by the strong.’ Labour shadow pensions minister Gregg . McClymont came under fire for ‘condoning’ an inflammatory tweet about . the former Conservative prime minister. He was accused of being ‘extremely . foolish’ when he described a university student’s political views as . ‘spot-on’ following a reference to Lady Thatcher a ‘f***** witch’. Peter Taaffe, the Socialist Party . general secretary, said Lady Thatcher was ‘seen by many as a kind of . modern-day Genghis Khan’. Music star Morrissey, a long-time critic, berated her as ‘barbaric’ and ‘without an atom of humanity’. Comedians were also quick to add to the insensitive tirade against the former PM. Comedian Frankie Boyle, referring to . IRA hunger strikers, tweeted: ‘Booby [sic] Sands ghost just appeared to . me, trying to start a conga’, and added: ‘Thatcher being dead is a lot . less tragic than Cameron being alive.’ Disrespectful: Comedian Frankie Boyle tweeted . 'Terrible news about Thatcher' and linked to the YouTube video . 'Celebrate good times come on!' Disrespectful: Comedian Frankie Boyle's controversial tweet . The Scottish parliament caused outrage by refusing to mark Baroness Thatcher’s death by flying its flags at half mast. At Holyrood, the Saltire, the Union flag and the European Union flag all remained at full mast outside the public entrance, as did the Saltire in front of the government’s nearby St Andrew’s House headquarters. Parliament bosses said flags will be flown at half-mast only on the day of Lady Thatcher’s funeral, in line with existing policies. A Tory source said: ‘This is an insult by Holyrood and government bosses.’ Boyle later added: ‘Finally I get to . wear my black suit and tap shoes together’ and ‘I’m not sure that . Margaret Thatcher got many women into politics, in the same way that . Myra Hindley didn’t get a lot of women into hiking’. TV presenter and stand-up comedian . Terry Christian tweeted: ‘State funeral would be an insult to the . millions who suffered and the social chaos of gangs, homelessness and . hopelessness she brought.’ Footballer Joey Barton tweeted: ‘If heaven exists that old witch won’t be there.’ Dozens of students tweeted their . distaste after delegates at the National Union of Students’ conference . cheered and applauded when Baroness Thatcher’s death was announced at . Sheffield City Hall. NUS President Liam Burns made a statement a few minutes later, urging the 1,000 delegates to show ‘sensitivity’. Anti: Some of the top anti-Thatcher photos which were trending on Twitter today after news of her death broke . Comedian and TV presenter Patrick Kielty tweeted: 'RIP Margaeret Thatcher - her final wish was to be cremated but we've no coal left' Timely: Less than an hour after her death was made public, a book entitled Thatcher Tributes with a witch on the front was on sale . When former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell . wrote a positive tribute to the ‘First Lady of girl power’ on Twitter . she received so much abuse she felt the need to delete it. She later . tweeted to her 203,000 followers: ‘I’m sorry if I offended u. X’ Former Tory MP Louise Mensch was one . of several people who responded to the negative Twitter reaction, . writing: ‘Pygmies of the left so predictably embarrassing yourselves, . know this: not a one of your leaders will ever be globally mourned like . her.’ Millionaire businessman Lord Sugar – . who was one of the first to pay tribute – similarly took issue with . those who objected to his comments. He wrote: ‘Some of the despicable scum . tweeting foul mouth comments on my Baroness Thatcher tweet, were still . drinking milk from a teat in the 80’s.’ A website set up three years ago asking ‘Is Margaret Thatcher Dead yet?’ was updated yesterday – with the word ‘YES’. It ran the slogan ‘Margaret Thatcher . is dead. This lady’s not returning,’ and encouraged people to host . parties, publishing a music playlist including Ding Dong! The Witch Is . Dead from The Wizard Of Oz. Distasteful: A website set up three years ago asking 'Is Margaret Thatcher Dead Yet?' was today updated for the first time - with the word 'YES' Within an hour of her death being . announced, nearly 155,000 people had ‘liked’ the page on Facebook, . 12,500 people had tweeted about it and an internet campaign launched . urging people to download the song and make it No.1 in the charts.

"A mother whose face was hideously deformed by acid sprayed by her married lover appeared in court today and accused him of 'turning me into a monster'. Speaking on the first day of Richard Remes's trial for attempted murder in Belgium, Patricia Lefranc said she was 'determined to look him in the eye and show the jury what he has done to me'. The 48-year-old, who underwent 86 operations following the attack, added: 'I hope to convince the court that he did indeed want to murder me.' Before and after: Patricia Lefranc was seriously disfigured in the attack allegedly carried out by her ex-lover . Richard Remes insisted that he didn't realise the sulphuric acid would have such devastating consequences . Remes, 57, is said to have planned the sulphuric acid attack after Ms Lefranc ended their relationship just over two years ago. Ms Lefranc told Brussels Assizes that December 1, 2009 was the day Remes 'finally destroyed my life.' She said he was waiting for her as she emerged from a lift in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. He sprayed the sulphuric acid, once referred to as 'oil of vitriol' by medieval European alchemists, all over her head and upper body, she told the court. She said she was convinced she would die, but neighbours in a nearby building heard her screams and managed to get her to the burns unit of a nearby hospital, where she lay in a coma for three months. Ms Lefranc said: 'I hope Remes is convicted of attempted murder, and not just for assault and battery with torture. He did not just want to hurt me, he wanted me out of the way. I just hope that I get to tell the court what I experienced, and how it hurt. Trial: Patricia Lefranc (right) pictured arriving at a Brussels court with lawyer Daniel Spreutels (left) for Richard Remes's trial . Accused: Richard Remes (top) talks with his lawyers on the first day of his trial . 'I would also appeal to his wife. She . paints me as a manipulator who hooked  her husband. I think that's an . insult - a dagger in my back. 'He made the first step in starting a relationship, and I had to bring it to a close. Let's reverse the roles, but don't tell me how seriously he should be punished. 'I leave that to the court, but while working out the punishment don't lose sight of the fact that he condemned me to pain, both physical and psychological, for life.' Ms Lefranc said her son’s school friends now regularly mock her appearance, adding: 'Remes has also ruined my life as a woman. Who once to deal with the monster that he made me? 'I'm stared at on the street. Worse, I'm used as an example of what can happen to a woman who wants to put an end to a love affair.' A 22-year-old woman is said to have been threatened by a boyfriend who said: 'Remember what happened to Patricia Lefranc?', said Ms Lefranc. As well as psychological torture, Ms . Lefranc said she was in constant physical pain, and all of it reminded . her of the horror of the attack. Brave: Patricia Lefranc (right) with her lawyer Daniel Spreutels (left) said her former lover 'destroyed her life' She said: 'When I look in the mirror, every fibre of my body reminds me of what happened. The doctors had me in an artificial coma for months. 'I lost the sight in my left eye, and hearing in an ear - my right ring finger was amputated. By the time I got to my eightieth operation, I stopped counting. 'But I know that I still have about twenty operations to go. The acid which he maimed me, is worse than a weapon of war.  It still gnaws at me. 'My nose is quietly shrinking away and will eventually be replaced by a prosthesis. That will be the last and perhaps most difficult surgery. 'For three months I will have to wear a mask to hide the gaping hole in the middle of my face. Only then can the final prosthesis be implanted. 'That mask must be removed daily for cleaning. No, I will not handle that - a nurse will be doing it.' Remes has apologised for the attack, denying that he meant to maim her. His defence is that he did not realise the sulphuric acid he sprayed would have such a devastating effect. Remes told the court how he started his relationship with Lefranc, who was the janitor of their block of flats, in 2009. He said: 'I moved with my wife and children to the building on Avenue Sippelberg in 2006. Patricia was already living there. She was a janitor. At first we just said hello, that's all. 'Then her relationship with her ex boyfriend ended. And, in late 2008, she asked me two or three time to do small jobs in her house that she could not do herself. 'One day, at the beginning of 2009, I offered to go for coffee. We went to a hotel and our relationship began.' The case continues.","Patricia Lefranc, 48, left disfigured after sulphuric acid attack .

"Some of the IRA’s most notorious terrorists have become multi-millionaires by flooding mainland Britain with illegal cigarettes. Fifteen years after the Good Friday Agreement paved the way for their release from prison, terrorists who once plotted carnage in the UK are supplying tens of millions of cheaply made and potentially lethal cigarettes on the black market. The cigarettes originate from the Far East and are made of second-hand tobacco and even waste. Under investigation:  Brian Arthurs, 48, previously named as a member of the IRA’s ruling Army Council, is believed to be involved in the racket alongside convicted terrorist and cigarette smuggler Aidan Grew, 57 . They are packaged as recognised brands and sold at a cheaper price – depriving the taxman of billions of pounds in lost revenue. Details of the racket – which helps fund terrorism – emerged as a watchdog report said HM Revenue and Customs had failed to meet any of its targets on reducing the smuggling of illicit tobacco into the UK. Senior Gardai and Customs officers in Ireland told the Mail that leading figures in the dissident republican terror group the Real IRA are being investigated on suspicion of masterminding a global smuggling operation in cigarettes. They said that between 150million and 200million of its smuggled cigarettes end up in Britain each year, generating annual profits of up to £80million. Fake cigarettes: Suppliers in China employ ¿workers¿ to collect cigarette butts from rubbish bins and recycle the contents into new cigarettes . HMRC estimates that in 2010-11 alone, . duty was not paid on 9 per cent of cigarettes and 38 per cent of . hand-rolling tobacco smoked in the UK at a cost of £1.9billion in lost . taxes. Industry sources say . the lost revenue for 2012 will be up to £1billion more (£2.9billion), . after accountants KPMG said there was a 63 per cent increase in the . illicit cigarette trade last year. Suppliers in China employ ‘workers’ to collect cigarette butts from rubbish bins and recycle the contents into cigarettes for export through Eastern Europe, Greece and Italy. From there they find their way to Holland or Spain and then on to Ireland and the UK. They are sold by unscrupulous newsagents and on the streets throughout the UK. The man who is being investigated over masterminding the cigarette smuggling is Brian Arthurs, 48, previously named as a member of the IRA’s ruling Army Council. He was jailed for 25 years in 1995 for possession of explosives. Senior law enforcement sources say they are considering intelligence that Arthurs, once a commander of the IRA’s notorious East Tyrone Brigade, runs the operation with a convicted terrorist and cigarette smuggler called Aidan Grew, 57. Both men deny the allegations. In January, Arthurs admitted more than £250,000 of mortgage fraud at Belfast Crown Court. But controversially, he was given a two-year suspended prison sentence after being deemed not to be a threat to the public. Terrorist Grew got 15 years in the mid-1980s for a landmine attack on loyalists. He was also jailed for three years, suspended for two, in 2011 for failing to pay a £500,000 confiscation order relating to millions of contraband cigarettes. He had pleaded guilty in 2008 to evading duty. Probe: Senior Gardai told the Mail that leading figures in the dissident republican terror group the Real IRA are being investigated on suspicion of masterminding a global smuggling operation in cigarettes . Last month David Cameron blocked attempts to have all cigarettes in Britain sold in plain packets partly because it would further enrich republican terrorists. But despite the PM’s decision, new European laws, which Britain will be forced to adopt, could make Real IRA smugglers like Grew even richer and cost taxpayers billions more every year. The Tobacco Products Directive, which is currently being pushed through the European Parliament, will mean all cigarettes in Europe being sold in identical plain packaging and will ban menthol cigarettes completely. Britain will be forced to adopt the EU Directive or face huge rolling fines from Brussels for not implementing it. ‘These new laws are a fundraising charter for dissident republicans,’ said a security source who has spent his career battling the IRA. ‘Banning these products will give smugglers a huge and instant increase in the size of their black market at the expense of ordinary British taxpayers.’ Ex Ulster deputy chief constable Alan McQuillan told the Mail: ‘Cigarette smuggling is almost a Cinderella crime. There are few law enforcement agencies really focusing on it. The profits can be higher than drug smuggling and the penalties are far smaller. ‘Counterfeit cigarettes are often made in unhygienic underground factories where they can be contaminated with anything from rat droppings to polonium. ‘On every level this is a crime  that damages the public purse, funds terrorism and crime and damages health.’ ■ Gillingham in Kent is thought to be one of the worst places for selling illicit cigarettes. A BBC survey found more than 50 per cent of empty packets – which came from Poland, Lithuania and Belarus – were either smuggled or fake.","The illicit smokes are believed to be made in China from recycled stubs .

"For most people, the incredibly realistic graphics are the key to enjoying video games. However, one dedicated player has become a gaming whizz - despite being blind. Ben Breen, a 19-year-old from Meopham in Kent, was born four months early, and as a result, was left blind from birth. Incredible: Ben has spent hours teaching himself the precise combinations for Rock Band games . Where most computer games represent . ‘down time’ or a means of relaxation, for Ben, mastering a game requires . intense concentration - combining muscle memory with incredibly precise . timing to make up for a lack of visual cues. 'In . Rock Band (where the player has to press sequences of coloured keys to . music) I would sit for around 2 hours at a time, meticulously working on . the muscle memory required to play the complex patterns,' he said. 'Eventually, I . was able to play some of the hardest songs in the game, including Dream . Theatre's Panic Attack. Despite this, he achieved strong GCSEs from Dartford Grammar school and an international baccalaureate degree. However, he says it was his introduction to video games that really changed his life. 'At first, I simply enjoyed the sounds of music, and when I discovered I could actually play certain games a few years later, it was amazing,' he said. 'I went for a computer taster day at the Kent Association for the Blind, but whilst others were playing games like Unreal Tournament, I was introduced to a great title called Grizzly Gulch Western Extravaganza. 'This was a simple sound-oriented 4-key adventure game aimed specifically at blind gamers, but for the time, it was revolutionary. 'I was so hooked by this Wild West epic that I bought it the next day. 'I began to learn how to use a computer with screen-reading software and from then on I was able to download all the demos I wanted and buy my own games. I turned to the Wii and tried tennis and realized that if my timing was within a certain window, I could return the ball without any major difficulty.' Where most computer games represent ‘down time’ or a means of relaxation, for Ben, mastering a game requires intense concentration - combining muscle memory with incredibly-precise timing to make up for a lack of visual cues. 'In Rock Band (where the player has to press sequences of coloured keys to music) I would sit for around 2 hours at a time, meticulously working on the muscle memory required to play the complex patterns. Eventually, I was able to play some of the hardest songs in the game, including Dream Theatre's Panic Attack. 'As for my favourite game, it would probably have to be Mortal Kombat Deception for Playstation 2, and for next-generation consoles, it would probably be Rock Band.’ Although there remains but a handful of games dedicated to the blind or visually impaired player, Ben has not let his condition stop him from enjoying the fruits of the mainstream, and even completing some of the most technically challenging titles around - using his disability to his advantage - especially in the Beat -em-up genre. Challenging: Renowned as a difficult game on the hardest settings, Rock Band relies the player to press keys on an 'instrument controller' that correspondent to the visual cues. Ben can play the game and complete the levels without needing to see these cues. ‘I have completed a few story modes, Soulcalibur V and Mortal Kombat 9's to name two. I can also beat my friends consistently at Rock Band, since I’m not distracted by the flashy graphics!’ he jokes. 'I play games with sound alone, which is a lot of fun to show sighted people. I don't let my condition stop me playing a game, and if I have to get sighted friends help to play a 3D game like Duke Nukem ( a first-person shooter), then I will, as I love not only playing competitively, but also blowing things up! 'I urge any gamers who are blind or visually impaired to look into all the equipment options available and see what’s right for them, in terms of situation, price tag and usability. 'I think that blind gamers should try, particularly with music based games, with the normal peripherals and then if they want or need adaptations, alternatives should be available.’ Happy: . Gaming has given Ben a new aspect to his life, and he vows to keep . searching for games that blind people can play and enjoy. Unfortunately, inspirational figures are few and far between in the blind gaming community, but Ben points to a couple gamers who gave him the belief that the world of video games wasn't just for sighted to enjoy. 'The blind gamer who inspires me the most is probably a friend of mine by the name of Clement Chou, as he has studied games in so much depth that he knows the mechanics better than most.  As for the greatest blind gaming achievement that I am aware of... well...That’s difficult. 'A blind gamer who I have had the fortune to meet in person, by the name of Aaron, has managed to play Lost World Arcade and survive for a lengthy period of time. 'Additionally though, I do know that Yohandi, an American gamer, with no sighted help, has completed the Mortal Kombat Challenge Tower... all 300 missions.’ But for Ben, the industry needs to do more to support the visually impaired community. He believes the same energy they put into graphical prowess should be put into the development of games taht are accessible and enjoyable for both blind and sighted gamers alike. Mortal Kombat-Deception, Ben's favourite game. He says he can beat many of his sighted friends simply by recognising the sounds characters and moves in the game produce . Muscle memory is a type of memory that is 'taught' through repetition - such as riding a bicycle, typing and playing a musical instrument. When a movement is repeated over time, a long-term muscle memory is created for that task, eventually allowing it to be performed without conscious effort. This process decreases the need for attention and creates maximum efficiency within the motor and memory systems. 'The gaming industry needs to support more visually impaired gamers, definitely.  We aren't getting much help from other communities as well - certain gaming sites just don't seem to appreciate that blind people can play games. 'Also, the developers aren't making things like high-contrast colours a priority. 'A universal way for developers to help us is possibly have an accessibility mode implemented, whereby things like locking tones in shooters, or stereo panning in racing games to show where your car is are added. 'However, these would be designed to make the game no easier than it is for anyone else. Also, spoken tutorials would be extremely useful for sighted and blind players alike, since if executed correctly they are invaluable in improving strategy, ability or general understanding.’ There is, however, one piece of hardware that Ben would like to see created in the coming years. ‘It is simply a glove, or rather a pair,' he explains. ‘When the gloves are recognised by the Xbox 360 Kinect, if the players' hand is over an option, a small sensor in the palm will vibrate to tell them so. 'Then the option would be spoken by a synthesizer built into the firmware of the Xbox. 'This technology could then be adapted into light guns. 'It would be great as a tool for navigating without the controller.' At the moment, the thought of such a device is nothing more than a dream. But given how far technology has advanced, it is only a matter of time before developers listen to the blind community and make this a reality. For now at least, the wait gives Ben all the more time to practice. And to continue beating his sighted friends at their own game.

"Healers in Peru carried out cranial surgery more than a thousand years ago to treat a host of conditions - often successfully. Without the benefits of a sterile operating theatre, state-of-the-art surgical instruments, anaesthetic and pain medication, the ancient people of the South American country undertook a surgical procedure that involves removing a section of the skull using a hand drill or a scraping tool - a practice called trepanation. It was used to treat a variety of ailments, mainly head injuries but even, bizarrely, a broken heart. Gruesome: Some 900 years ago, Peruvian healers used hand drills to make dozens of small holes in a patient's skull . Excavating burial caves in the south-central Andean province of Andahuaylas in Peru, University of California bioarchaeologist Danielle Kurin and her research team unearthed the remains of 32 individuals that date back to the Late Intermediate Period (around AD 1000-1250). Among them, 45 separate trepanation procedures were in evidence. 'When you get a knock on the head that causes your brain to swell dangerously, or you have some kind of neurological, spiritual or psychosomatic illness, drilling a hole in the head becomes a reasonable thing to do,' said Kurin, a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at UC Santa Barbera and a specialist in forensic anthropology. According to Kurin, trepanations first appeared in the south-central Andean highlands during the Early Intermediate Period (circa AD 200-600), although the technique was not universally practised. Still, it was considered a viable medical procedure until the Spanish put a halt to the practice in the early 16th century. New bone growth at the trepanation site on the side of the head indicates a successful procedure. However, the holes drilled at the top of the skull were as the individual was dying or shortly after he died . But Kurin, whose findings appear in the current issue of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, wanted to know how trepanation came to exist in the first place and looked to a failed empire to find some answers. 'For about 400 years, from 600 to 1000 AD, the area where I work — the Andahuaylas — was living as a prosperous province within an enigmatic empire known as the Wari,' she said. 'For reasons still unknown, the empire suddenly collapsed.' And the collapse of civilisation, she drily noted, brings a lot of problems. 'But it is precisely during times of collapse that we see people's resilience and moxie coming to the fore,' Kurin continued. 'In the same way that new types of bullet wounds from the Civil War resulted in the development of better glass eyes, the same way IED's are propelling research in prosthetics in the military today, so, too, did these people in Peru employ trepanation to cope with new challenges like violence, disease and depravation 1,000 years ago.' A Peruvian actress impersonates an ancient female warrior in this file picture. Trepanning was common in the mysterious Wari culture . Danielle Kurin says the procedure was used to treat a variety of ailments, mainly head injuries . Kurin's research shows various cutting practices and techniques being employed by practitioners around the same time. Some used scraping, others used cutting and still others made use of a hand drill. 'It looks like they were trying different techniques, the same way we might try new medical procedures today,' she said. 'They're experimenting with different ways of cutting into the skull.' For about 400 years, from 600 to 1000 AD, an enigmatic empire known as the Wari were living in Andahuaylas in Peru . Sometimes they were successful and the patient recovered, and sometimes things didn't go so well. 'We can tell a trepanation is healed because we see these finger-like projections of bone that are growing,' Kurin explained. 'We have several cases where someone suffered a head fracture and were treated with the surgery; in many cases, both the original wound and the trepanation healed.' Trepanning involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull, and it has been performed since prehistoric times. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, headaches and mental disorders. The oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in France dating back to 6,500BC. But it was also used by the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Romans, Greeks and the early Mesoamerican civilizations. Even the 'father of medicine' Hippocrates (pictured) advocated the process in his 400BC tome 'On Injuries of the Head'. Modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain, increasing lucidity and heightening brain function. It could take several years for the bone to regrow, and in a subset of those, a trepanation hole in the patient's head might remain for the rest of his life, thereby conferring upon him a new 'survivor' identity. When a patient didn't survive, his skull (almost never hers, as the practice of trepanation on women and children was forbidden in this region) might have been donated to science, so to speak, and used for education purposes. 'The idea with this surgery is to go all the way through the bone, but not touch the brain,' said Kurin. 'That takes incredible skill and practice. 'As bioarchaeologists, we can tell that they're experimenting on recently dead bodies because we can measure the location and depths of the holes they're drilling,' she continued. 'In one example, each hole is drilled a little deeper than the last. So you can imagine a guy in his prehistoric Peruvian medical school practicing with his hand drill to know how many times he needs to turn it to nimbly and accurately penetrate the thickness of a skull.' Some might consider drilling a hole in someone's head a form of torture, but Kurin doesn't perceive it as such. 'We can see where the trepanations are. We can see that they're shaving the hair. We see the black smudge of an herbal remedy they put over the wound,' she noted. 'To me, those are signs that the intention was to save the life of the sick or injured individual.' But thanks to Kurin's careful archaeological excavation of intact tombs and methodical analysis of the human skeletons and mummies buried therein, she knows exactly where, when and how the remains she found were buried, as well as who and what was buried with them. She used radiocarbon dating and insect casings to determine how long the bodies were left out before they skeletonised or were mummified, and multi-isotopic testing to reconstruct what they ate and where they were born. 'That gives us a lot more information,"" she said. 'These ancient people can't speak to us directly, but they do give us information that allows us to reconstruct some aspect of their lives and their deaths and even what happened after they died,' she continued. 'Importantly, we shouldn't look at a state of collapse as the beginning of a ""dark age"", but rather view it as an era that breeds resilience and foments stunning innovation within the population.'","People of the Wari culture used 'trepanning' - where the skull is cut into .

Painful: Dionne Baxter from Purfleet in Essex was left badly burned after falling asleep on her iPhone 4 . 'I sleep in the nude and this large red mark was all down one side to the nipple,' Ms Baxter revealed in an interview with the Sun newspaper. 'When I touched the phone, it was so hot, I couldn't pick it up.' Ms Baxter's experience is not the first time that unwary users have found themselves injured by an overheating iPhone. Just two weeks ago, Jake Parker, 18, woke up to find himself with a painful burn on his arm after dozing off draped over his iPhone 5. And in February, a teenage girl was left with second degree burns after her iPhone caught fire while in her back pocket at school. Agony: Ms Baxter took this photo immediately after waking up and discovering the burn on her breast . Sore: Ms Baxter was left with a painful five inch scar which was made worse after the burn became infected . The 14-year-old had just arrived for her French class at a middle school in Kennebunk, Maine, when the device spontaneously set alight and burnt her thigh and back. Ms Baxter, whose wound later became infected, now fears that she may not be able to breastfeed a second child should she have one. 'It's dreadful,' she added. 'Imagine if my daughter had been on that side of the bed and it had burned her face.' Apple declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.","Dionne Baxter, 24, from Essex was burned by her iPhone as she slept .

"Cleared: Andrew Constantine won a fight to clear his name after being accused of speeding . A taxi driver has overturned a fine for doing 50mph in a 30mph zone by using speed camera images to prove he was actually going at only 18mph. But Andrew Constantine must still pay hundreds of pounds in costs, despite winning his long legal battle. Mr Constantine had been shocked to receive the fixed-penalty notice as he remembered at the time he had been carrying a passenger in her 80s and was driving with extra care. Determined to clear his name, he appealed against the £60 fine which was imposed after he was ‘caught’ by a fixed-speed camera in Drayton, Norfolk, in February last year. The father of two, from Norwich, hired a specialist motoring offences lawyer. His battle dragged on for 11 months, until earlier this week the case was dropped moments before a court hearing was due to start. Using simple maths, two pictures taken by the Gatso speed camera showed Mr Constantine had been well under the speed limit. The images were taken about half a second apart over a distance of four metres marked by white lines on the road – proving his speed was 17.8mph. Mr Constantine’s case was due to be heard at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Monday but was dropped when the prosecution looked at the photographic evidence and agreed there had been a mistake. But Mr Constantine is entitled to claim only about three-quarters of the £1,600 he spent on his solicitor, due to a cap on hourly legal fees that may be claimed in motorists’ cases. When lawyers charge more than the hourly rate, the client has to make up the shortfall. The cap on rates was lowered from October 1, after Mr Constantine set his appeal process in motion. But Mr Constantine, 47, refused to let the expense take the edge off his victory. Faulty: This speed camera in Drayton, Norfolk, overstated the speed Mr Constantine was driving by 32mph . He said yesterday: ‘Some other people may have just taken the medicine and accepted it, but I  was innocent. ‘It was nice to walk into court innocent, leave court innocent and be completely vindicated.’ Matthew Miller, of Motoring Offence . Lawyers, which represented Mr Constantine, said: ‘Nobody knows if there . was a fault with this camera. ‘We have speculated that it might have . taken a reading from another vehicle or another object. I have seen . similar errors in the past but never one as bad as this.’ Last year it emerged the number of . active fixed speed camera sites in England had increased from 2,188 to . 2,331 in a 12-month period. The number is set to increase, due to plans . in a Department for Transport report earlier this month. The vast majority are Gatso cameras, a Dutch brand. A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said . cameras were calibrated annually by the manufacturer and data and images . were checked by Criminal Justice Unit staff before fixed-penalty . notices were issued. She said: ‘In this case a fixed penalty notice was issued in error. ‘However, we were not notified this ticket was being challenged until Monday morning. ‘The file was then reviewed and we supported the withdrawal of this case.’","Andrew Constantine accused of driving at 50mph down road he knew well .

"The boss of The Onion has been forced to issue a grovelling apology to nine-year-old Oscar nominee Quvenzhané Wallis after the satirical newspaper site referred to the young star as a 'c***' on Twitter. A Tweet posted by @TheOnion during last night's Oscars ceremony said: 'Everybody else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a c*** right?' The post, which was deleted an hour later, provoked a storm of complaints, and the website's CEO Steve Hannah has now personally apologised to the best actress nominee for the 'crude and offensive' tweet, adding that steps were being taken to 'discipline those individuals responsible'. Scroll down for video . 'Racist': Twitter was awash with complaints after best actress nominee Quvenzhané Wallis was referred to as 'little Q' in coverage of the Oscars ceremony . In a statement posted on Facebook Mr Hannah said he and everybody at the Onion were 'deeply sorry' for the remark. 'No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire,' the statement said. 'Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better.' The tweet was met with a storm of angry comments and demands for an apology across social media. Actor Wendell Pierce, who stars in Treme, described the tweet as an 'abhorrent verbal attack of a child', while another critic called for the writer behind the post to get 'exactly what they deserve. From both the law and the street'. Blogger Elizabeth Hawskworth suggested there was a racist undertone to the deleted post, tweeting: 'Quvenzhané Wallis is a nine year old woman of colour. Let's let what @TheOnion did sink in and remember that Dakota Fanning never had this.' Fans of the spoof website were among . those expressing their distaste and disappointment at its use of the . expletive in reference to the child star. 'Oh boo to the Onion. I generally . find them hilarious but I draw the line at calling 9 year olds ugly . names, even in jest,' said one tweet, while another read: 'I know the . Onion jokes about everything but this is inappropriate'. The Onion website features satirical articles based on national and international news. Its Twitter account has more than 4.5 million followers. The young actress was also at the heart of a second Twitter spat during the ceremony, after she was referred to as 'Little . Q' in coverage, prompting accusations of racism. E! Fashion Police co-host Kelly . Osbourne was branded 'stupid' for failing to use the young . actress' full name during the channel's Oscar night coverage. One disgusted viewer posted: 'It is rude, unprofessional and borderline racist to not even try to pronounce her name properly.' Another tweeted: 'Not learning her . name is racist. Calling her Annie is racist. Saying she says her name . the best is racist.' Kelly Osbourne was among the broadcasters singled out in the row, with one critic tweeting: 'Aren't you paid to be a host? Do your research and practice her name. Stupid Kelly Osbourne.' 'Stupid': Viewers complained after E! Fashion Police co-host Kelly Osbourne, left, referred to Quvenzhané Wallis as 'Little Q' It was one of a host of angry tweets . posted by enraged Oscars viewers, who insisted the media should have . been prepared to pronounce Louisiana-born Quvenzhané's name in full. 'Seriously though, the media need to learn how to pronounce Quvenzhané . Wallis' name. Resorting to little q is disrespectful,' Lauren Karlisle . said on Twitter, while another user tweeting under the handle . @crushabledotcom posted 'OMG are they calling her little Q because they . can't be bothered to learn how to pronounce her name!?!' It isn't the first time Kelly Osbourne has come under fire for her Oscar night commentary. Last . year she raised eyebrows with a remark about Jennifer Lopez's Zuhair . Murad gown, which Ms Osbourne referred to as 'kind of like if she was . hosting the Latin Grammys - like what she would wear as her wow dress'. Quvenzhané was nominated for an Oscar for her starring role as Hushpuppy in critically acclaimed drama Beasts Of The Southern Wild. The rising star lost out to Jennifer Lawrence, who won for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook. Commentary: Kelly Osbourne appeared to suggest the dress Jennifer Lopez chose for the 2012 Oscars would have been more appropriate for hosting the Latin Grammys . Daniel Day Lewis triumphed in the best actor category for his role in Lincoln, while Anne Hathaway and Christoph Waltz took home the statuettes for best supporting actress and best supporting actor. Argo, directed by Ben Affleck, was named best picture at the ceremony in Hollywood. Although she missed out on a statuette, Quvenzhané still made history as the youngest ever Oscar nominee in the best actress category.

"A white-skinned Indian couple are set to enter the record books along with their offspring, after becoming the world's biggest albino family. The ten members of the Pullan family, headed by Rosetauri, 50, and his wife Mani, 45, all have the extremely pale skin and near-white hair of albinos. But despite years of prejudice and suffering the poor vision which is a side effect of the condition, the Pullans and their eight other family members are set to land a Guinness World Record. The Pullan children Shankar, 24, Ramkishan, 19, and Vijay, 25 (back row), along with daughters Deepa, 21 (left) and Pooja, 18 (right) all inherited albinismn from their father Rosetauri and mother Mani (centre) Hardship: Mani Pullan, pictured in purple, says her family which includes daughters Deepa (left) and Pooja (right) have had to battle prejudice in India as albinos . Happy family: The Pullans, who are all albino, live in a small one-bedroom flat in Delhi . The Pullan family say that despite their condition, they are looking forward to global recognition as the world's biggest albino family . The Pullan's sons Shankar, 24, Vijay, 25 and Ramkishan, 19, and daughters Renu, 23, Deepa, 21 and Pooja, 18, inherited their albinism, according to The Sun. Renu married a man who also had albinism, Rosheh, 27, and the couple's son Dharamraj, 2, also inherited the condition from his parents. The family live in a one-bedroom flat in Delhi, and say many fellow Indians find it hard to believe they were born and bred in the country. Roseturai Pullan told The Sun: 'I've heard people call us 'angrez', which means 'English'. New arrival: Two-year-old Dharamraj is the latest albino addition to the Pullan family . Heads of the family: Rosetauri, 50 (left) and his wife Mani (right), 45, wed in an arranged marriage in 1983 . Indian born and bred: The Pullan's 24-year-old son Shankar, who was also born an albino . Rosetauri and Mani (left) wed in an arranged marriage in 1983, but Mani now describes her family's albinism as a 'gift from God' 'All we know is that we can't see properly, and we can't sit under the sun for long, but we live the best we can. 'People in Delhi are a little more open-minded, but many think we're foreigners.' Albinism affects around one in 17,000 people. Those with the condition do not produce enough melanin pigment, which gives colour to the skin, hair and eyes and protects the body from the sun's rays. The Pullans say they have endured a lot of prejudice as people find it hard to understand they are 'born and bred in India' Younger generation: Pooja, 18, and Deepa, 21, are among the younger members of the albino Pullan family . Family plans: The Pullan's eldest son Vijay, 25, says when he has saved enough he wants to find himself an albino wife . Albinos such as the Pullans often suffer from extreme short-sightedness and a severe sensitivity to light. After marrying in 1983, Rosetauri and Mani moved from southern India to Delhi. The couple say they have had a 'tough life' and often been treated as outsiders, but mother Mani says despite the family's setbacks she sees the condition as a 'gift from God'. A spokesperson for Guinness World Records said they would be contacting the Pullans to verify the record of them being the world's biggest albino family. It is thought the current record is held by a six-strong family who live in the U.S. and Canada.","Indian family of ten all have condition which affects one in 17,000 .

"Latin scholar: Wilfred Owen in uniform. Newly released records show the poet's father paid for his son to have lessons in the language of the classics . His most memorable poem left a patriotic slogan in Latin forever dripping with tragic irony. Now it has been revealed that Wilfred Owen's father paid extra for his son to take lessons in the language of the classics - one detail in a snapshot of British education in the years leading to the Great War. An insight into the school days of many First World War soldiers, poets and artists, many of whom did not return home, forms part of the 1.7 million historical files made public today. Handwritten registers, log-books and diaries detailing absences, illnesses, visitors and holiday and attendance records have been brought to light for the first time. Unlike many boys at his Birkenhead school, Owen did not pay an extra fee to do gym but his father, who worked as a station master, paid extra for his son to take Latin, the documents say. That may have been the turning point in his development that made it possible for him to pen his celebrated condemnation of the senseless slaughter on the fields of northern France, Dulce Et Decorum Est. Describing the horrors of life on the front, it concludes those of knew of them 'would not tell with such high zest . 'To children ardent for some desperate glory, . 'The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est . 'Pro patria mori'. The Latin phrase, borrowed from the Roman poet Horace, translates as: 'It is sweet and right to die for your country'. Owen himself died for his country on November 4, 1918, while attempting to lead his men across the Sambre canal at Ors, France. The news of his death reached his parents on November 11, Armistice Day. Edited by fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon and published in 1920, Owen's single volume of poems contains some of the most poignant English poetry of the First World War, including Dulce et Decorum Est and Anthem for Doomed Youth. His work stood in stark contrast both to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke. Owen's educational records are in a newly released collection, the National School Admission Registers 1870-1914, now online at the Findmypast family history website. It was built from work with 25 archives and schools in England and Wales. The historical records come from 1,500 schools. The records show that classes including responsibility, duty, sympathy and self-sacrifice alongside criticism, sewing and objects were taught in schools in 1914. Standards in the education system took a blow as many teachers went to the front in Belgium and France. One record notes a teacher commenting 'no real progress can be made by these classes under the circumstances'. Details of children leaving school early can also be found, including those for pupils at Harris Orphanage School in Preston. In the 'cause of leaving' field, reasons include 'discharge owing to impending blindness' and 'died in workhouse hospital'. Just like in modern-day Britain, parents who did not send their children to school could face fines. One report records that 'last week a parent was fined ... his boy being absent 139 times out of a possible 139'. Current attendance rates stand at 95.7 per cent but one official notes in a 1890 school log that serious illnesses had seen attendance plunge at to 58 per cent at times. They said they had just had the 'best days attendance for a whole year' at 90 per cent. The official school leaving age at the time of these records changed from 10 to 14 but it is clear from the records that many children left even earlier. The Western Front in 1916 : British infantrymen occupy a shallow trench in a ruined landscape before an advance. The original caption reads '331 Infantry to advance'. Many teachers died in the catastrophic war . John Chambers, the chief executive of the Archives and Records Association (UK & Ireland), the lead membership body for archivists, records managers and conservators, described it as a 'significant new resource for family historians - and for all interested in the history of education'. Findmypast family historian Debra Chatfield said it was 'a fascinating collection', adding: 'Not only do these records reveal the details of our ancestors' daily school lives, but they also give an insight into the last days of innocence for many young soldiers. 'Never before have so many archives and schools from across the country collaborated in a project like this, so that from today anyone can go online and search for the names of their ancestors or even their old school in these records.' The records are to be released in three phases. The first release includes records from 1,500 schools from counties across England and Wales - Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Devon, Huntingdonshire, Lancashire, Middlesex, Surrey, Wiltshire and Glamorganshire and Westminster. More releases are to follow in spring and autumn next year.","Owen's most famous poem subverts patriotic slogan of Roman poet Horace .

"Tennis ace Andy Murray has joined the fight to end poaching and the illegal wildlife trade that is threatening the survival of endangered species such as tigers and rhinos. The world number six  has become a global ambassador for conservation charity WWF and will be supporting an initiative in Nepal that trains dogs to track down poaching activity in the country’s Chitwan National Park. Former Wimbledon champion Murray is well known for his love of dogs and will be raising funds throughout next year’s tennis tour for the programme. Tennis ace: Andy Murray has joined the fight to end poaching and the illegal wildlife trade that is threatening the survival of endangered species such as tigers and rhinos . In honour of his support a  puppy, who will be specially trained as a sniffer dog, has been named Murray. Nepal is home to tigers, rhinos and elephants under threat from poaching for the illegal trade in their body parts such as rhino horn, and tiger bone and skin, while the country is also a key transit route for illegal animal products from India to China. The scheme aims to prevent poachers smuggling animal parts in the area of the national park. Paws for thought:  Murray, pictured with Border Force sniffer dogs Tyke and Marley, will be supporting an initiative in Nepal that trains dogs to track down poaching activity in the country’s Chitwan National Park . Namesake: In honour of his support a puppy, who will be specially trained as a sniffer dog, has been named Murray, pictured here during his training . Murray said: 'It’s a shocking fact that the rise in rhino poaching increased by 7,700 per cent between 2007 and 2013 and as few as 3,200 tiger remain in the wild so anything we can do to deter poachers is a positive step in the right direction. 'I’ve followed WWF’s work on the illegal wildlife trade for a while now and been looking for a way to support the campaign. 'I think it’s incredibly important that this trade is prevented and the sniffer dog programme seemed like the perfect venue for me to get behind. 'I know from my own dogs how clever they can be and it’s fascinating how these sniffer dogs communicate with their handlers. I’m also really looking forward to going to see Murray at work at some point in the near future.' In action: Murray in action against Novak Djokovic in the BNP Paribas Masters last week . Heather Sohl, chief species adviser at WWF-UK, said: 'We’re delighted that Andy has joined us in our quest to fight the illegal wildlife trade and this programme seems the perfect fit for him. 'We’re looking forward to sharing news of Murray’s progress with him as well as from the wider team of sniffer dogs in Nepal. 'Illegal wildlife products are often difficult to detect so it is vital if we are to stop the trade for us to continually find new ways of identifying products being transported across the borders. 'With the right training, sniffer dogs can be used to trace wildlife parts, such as rhino horn, tiger bones and tiger skins.'","Murray has become a global ambassador for conservation charity WWF .

"A man diagnosed with schizophrenia has described how staff at a Nevada mental health hospital put him on a bus to California with little medication and food and told him to call 911 when he got there. James Brown, 48, received treatment at Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas last year after suffering from depression and contemplating suicide but was discharged after just three days. His startling case has revealed the state's alleged practice of 'patient dumping', with records showing Nevada has bought 1,500 bus tickets since 2008 - sending some mentally ill patients to places they have never been before and where they know no one. For Brown, who had wanted to stay in Nevada, the experience was petrifying. Scroll down for video . 'Shipped off': James Brown, who was being treated for psychosis and schizophrenia in Nevada, was put on a one-way bus to California - where he knew no one - and told to call police when he got there . 'Why California?' he asked as he became emotional in an interview with ABC News. 'What's waiting for me there? I'm already scared enough.' Just days after checking into the hospital in February 2012, doctors felt Brown was ready to leave and they asked him where he wanted to move, he said. 'I said, ""I don't want to leave Nevada"",' Brown recounted. 'He said, ""California sounds like a really nice state. I think you'll be happy there"".' But doctors insisted he would get better mental health care in Sacramento, even though he had never been and was not given any information about the city. Confused: Brown (pictured finally receiving treatment in North Carolina) went to a police station and ended up at a homeless shelter where his medication soon began to wear off . Reunited: A Sacramento reporter and a counselor put him in touch with his daughter, left, who cares for him . Instead, staff drove him to a . Greyhound bus station, bought him a $306 one-way ticket, gave him six . Ensure nutrition drinks, three-days worth of medication and told him to . call 911 when he arrived. Brown's papers even noted his discharge address as 'Greyhound Bus Station to California'. After the 16-hour trip, he arrived in Sacramento and, confused, went to a police station. Officers took him to a homeless shelter where he began feeling withdrawal symptoms from his medication. At the shelter, he told staff that he knew no one in the state, had nowhere to go and had . run out of medication to treat his schizophrenia, anxiety and . depression. Shelter staff eventually put him on another bus to a mental health clinic, but he failed to turn up and only received help when a Sacramento Bee reporter learned of his plight. Facility: Brown was discharged from Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital after just three days . 'No support': He said he told doctors at the center, pictured, he wanted to stay in Nevada but they did not listen . The reporter and a counselor helped . him make contact with his grown daughter, and he moved to her home. He . is now undergoing treatment. 'I don't want revenge, and I don't know . about justice, but I want them to pay for what they've done to me and . the others,' Brown said. 'I want people to really take a moment to think . about this.' The Bee first shared Brown's story in March and discovered that the state has bought nearly 1,500 bus tickets for patients to nearly every state in the United States. Mike Willden, who directs Nevada's Department of Health and Human Services, maintains that most of the tickets were for patients being met by family members or friends. Documents: His medical records noted that he wanted to stay locally but he was still sent to California . He told ABC News that out of the . 1,500 patients in the past five years, just 10 were inappropriately . transported - but he would not say where they ended up. Following a 10-day internal review, he spoke at a legislative hearing and said that the probe found there was not a pattern of misconduct. Among the report was findings that apparently relate to Brown's case, without naming him. It notes that, 'there was no documented evidence in the medical record that indicated how the patient could access mental health services' or find a physician or a place to live. Another example described a . diabetic patient with bipolar disorder who was bused to Oklahoma who had . no medication or information on where to receive treatment for his . diabetes. Progress: The state's policies have now been changed to ensure all patients travel with a chaperone . He was also given Ensure, but it was not a healthy for someone with diabetes, a nurse said. The findings have prompted Nevada into action. Gov. Brian Sandoval announced on Monday that the state had disciplined mental health employees. Of nine workers at Rawson-Neal who are implicated in the findings, four no longer work there, two have been terminated and three will face further disciplinary action, ABC found. The hospital's policy is now to require chaperones for all bus trips. See below for video .

When Cesc Fabregas left Barcelona in the summer, the club explained one of the reasons for selling him was a ‘downward trend in his stats every season’. They claimed Cesc was rarely as good in the second half of the season as he was in the first. Well, the way he has been playing in the first half of this campaign is better than most players manage over the course of four or five seasons! The Barcelona statement stuck in my mind and it certainly will have stayed with Cesc. The challenge for him now is to continue his sensational run of performances. Cesc Fabregas runs off with his arms wide in celebration after scoring against Schalke in September . The Spanish midfielder's passing and assists have been crucial to Chelsea so far this season . The stats show Barcelona might have had a point, as his performances do tend to tail off in the second half of the season. But now he has a manager who will be all over him if he doesn’t perform. The way Chelsea are going, though, it’s hard to see him doing anything other than play well. Expect him to be pulling the strings tonight.

GERRARD'S FAREWELL TOUR . The next few months will feel a bit like an open-top bus parade for Steven Gerrard as he gets ready to bid farewell to Anfield, but I’m sure he will want to make a quick detour to Wembley. This is a fantastic opportunity for Liverpool to win a trophy and it’s poignant that tonight’s game is against Chelsea, a team that so nearly plucked Gerrard from Anfield. He could have left and won many more trophies, but he stayed true to his boyhood club and they will be desperate for him to win one more before he leaves.

The Liverpool captain slides in celebration after scoring in September's Merseyside derby against Everton . BACK TO BASICS . Brendan Rodgers is a coach who believes strongly in his own attacking philosophy. He sticks to his principles, sometimes to the detriment of the team. If Rodgers persists with his preferred back three, Chelsea’s wide men will tear them apart . A conventional back four would increase their solidity, so it will be interesting to see how Brendan goes. Rodgers has a strong attacking philosophy but he must sacrifice some of his principles against Chelsea . Martin Skrtel has been asked to operate in a back three recently but Rodgers should move to a back four . NOW WE'LL SEE WHAT MOURINHO HAS LEARNED . After losing 5-3 to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, I felt we would only see what Jose made of that defeat the next time he faced a big team on the road. That’s no disrespect to Swansea City, but Jose played his best team on Saturday. He has a tendency to be more cautious against the top sides away from home. The Spurs defeat will have created doubt in his mind and it might be that he puts another holding midfielder alongside Nemanja Matic on Tuesday night.

"Chelsea battled their way to the Capital One Cup final with a hard-fought 1-0 extra-time win ensuring a 2-1 aggregate victory against Liverpool. Branislav Ivanovic's header in the opening period of added time was enough for Jose Mourinho's men, who will face either Tottenham or Sheffield United at Wembley. Here, Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown rates each player. CHELSEA (TEAM AVERAGE 6.6) Thibaut Courtois - 7.5 . Made some good saves in the first half. He can pluck the ball out of the air at will. Thibaut Courtois (left) keeps the score level at 0-0 with a fine save from Liverpool's Alberto Moreno . Branislav Ivanovic - 6 . Awkward without an opponent opposite him and was outmuscled. John Terry - 6.5 . A difficult task against Sterling but kept things simple and passed the ball well. Kurt Zouma - 6 . Sometimes took too long on the ball but recovered well to deny Sterling in the first half . Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to score the decisive goal and send Chelsea to Wembley . Filipe Luis - 6 . Luis In what was a full on game, the Brazilian was quiet but he did his job. Nemanja Matic - 6 . Not as assured as normal. Liverpool’s pressing forced him into some rare mistakes. Cesc Fabregas - 6 . Had to work harder defensively than he might have liked and struggled in attack. Cesc Fabregas (right), pictured tussling with Philippe Coutinho, was forced off injured during the match . Eden Hazard - 8 . The harder you press him, the faster he goes. As good as any winger in world football. Willian - 7 . Buzzed around with plenty of energy and an important ingredient in the win. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard has an effort at goal during a feisty Capital One Cup semi-final second leg . Oscar - 6.5 . Disappointing after a good spell. The least effective of Chelsea’s front men. Diego Costa - 7.5 . The ultimate warrior but he may have crossed the line on this occasion. MANAGER . Jose Mourinho – 7 . Disappointing to see him calling for players to be sent off but he manages on the edge. Chelsea striker Diego Costa had an eventful night against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge . SUBSTITUTES . Ramires (for Fabregas 50, 6.5), Azpilicueta (for Luis 78, 6) Not used: Cech, Cahill, Ake, Remy, Drogba. LIVERPOOL (TEAM AVERAGE 6.9) Simon Mignolet - 7.5 . Hugely improved and dealt well with everything. Made two fine second-half saves. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (left) denies Costa a goal with a last-ditch tackle . Emre Can - 6 . The German had a difficult start but grew another lung in extra-time. Martin Skrtel - 7 . Showed fighting spirit and is the man of the team, but lucky not to concede a penalty. Mamadou Sakho - 6.5 . Understands his role in the back three and was solid, but hit a poor second-half pass. Martin Skrtel (left), pictured challenging Costa, was fortunate not to give a penalty away on Tuesday night . Lazar Markovic - 6 . Used his pace well and put in the hard miles for his team before coming off. Steven Gerrard - 6 . Not quite at his best in fiery game. Only one chance left for a Wembley final. Reds skipper Steven Gerrard holds off Oscar as he collects a pass during the opening period . Lucas Leiva - 7.5 . A vital part of the defensive screen and pinched the ball intelligently. Jordan Henderson - 7 . Passed well and fought hard in a busy midfield but will rue a late missed chance. Philippe Coutinho (right) was the star man on the night despite Liverpool's extra-time defeat . Alberto Moreno - 7 . Was impressive on the flank and used his pace well to give Ivanovic problems. Philippe Coutinho - 8 (STAR MAN) His closing down and running with the ball was of the highest quality. Raheem Sterling - 7.5 . Dangerous in a central role and tested the Chelsea defence but unable to break through. Raheem Sterling was once again asked to play as a lone striker by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . MANAGER . Brendan Rodgers – 7 . Set his team up to attack well. This was more like the Liverpool of last season. SUBSTITUTES .

"Weighing in at 2st 2Ib, Ulric the cat (pictured below) is as heavy as a three year old child and is believed to be the heaviest cat in Britain. He’s also just been put on a crash diet by his owner to try to save his life. The tubby tomcat has been declared as morbidly obese by vets after he ballooned to twice his normal weight. The seven-year-old Norwegian Forest cat spent years stealing his sister Ulla’s food and gorging on cat biscuits. Scroll down for video . Fat cat: . His . monster appetite coupled with his dislike for any exercise has meant . that he has rocketed to the average weight of a three-year-old child. Ulric has now been entered into a pet slimming competition . after experts said his alarming size could have serious consequences for . his life expectancy. Owner Jan Mitchell has already started putting . Ulla’s food on her kitchen worktop, which Ulric is unable to jump to . because of his sheer size. She said Ulric's sister weighs a healthy . 12lbs, which is less than half the size of her large brother. Mrs . Mitchell, 68, a retired secretary from Dorchester, Dorset, said: ‘We got . Ulric and his sister Ulla in 2006 when they were three-months-old. ‘I don’t remember him being particularly abnormally large, but by the time he was 15-months-old he was 1st 3lbs. Super-sized: weighing in at 2stone 2ibs Uric (pictured with his owner Jan Mitchell from Dorchester) is twice the weight he should be and weighs as much as a toddler . Crash diet: Uric has gotten so fat that vets have put him on a crash diet to save his life . ‘We couldn’t really work out why he had got so fat - his diet only consisted of dry cat food and water, nothing elaborate. ‘We had to move Ulla’s food up onto the kitchen worktop to stop him eating that too. She . added the first time she realised he had some weight behind him was . when she was sat in the sitting room and the door came flying open from . where he had pushed it. ‘We had to lock him in the conservatory at night otherwise he would come crashing into the bedroom,’ she added. Mrs . Mitchell said nothing she did stopped him getting bigger but when he . hit the two stones mark ‘that’s when alarm bells started ringing.’ Over-eater: Ms Mitchell was shocked to discover she owns Britain's fattest cat. She said she thought he got so big by stealing his sister's food . ‘He . wasn’t healthy and had trouble moving,’ she said. ‘He is a lovely cat . but he’s just very greedy and lazy, he doesn’t do any exercise and . spends all day lying around. ‘I have even tried to take him for a walk on a lead but he didn’t want to know.’Concerned for Ulric’s health, Jan entered him into a pet slimming competition run by animal charity PDSA. He . is the heaviest cat ever to take part in the competition and now has . his food weighed to make sure he is eating the correct amount. Stella . Hughes, a head nurse for the PDSA, said: ‘Ulric is morbidly obese, . which can have very serious consequences for his health and life . expectancy. Lazy cat: Ulric's weight gain has also been put down to his dislike of exercise. ‘Overweight pets are less mobile, less willing to play and more likely to develop a number of serious health conditions. ‘The good news is it’s never too late to make a positive change and improve a pet’s lifestyle. ‘We’re confident that Ulric will have a slim-line figure and new lease of life by the end of the competition.’ Big . as he is, Ulric is not the heaviest cat in the world.

"Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev displayed a disturbing pattern of verbal abuse and violence toward women that included fits of rage against his wife and an arrest in 2009 for slapping a previous girlfriend, according to police records and accounts from those who knew him. Close friends of his wife Katherine Russell, 24, claimed today that Tsarnaev, 26, was combative, angry and controlling. His wife hasn't spoken publicly about her husband since he was killed in a shootout with police early Friday morning. But it appears she spoke to federal authorities for the first time on Tuesday, after she was spotted leaving her Rhode Island family home with her lawyer and three federal investigators. She returned home nearly four hours later with her mother. Scroll down for video .

Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office . History: Bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev (left) displayed a disturbing pattern of verbal abuse and violence toward women, including his wife, Katherine Russell (right) Wife: Russell became pregnant with Tsarnaev's baby her senior year of college and she dropped out of school . Katherine Russell's lawyers released this statement on Tuesday morning at her request: . 'As you know from news reports, Katie married her husband in June of 2010. Since then, she has been living in Cambridge, raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves. 'Katie grew up in Rhode Island and has always remained close to her parents and sisters here, as well as her extended family. 'She is fortunate to have the support of her loving family now, as they, too, struggle to come to terms with these events and the deep sorrow we all feel following the events of last week. 'Meanwhile, she is doing everything she can to assist with the investigation. 'The injuries and loss of life - to people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family. 'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all. 'As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims - students, law enforcement, families and our community. In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events.' Afterwards, her lawyers released a statement at her request that claimed she has been 'doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.' 'The injuries and loss of life - to . people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound . distress and sorrow to Katie and her family,' the statement read. 'The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all.' Three of Russell's friends told . National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult . Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.' He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects, including furniture, friends said. Russell's lawyer, Amato DeLuca, said she was a student at Suffolk University when she was introduced to Tsarnaev at a nightclub. He didn't specify the exact date that they met, though it's believed to be sometime during 2009. Tsarnaev was seeing another woman at the time, he said. 'They went out for a while, and then they stopped and then they went out again,' DeLuca said. It's possible the other woman that Tsarnaev was apparently dating was 25-year-old Nadine Ascencao of Brookline, Mass. Tsarnaev was arrested in July 2009 for allegedly slapping Ascencao, according to court records. Ascencao . was 'crying hysterically' and called 911 to report that she was 'beat . up by her boyfriend,' Cambridge Police Officer Angela . Pereira wrote in the arrest report. Tsarnaev told Pereira and another officer that his girlfriend 'was yelling at him because of another girl.' Asked whether he had hit Ascencao, Tsarnaev stated, 'Yes, I slapped her.' He specifically stated that he struck the left side of her face. Eleven months later, Tsarnaev was apparently no longer dating Aschencao. He had persuaded Russell to convert from Christianity to Islam and the couple married on June 21, 2010. Around the same time, Russell . became pregnant with Tsarnaev's baby. She . dropped out of school in her senior year and reportedly began pulling away from her friends and . family.

Silberman, whose apartment backs up to Tsarnaev's Cambridge home, said she often heard loud arguments late at night that mostly . consisted of a woman's voice yelling at a man. 'It wasn't enough to call the police,' Silberman told Reuters. 'It didn't sound like anyone was in physical danger.' Marathon bombings: Tsarnaev (right) is a suspect, along with his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar, (left), in the Boston marathon bombings that killed three and wounded more than 180 . But the shouting was often loud enough to keep her awake at night. She could also hear the couple's daughter, Zahara, now three years old, wailing at night and she often wondered why the mother wasn't responding, she said. As the girl grew into a toddler, Silberman said she would see Zahara staring out the window. Since Tsarnaev's death, Russell has been staying with her family in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. Her lawyer, Amato DeLuca, told CNN on Monday that the 24-year-old is 'very distraught' and 'cries a lot.' Regarding the bomb plot, DeLuca said, 'She knew nothing about it at any time.' 'The . whole family is a mess, to put it bluntly,' he said. 'They're very . distraught. They're upset. Their lives have been unalterably changed. They're upset because of what happened, the people that were injured, . that were killed. It's an awful, terrible thing.' Timeline: Sometime around 2008, Tsarnaev's erratic and violent behavior escalated as he stopped smoking and drinking and suddenly became heavily involved in Islam . Tsarnaev, who had appeared in surveillance photos wearing a black cap and was identified as Suspect No. 1, died days after the bombing . Russell works 70 to 80 hours a week as a home health aide, according to family members. Tsarnaev was unemployed. Judith Russell, the 24-year-old's mother, read an emotional statement to the media outside the timber-framed detached family home. ‘Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child,' she said. 'We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.’ She added: ‘In the aftermath of the Patriots’ Day horror, we now know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev.’","Katherine Russell is 'doing everything she can to assist with the investigation' according to a statement released Tuesday .

"Yahoo! CEO . Marissa Mayer's bold move to buy online blogging forum Tumblr for $1.1 billion was announced on Monday as she tries to rejuvenate an Internet icon that had fallen . behind the times. The deal is Yahoo!'s most expensive acquisition since the California . company bought online search engine Overture a decade ago for $1.3 . billion in cash and stock. Yahoo'!s board of directors agreed on Sunday to buy the wildly popular blogging platform from the 26-year-old founder David Karp. The deal for Tumblr, which boasts 100million users and 90million posts per day, was struck for $1.1billion cash. Scroll down for Marissa Mayer's GIF . Done deal: Tumblr CEO David Karp (pictured left) has sold his blogging platform for $1.1billion cash to Yahoo! in a deal orchestrated by CEO Marissa Mayer (right) The deal makes Karp, a native New Yorker, the . latest 20-something tech tycoon, even though he was publicly . opposed, even just last year, to selling the company he founded out of . his mother's small Manhattan apartment in 2007. On Monday morning, Mayer publicly announced the purchase of Tumblr with a post on her own Tumblr page - including an animated GIF image that acknowledged the public questions about the acquisition. Her first words about the deal were: 'We promise not to screw it up.' Mayer announced that Karp will stay on as CEO of Tumblr and continue to run and develop the site. Despite a massive user base, Tumblr's . revenue was only $13million last year. Even that figure was only made . possible after $125million in capital investments. The . deal also faced almost immediate backlash from Tumblr users, who feared . Yahoo!'s ownership would change the character of the site and water down . the features that make it successful. Mayer . sought to allay concerns on both sides - and even used an internet meme . to make light of the criticism. The GIF she posted reads: 'Yahoo. Tumblr. Now Panic and Freak Out.' Rich man: David Karp, who founded Tumblr in 2007 in his mother's Manhattan apartment, just made hundreds of millions of dollars after his company was purchased by Yahoo . Moving on up: Karp lives with his girlfriend Rachel Eakley, a graduate student and chef, in a modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village . Instead, Mayer urged users and Yahoo! investors alike the 'Keep Calm and Carry On' - a reference to a famous British propaganda poster produced during World War II. Tech news site AllThingsD reports that Mayer, who took over as Yahoo! CEO in July, wanted to quickly snatch up Tumbler as 'the stake in the ground of what her strategy is going forward for Yahoo!.' Tumblr, which is a mico-blogging platform for quickly posting pictures, text and video, also functions as a social media site. Its platform manages to blend . elements of all of the major social networking sites. Sharing and . posting photos is simple and easy, like Instagram. GIFs and videos are . all easy to share, as well. But, the site also has a new feed function, . allowing users to follow other Tumblr blogs like social media networks Facebook and Twitter. The . simple layout of Tumblr has spawned millions of diverse, quirky, blogs. An enormously popular Tumblr called '#whatshouldwecallme' features a . series of animated GIFs explaining the reactions to daily life of a . 20-something woman. Miss Eakley has been Karp's constant companion at public events for several years . However, celebrities like Joe Jonas and Lady GaGa also have popular Tumblr pages and companies like the shoemaker Cole Haan use the site as a creative way to market their products. Tumblr is also popular with many porn stars and features numerous sexually-explicit blogs. Tumblr boasts remarkable loyalty among its users. Some 85percent of Tumblr users make 20 or more posts a month. Mayer cited some of these facts when addressing critics who worried Yahoo was paying too much for a company that has yet to turn a profit. In her Tumblr post, she wrote: 'The combination of Tumblr+Yahoo! could grow Yahoo!’s audience by 50% to more than a billion monthly visitors, and could grow traffic by approximately 20%. 'In terms of working together, Tumblr can deploy Yahoo!’s personalization technology and search infrastructure to help its users discover creators, bloggers, and content they’ll love.' She also addressed the fears of Tumblr users, who threatened to leave the service in droves or to otherwise protest the takeover. 'Tumblr is incredibly special and has a great thing going.  We will operate Tumblr independently.  David Karp will remain CEO,' Mayer wrote. 'The product roadmap, their team, their wit and irreverence will all remain the same as will their mission to empower creators to make their best work and get it in front of the audience they deserve.  Yahoo! will help Tumblr get even better, faster.' Very young and very rich: Karp and Eakley, who enjoy spending their Sunday mornings at brunch in Manhattan's East Village, are now due for a major lifestyle change . However, Karp - a high school dropout who taught himself how to code - had expressed grave reservations about giving up his brainchild to a Silicon Valley tech giant. In a 2012 interview with the Guardian, he said he had been swatting away buy-out requests for years. 'Particularly in the first three years, there were a lot of (mergers and acquisitions) people who would pull you aside and you'd think ""Well, s***, I could be a pretty rich 23-year-old with very little effort,""' he said. 'We stuck it out. I won't say I really knew why.' Perhaps the perseverance makes sense to Karp now that he is 'very rich' at age 26. The deal conjures images of another young man who is very rich - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. At $1.1billion, Tumblr's worth is . nowhere near the value of $100billion Facebook, but 29-year-old . Zuckerberg's success has become something of a pattern for young, . brilliant tech entrepreneurs. It is unclear how large a stake in the company Karp maintained before the Yahoo deal. In 2008, he sold a 25percent stake to investors for $750,000. The investor share of the company was $125million at the time of the deal, according to AllThingsD. Karp grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the son of a music composer father who wrote songs for . films and TV shows and a mother who was a teacher. Unlike the famously-dressed-down Mark Zuckerberg, Karp prefers wearing plaid instead of a hoody. But he's not afraid to wear a suit, either. He taught himself how to code HTML at . age 11 and began setting up his own consulting business shortly . thereafter. His parents allowed him to drop out of high school at age 15 . and complete the remainder of his education by homeschooling. At age 17, he moved to Japan, where he cemented his skill as a programmer and began pitching his ideas to tech companies. He moved back to New York and sold his services as a consultant. He founded Tumblr in 2007 at age 21 - and it quickly consumed all of his time. He started up an office in Manhattan and has ardently resisted the lure of moving to Silicon Valley. He also tried to resist the money that the tech world had to offer. He told the Guardian that he wanted to remain independent - believing he could grow the company by growing ad revenue naturally. Within a year, though, he was accepting funds from venture capital investors. He currently lives with his girlfriend in a modest apartment in Manhattan's West Village. Rachel Eakley is a chef and a graduate student studying psychology.","Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer's first words about the deal were: 'We promise not to screw it up'

"David Cameron’s fate as Tory leader will hang in the balance and he could feel ‘duty bound’ to resign if Scotland votes for independence, his allies conceded last night. Even some Cabinet ministers who are supportive of the Prime Minister’s leadership admit his future will be ‘difficult’ – despite his insistence he would ‘emphatically’ not quit in the event of a Yes vote. One told the Mail he would have a responsibility to stay on and deal with the aftermath of Scotland voting to break away but could then be forced out or feel ‘duty-bound’ to go. Scroll down for video . David Cameron could feel duty bound to resign if Scotland votes for independence his allies have conceded . Another said Mr Cameron would have a ‘very difficult’ period, but was likely to survive because of the proximity of the general election and the lack of any obvious replacement. Officers on the Conservatives’ 1922 Committee, which represents backbench MPs, are understood to have quietly canvassed opinion over the weekend on whether Mr Cameron might lose a vote of confidence. The Prime Minister has effectively ceded control of the No campaign to his old enemy Gordon Brown, and is not expected to appear in Scotland this week. Strategists admit their party is still so divisive north of the border that too much exposure of senior Conservative ministers might prove counterproductive. Later this week, the Prime Minister is expected to back proposals for rapid devolution of more powers over taxation, public spending and welfare rates to Scotland in the event of a no vote. He has also urged Labour figures to halt the separatist surge by making the ‘emotional case’ for preserving the Union, rather than focusing on negative warnings. After what were seen as crisis talks with the Queen at Balmoral at the weekend, Mr Cameron is understood to have insisted that the campaign focus on the ‘heart rather than the head’ in its final ten days. ‘He wants to make the emotional argument about all that England and Scotland have achieved together – and all they can continue to achieve,’ said one source. Under Conservative party rules, a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron is triggered if at least 15 per cent of backbenchers – currently 46 MPs – write to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, requesting one. Some Tory MPs say Mr Cameron’s credibility will be shattered if, as head of what is officially called the Conservative and Unionist Party, he has and presided over the end of the UK. One minister said the Prime Minister would also face questions about his concessions to Alex Salmond on the timing of the referendum, the ballot’s wording and the extension of the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds. The Prime Minister has effectively ceded control of the No campaign to his old enemy Gordon Brown, pictured, and is not expected to appear in Scotland this week . ‘The way the question is worded so that No is the vote for the Union has made it seem a negative rather than a positive thing,’ the minister said. After the election of the SNP government in 2011, the Government originally insisted must hold the referendum by September 2013. But a later vote was permitted in exchange for First Minister Alex Salmond agreeing to a single Yes or No question. He initially wanted a second question on so-called ‘devo max’ – the devolution of more powers. Some senior Conservatives now believe it was a fundamental error to exclude a ‘third way’ from the ballot paper, since it would have allowed pro-Unionists to campaign against No while urging those voters who want change to back a ‘best of both worlds’ option. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Tory foreign secretary, pointed out that more than 90 per cent of Tory voters in Scotland are backing the No campaign, while Labour has steadily leached support to Yes. The latest polling suggests as many as 35 per cent of Labour voters could back independence. ‘You can hardly blame the Prime Minister for Labour people deserting their own party,’ he said. Labour leader Ed Miliband is also likely to face a leadership crisis if Scotland votes Yes. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is also likely to face a leadership crisis if Scotland votes Yes . Sam Dale, writing on the Labour supporters’ website Labour Uncut, said he would shoulder ‘most blame’ in the event of a Yes vote and would also have to resign. ‘It was the hapless Labour campaign for the Scottish Parliament in 2011 that let the SNP in power. It is a disaster that Miliband oversaw but has never been fully held to account for within Labour circles,’ he said. ‘For the SNP to gain a majority required Labour ineptitude on a grand scale. Ever since, Labour has provided woeful opposition to the SNP in Scotland. ‘Since the referendum campaign began it has been crystal clear that Labour voters would decide the vote. Unlike David Cameron, Miliband had a chance to convince his own supporters and turn the referendum. He did not intervene often enough or effectively.’","Ministers admit PM's leadership would be 'difficult' if there is Yes vote .

"Scroll down for video . Three Indian police officers have been suspended after a horrifying video was posted on Facebook which appears to show them violently beating a man with sticks and stealing money from his wallet. In the clip, which was filmed near Red Fort in Delhi and posted by the Aam Aadmi political party, the man can be seen pleading with officers and wincing in pain as they pin him against a fence and thrash him with canes. At one point the man appears to collapse in agony before an officer forces him back to his feet so the beating can continue. Brutal: The man can be seen pleading with officers and wincing in pain as they pin him against a fence and thrash him with canes. At one point the man appears to collapse in agony . The full video, which was taken on a mobile phone on January 12, is around 20 minutes long. The majority of the video appears to show the man being beaten and robbed . With the man standing in tears, one of the officers appears to reach into his pocket and take money from his wallet, which he then throws over a fence out of the victim’s reach. Another officer then repeatedly slaps the man in the face. The full video, which was taken on a . mobile phone on January 12 and uploaded to the official Aam Aadmi .

Since being posted last week by local man Kapil Kumar, the video has had over 10,000 views on YouTube, many of which came indirectly through Aam Aadmi's social media platforms . Speaking to the Times of India, Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi secretary Dilip Pandey said: ‘We have no personal agenda in this. This is just another incident of police brutality and AAP is simply saying that there is something seriously wrong with our policing system.’ The local police force reportedly attempted to justify the beating, saying the man was a pickpocket who had been caught ‘red handed’.  That account was later called into question, however, when the police argued that the man had been ‘let off’ with the crime. Delhi police said they had identified and suspended the three police officers that appeared in the video and urged the victim to come forward to provide a statement. An unidentified senior officer told the Times of India: ‘More stern action will be taken against the rogue policemen if required. No unruly behaviour will be tolerated.’ He added that a special team would investigate the incident at the earliest opportunity, with the officers’ statements due taken on Monday.

The police initially attempted to justify the beating, saying the man was a pickpocket who had just been caught . At one point the man appears to collapse in agony before an officer forces him back to his feet . There have been several serious incidents of alleged police brutality in India in recent years, the most recent a violent clash between officers and villagers near Forbesganj in 2011. During a protest over the building of a road, police shot and killed two villagers. Another two people died in the resulting violence, which also left 27 police officers and four villagers with serious injuries. In 2003 police fired on tribal clans in the village of Muthanga in Kerala. The clans had gathered to protest a delay in allotting them land, which had been contracted in October 2001. During the protest, Kerala Police fired 18 rounds resulting in two immediate fatalities - one of which was a police officer. In a statement Kerala officials later placed the official death toll at five.","Clip appears to show three officers thrashing alleged pickpocket with a cane .

"Diego Costa up against Thiago Silva is a mouthwatering prospect: one of the world’s best strikers versus one of the game’s best defenders. I watched Silva a lot at the World Cup for Brazil and he was immense. When he was missing, they lost 7-1 to Germany in the semi-final. Silva is an aggressive and brave defender who attacks the ball well. He’s not the tallest at barely 6ft but that gives him extra mobility. Diego Costa has been in formidable form for Chelsea since signing from Atletico Madrid last summer . Thiago Silva is one of the most respected defenders in world football and will try to stop Costa on Tuesday . Costa (right) will pose one of the toughest challenges that Silva has faced in a Paris Saint-Germain shirt . He’s good on the ball and is not afraid to bring it out from the back. Also, when opponents try to put pressure on him he will find a way out with a bit of skill. He makes it look easy. He is a threat in the opposing penalty area too but hasn’t scored for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 or Europe for more than a year so he will know that needs to improve. Perhaps Silva’s biggest weakness is the league he is playing in. Ligue 1 does not offer enough of a regular test for PSG’s players so all of a sudden facing someone as brilliant as Costa could be a shock to the system. He and his central defensive partner David Luiz will want to show they are capable of stopping Chelsea, the competition’s highest scorers so far. Luiz’s professional pride will have been wounded when Chelsea sold him so he also has a big point to prove. But he and Silva will leave space in behind as they like to bring the ball out, and that could give Chelsea opportunities. Former Chelsea player David Luiz (right) is set to partner Silva in central defence for PSG . Silva (left) has criticised the decision of Costa to switch nationalities from Brazil to Spain . Silva and Luiz will also have to stifle the attacking threat of Eden Hazard (left) when they play Chelsea . Maybe they can get a hold of Costa but that might just leave space for Eden Hazard or Willian to run in behind. Costa can be the decoy. And as if the tactical battle isn’t enough, Costa switching nationality from Brazil to Spain will add even more spice. Silva has already said he wouldn’t do the same and probably wondered how well Brazil could have done in the World Cup with Costa in their side. Get ready for some niggles.","Diego Costa is set to return to Chelsea's line-up at Paris Saint-Germain .

"Convenience of staff: Inspections have uncovered cases where residents are woken in the early hours – in one case as early as 4am (file picture) Elderly people should not be woken up early to fit in with care home staff rotas and save them extra work, new guidelines say. Inspections have uncovered cases where residents are woken in the early hours – in one case as early as 4am – for the convenience of staff. The lives of thousands of elderly and vulnerable people in care homes are also being put at risk because staff do not bother to make sure that residents get enough to eat, the National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) has warned. New guidance instructs care home managers to give residents ‘as much choice as possible about personal routines’. Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive of NICE, said: ‘The person’s needs should come before what is most convenient for the home.’ On residents being forced to get up and go to bed at unusual hours for the convenience of staff, the NICE briefing paper, aimed at care home managers and local council social services chiefs, said residents should be allowed to ‘go at their own pace’. The guidelines also warn that one in ten people over 65 suffer from malnutrition and called for care home staff to routinely monitor meals and diets. NICE says: ‘Without proper care and attention, older people in care homes can develop malnutrition and this can lead to a hospital admission. Investigation: Police arrested two  workers on suspicion of neglect and ill-treatment after 83-year-old and 93-year-old residents died within days of each other at Birdgrove care home (pictured) in Berkshire . ‘Care homes need to be aware of the need to provide residents with a balanced, healthy diet and to be aware of the signs of malnutrition.’ The intervention of NICE, which advises NHS and private health providers and decides which drugs the NHS should make available, reflects a growing concern that many care homes are run for the convenience of staff rather than residents. The warning on malnutrition follows a series of scandals involving care homes where elderly residents who needed help with meals were ignored. Concerns have also been raised about the failure of care homes to give residents enough to drink – often because staff do not want to be bothered with helping residents to use the toilet in the middle of the night. Both failures can lead rapidly to hospital admission and a high likelihood of death for the patient. The NICE warnings came on the day the Daily Mail reported that two workers had been arrested on suspicion of neglect and ill-treatment following the death of a resident at the Birdgrove care home in Berkshire. A large-scale academic study published last month found that care home residents are also highly likely to be suffering from dehydration when they go into hospital, and, once there, they are up to ten times more likely to die than other elderly patients. Professor Leng said: ‘Our recommendations advise that people living in care homes should be helped to retain their independence and identity, for example through supporting them to take part in activities they enjoy, and allowing them to go at their own pace. ‘It is also important to respect a person’s right to make their own decisions if they still have the capacity to do so. This includes having as much choice as possible about personal routines such as when someone eats or sleeps, or spends time alone.’ She added: ‘Older people’s physical needs are equally important to their mental wellbeing.’","Residents are woken in the early hours  for the convenience of staff .

"A nuclear plant was inches away from being engulfed by the bloated Missouri River after several levees in the area failed to hold back its surging waters, raising fears it could become America's Fukushima. Dramatic pictures show the moment the plant was threatened with being shut down today, as water levels rose ominously to within 18 inches of its walls. The river has to hit 902 feet above sea level at Brownville before officials will shut down the Cooper Nuclear Plant, which sits at 903 feet. It stopped and ebbed slightly yesterday, a reprieve caused by levee breaches in northwest Missouri - for now. Engulfed: The nuclear power station in Nebraska came within inches of having to be shut down . Flooding is a major concern all along the river because of the massive amounts of water that the Army Corps of Engineers has released from six dams. Any significant rain could worsen the flooding especially if it falls in Nebraska, Iowa or Missouri, which are downstream of the dams. The river is expected to rise as much as five to seven feet above the official 'flood stage' in much of Nebraska and Iowa and as much as 10 feet over in parts of Missouri. The corps predicts the river will remain that high until at least August. Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker said the river rose to 900.56 feet at Brownville on Sunday, then dropped to 900.4 feet later in the day and remained at that level on Monday morning. The Missouri River set a new record Sunday at Brownville when its depth was measured at 44.4 feet, topping the previous record of 44.3 feet set during the 1993 flooding, according to the National Weather Service. Stranded: Cars stop hopelessly, stranded by floodwaters over a bridge . Carnage: Other vehicles were not quite so lucky and were swept away by the floods . Just north of New Orleans, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers workers finally closed the final bays of the Bonnet Carre Spillway yesterday. The gates were opened weeks ago in an effort to redirect high water on the Mississippi River which threatened levees. Meanwhile, the supply of sand used to fill hundreds of thousands of bags needed to fight off the swollen Missouri River is running low after weeks of relentless flooding. It's a problem that could get worse as the river is expected to remain high through August, making it unsafe to gather sand from the easiest place to get it: the river itself. The Army Corps of Engineers is monitoring the sand supply, said Jud Kneuvean, chief of emergency management for the corps' Kansas City District. He said a ton of sand produces about 60 sandbags. Sand also is piled along weakened areas of levees to prevent seepage. 'You need lots of sand, lots of sand,' Kneuvean said. Dan Sturm, the fire chief in Hamburg, Iowa, joked that his community deserves blame for thinning sand supplies. 'We probably took all the sand,' Sturm said. Hamburg has filled at least 250,000 sandbags and dumped truckloads into fabric-lined metal-frame baskets to create a makeshift barrier to hold back water pouring through a breached Missouri River levee. Downstream, St. Joseph has filled 365,000 sandbags to reinforce low spots on levees and protect city buildings and the airport at Rosecrans Air National Guard base, said public works director Bruce Woody. The local supply of sand quickly ran out after flooding began in St. Joseph, and the river was moving too swiftly to allow for dredging, Buchanan County emergency director Bill Brinton said. The county had to ship in sand from Topeka and Kansas City. Damage: A worker surveys they scene as he scales a levee attempting to hold back the floodwater . Man versus nature: A levee manages to keep the water from passing . No passing: Flood waters from the nearby Missouri River cover a county highway . Atchison also had to purchase sand from the Kansas City area, about an hour's drive away, city manager Trey Cocking said. Suburban Kansas City-based Ash Grove . Aggregates & Ready Mix, which sells sand, typically dredges the . river at St. Joseph for sand. Because the river is so high and the . current so strong, the company has been forced to cease dredging and may . not start again until August, company president Allan Emby said. But despite the shortage, he is refusing to raise the price. 'I can't morally in my own brain think about increasing prices because of flooding,' Emby said. The Cooper Nuclear Plant remains . operating at full capacity today but the Columbus-based utility sent an . emergency 'notification of unusual event' to the Nuclear Regulatory . Commission when the river rose to 899 feet early on Sunday morning. Deluge: Statues of workers, part of  Monument for Labor by Matthew J. Placzek, stand in the rising waters of the Missouri River, in Omaha . 'We knew the river was going to rise for some time,' Becker said. 'It was just a matter of when.' The . nuclear plant has been preparing for the flooding since May 30. More . than 5,000 tons of sand has been brought in to construct barricades . around it and access roads, according to NPPD. Should . water levels engulf the facility, forcing closure and repairs, energy . bills in the area would be likely to rocket to cover the cost. 'In that case we may have to raise rates,' a spokeswoman said. The Army Corps of Engineers said the . river level at Brownville had surged about two feet from Saturday . morning to Sunday morning and that it continued to rise because of heavy . rain on the Nishnabotna River, which flows into the Missouri River from . Iowa. The Cooper Nuclear . Station is one of two plants along the Missouri River in eastern . Nebraska. The Fort Calhoun Station, operated by the Omaha Public Power . District, is about 20 miles north of Omaha. It issued a similar alert to . the regulatory commission on June 6. The river has risen at least 1.5 feet higher than Fort Calhoun's 1,004-foot elevation above sea level. The plant can handle water up to 1,014 feet, according to OPPD. The water is being held back by a series of protective barriers, including an 8-foot rubber wall outside the reactor building. Its reactor already had been shut down for refuelling and maintenance since April, and it won't be turned on again until the flooding subsides. The entire plant still has full electrical power for safety systems, including those used to cool radioactive waste. It also has at least nine backup power sources. Hope: Engineers close the final bays of the Bonnet Carre Spillway just above New Orleans . A spokesman for the Nuclear . Regulatory Commission said the NRC thinks OPPD managers have 'done . everything that they need to do to respond to the current conditions' at . the nuclear plant. Over . the weekend, several northern Missouri levees failed to hold back the . raging floodwaters, and the hole in a Holt County levee that ruptured . last week continued to grow. The water started pouring over levees . on Saturday night and Sunday morning in Holt and Atchison counties, . flooding farmland, numerous homes and cabins. The recreational community of Big Lake, which is home to a state park and less than 200 people, is being threatened by the floodwater. Most of Big Lake's residents have already evacuated. The area 78 miles north of Kansas City has been high for the past couple weeks, has experienced major flooding in three of the last five years. Disaster: Flood waters from the Missouri River engulf homes in neighbouring Iowa. More than 250 residents have now been evacuated from Missouri after levees broke . Water flooded two highways, several homes were under as much as five feet of water and there was extensive farmland flooding, said Diana Phillips, clerk and flood plain manager for the village of Big Lake. 'It's only going to get worse because there is lots of water coming in,' Phillips said. In Atchison County, where farmland . was flooding, people have been evacuating for days, said Julie Fischer, a . dispatcher for emergency services. Gushing: The powerful waters rush through a ruptured levee near Hamburg, Iowa, last week . 'Everybody is pretty much gone,' Fischer said. 'The roads are closing, there is no way in or out.' Authorties have urged around 250 people in northwester Missouri to leave their homes. Jud Kneuvean, chief of emergency . management for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Kansas City District, . said the Missouri River dipped by almost 1 foot after the Big Lake . breach in Missouri but that the water started to rise again by Sunday . afternoon. He said Big Lake . is seeking permission to cut a relief hole in an already-damaged county . levee to allow water trapped behind the levee to flow back into the . river. The Corps increased water releases on Saturday from two dams -- Oahe above Pierre, South Dakota's capital, and Big Bend Dam just downstream -- to make room for expected potentially heavy rains through early next week. They have been increasing water releases from five dams in North Dakota and South Dakota to roughly double prior records to relieve reservoirs . Most people left their homes well in advance of the flooding. Those who stayed were told Saturday night that water was flowing into the area. The Big Lake area, where water has been high for the past couple weeks, has experienced major flooding in three of the last five. Mike Crecelius, the Fremont County Emergency Management chief, said that in Hamburg, Iowa, the river was expected to crest at 10 feet over flood stage in the coming days. Crecelius said the river has been over flood stage since late April, and that forecasters are projecting river flows of 150,000 cubic feet (1.1 million gallons) per second through August. '[The levees] are not designed for . this amount of pressure for this length of time,' Crecelius told CNN. 'They've never been tested like this.' Raging: Residents burn wood to avoid it becoming flood debris . Flames: Residents burn a pile of pallets in near Rock Port, Missouri, to avoid them from becoming debris in flood waters after a levee broke . 'There was some talk this morning about more than 150,000 cubic feet per second coming out of Oahe,' said Jerry Compton, working on Sunday at a convenience store in Missouri Valley. The threat of flooding is stressful, said Compton, who knows her customers by name and even knows what brand of cigarettes they buy. 'People either moved out of their homes to another house, or they're trying to live in a camper. Some people have had their utilities cut off,' she said. 'We just sit here and wait.' Peak releases are planned until at least mid-August and high flows are expected until December. The . National Weather Service said that the six to 12 inches of rainfall in . the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's . worth of raid, while runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140 per cent . of average levels.","Nuclear plant inches from being totally flooded, but is saved - for now .

"One of the major arguments of those who deny climate change is that, over the last 15 years, global warming has been slowing down. Research, now claims, has shown that this is consistent with models of climate change and can be explained by the weather phenomenons El Niño and La Niña. By reviewing data from 1950 to 2013 scientists found models under and overestimated warming trends when El Niño and La Niña respectively were taken into account. A study claims temperature changes in the Pacific can help explain over and underestimates in climate models. The study shows these trends are consistent with El Nino and La Nina. Shown is an anomaly image from 2007, during La Niña, where strong bands of blue (cool) water and red (warm) water are shown . The study in Nature Climate Change shows that El Niño and La Niña could explain discrepancies in climate models. El Niño and La Niña are opposite phases of what is known as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (Enso) cycle, says the NOAA. The Enso cycle is a scientific term that describes the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific (approximately between the International Date Line and 120 degrees West). La Niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase of Enso and El Niño as the warm phase. These deviations from normal surface temperatures can have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes, but also on global weather and climate. El Niño and La Niña episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some prolonged events may last for years. They often begin to form between June and August, reach peak strength between December and April, and then decay between May and July of the following year. While their periodicity can be quite irregular, El Niño and La Niña events occur about every three to five years. Typically, El Niño occurs more frequently than La Niña. The global warming slowdown over the last 15 years had raised questions about the accuracy and credibility of climate models. But now experts say that the models are accurate when natural weather systems are considered. The paper was led by climatologist Dr James Risbey, based in Australia. Risbey and colleagues investigated the ability of present models to reproduce temperature observations for the past 15-year period. Over time weather patterns like El Niño and La Niña cancel each other out, but in the short term they can skew climate data and make models seem inaccurate. The findings of the research were that periods of global warming increasing or decreasing were consistent with temperature changes caused by El Niño and La Niña. The authors studied a collection of 18 global climate models that are able to represent El Niño/Southern Oscillation (Esno) through sea surface temperatures. Of these they identify a subset which accurately represent the current state of El Niño/Southern Oscillation through comparison with observations. By reviewing data from 1950 to 2013 scientists found models under and overestimated warming trends when El Niño and La Nina respectively were taken into account. Shown is Laguna Blanca in Chile, a dry lakebed flooded by El Niño storms. The storms restarted the growth of polygonal salt formations . Over time weather patterns like El Niño (red) and La Niña (blue) cancel each other out, but in the short term they can skew climate data. The findings of the research were that periods of global warming increasing or decreasing were consistent with temperature changes caused by El Niño and La Niña . The selected models are able to provide more accurate estimations of temperature trends over the past 15 years as well as the recent spatial trends in Pacific Ocean surface temperature. ‘The question of how climate model projections have tracked the actual evolution of global mean surface air temperature is important in establishing the credibility of their projections,’ the researchers write. ‘Some studies and the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report suggest that the recent 15-year period (1998–2012) provides evidence that models are overestimating current temperature evolution. ‘Such comparisons are not evidence against model trends because they represent only one realisation where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations.’ The scientists go on to say that climate models have actually been successful in estimating Pacific trend patterns with regards to El Nino and La Niña with surprising accuracy, albeit by accident. The research shows how the climate in the short term can be affected by weather patterns like El Niño and La Niña, but it does not disprove man-made climate change is occurring. The predictions of weather patterns by climate models isn’t perfect, as on occasion it has been a few years out, but nonetheless the anomalies in the models seem not to have been explained.","Study claims temp changes in the Pacific can help explain climate models .

"It was once a sanctuary of silence - where people went to escape the distractions of their home. But the modern library has been transformed into a noisy children's playground - thanks to countless schemes introduced to entice more visitors. Many people have now had enough and a campaign is underway to move Britain's libraries back to to their intended purpose as places of quiet reading. Scroll down for video . Change: The modern library has transformed into a noisy children's playground - thanks to countless schemes introduced to entice more visitors (picture posed by models) An article published in the Public Libraries News last month suggested that 'public librarians, perhaps in the reaction to the stereotypical 'shush' image have sometimes gone out their way to be louder and more energetic and, in doing so, have alienated some of its clientele and core audience.' Some authors, who have now put their weight behind the campaign, say the institutions are desperate to justify their existence in times of budget cuts, reports The Times. But they believe libraries have gone too far - with many now acting as creches, concert halls and dance class venues. Alan Gibbons, an award-winning children's authors said: 'Fashionable activities can retract from reading pleasure and that's right at the heart of what libraries should be about. Balance needed: Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has claimed libraries need to weigh up new community initiatives with the demands and expectations of their users . 'If the peripherals become more important than that, it becomes a problem.' Many libraries across the UK are now holding Baby Bounce and Rhyme sessions where toddlers experiment with percussion instruments while singing nursery rhymes. Cardiff's Central Library hosts music gigs every Saturday, Newcastle's City Library has a creche and the Library of Birmingham offers its own business club for budding entrepreneurs. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has claimed libraries need to balance new community initiatives with the demands and expectations of their users. There are 4,134 public libraries lending 262.7million books a year and there are 10.3million active book borrowers in Britain. But according to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's recent survey, the number of people using libraries declined by six per cent and book lending by 8.6 per cent last year. There are 4,134 public libraries lending 262.7million books a year and there are 10.3million active borrowers in Britain . Brian Ashley, Director Libraries Arts Council England said: 'There's a recurring theme in all of this which is that it's all about the age-old stereotype of libraries as a place where some forbidding person tells you to ""shut up"" or ""shhhh"", and it's frankly something that most of us who work in libraries would like to consign to history. 'Having said that, we know that many library users value them as spaces where they can be quiet and study or just reflect and we know that people see libraries as trusted safe spaces and that's a quality we would never want to lose.' In January 2011, it was revealed that more than 400 libraries were under threat of closure due to budget cuts - forcing library users to set up the Save Our Libraries Campaign. Phillip Pullman, author of His Dark Materials Trilogy which includes The Northern Lights, got behind the protest. So did Michael Morpurgo, the former children's laureate and author of War Horse, and Mark Haddon, who wrote The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night.

"Barcelona will take a one-goal advantage into the second leg of their last-16 Champions League clash against Manchester City following a 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium. Luis Suarez's first-half double was enough to hand the Catalan giants victory, as they take two valuable away goals into the second-leg clash on March 18 at the Nou Camp. Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his big match verdict to Tuesday night's events in Manchester. Luis Suarez celebrates the crucial first away goal for Barcelona after an emphatic finish past Joe Hart . Manuel Pellegrini wants his teams to play with two strikers. That’s his philosophy but it left Man City exposed, especially in the first half. They only played one striker in this fixture last year, so he clearly wanted to go on the offensive. But David Silva and Samir Nasri are not designed to chase and press teams. They needed one striker sitting deep but with two further forward and the City midfield chasing shadows, Barcelona could dominate. Manchester City playmaker David Silva (middle) is not the type of player to chase and press teams . Samir Nasri (middle) is another of those luxury players, like Silva . Playing against Barcelona, you don’t want to give anything away. But that’s exactly what the first goal was. A gift. It was far too easy for Luis Suarez. The second was not too good, either. Fernando was dragged wide and with no midfield protection, Vincent Kompany came flying out of the defensive line. That left space for Messi to drive into and once City started retreating, left back Jordi Alba bombed forward and was able to pick out his pass, which is not hard when the defenders are like mannequins. Six City players left Suarez unmarked as he notches Barcelona's second goal at the Etihad . Suarez, who scored only once in six games against City at Liverpool, was on song on his return to England . The 28-year-old, pictured scoring his second goal, was afforded too much space in crucial areas of the pitch . I thought we might have seen the best of Lionel Messi, but he was excellent. He receives the ball in positions where almost every player in the world would lay it off. It was the Messi of old — though I can’t remember Messi missing a penalty or spurning an open goal too often! Lionel Messi (middle) looks to go in between both David Silva (left) and Fernandinho (right) Messi (right) watches on as City stopped Hart does brilliantly to save his last-minute penalty . The 27-year-old then sent his headed rebound well wide - but despite that impressed for Barcelona on the night . It feels like another false dawn for City. Before the match all the talk was of how they can match Barca, but they were still short. They did well to get it back to 2-1 but it will be difficult at the Nou Camp. It seems that City’s quest for Champions League greatness is going to take longer than they thought. City trio Nasri (left), skipper Vincent Kompany (middle) and Fernando (right) look on despondently . Barcelona's front three were magnificent. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were all so willing to run straight at defenders. It was terrific to watch. With Suarez as a focal point in the middle, Neymar and Messi could cut inside onto their stronger foot and they tore into City. No longer do Barcelona just pass for the sake of it. They are more direct, can play on the counter and their current system is getting the best out of Messi and Neymar. Neymar, like Suarez and Messi, was in inspired form as Barcelona secured a impressive 2-1 win at City .","Barcelona beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday .

"Three hundred passengers and crew were still on the sinking cruise ship Concordia as its captain made his escape, the official report on the tragedy has revealed. Among other damning revelations in the 176-page dossier is that the coastguard were not alerted to the incident until they were phoned by a passenger’s mother. Half an hour after the collision, Captain Francesco Schettino had yet to put out a distress signal. Captain Francesco Schettino was at the command of the cruise liner in January 2012 when it hit rocks off the coast of Tuscany and sank, killing 32 people . But by this time a mother of one of . the passengers had informed police of an accident, after receiving a . call saying that the ship was in blackout, a ceiling had collapsed and . those on board were putting on their life jackets. Some 32 people died when the Costa . Cruises liner ran aground off the Italian island of Giglio in January . last year, hours after leaving Civitavecchia on the first leg of a . cruise round the Mediterranean. A catalogue of errors by 53-year-old . Schettino are documented in the dossier into the disaster by the Italian . maritime authorities. The captain caused the collision by . sailing too fast, too close to shore, and he was distracted by people . who had no business on the bridge, it found. He had failed to consult large-scale . maps, and used the wrong landmark on the island to turn the ship. He . then delayed sounding the general alarm, and when he did eventually . speak to the coastguard, downplayed the seriousness of  the incident. Passengers and crew were left to their fate by the captain of the cruise ship Concordia, the official report on the tragedy has revealed, while 80 were still fighting for their lives as the sea-master stood safely on shore . The report appears to demolish . Schettino’s claim that he saved thousands of lives by steering the ship . into shore, saying the crash caused the rudder to fail. Instead, a . detailed chronology reveals how he left his 4,228 passengers to fend for . themselves. At 9.45pm, the ship ran aground at a . rate of 16 knots. As the rocks tore a 150ft gash in the ship’s  belly, . the loud scrape and subsequent blackout made it obvious to everyone on . board that something was very wrong. Five watertight compartments were . immediately submerged, meaning the ship was doomed. But it took another 31 minutes for . Schettino to alert the authorities and it was not until an hour after . impact that the order to abandon ship was given. At 11.19pm, with 300 . passengers and crew still on board, the captain and officers abandoned . the bridge. Shortly afterwards, when coastguard officials called Schettino’s mobile phone, he had already slipped onto a lifeboat. A lifeboat is prepared after the ship run aground off Italian island Giglio's coast in January 2012. The report demolishes Schettino's claim that he saved thousands of lives, by steering the ship into shore . Schettino (centre) faces 20 years in prison for his part in the maritime disaster off the island off Giglio. Others were also at fault, the report found . He was ordered to return to his . vessel but continued towards shore. By the time he reached Giglio, 80 . passengers and crew were still struggling to stay alive on the sinking . vessel. Human error is ‘the root cause  of . the Costa Concordia casualty’, the report concludes, much of  it the . ‘inadequacy’ of the ship’s command and Schettino’s ‘unconventional . behaviour’.

"Bunny Hunter - real name Michelle Rovinsky - is making waves as unlikely advocate for guns, God, and gore. The 32-year-old Tampa, Florida, native, who boasts a substantial weapons collection and has a fondness for hunting, skinning and gutting her game, wants to be a better role model for women - and features in a new bTV segment to spread her message. 'Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus have no morals, they are terrible role models for young women,' says the 100lbs bleach-blonde firearms-enthusiast. 'I want to show women that you don’t have to act like a slut to get ahead.' Scroll down for video . Gun-ho: Bunny Hunter (pictured) - real name Michelle Rovinsky - is a 32-year-old firearms enthusiast and survivalist from Tampa, Florida, who is on a mission to be a good role model for young women . Hard-gore: Bunny is an avid hunter who has a fondness for hunting, skinning and gutting her game . 'Someone looks at me and they think, ""what a cute little Barbie,""' Bunny clucks, in a clip for her bTV appearance. 'Little do they know, they've got something coming their way if they try and mess with me.' And her cutesy appearance isn't just a coincidence; it's all part of her master plan. 'I see my make-up and clothes as kind of like camouflage,' she explains. 'People let . their guard down and I let them think I’m stupid if I want.' Bunny grew up in what she refers to affectionately as 'the gunshine state,' as part of a military family with four brothers. Most of friends are military too, she says; which helps keep Bunny sharp with 'up-to-date tactics.' Packing heat: 'I see my make-up and clothes as kind of like camouflage,' she explains. 'People let their guard down and I let them think I’m stupid if I want' Suspicious: Bunny is very concerned that the government is attempting to ban guns, which she points out are essential to protecting ourselves from a 'political uprising' She appears to be rigorously preparing for some sort of catastrophic national disaster, admitting on her website that she has read Chinese warfare bible 'The Art of War' from cover to cover 'countless times.' 'I want to show women that you don’t have to act like a slut to get ahead' 'The right to bear arms - it says right there in the constitution that it's in case of a political uprise from the government,' she tells bTV earnestly. 'I feel that a lot of the laws that have been passed or are trying to be passed have to do with that. The government is trying to strip us of our arms.' And they'll have a tough time wrenching the guns out of this feisty bombshell's steely grip.

'This God-fearing, patriotic country girl is striving to help restore this once proud land back to that which was originally envisioned by our Founding Fathers.' Bunny shot her first gun when she eight years old, and it was love at first bang. 'I was just elated,' she recalls. 'I couldn't have been happier.'

The family that plays together, stays together.' And of her own love life? Bunny has been single for six years, perhaps because of the drought of men she deems suitable.

"Disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile was given a key position running Broadmoor and personally selected managers, it was claimed last night. A former manager claimed that politicians and civil servants thought he was the ‘bee’s knees’ and appointed him to a task force to run the hospital in 1988. The Top Of The Pops presenter has since been unmasked as one of Britain’s most prolific sex offenders, but was ‘given the keys’ to Broadmoor. Savile had had a long association with the hospital, having been a volunteer worker there in the 1970s and 1980s with the unofficial title ‘honorary entertainments officer’. Serial abuser Jimmy Savile had considerable influence at Broadmoor, former staff have claimed . He had his own set of keys and living quarters on site and is accused of sexually abusing a number of patients. It is now claimed that he had a far bigger role than previously thought and was able to choose managers to run the hospital. He is also said to have been put in charge of a committee which examined the welfare of patients, even though the new management were given no say in his appointment. A manager who had close links to Broadmoor told a newspaper: ‘Savile was a national entertainer and was in charge of this psychiatric unit. I thought it was extraordinary, but the civil servants and the politicians apparently thought he was the bee’s knees.’ A female civil servant at the health department had complained to her boss that Savile had kissed her on the mouth before a meeting with Edwina Currie yet nothing was done. He was appointed by Mrs Currie, then a junior health minister, despite the fact he had no expertise in mental health. Sinister: The disgraced entertainer is also said to have been put in charge of a committee which examined the welfare of patients . The Broadmoor taskforce, which replaced the previous suspended management, was set up in August 1988. The Earl of Dundee told the House of Lords that Savile was ‘devoting his considerable talents to ensuring that the hospital functions smoothly’. Alan Franey, a taskforce member and later Broadmoor’s general manager, said: ‘Savile was appointed to the task force by Edwina Currie, but it would have been on the recommendation of civil servants. It was a bit odd.’ Cliff Graham, under-secretary at the Department of Health and an advocate for NHS change, recommended that Savile sit on the taskforce. Former Broadmoor staff recall being called to meetings with the DJ. Mr Franey said: ‘I had an unusual meeting in the Athenaeum Club in London [Jimmy Savile and Cliff Graham were present]... and I was persuaded that a move to Broadmoor would be a good career step.’ The late David Edmond, the first chairman of the Special Hospitals Service Authority (SHSA), recalled: ‘I [was] asked to a strange meeting at Stoke Mandeville Hospital with Cliff Graham, Jimmy Savile, a retired Department of Health senior civil servant and other department officials...’ Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe with Jimmy Savile and Frank Bruno at Broadmoor. The former DJ had no expertise in mental health . One manager at the hospital reflected on Savile’s influence: ‘We were told that he was a valuable asset, that he was well thought of in high circles in the Department of Health and it was important we got on good terms and that we cultivated what he had to offer. ‘Cliff Graham quite explicitly told me those things and said much the same to David Edmond.’ Mr Franey added that Mr Graham was in favour of Savile. He said: ‘Savile’s connections were significant. Everyone knew of the close friendship between Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, and Savile, whom she regularly invited to Chequers.’ There is no suggestion that Mr Franey or any of the civil servants and politicians had any knowledge of Savile’s abuse. Staff at the hospital said they reported issues to management, but nothing was done. Richard Harrison, a psychiatric nurse at Broadmoor for 30 years, said of Savile’s appointment: ‘The lunatics have taken over the asylum.’ He added: ‘I considered him, as many of my colleagues did, as a man with a severe personality disorder and a liking for children.’ Bob Allen, a former nurse, said he saw Savile take a girl who looked 14 or 15 years old into his house. When he reported it, his supervisor said: ‘No one appears to be interested.’ Last night, Broadmoor did not respond to requests for a comment.","Sex offender had huge influence on the way hospital was run .

"A former parliamentary secretary of George Galloway has been spared jail despite convincing her anti-terror police husband to illegally access emails for her. Aisha Ali-Khan, 34, was given a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting that she had encouraged husband Mohammed Afiz Khan, 46, to obtain people's private details. Ali-Khan, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, made the request in an attempt to identify individuals who had posted offensive material on the internet and sent her emails on or about August 24 2012. Alish Ali-Khan, 34, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting she convinced her police officer-husband, Mohammed Afiz Khan, 46, to illegally access emails and other personal data . Sentencing her at London’s Southwark Crown Court today, the Recorder of Westminster Alastair McCreath said: 'I accept that your criminality arises in circumstances where you were offended, and justifiably so, by someone putting material on the internet that was offensive to you. 'The request was unlawful. Whilst what you did was against the law, the request was understandable and led to nothing. 'Punishment as such is inappropriate - you must behave yourself for the next 12 months when this will be discharged.' Her husband was also sentenced today to six months in jail, suspended for two years, and charged £500 costs after he pleaded guilty to two charges of misconduct. In December  he pleaded guilty to using his position in the Metropolitan Police to pass details of the arrest of radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary to his wife while she was employed by Mr Galloway on or around May 22, 2012. He also admitted to obtaining CCTV from South Yorkshire Police between March 16 and April 30, 2012, which the court heard was 'for private purposes to do with jealousy and uncertainty about your relationship.' Khan was sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years and ordered to pay £500 costs after admitting two charges of misconduct. He has also been sacked from his job as an anti-terror officer . Khan admitted obtaining details about the arrest of radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary for his wife while she was working as a parliamentary assistant for George Galloway (pictured) Khan was suspended by the Met Police in July last year after he was charged, and has now been sacked from the force. Speaking about the information on Choudary's arrest, the judge said: 'The object of Mr Khan to gain this information was to assist Ms Ali-Khan and that she might be able to bolster her position as Mr Galloway’s assistant.' He added that the breach should cast no aspersions on Mr Galloway. Caroline Haughey, defending Khan, told the court that Khan felt 'enormous shame' in having thrown away a 25-year career in a job that he 'worshipped'. She said: 'He feels he has betrayed the Metropolitan Police Service, the police generally, the public, his family and the community by his stupidity. 'These offences were motivated by his heart rather than his head.' Ms Haughey added that he felt 'great shame and sadness' that his father had died watching his downfall. She said: 'There was no financial gain. He has lost his job, lost his pension and lost his self-respect. The only gain from it was to his own jealous mind. It was an ego trip by him and his partner.'","Aisha Al-Khan, 34, sentenced to 12-month conditional discharge today .

"Alan Pardew is mad and bad? Rubbish. This is a bold and clever decision and the right time for him to escape from Newcastle. He can leave knowing he has done a good job in difficult circumstances. Not a brilliant job. He didn’t win them a trophy. But nor did Bobby Robson. Or Ruud Gullit. Or Kenny Dalglish. Or Kevin Keegan. Or Graeme Souness. Or Alan Shearer. Think of how decorated they all were as players, but they could not lift Newcastle to the heights their supporters demand. It is 45 years since Newcastle won a trophy, but Pardew finished fifth in his best season in the Barclays Premier League and consolidated their position, with a pretty average team and a club that sells its best players. Alan Pardew spent four turbulent years as Newcastle manager before leaving the club on Monday . Club legend Kevin Keegan spent two spells as Newcastle manager and narrowly missed out on the title . Last time it was Yohan Cabaye, next time it will be Moussa Sissoko. There is only so much a man can take. He was manager of the month last month, having lifted Newcastle from the foot of the table with a six-game winning run, before losing 1-0 at West Ham on November 29. Since then, they have beaten leaders Chelsea — the only team to do so this season — but lost 1-0 at home to Sunderland. It is typical of their frustrating, rollercoaster form. Alan was always a couple of wins from a crisis. Former Newcastle managers sir Bobby Robson and Alan Shearer failed to bring silverware to the club . Kenny Dalglish was only boss at Newcastle for a year and a half before leaving in the summer of 1998 . Ruud Gullit replaced Dalglish in the Newcastle dugout but only last a year in the hot seat at St James' Park . The Newcastle fans created a 'sack Pardew' campaign which was at it's strongest this season . Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals. The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season. Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match). The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay. Pardew played every minute of both matches. Two defeats and the ‘Pardew Out’ brigade demand their say; their banners ready to be unfurled again. ‘Pardew is a Muppet’ one banner derided. He behaved with dignity and turned them around, but never really won them over. Do not underestimate the lure of London for someone born in Wimbledon — and the chance to return to a club where he is admired and respected and where he will feel supported. At Newcastle — potentially a powerhouse football club — Pardew may have received an eight-year contract, but did he ever really feel like the man they wanted? I can’t hear too many Newcastle fans complaining about his departure, but there are some in football who are questioning his motives. ‘Why is he leaving a big club for a small club? He must be crazy.’ The Newcastle fans wanted Pardew out after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign . Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over Liverpool in the FA Cup back in 1990 . But, as a manager — and it’s the same as a player — you know when your time is up. This is good timing for Alan and he is joining a good club. Yes, Palace are a smaller club than Newcastle (and they are 10 points worse off) but he will revel in the freedom of a job where he can actually manage. I wish him well. Palace have been interested before, but this was the right time. Yes, he faces a relegation battle but he enters a transfer window with an owner who will listen to his ideas. In the end, you go where you’re wanted.

"Sam Allardyce turns 60 on Sunday. This season he’s proving that you are never too old to learn new tricks. From being booed off the pitch last season to winning in style this time around, things have changed dramatically at West Ham. The football has been transformed and with that, so has the mood at Upton Park. For Big Sam, so often associated with pragmatic, long-ball football, it has been the biggest turnaround in 20 years of management. His team have been playing with style, pace and, most importantly, are getting the results to go with it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sam Allardyce: Players need to prove why I should select them . Sam Allardyce has transformed West Ham into a team worth watching after a period of criticism . New signing Diafra Sakho (left) celebrates with team-mate Stewart Downing (centre) after scoring against QPR . West Ham bought well in the summer and while it’s always easier to play good football with better players, you can’t over-estimate how important the manager is. Compared to this time last year, there were eight new starters in West Ham’s last fixture, so credit to the manager for bedding in those new faces so quickly. With Neil McDonald — a colleague of mine at Everton, where passing football was always the mantra — and Teddy Sheringham on the staff, the balance has now been tipped. Who would have thought that we would be talking about Sam using midfield diamonds and 4-3-3s? He has shown great tactical awareness and flexibility and the fans and the players are loving it. Morgan Amalfitano celebrates after wrapping up a 3-1 victory against Liverpool last month . Allardyce must have been the only man in the country who thought Stewart Downing could play as a No 10 at the tip of a midfield diamond. It was a masterstroke and Downing is a player reborn. We talk about Brendan Rodgers’ tactical ability at Anfield but Downing will have loved wiping the smile off his face when West Ham beat Liverpool 3-1. Downing has now almost become a barometer for how the team performs. He has created the most chances in the League — level with Cesc Fabregas on 22 — and has made almost twice as many passes per game as last season. He is playing with a smile on his face and giving everything for the cause — something West Ham fans demand as a bare minimum. With players such as Alex Song, who has spent most of his career playing passing football, Allardyce has seen the way forward and it’s as if he now trusts his side to get the ball down and play. The defence has been consistent and it’s good to see two young English full backs getting their chance. With Alex Song now back in full flow, it is obvious Allardyce wants to get the ball down and play . Carl Jenkinson has the potential to be a top player and Aaron Cresswell is a shining example to any young English professional. Released by Liverpool at youth level, he kept going, worked his way up via Tranmere and Ipswich and is now carving out a career at the top level. Of course it always helps when you have players who score goals. You almost expect West Ham to score whenever Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho are on the pitch. They are players who create a real buzz among the fans. The atmosphere at Upton Park is in sharp contrast to last season when it became an ordeal to play at home. It’s a tough ground and the fans expect their side to play ‘the West Ham way’. It was similar for Allardyce at Newcastle where he was almost driven out because of the fans’ expectations of style. That experience has helped him at West Ham and he has adapted. It’s still early days and if improvements don’t continue things could take a turn for the worse. So let’s hope West Ham fans can enjoy the positive play for a long time to come. It has been a huge change in mood at Upton Park since last season, with fans enjoying what they're seeing . PS . I was at the National Football Museum this week to see, among others, Patrick Vieira, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen inducted into the Hall of Fame. Many worthy people were honoured and we paid tribute to the Preston Invincibles of the 1880s. This week was also the tenth anniversary of Arsenal’s Invincibles, so let’s hope they don’t leave it more than 100 years to honour that team!

"People say it’s only the Capital One Cup, but this could be one of the games of the season. There is a Wembley final at stake and the bigger picture to think about. If Chelsea win, they move on and can take a big step towards the title if they beat Man City on Saturday and a Liverpool win could inspire the rest of their season. Dejan Lovren (left) posted an Instagram picture of him and Mario Balotelli on the train to London . The Liverpool players will be hoping to continue their resurgent form against Chelsea on Tuesday night . HOW CHELSEA CAN WIN IT . Jose Mourinho reverted to type at Anfield. It didn’t work. He loves being the underdog and tends to be more defensive in the big games, but playing Jon Obi Mikel as an extra midfield shield has not worked. This Chelsea team is just not built to play defensively. For Jose attack is definitely the best form of defence. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see Liverpool’s weakness is at the back, and I fully expect Mourinho to name his strongest team on Tuesday night. As we saw at Swansea, when they are let off the leash, they are almost unstoppable. When Chelsea are let off the leash, they are almost unstoppable - attack is the best form of defence . HOW LIVERPOOL CAN WIN . After letting in five at Spurs and four against Bradford, there will be doubts creeping into the minds of Chelsea players and fans alike. Liverpool must prey on that. They will have to be patient but their system caused Chelsea problems last week. Steven Gerrard was rested on Saturday so should start and I’d like to see him playing in an advanced role again. If he and Philippe Coutinho can keep Nemanja Matic occupied, then that might tempt John Terry or Gary Cahill to step out and deal with him, as our pitch map shows. If that happens, that leaves Raheem Sterling with a one-on-one situation. After the way he played last week, that is the last thing Chelsea will want. Liverpool must try and occupy Chelsea defenders to get Raheem Sterling into one-on-one situations . JOHN TERRY & GARY CAHILL v RAHEEM STERLING . Sterling terrorised these two in the first leg and took his goal so well. He is one of the fastest players in the league and if Liverpool can get their main man driving at the heart of the Chelsea defence, then they are in with a real chance. NEMANJA MATIC v STEVEN GERRARD & PHILIPPE COUTINHO . Matic is the solid foundation on which Chelsea build all their attacks, but he will not be getting much help from Cesc Fabregas. Matic can’t be in two places at once and if Liverpool’s midfield men can isolate him, they will be able to find spaces either side to try and open up their opponents. Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho could hold the key in isolating Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge . OSCAR v LUCAS . He might not get praised like some of his team-mates, but Oscar is a silent assassin. If I were facing Chelsea, he is the one I would be most scared of. He sparks much of Chelsea’s best work and because of their forward players’ fluid movement, you can’t mark man for man. That’s why Lucas has such an important role. Oscar is Chelsea's silent assassin, he sparks much of Chelsea's best work . Lucas Leiva will have a tricky task in trying to mark his fellow Brazlian on Tuesday night .","Chelsea host Liverpool in their Capital One Cup semi-final second leg .

"Iraqi insurgents executed at least 160 prisoners in just four days in the northern city of Tikrit, according to a human rights group which cited analysis of satellite imagery and shocking photographs released by the militants. The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) killed between 160 and 190 men in two locations in Tikrit between June 11 and June 14. The group has compiled a series of graphics documenting the massacres after painstakingly cross-referencing landmarks and individuals from various satellite images with pictures posted online by ISIS. 'The number of victims may well be much higher, but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation,' it said. After overrunning large swaths of northern Iraq and capturing the cities of Mosul and Tikrit earlier this month, the Islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers onto flatbed trucks. They were then forced to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs while apparently being shot in the head. A final set of photos shows bodies piled up. Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement: 'The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation.' Scroll down for video . Forensic analysis: Human Rights Watch has produced a series of graphics like this which they say document the execution of at least 160 Iraqi prisoners in two locations in Tikrit over four days after cross-referencing landmarks and individuals in images posted by ISIS with satellite photographs . The U.S.-based group said militants from ISIS killed between 160 and 190 men in two locations in Tikrit between June 11 and June 14. The first location where two trenches were dug, is seen above . Forensic: HRW said satellite imagery of the site from June 16 (right) did not reveal bodies, but showed indications of vehicles and earth movement when compared with an image from 2013 . Sunni prisoners are being summarily executed by government forces in much the same way as insurgents have been exacting on captured Iraqis, it was claimed today. Amnesty International says it has evidence of a pattern of dozens of executions of detainees by Iraqi troops and Shia militias in the cities of Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba. Surviving detainees and relatives of those killed gave graphic accounts that suggest Iraqi forces had carried out a series of vengeful attacks against Sunni detainees before withdrawing from Tal Afar and Mosul in northern Iraq, the Amnesty report said. Amnesty International's Senior Crisis Response Adviser Donatella Rovera, said: 'Reports of multiple incidents where Sunni detainees have been killed in cold blood while in the custody of Iraqi forces are deeply alarming. 'Those among the warring parties in Iraq who are committing war crimes should know that the impunity they currently enjoy won’t last forever and that they may one day be held accountable for their crimes.' The rights group located two of the . trenches filled with bodies at the first location by cross-checking against ground features . and landmarks in the photographs released by ISIS. HRW said that using . satellite imagery from 2013 and publicly available photos taken earlier, . it was able to pinpoint the execution site in a field near a former . palace of the late dictator Saddam Hussein, next to the Tigris river. It . said satellite imagery of the site from June 16 did not reveal bodies, . but showed indications of vehicles and earth movement consistent with . the two shallow trenches visible in the photos. HRW counted the bodies visible in the available photographs, and estimated that ISIS killed between 90 and 110 men in one trench and between 35 and 40 men in the second. A further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot at a second site but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site. Chief Iraqi military spokesman Lt Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the authenticity of the pictures on June 15, after they first surfaced, and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured Iraqi soldiers in areas held by the Islamic State. Graphic: Photos from one of the trenches at the first execution site show ISIS fighters forcing prisoners to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs . Shock tactics: The massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in Iraq's armed forces - which melted away as ISIS seized much of the north in a matter of days . Grim: The Islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers onto flatbed trucks. Human Rights Watch have even estimated the time of executions by studying the length of the shadows . He told The Associated Press at the . time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that . about 170 soldiers were shot dead after their capture. Captions . on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say 'hundreds . have been liquidated', but the total could not be verified. The . massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in Iraq's demoralised . armed forces - which melted away as militants seized much of the north . in a matter of days - as well as the country's Shiite majority, whom the . Islamic State views as apostates. 'This . is the fate that awaits the Shiites sent by Nouri to fight the Sunnis,' one caption read, apparently referring to Prime Minister Nouri . al-Maliki. The rapid advance of the . Islamic State and allied Sunni militants has ignited sectarian tensions, . with heavily armed Shiite militias vowing to defend Baghdad and revered . shrine cities to the south. Macabre: These images show prisoners being shot by ISIS gunmen after being forced to lie face-down in a ditch at the second of the two locations in Tikrit . Painstaking: By cross-referencing landmarks in these images with satellite data, the group was able to pinpoint the location of the first execution site . On . Thursday, a bombing killed 12 people in a Shiite neighborhood of . Baghdad that houses a revered shrine, and police found the . bullet-riddled bodies of eight Sunnis south of the capital. Prominent . Shiite leaders are meanwhile pushing for the removal of al-Maliki, who . has come under mounting pressure to reach out to the country's . disaffected Sunni and Kurdish minorities and rapidly form a unified . government following April's parliamentary elections. Even al-Maliki's most important ally, neighboring Iran, is said to be looking at alternatives. A . senior Iranian general who met with Shi'ite politicians in Iraq during a . 10-day visit this month returned home with a list of potential prime . minister candidates for Iran's leadership to consider, several senior . Iraqi Shi'ite politicians who have knowledge of the general's meetings . told The Associated Press on Thursday. The . general, Ghasem Soleimani, is expected to return within days to inform . Iraqi politicians of Tehran's favorite, they said, speaking on condition . of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations. Reconstruction: Again, in this image, the human rights group were able to accurately locate the position of two trucks based on landmarks in the background . Evidence: Analysis of these pictures suggests the militants may have taken the truck used to transport the prisoners from a government depot . The . rapid advance of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in the north . as well as the restive western Anbar province has plunged Iraq into its . worst crisis since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011 and raised fears of a . region-wide conflict. The . radical group has carved out a self-styled Islamic state straddling the . Syrian-Iraqi border, where it has imposed a brutal version of Shariah . law. Russia's U.N. ambassador said Thursday that there is a real prospect of a terrorist . state springing up from Syria's second-largest city Aleppo to Iraq's . capital Baghdad. Vitaly Churkin, the current president of the U.N. Security Council, said he told the 14 other council members that a terrorist state 'is a very, very serious prospect' that the council needs to address 'because really we are lagging behind... in our responses.' He argued that Russia's support for President Bashar Assad's government in Syria was aimed at preventing the Islamic State from taking over. The United States is also looking to Syria, with President Barack Obama requesting $500 million to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels in the hopes of opening up a new front against the Islamic State, which has been at war with other Islamic and secular rebel groups since the start of the year. The rebel groups turned on the Islamic State because of its alleged brutality toward rivals and activists. Massacres like the one depicted in the online photos from Iraq could alienate some Sunnis while emboldening the armed forces and Shi'ite militias.","Human Rights Watch said Sunni militants executed 160 to 190 men at two locations in Tikrit from June 11 to June 14 .

"A Wyoming couple is charged with felony child abuse for allegedly locking a seven-year-old in an outdoor cage for three weeks as punishment. Jena Harman, the child's mother, and her . boyfriend, Alexander Smith, each face up to 20 years jail for allegedly . caging the child outside their Laramie, Wyoming, home. Police said the child was forced to live in a six-by-six-foot wooden box where he/she ate once a day, slept on a cot and went to the toilet in a five-gallon bucket. The child, whose gender was not identified by . authorities,  was also sprayed with a hose while inside the cage and ordered to sleep outside during thunderstorms, Laramie Boomerang reported. Scroll down for video . Pictured: Wyoming authorities are pressing felony charges against Alexander Smith (left) and Jena Harman (right) who allegedly locked Harman's child in a cage for three weeks . The cage: The Wyoming couple allegedly locked the seven-year-old in this wooden cage outside their home for about three weeks as punishment . 9NEWS reported Harman and Smith each face one count of child abuse and three counts of felonious restraint. They were arrested on July 24 after Albany County Sheriff's deputies responded to a tip that the child was caged outside a remote Fox Creek Road home. However that was not the couple's first contact with authorities. Citing an affidavit, 9NEWS reported the family had eight contacts with authorities since February, but the child remained at home. The child's school had complained to the sheriff's office several times, saying the child missed 18 days of school and at times showed up with bruises and a limp. However the sheriff's office said the . reports were unfounded, even though deputies witnessed the child pulling . food out of a garbage can and eating it, the affidavit states. Neighbors told 9NEWS they saw the abuse but didn't report it because they were scared of Smith, a truck driver. The Albany County Sheriff's Office would not provide comment to 9NEWS. Scene: Neighbors said they saw the couple abuse the seven-year-old boy at the Laramie, Wyoming property (pictured), but were afraid of Jena Harman's boyfriend Alexander Smith . Child psychologists told 9NEWS the child is likely to suffer a lifetime of anxiety, depression and anger following his horrific alleged abuse. The cage the child lived in was . made from cattle paneling and wooden snow fence with plywood . covering half of the opening. A metal chain and 'dog-leash-style . latch' were allegedly used to keep the child locked in with some clothing, books, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a bucket. According . to court documents, the child spent most of the time inside the cage, including to use . the restroom. The child ate once a day - if Harman remembered to bring food. Harman released the seven-year-old from the cage when Smith was not around, according to police. Smith lived in a camper near the home. According to an affidavit, Harman told deputies she and Smith kept the child in the 'playpen' because the seven-year-old 'was constantly doing bad things'. Isolated: The cage was on Harman's isolated property on Fox Creek Rd in Laramie, Wyoming . Smith told deputies he disliked the child but wanted to keep the juvenile safe in a cage. Smith said the child appeared to like the cage. When the child was allowed in the house, they were forced to sleep on the floor. The dog slept on the couch. The child told investigators that peeing outside was allowed, but had to hold on to 'poop' until the family could go 'into town', the affidavit stated. Smith and Harman remain in custody on a $100,000 cash bond at the Albany County Detention Center in Laramie, Wyoming. Smith faces a circuit court hearing on Thursday while Harman has been bound over to district court. The child is now in the state's custody.​ .","Mother Jena Harman and Harman's boyfriend, Alexander Smith, are charged with felony child abuse .

"A British soldier surprised his bride-to-be with a wedding ring he made by hand from an old penny he found in Afghanistan. Bombardier Ben McDowell surprised his fiancee Jolene Riley with a unique wedding band that he meticulously carved while he was on tour in Afghanistan. The 19-year-old couldn’t believe it when Ben got down on one knee, after just 10-months together, and popped the question during two-weeks of leave last month. Dedication: Bombardier Ben McDowell surprised his fiancee Jolene Riley with a unique wedding band that he made himself while he was on tour in Afghanistan - from a local penny . The Afghan penny the soldier used to create the ring . But she got an even bigger surprise when the 24-year-old showed her the unique wedding band he had carved from an Afghan coin using a rock, hammer and a metal file. Mr McDowell, who serves in the Royal Artillery, beat the edges of the coin with the rock and hammer until the edges were raised, then drilled through the middle before shaping it with a metal file - a process which took three months. Sentimental warrior: Mr McDowell on patrol in the war-torn nation . She said: 'Before Ben left for his nine month tour of Afghanistan, he asked me what I wanted for Christmas. 'I don’t like him spending money on me, so I thought of the cheapest thing I could think of and asked for a penny from Afghanistan as a sentimental gift. 'That’s the only thing I have ever asked for from him, but obviously his mind went into overdrive and he thought up this amazing surprise. 'He isn’t usually the romantic type so everyone has been completely shocked by what he has done. 'He proposed as soon as we got back to his house when he got home from Afghanistan. We had been stuck in the car for hours, and it was 1.15am by the time we got home. 'I wasn’t expecting it at all, but he was so nervous - his whole body was shaking.' Miss Riley, from Sutton-in-Craven, North Yorkshire, fell for soldier Ben after the pair started talking online in June last year. She added: 'It was undoubtedly love at first sight from the very first time I met Ben. 'I even proposed to him while he was away in Afghanistan but he said it wasn’t a proper proposal, and he wanted to do everything right. 'So I was gobsmacked when he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.' After painstakingly carving the ring he sent it back to UK jewellers Serendipity Diamonds to be gold-plated. Dedication: The soldier hit the coin with a hammer and rock to create a 'lip' which would become the ring . The process took three months from start to finish . Hole lot of money: The coin is clamped down and drilled through . Nearly there: Mr McDowell then filed the coin into shape . Miss Riley said: 'It is just so amazing, and it means so much more to me knowing how much thought he has put into it. 'It is something unique that I can treasure for ever. 'You don’t often hear stories like this - and now it is a story I can tell people for the rest of my life.' A spokesperson from Serendipity Diamonds, based in Portsmouth, said: 'Our part in this involved just a little help adjusting the ring to the correct finger size. 'We also applied the final polish to complete the ring. It was quite remarkable, and what a story to connect to a wedding ring.' Jolene Riley with the ring.

"President Obama has told Americans that they can still sign up for health insurance 'the old fashioned way' to avoid the problem-prone website, but now callers are being greeted by busy signals in spite of the extra staff that have been sent to call centers. He went on the defensive today during a press conference as he argued that the 'kinks' in the heathcare website need to be ironed out but his administration is pushing for shoppers to sign up online. 'There's no sugar-coating it: the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and no one has been more frustrated by it than me,' President Obama said. Scroll down for video . Calming fears: President Obama did his best today to brace the tension that has arisen over the malfunctioning website where Americans are directed to sign up for national health insurance . He stressed that the White House have had 'some of the country's best tech talent join the team' and they are working overtime to help fix the problems. The website 'hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work. The . number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming which has . aggravated some of these existing problems,' Obama said. Since being elected to office in 2008, President Obama’s administration has prided itself on their tech-savvy ways making the disappointing website a source of embarrassment- and an expensive one at that as it was said to cost $394 million to build. Though they have been tight-lipped regarding the actual numbers of prospective buyers who have visited the website, today the President revealed that nearly 20 million people have visited the website since it was unveiled on October 1. Of those visitors, half a million people have successfully put through their applications for insurance, though that means that the number of people who have gotten insurance through those applications is much higher as many of the applications cover multiple people within one family. Friendly faces: The President surrounded himself with people who had successfully signed up for health insurance using the Affordable Care Act website . The President's remarks came the same day as healthcare administrators tried to push citizens to sign up for health insurance by phone to avoid using the buggy website. In addition to the sizable green button prompting visitors to Apply Online, they also now have an option to click on a button suggesting they Apply By Phone. The button directs users to a 1-800 number that is 'available 24/7'. That solution does not appear to be a . solution at all as a number of tests by journalists ended with busy . signals or dropped calls. Others . in the 36 states that have their own state health insurance . marketplaces are directed to call the individual numbers of those sites. The same kind of treatment is found on the website, as applicable users are directed to their state's individual website for health insurance sales after typing in their zip code. 'While the website will ultimately be the easiest way to buy insurance, it is not the only way,' President Obama said. Addressing the problem: Obama said that have had 'some of the country's best tech talent join the team' Under scrutiny: The Department of Health and Human Services, headed by Kathleen Sebelius, has been criticized for the slow website that cost an estimated $634m to build . He went on to suggest that part of the reason why people have grown so frustrated by the process is because they have 'forgotten what it's like to buy insurance'. He used the press conference as an opportunity to highlight some success stories, surrounding himself by a crowd of happy customers who waited out the length virtual process but eventually were able to sign up and save money. He took a minute to chide his Republican colleagues, many who he said have been using their fight against the Affordable Care Act as their sole uniting cause. 'It's time for folks to stop rooting for its failure because hard working middle class families are rooting for its success,' he said.","President Obama held a press conference Monday to urge Americans to use alternative enrollment methods due to the slow website .

"In the battle against poachers, conservationists have become embroiled in a technological arms race. And now Instagram is being used as a weapon. Recent reports suggest poachers are increasingly using geo-tagged photos on the site, and other social media networks, to quickly track down their prey. A photo posted on Twitter this week by Eleni de Wet in South Africa reveals just how much of a concern geo-tagged tourist photos have become. This photo posted on Twitter by Eleni de Wet in South Africa reveals just how much of a concern geo-tagged tourist photos have become in the battle against poachers . 2013 was the worst year on record for . rhino poaching in South Africa, with 1004 illegally killed, according to . South African Department of Environmental Affairs figures released in . January. This means nearly . three rhinos were poached every day, representing more than a 150 per . cent increase on the number killed in 2012 - and a 3000 per cent . increase since 2007. Prince . William recently declared he would like to destroy the royal collection . of ivory as a way of taking a stand against the slaughter. Rhino . horns, which can earn as much as £11,800 ($20,000) per kilogram on the . black market, are believed to cure a number of illnesses and ailments, . including poisoning, hallucinations, typhoid, carbuncles, cancer, fever, . and boils. ‘The method is to send a young couple on safari with a GPS-enabled smartphone, which they use to take a photo of the rhino,’ said Marc Reading, whose marketing and communications company represents South Africa’s national parks, in an interview with the Sunday Times. ‘The exact co-ordinates are attached to the picture, allowing poachers to come in after dark and track the animal.’ The problem is that many images on some social media sites are automatically geo-tagged without the photographer realising they’ve revealed the coordinates of where the photo was taken, according to a report in Quartz. The battle between poachers and conservationists has also taken the form of hackers trying to get access . to the GPS data of a Bengal tiger. Meanwhile drones – which are being used to track poachers – and also being used by the poachers themselves to hunt animals. In 2013, nearly three rhinos were poached every day, representing more than a 150 per cent increase on the number killed in 2012 . In New Mexico, the state Game Commission is set to vote this month on a proposal that would make it illegal to use drones to signal an animal's location.

"When Adriano Galliani, the chief executive of AC Milan, sold Mario Balotelli to Liverpool for £16m, he told friends it had ‘felt like winning the lottery’. Balotelli’s agent Mino Raiola had done a number on Liverpool, telling them that he could get the Italian forward out of Milan on the cheap. In their desperation to replace Luis Suarez, they fell for it. In return, Raiola’s pockets were lined and Liverpool are even understood to have added the five per cent (£800,000) solidarity fee, which is paid to his former clubs, as part of the package.

Balotelli has a drink from a can of Red Bull during his spell on the sideline on Monday night . It will cost Liverpool a lot of money to get shot of him this month, but fronting up and accepting that they have made a mistake with him is the best thing they can do. Chelsea persisted and persisted with Fernando Torres after they bought him from Liverpool for £50m in 2011, picking up his wages for nearly four years in the hope that it would all come right eventually. It rarely does. Robbie Keane lasted just six months at Liverpool before he returned to his selling club Tottenham. It happens and players can be moved on. Finding a buyer for Balotelli in this transfer window, or any other for that matter, will not be easy for Liverpool’s chief executive Ian Ayre. The days when he was man of the moment, winning the prestigious Golden Boy award in 2010 after being voted the best young player in Europe, are long gone. Balotelli has scored twice for Liverpool, once in the Champions League against Ludogorets and another in the Capital One Cup against Swansea City since his arrival from the San Siro. Clearly Liverpool expected more. Fernando Torres, pictured against Southampton in 2013, struggled after leaving Liverpool for Chelsea .

On Monday evening, in an FA Cup third-round tie at AFC Wimbledon, who are 12th in League Two, Balotelli could not get a game ahead of Rickie Lambert. Even after his appearance as a substitute there was a report that he flounced off when he was told to warm down on the pitch at the Kingsmeadow with one of Liverpool’s fitness coaches. Everybody has tried and failed with Balotelli: Roberto Mancini (twice), Jose Mourinho, Massimiliano Allegri, Clarence Seedorf, Cesare Prandelli and Antonio Conte. When a manager with Mourinho’s stature cannot get through to him, you do have to wonder what Brendan Rodgers was thinking when he agreed to sign the forward. Balotelli is not about to come good. Everybody has their own favourite Balotelli story, but the trouble is that none of them reflect well on him. Balotelli is snapped by photographers as he walks out onto the pitch for the pre-match warm-up on Monday . Balotelli listens to assistant manager Colin Pascoe (right) as he prepares to come on as a substitute . Mourinho has refined his story about Balotelli’s dismissal against Rubin Kazan in the Champions League over the years, but remove the poetic licence and the sentiment is clear. ‘Mario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute (it was actually the 20th), so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario. 'I said to him: “Mario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers (he had named two keepers) on the bench, so don't touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.” 'The 46th minute – red card!' (He was actually sent off in the 60th). When he was a player at Manchester City, club officials were not even certain that he would turn up at Villa Park to play Chelsea in the Community Shield in 2012 because it coincided with his birthday. Balotelli had been out with friends the night before and when he eventually arrived, Mancini did not even name him on the bench. Most recently Conte, who replaced Prandelli as Italy coach after the 2014 World Cup, sent him home early from international duty. He told Balotelli he will not be selected again. Jose Mourinho talks to Balotelli during Inter Milan's Serie A match against Palermo in 2009 . Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini gestures towards Balotelli during a match in 2012 . Rodgers looks towards Balotelli during Liverpool's match against Aston Villa last September . Since his return from the suspension imposed on him by the FA following his offensive re-tweet, his status within the dressing room has shifted markedly. Rodgers had always maintained that Balotelli has never caused him a moment’s trouble since his arrival from Milan and consistently claims that the forward is working hard to improve. In recent weeks, though, the Liverpool manager has admitted that Balotelli has struggled to adapt to the team’s ethos of a high-pressing game. Instead he has played Raheem Sterling in a central role, with some success after a false start in the 3-0 defeat against Manchester United at Old Trafford just before the turn of the year. At the front of house, Rodgers continues to believe in Balotelli and yet the task behind the scenes is to convince the forward that Anfield is not quite for him. If they can make the numbers work, now is the time to let him go.","Mario Balotelli was sold by AC Milan to Liverpool for £16million .

"Bernie Ecclestone has suggested Formula One is poised for a dramatic change should a number of cash-strapped teams go to the wall over the winter. The likes of Sauber, Marussia and Caterham are currently teetering on the brink of extinction as a result of rising, unchecked costs associated with running their teams. To that extent, plans have been aired at recent meetings with regard to the prospect of eight, three-car teams being on the grid in 2015. Bernie Ecclestone has suggested three-car teams should a number of cash-strapped teams go to the wall . Speaking at a promotional event in Singapore ahead of this weekend's race around the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Ecclestone said: 'It has always been on the cards if we lose up to three teams the others will run three cars. 'I think we should do it anyway. I would rather see Ferrari with three cars, or any of the other top teams with three cars, than having teams that are struggling.' Asked whether such a concept could happen next year, Ecclestone added: 'We'll know after the next two or three races, but it is being looked at.' One suggestion is for the back-of-the-grid teams to be provided with financial assistance to overcome their current difficulties. But as Ecclestone states, it has been the way of F1 over the years that teams have come and gone - many for financial reasons. 'I've been around - most people would say too long - but long enough to know there are always people at the back of the grid,' remarked the 83-year-old. 'The trouble with the teams - which is all normal - they think of themselves short term. 'You ask about next year, but they're worried about the next race, which is the problem.' Sauber, Marussia and Caterham are currently teetering on the brink of extinction because of costs . Another issue for Ecclestone to resolve is whether to continue with the controversial double-points system for the final race of a year. The season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November will serve as the acid test of whether the concept loathed by the majority of fans has worked. Successful or not, though, it could be the system is axed regardless. Ecclestone added: 'I wanted it (double points) to be for the last three races. 'Then people would believe it still possible somebody else could win, but everyone said I was mad, so we won't do it. 'As for keeping it for the last race, I don't know. Probably not. We can't yet see whether it has worked, it depends. 'It just seemed to me the right way to keep the championship open, otherwise for the last three or four races people are running in non-championship races.' Ecclestone, meanwhile, has suggested more measures may be taken to make a driver's life more difficult over the course of a grand prix weekend. Ecclestone's remarks follow a suggestion of his coming into force from this weekend's race - the banning of certain types of radio messages. Commercial supremo Ecclestone talks to former Formula One driver Mika Hakkinen on Thursday . Asked whether he was in favour of the ban, Ecclestone smiled and then replied: 'As I was the one who started it off, yes.' Suggested it was imperative drivers do more rather than continually relying on information from the pit wall, Ecclestone added: 'I think none of the drivers want it (radio). They are all happy it has gone. 'They drive the cars, they should know what is wrong or right. They don't need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do. 'We have a regulation in force drivers must drive the car unaided. They have been aided - and still are. 'Even if we get rid of this 'ship to shore' as I call it, there are still a lot of aids that they should not have. 'Driving is still not easy, but it was easier than it was.' Asked whether more rule changes would come into effect, Ecclestone replied: 'I think we might...to make their life more difficult.","Sauber, Marussia and Caterham are teetering on the brink of extinction .

"Out there in the big bad world of the Barclays Premier League, Jose Mourinho believes everyone has got it in for Chelsea again. He is convinced there is an orchestrated campaign, a deliberate attempt to undermine the league leaders as they enter the second half of the season. On these occasions you are usually inclined to think he is off his rocker, having him down as barking mad at the perceived injustices to his blue-eyed boys. Maybe this time, though, he has a point. ‘There is a campaign - not against me, but against Chelsea,’ he claimed after Cesc Fabregas was denied a 55th-minute penalty at St Mary’s on Sunday. Mourinho shows his frustration as Cesc Fabregas is fouled against Southampton . Mourinho believes there is a deliberate attempt to undermine Chelsea when penalties are not given . Penalties given in Premier League 2014-15 . Manchester City - 5 . Arsenal - 4 . West Bromwich Albion - 4 . Queens Park Rangers - 3 . Crystal Palace - 3 . Everton - 3 . Burnley - 2 . Leicester City - 2 . Chelsea - 2 . Stoke City - 2 . Southampton - 1 . Tottenham Hotspur - 1 . Sunderland - 1 . Newcastle United - 1 . Liverpool - 1 . West Ham United - 1 . Hull City - 1 . Swansea City - 1 . Aston Villa - 0 . Manchester United - 0 . Mourinho should not have been surprised because Chelsea have only been awarded two penalties this season. Both were at home. They were scored by Eden Hazard, one in the 2-0 victory over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on October 5 and another against QPR on November 1. Since then, they haven’t had a sniff. On the face of it, with the likes of Oscar, Willian, Hazard, Fabregas and Andre Schurrle running rings around their opponents in the penalty area, it seems inconceivable that they have not won more decisions. That group play some of the most intricate football in the Premier League and yet Manchester City (five), West Brom and Arsenal (four), Crystal Palace, QPR and Southampton (three) have all had more penalties. Chelsea, Burnley and Stoke have been awarded two; Liverpool one; Manchester United have not had a single penalty under Louis van Gaal. So much for the big clubs getting all the big decisions. In the past few weeks, largely thanks to Steve Bruce’s ‘Swan Lake’ comment following Hull’s 2-0 defeat on December 13 and Sam Allardyce’s criticism of Branislav Ivanovic on Boxing Day, Chelsea’s player have acquired something of a reputation. Allardyce had a particular view on Ivanovic, accusing him of attempting to con referee Michael Oliver into awarding a penalty during West Ham’s 2-0 defeat. ‘Entitled? I don’t know about entitled,’ claimed Allardyce. ‘They try to make referees' minds up for them. ‘Staying on your feet does not get rewarded if you are fouled. We all know that.’ That provoked Mourinho, retaliating at Southampton after referee Anthony Taylor had denied his team a penalty when the score was 1-1. Phil Dowd, the match official for Chelsea’s New Year’s Day clash at Totteham, is under an extra bit of pressure because of Mourinho’s outburst. Eden Hazard is felled by Laurent Koscielny against Arsenal - a penalty was given and scored by the Belgian . The same player was fouled by QPR's Eduardo Vargas and converted Chelsea's other penalty this season . Diego Costa, Willian, Oscar, Fabregas, Ivanovic and even Gary Cahill are Chelsea players accused of diving at various stages of the season. It must be said, they do not look like a team of cheats. Still, Mourinho must accept that the decisions involving Chelsea will be scrutinised more than practically any other team in the Premier League because they are at the top. It was unwise for Taylor to apologise to Mourinho, particularly as Fabregas’ fall inside the penalty area fell into something of a grey area. It is true that the Southampton left back Matt Targett tripped him, but the replays also show Fabregas flinging out his right leg before he goes to ground. Why did he do that? The Spaniard has never been noted for trying to win penalties or con referees during his club career. Diego Costa was clipped by Burnley keeper Tom Heaton in the opening game but no penalty was given . Cesc Fabregas is incredulous after his penalty appeal against Southampton was turned down . What we do know is that the reaction of Fabregas prompted the referee to check with the fourth official to ask whether the decision was correct. Half an hour after the final whistle, Taylor held up his hands and apologised when he spoke with Mourinho in the dressing room area at St Mary’s. According to some officials in the game, it is normal practice to apologise to a manager if they subsequently realise they have made a mistake. Each manager has his own way of approaching referees. Sir Alex Ferguson often waded in, ranting about a decision that he believed had cost Manchester United the points. Mourinho has a twinkle in his eye, a certain charm that referees fall for when he enters their dressing room area to discuss a decision. Gary Cahill throws himself against Hull and no penalty was awarded . In a previous era, John Gregory once asked to sit in Graham Poll’s room instead of the visitors’ changing area after he had failed to award his side a penalty in the final minute against Charlton. ‘My players have worked so hard all week, but how can I face them after what you’ve just done,’ snapped Gregory as he took a seat on one of the benches in the referee’s room. He had made his point. Mourinho has made his, drawing his own conclusions after his team failed to record a sixth successive victory at Southampton. It was way over the top, but that is the way Mourinho works.","Chelsea have won two penalties this season, both at Stamford Bridge .

"Ravel Morrison has all but confirmed his transfer to Serie A side Lazio after posting a picture of his new shirt online. The 21-year-old midfielder travelled to Italy on Wednesday to have a medical and complete his move from West Ham, where he has fallen out of favour. And Morrison appears to have sealed a deal to play for the sixth club of his career after releasing a picture  of a Lazio shirt with his name on the back and the caption: 'Ravel 4'. Ravel Morrison posted this picture on Instagram showing his name on the back of a Lazio shirt . The former Manchester United midfielder can be seen walking next to the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico . Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United . Appearances: 81 . Goals: 14 . Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) Morrison, who began his career at Manchester United's academy, will join the Italians on a free transfer at the end of the season. His contract with the Hammers expires at the end of June and the controversial midfielder is thought to have signed a three-year deal in Rome. This season he joined Cardiff on a three-month loan but returned early in December. Other Premier League clubs also enquired about the England Under 21 international but Morrison favoured a move abroad.

"Philippe Coutinho was excellent against Chelsea last week and had a fine game against West Ham United at the weekend too. He set up two goals including one for Raheem Sterling with one of my two favourite passes of the season. It was just as good as Cesc Fabregas’s assist for Andre Schurrle against Burnley. Philippe Coutinho was magnificent for Liverpool against Chelsea and West Ham United . Manchester City playmaker David Silva levelled the scoreline shortly before the interval . Coutinho (centre) celebrates with Liverpool team-mates Daniel Sturridge (left) and Lucas on Saturday . Philippe Coutinho and David Silva's stats . Now Coutinho needs to start producing these kind of performances week in, week out. He is still only 22 and has all the talent and skill to become a top player but he is not yet consistent enough. David Silva is 29 and was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, even scoring after reacting first to Sergio Aguero's shot which was possibly heading wide, but he plays like that most weeks for City. Coutinho should take a leaf out of his book. In his time in England, Coutinho has been unable to match Silva, as our table shows. But his last two games show he is more than capable. He just has to show he can keep it up. Sergio Aguero celebrates with his team-mate following Silva's equaliser in the 45th minute . Coutinho (right) jumps into the air and waits to receive the ball at Stamford Bridge last week . Silva (left), holding off the challenge of Chelsea's Ramires, is brilliant week in, week out for Man City . CITY NOT OUT OF IT . It was not the game we all hoped for at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, far from it. I predicted a 1-1 draw but had hoped for a thriller. It was anything but. Before the game I’m sure most Chelsea fans would have taken a draw to keep their five-point lead at the top. As soon as Manchester City scored you could sense Jose Mourinho and his team were happy with that. In the second half they sat deep and soaked up City’s pressure but came away with a result that suits them just fine. Chelsea striker Loic Remy put his side in the lead with a 41st minute opener against Man City . Aguero's strike at goal was eventually turned in by Manchester City team-mate Silva . Remy is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring his fifth goal of the season . The fixture list looks kind for them for the rest of the season. Of the top sides, they only have to visit Arsenal, whereas Man City have to go to Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. But Chelsea do play Liverpool and Man United at home and they will not be easy games. Man City have Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony to come back from the Africa Cup of Nations and Manuel Pellegrini’s men came from behind to win the league last season. This title race is not run yet. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (second left) will have been relatively happy with the result at Stamford Bridge . Remy places the ball past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart to put his side in the lead . Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is called into action during the top-of-the-table clash in west London . FIVE INTO TWO DOESN'T GO . If the battle for the title is a two-horse race, then the fight for Champions League spots could be tougher than ever. Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham all won, which makes Southampton the biggest losers of the weekend. One thing is for sure - it’s going to be a real scrap for those two spots. It was good to see Theo Walcott scoring again after injury and Arsenal proved they can win without Alexis Sanchez.

The transfer window is always mad but a fit Daniel Sturridge will feel like the signing of the season for Liverpool. Their campaign starts now. Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen lead the way for Spurs, Man United keep grinding out results and, despite a surprise defeat, Southampton are still in the mix. Let battle commence.

Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane celebrates scoring during his side's victory at West Bromwich Albion . TRIPLE JOY FOR JON . 1 - Jon Walters has as many Premier League hat-tricks as Eric Cantona, Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo. They all have one each. Scoring a hat-trick at any level is an achievement but Jon Walters can be proud of his perfect treble - a goal with either foot and a header. Queen Park Rangers will be kicking themselves for the way they conceded the goals, but Walters took them well. With Bojan out for the season, Stoke need somebody to step up and score.

The Ireland international (left) celebrates a superb hat-trick during the 3-1 win over relegation threatened QPR . DEFOE DEAL WAS A NO-BRAINER FOR GUS . Signing a player in the January transfer window is always a bit of a risk. You never know if they are going to hit the ground running or disrupt your plans. When Gus Poyet brought in Jermain Defoe it was as close as you can get to a risk-free deal. If there’s one thing Defoe guarantees, it’s goals - he’s not even fully fit and he already has his first for Sunderland. There were a lot of clubs looking at him because everyone knows he is a master finisher. The deal he’s on works out as big money but if his goals help keep Sunderland in the Premier League, there’s no question it will be money well spent. Jermain Defoe celebrates scoring for Sunderland against Burnley on Saturday afternoon . Defoe tries a shot at goal but is closed down by Burnley's Jason Shackell (right) at the Stadium of Light . He (left) turns away to celebrate scoring Sunderland's second goal and his first since joining the club . ERIKSEN'S THE NEW FREE-KICK MASTER . The free-kick Christian Eriksen hit against Sheffield United was unbelievable. Then he followed it up with another beauty against West Bromwich Albion. The Dane is fast becoming one of the Premier League’s top free-kick specialists. I love the way he takes them. He is so relaxed and in control of his body and he can bend the ball into either corner. He hits it in quite an old-fashioned way - more David Beckham than Cristiano Ronaldo - and decides where to swerve the ball rather than hitting it and expecting it to move around itself. Free-kicks can be a game of cat and mouse with goalkeepers, but he is keeping the keepers guessing. He’s got a way to go to match the Premier League’s best, as our table  shows, but he’s certainly on the right road. Christian Eriksen scored a wonderful curling free-kick against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday . Eriksen (left) positions himself ready to curl the ball up and over the on-looking West Brom wall . The West Brom wall (right) jumps but cannot get high enough to block Eriksen's wonderful effort . 2 - Things are not looking pretty for Steve Bruce and Hull City at present. Their 3-0 drubbing at home by Newcastle United means they have won just two of their last 13 league games at the KC Stadium, a run that stretches back to last season. They have also failed to score in 11 of their last 15 Premier League games and have kept only one clean sheet in their last eight league matches. 12 - Burnley have leaked goals all season. Of the 38 they have let in, 12 have been headers - that’s more than any other team in the league. 4 - Maybe Louis van Gaal should give Radamel Falcao a regular starting spot. In nine league starts the Colombian (has been involved in seven goals, scoring four and setting up three. 167 - Daniel Sturridge made a scoring return from injury for Liverpool and bagged his first goal since the opening day of the season - 167 days ago. His last goal came against Southampton at Anfield on August 17. 5 - Roberto Martinez will have been delighted Everton hung on to win at Selhurst Park. It stopped a run of five consecutive away defeats. 4 - Mesut Ozil clearly enjoys playing against Aston Villa. All four of the goals he has been involved in this season have come against Paul Lambert’s side - he has two goals and two assists. 9 - Newcastle United like a sub who can make an impact. Yoan Gouffran’s goal against Hull City made it nine times this season that a Newcastle player has come off the bench and scored. That’s three more than any other side.","Philippe Coutinho was excellent for Liverpool vs Chelsea and West Ham .

"If there is one player I would have liked to have been it is Steven Gerrard. I feel very proud and honoured to have been on the same pitch as him. Now he is leaving Liverpool I say one thing to him: do not retire. Go and play in America, you are a young man, you can carry on for five or six years. And if, when the Major League Soccer season is closed and you are looking for a loan back to England, I know my dad would love to have him... VIDEO Is Steven Gerrard the best Premier League player of all time? Scroll down to see . Former England captain Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool when his contract expires in the summer . Jamie Redknapp celebrates his goal with Gerrard during a Premiership clash with Charlton in 2001 . When you talk about Liverpool’s greatest players, you think about Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness; but they were surrounded by other fantastic players. Steven Gerrard has carried Liverpool. He has been the captain, leader and inspiration for some poor teams. He has been their Roy of the Rovers, their superman. We can remember those moments. Against Olympiacos in 2004 in the Champions League when they were going out and he scored a rocket goal. His header in the Champions League Final against AC Milan in Istanbul. His match-winning performance against West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup Final when they had all but lost the game at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium but, somehow, he won them the trophy. The Liverpool skipper has often been the man to bail his team out on the big occasion with an important goal . Gerrard was instrumental in his side's unlikely run to the Champions League . Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy . Gerrard and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher celebrate Liverpool's 2005 Champions League win . The first time I saw him on the training pitch, I passed the ball and I expected him to send it back to me. He turned and pinged a 50-yard crossfield pass. I can remember the noise; like a golfer hitting the sweet spot. I knew we had a player. When I told our manager Gerard Houllier, he thought I was talking about somebody else! But the players knew. Some will say now that he should retire at the top, as a one-club player. I say that you are a long time retired. He has to play on for as long as he can. He is only 34. He can still pass a ball as beautifully as anyone. Jamie Redknapp (left), Carragher, Danny Murphy and Gerrard in the Liverpool gym in 2002 . Gerrard and Redknapp joke with Robbie Fowler (centre) and Stephen Wright before the 2001 FA Cup final . Why the MLS? He will know that the game in Europe is for young men. He has earned the chance to play the game at his pace. He could play in Los Angeles with LA Galaxy or in New York with the Red Bulls, or even for David Beckham if the former England captain gets his Miami franchise off the ground in the future. There are times when Gerrard has looked as if he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders this season, since Liverpool failed to win that coveted Premier League title last season. And since Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge has been injured, that has virtually been the case. There hasn’t been the usual smile or the swagger we’ve associated with him during matches, and he has been moved around the pitch in a manner that has complicated his performances. I found myself thinking: ‘Just let him play’. Gerrard scored 13 times for Liverpool last season, coming agonisingly close to his first Premier League title . John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dani Alves are free transfers and will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens... Stevie is more interesting; he can still do a job for Liverpool and I hope he stays, but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable. If he does stay, just let him play! There is too much ‘make him a holding midfielder’, or ‘let’s push him forward’. Now he can do that in America amid the relative calm of the MLS. He can be a superstar, just as Beckham was out there. Why now? He reads the newspapers, listens to the radio phone-ins, logs on to the websites. People have been saying he has lost his pace and that he is not the same player. He’s a sensitive boy and such criticism and comments will weigh on his mind. This decision will not have been easy for him — it will have hurt him. He loves Liverpool and it has been his club. He’s their talisman and it was his ambition to win them a title. It was difficult, too, for him to turn down Chelsea when Jose Mourinho first came calling, but this will have been just as tough. The hardest thing is to visualise him in another kit, with another badge on his chest. Some will say he is like a boxer coming towards the end; don’t take one more fight. It’s different for Frank Lampard. We all remember him at West Ham, before he moved to Chelsea. Now he is at Manchester City. Steven has played 695 games for Liverpool; we aren’t used to seeing him in another strip, apart from England. But I still think he should play on. Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . I remember reading in his book how anxious he was when he first joined up with England, and that I had to get him from his room before a meal to bring him down to join the rest of the squad. I don’t recall that. I just remember him being a superhero from the moment I set eyes on him. What a player! But I don’t want this to read like an obituary. I want it to be a reflection of his brilliant career and I hope there is more to come. The moment when you make that run, you make that tackle, you score that goal … if you retire, you never get that back again. You don’t get any medals for being a one club man. While you can still do it, then do it. I don’t see him as a manager — and he doesn’t need the money anyway. He’d be good on TV. No, he’d be a superstar. But that can come at a later date. He’s still got the legs to play, to reinvent himself. He doesn’t owe anything to anyone. This is his time. Walk out with your head held high, Stevie. And keep on playing.

"Here’s an amazing stat: Burnley have kept more clean sheets (three) this season than any of last year’s top seven clubs. In fact, those seven: Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Spurs and Manchester United have managed just nine clean sheets between them. At this stage last season, they had kept 19. The Premier League is gradually becoming more like La Liga in Spain; the emphasis moving from building a solid team from the back to throwing men forward to outscore your opponents. Manchester United spent all their money during the summer on attacking players . Teams are coached to pass and commit men forward, full backs are encouraged to attack more than defend and players are asked to play with freedom. It’s a far cry from the old days when the emphasis was on staying in your position and playing long balls from the back. The managers of those seven clubs: Mauricio Pochettino, Manuel Pellegrini, Roberto Martinez, Arsene Wenger, Louis van Gaal and Brendan Rodgers all set up their teams to attack. Even Jose Mourinho does that now, although he still occasionally adjusts for tough games. In the early part of my career, managers adopted a safety-first approach but how many teams do now? Maybe Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Burnley. Top teams always played attacking football but now everybody is trying to play. The influence of Spanish players like Cesc Fabregas has opened up the Premier League . Sam Allardyce, for years associated with direct football, is using a diamond and Tony Pulis, another criticised for boring football, got Crystal Palace playing an exciting brand last season. We’ve seen it in Spain for years, the attitude of ‘we’ll outscore you’; that you might as well try to win three points in one match rather than run around like crazy and get three draws. It is more exciting for players and fans. Obviously, defences are exposed and in the past 10 years the top seven teams in La Liga have kept fewer clean sheets each season than their equivalents here. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has flourished as defences are exposed . When I played under Wenger at Arsenal, if one full back went forward, the other stayed back. That meant we had three defenders and at least one or two midfielders (usually Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira) defending too. The rest of the team was free to attack. Now most teams push both full backs forward, only leaving two centre-backs and a holding midfielder behind. That’s seven attacking. It’s not that you can’t defend with those seven pressing high up the pitch, it’s the gaps left behind that are the problem. Teams just run into the space, as Manchester United found to their cost at Leicester. Manchester City's David Silva operates in the pocket just in front of the defence . The Spanish influence is clear. Eight Premier League managers have experience in Spain and only Burnley, Hull, Palace, West Ham and Leicester haven’t had a manager who has played or managed there. It was only a matter of time before our game opened up. I imagine that around 90 per cent of the emphasis in training concerns the final third. The position of maximum opportunity (POMO) used to be at the back post. Football was about crosses. Now, with many teams playing a diamond, the POMO is that pocket in front of the defence where Wayne Rooney, Cesc Fabregas, Raheem Sterling and David Silva operate. Even crossers of the ball such as Stewart Downing are finding success there. Teams are more innovative and imaginative than ever. Who cares if we lose a few clean sheets in the process? Tackle Keown . Goonerriffic via email asks: Will you be watching the Ryder Cup this weekend? Are you much of a golfer? MARTIN SAYS: Try to stop me! The Ryder Cup is the reason I got Sky TV all those years ago. It will be so close this weekend but after the Miracle of Medinah, you wonder how often Europe can dig out performances like that. I’d love to get on the course more than I do but I didn’t play golf as a footballer because it affected my back. At Arsenal Lee Dixon and Dave Seaman (right) were probably the best two but you always had to keep an eye out for Ray Parlour. He was a bit of a handicap bandit!","Emphasis has moved from building a solid team from the back to throwing men forward to outscore your opponents .

"President Barack Obama asked Muslim communities in the United States to do more to weed out 'violent extremism' in their communities on Wednesday. His speech, during a three-day White House summit, addressed the threat of extremism flourishing among Muslims and the need for community leaders to push back on talk that the US is 'at war' with the religion. 'Muslim leaders need to do more to discredit the notion that . our nations are determined to suppress Islam,' Obama said, in reference to talk by extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS. Summit: Speaking in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Obama asked Muslim communities to do more to combat 'violent extremism' US intelligence officials said last week that up to 150 American may have tried to travel to Syria in an attempt to join militant groups fighting there. The White House has been under fire for its stance on groups like ISIS, with some, such as Democrat Representative Tulsi Gabbard, criticizing Obama's refusal to directly blame radical Islam. 'If you look at this broad focus on countering violent extremism, which is very hard to define, it’s a diversion away from the actual threat coming from this radical Islamic ideology that exists,' Gabbard said on CNN's The Situation Room. In the wake of shocking violence like the murders at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, some have been frustrated by some blaming moderate Muslims for not denouncing violence enough. Groups are also skeptical about the president's promise to engage with moderate Muslim communities, saying outreach efforts look more like policing the religion. 'It blurs the line between community outreach and intelligence gathering,' Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota about initiatives promoted by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Extremist: Obama has said that ISIS distorts religion in order to justify war. The group released a video Sunday showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians captured by the group. In Minneapolis, where Johnson visited, US Attorney Andrew Luger was asked in Minneapolis, where Johnson had visited to spearhead programs to educate and empower Muslim youth in order to counter the appeal of extremism. Those efforts, Hussein said, should be separated from the Justice Department and the Department of . Homeland Security.","The White House hosted a three-day summit on extremism .

"Time to stop the moaning, Louis . Louis van Gaal has spent the holidays moaning about the fixture list but I don’t understand why he’s so upset. When he came to the Premier League he knew exactly what he was letting himself in for. Festive football is one of the best things about our league. To arrive here and start complaining makes it look like he hasn’t done his homework. Wayne Rooney ran 7.4 miles against Stoke, compared to 7.1 miles against Newcastle and Tottenham . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has seen his side draw their last three away games . United's players look dejected as they fall behind to an early goal at Stoke . When he first made the comments after the Tottenham game, I thought Van Gaal was joking. It was the first time in 85 games that United had named an unchanged line-up. He has rotated his squad more than anybody this season and then he starts kicking up a fuss about tiredness? Do me a favour. There are plenty of managers who would love to have the kind of options Van Gaal has in his squad. He gets paid vast sums to figure out how to deal with situations like this. It’s odd behaviour but it relays to the players and gives them a ready-made excuse not to perform. Luckily for Van Gaal, he still has some very willing runners in his team. Four United players have played every minute since Boxing Day. But, as our table shows, rather than getting increasingly tired, they actually covered more miles on Thursday than in any of their other games. More brilliance from Bony . I'm not going to lie. I wasn’t happy seeing Wilfried Bony score a late equaliser at QPR. But I had a funny feeling he would do just that. Leroy Fer scored an absolute screamer, as our graphic  shows, but Bony delivered yet again. Wilfried Bony scores a stoppage time equaliser for Swansea at QPR . How Leroy Fer gave QPR the lead with his wonder strike in the first half . He is one of the most-coveted centre forwards in football right now and with good reason. He is one of the best I’ve seen at holding up the ball, he links so well and he has ice in his veins. He could play and prosper in any team. Spurs hit Jose for a famous five . On Thursday we had the result of the season at White Hart Lane. Who saw Chelsea getting hammered 5-3 by Tottenham? Not me. It was their best performance for years to beat a team of Chelsea’s quality, and scoring five goals, too. Only one other team in history has put five past a Jose Mourinho side — Barcelona when they beat Real Madrid 5-0 in 2010. Make no mistake, this was a massive result. Harry Kane scored twice as Spurs hit Chelsea for five . It was only the second time in Jose Mourinho's managerial career one of his sides conceded five goals . Chelsea have won nine out of nine at home but dropped 14 points on the road. It’s a game that has blown the title race wide open and now you have to put Tottenham down as genuine top four contenders. Harry Kane was unplayable and he terrorised a top defence. His work-rate inspires his team-mates and he is the difference for Spurs. For Mauricio Pochettino, it’s a great confidence boost. He looks like he could be the right man for the job and Spurs fans will be looking forward to seeing what he can achieve with the right investment. For Jose, it’s a huge blow. This was a shock and their away form is a real problem. Martinez has a Blue Christmas . What a miserable festive period it has been for Everton. They have not lost four straight games since 2005 and have slipped down the table. Everton have lost their last four games and are slipping down the table . Roberto Martinez has seen Everton go through a miserable run over the festive period . Roberto Martinez is a good manager and I admire his attacking style. It’s easy for people to say that makes them vulnerable but I didn’t hear any complaints about it last season. It’s easy to blame systems but it’s been a tough season and they look like they lack confidence. Maybe it’s time for the club to help Martinez freshen up his squad. Foxes are festive winners . Thursday felt like a big day at the bottom of the Premier League. Leicester and Burnley both came from behind to earn a draw and that late equaliser was a kick in the teeth for QPR. It’s still early days in the relegation fight and it’s all still so tight - just six points separate the bottom seven sides. Leicester came from behind to earn a draw at Liverpool . George Boyd celebrates as Burnley came from behind three times to earn a point at Newcastle . But survival is is all about confidence. Burnley have fought so hard and got good results and Hull stopped the rot. But with a win at Hull and rescuing a draw at Anfield, Leicester have been one of the biggest winners at the bottom this Christmas. Could Frank be the difference? Frank Lampard's incredible season goes on. Another game, another goal. It’s becoming a familiar story for City. Nobody saw the move coming, and people are keen to criticise Chelsea for letting him go. But, in fairness, you can’t say the decision has weakened their team. Where it is starting to hurt them is in the table. Frank Lampard celebrates his second half winner against Sunderland . Thursday’s winner was the latest in a long line of key goals for City, and the tables below show how important he has become. If you take away Frank’s goals, City would be seven points off the pace. With them, they are dead level and bang in the title race. 2 - Leicester should be proud of their comeback at Anfield. Only twice before in the Premier League have Liverpool surrendered a two-goal lead at Anfield to draw. It happened twice in September 2002 — first in a 2-2 draw with Newcastle and then a 2-2 draw with Birmingham a week later. Strangely, their last result before those games was a 2-2 draw away at Blackburn. 3 - Given his goal-scoring record, it may come as some surprise that this is the first time Yaya Toure has scored in three consecutive Premier League games. 53 - He might not be a creative playmaker, but Peter Crouch now has 53 assists in the Premier League, the same number as Robin van Persie. 33 - Let's hope the Premier League has started 2015 as it means to go on. There were 33 goals scored on Thursday, the most on New Year’s Day in the Premier League and the most since 34 went in on January 1, 1987. 77 - Antolin Alcaraz’s red card completed a miserable afternoon for Everton. They now have 77 Premier League reds — more than any other team. 653 - After seven goals in his first nine PL games this season, Saido Berahino finally ended a goal-drought of 653 minutes against West Ham. His last was against Palace in October. 11 - Aston Villa have scored just 11 goals so far this season. Only two sides in Premier League history have scored fewer goals after 20 games — Man City and Derby both scored 10 in 1995-96 and 2007-08 respectively.","Wilfried Bony showed why he is one of the most-coveted strikers around .

"By common consensus, Calum Chambers was rinsed by Swansea winger Jefferson Montero during Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium last Sunday.

Chambers' recovery time (in days) between matches at Southampton last season: . 7, 7, 15, 9, 12, 31, 7, 8, 4, 3, 3, 17, 10, 4, 7, 3, 11, 7, 22, 6, 7, 7, 30. His recovery time between matches for Arsenal and England this season: . 6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 7, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 3, 6, 3, 5. For a 19-year-old, making his way in the game after a £16m move from Southampton in the summer, he is playing an awful lot of football. Way too much football, as it happens. Last year, when he was in and out of the Saints team, interchanging at right back with Nathaniel Clyne, he played 1,821 minutes of first-team football in the entire season. Four months into his career at Arsenal, playing for one of the top clubs in England and the national team’s new right back, he has already played 1,535 minutes for club and country. It is too much. Last season, his first full season since he graduated from the academy at St Mary’s, Chambers averaged a game every 12.5 days for Southampton. This is his recovery time, in days, between games at Southampton last season: 7, 7, 15, 9, 12, 31, 7, 8, 4, 3, 3, 17, 10, 4, 7, 3, 11, 7, 22, 6, 7, 7, 30. Those spells out of the team gave Chambers time to recover, allowing his body to develop and to acclimatise to life as a top class professional athlete. This year, playing for a team that had ambitions to win either the Barclays Premier League or Champions League at the start of the season, he gets a game every 4.6 days on average. That’s ridiculous. Here is Chambers’ recovery time, in days, as an Arsenal and England player between matches: 6, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 7, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 10, 3, 6, 3, 5. He is being played round the clock for club and country. Montero tries to spin away from Chambers' during Swansea's win at the Liberty Stadium . Chambers on his England debut against Norway in September - he has now won three caps . Since he played in the 3-0 victory over Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 10, Chambers has appeared in 16 Arsenal games. Five of them have been in the Champions League. Throw in his England debut, a nine-minute appearance against Norway on September 3, and the figure rises to 17. Then add on his first start against San Marino at Wembley, plus the trip to Estonia a few days later and we’re up to 19. Too many. Before Chambers arrived at Arsenal in the summer, he had made 25 appearances in his entire professional career: 24 last season, trading places with Clyne when Mauricio Pochettino saw fit, and one the year before. He was at St George’s Park on Tuesday, playfully patting his England team-mate Luke Shaw’s stomach and teasing him about his summer excesses. A dejected Chambers walks off alone as Anderlecht celebrate their equaliser in the 3-3 draw . 2013-14 - Southampton . Matches: 24 . Minutes played: 1,821 . 2014-15 - Arsenal and England . Matches: 20 . Minutes played: 1,535 . Shaw, also 19, has played a lot of football, too. After breaking into Southampton’s first team he made 28 appearances in his first season. Last year, before his £31m move to Manchester United, he played 41 times for Southampton. At the time he looked like he could go on for ever. This season, after travelling to the World Cup with England, he has struggled to recover from injury. It will take time to rediscover his best form. Chambers has to be given time too, particularly after his punishing schedule for Arsenal and England. Think back to a time when Rio Ferdinand was coming through at West Ham in the mid-Nineties and it is a world away from the demands being placed in front of Chambers. Ferdinand was used sparingly at first, called into the England squad with Frank Lampard before Euro 96 to train with the team and give the pair experience of the elite level. Chambers leaps above Danny Rose for Southampton last season, when he had much more recovery time . The idea, a brainchild of Terry Venables, was to show two promising players what is in front of them if they continued to develop. Both went on to have long and enduring careers for club and country, but too much is being asked of Chambers at such an early stage of his career. Naturally he wants to play, but there is no time to learn when he is being asked to play at the very highest level of the game, on average, every 4-and-a-half days. Think back to August, when he was voted Arsenal’s player of the month and looked assured and accomplished in the heart of that defence. With the right guidance, he can play like that every week.

"The crew of a private jet that . crashed in Massachusetts, killing Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis . Katz and six other people, did not perform a flight control check before . attempting takeoff, a federal report issued Friday suggests. The . preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on the May 31 crash at Hanscom Field outside Boston also indicated a . possible problem with a mechanical gust lock system on the Gulfstream . IV, which protects aircraft components from wind damage while planes are . parked. The plane would have been unable to take off had the lock been engaged, according to aviation experts. Chilling: An image taken two weeks ago shows the . charred wreckage of Lewis Katz's Gulfstream IV that erupted into flames near . Boston on Saturday, killing seven . Terror: An image shows the plane crash at the . bottom of the runway at Hanscom Field. The aircraft was heading to . Atlantic City on May 31 . Fiery tomb: Lewis Katz, the billionaire co-owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and six other people died in the crash that was headed to New Jersey . Pilots . typically check wing flaps, elevators and other components before . takeoff to make sure they are working. The flight data recorder would be . expected to have recorded such checks, but investigators found no . evidence of such movement, the report stated. The . report did not identify a probable cause for the crash, and officials . have said a final report could take months to complete. NTSB . investigators previously said data from the jet's flight data recorders . indicated it reached takeoff speed of 190mph but never lifted off before it went . off a runway, crashed into a gulley and burst into flames. Cockpit voice . recordings revealed comments from the crew concerning 'aircraft . control,' the NTSB said. The black box also indicated that the pilot tried to brake and reverse the thrusters before the fiery accident that killed the billionaire and six others. Tire skid marks were also found on the runway leading up to the crash site. According to the preliminary report, flight data showed evidence that the gust lock was engaged during the taxi and attempted takeoff, though a physical examination of the wreckage found the handle that locks the device was in the ‘off’ position. ‘There is some evidence that there was a problem with the gust lock system,’ said aviation consultant John Cox, a former pilot and accident investigator. This is the flight data recorder recovered from the jet that crashed Saturday near Boston, killing eight people. Investigators are currently examining it for clues about what went wrong . This is the cockpit voice recorder from the doomed flight. Investigators said it picked up discussion among the pilot and co-pilot about trouble with air traffic control . Crew members, however, may not have been aware of the issue without a flight check. If . controls were locked or stuck, ‘those things would normally be found in . a flight control check prior to takeoff,’ said John Gadzinski, an . airline captain and aviation safety consultant. ‘We know one thing that . definitely wasn't moving as planned was the elevator, which is necessary . to rotate the aircraft (to lift the nose up).’ There was no evidence of catastrophic engine failure, the NTSB report said. Flight . data also indicated a rise in brake pressure and that the crew engaged . thrust reversers, suggesting a desperate attempt by the crew to stop the . aircraft after the failed takeoff. The photographs of the charred plane wreckage show the shell of the burned-out aircraft splayed across the banks of the Shawsheen River after leaving a trail of debris across the field in Bedford, Massachusetts where it erupted in flames following a takeoff attempt at Hanscom Field. Investigators have found that the crash was so quick that the pilots had no time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway. It then plowed through a fence and across the river banks - killing everyone on board - before coming to a stop. 'It's our understanding from a witness . the aircraft never became airborne,' Luke Schiada, senior air safety . investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the . Boston Herald last month. Remains: The National Transportation Safety Board has taken over the investigation into the plane crash to determine what caused it . Shall: A National Transportation Safety Board official looks through the wreckage where it came to a stop after plummeting down an embankment . Terror: Officials work near wreckage at the scene on Monday. Investigators have said there's no reason to suggest it was anything but an accident . Skeleton: The pilots did not even have time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway . The plane, . which was bound for Atlantic City, was carrying seven people, and six . have now been identified by the District Attorney's Office. Katz, 72, perished just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer following a bitter legal battle. Marcella . Dalsey, the executive director of his son Drew's foundation, also died . alongside Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Marcella Dalsey, 59, from Williamstown, New Jersey, and Katz's neighbor Anne Leeds of Longport, New Jersey. The chief . pilot was identified as James McDowell, 51, from Georgetown, Delaware; co-pilot was Bauke 'Mike' de Vries, and Teresa Ann Benhoff, 48, from Easton, Maryland was on board as air . crew. Nearby residents recounted seeing a fireball and feeling the blast of the explosion shake their homes. Out of control: Skid marks are seen on the runway at the scene on Monday as a destroyed wheel lies at the end of the tarmac . Debris: A National Transportation Safety Board official walks away from a piece of the landing gear at the scene on Monday . Frantic: Skid marks can be seen on the field, showing the plane's path before it burst into flames. A witness said it did not even get airborne . Katz, 72, and business partner H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest only recently became the controlling owners of the Inquirer, The . Daily News and Philly.com after buying out the other partners for . $88million in a private auction. 'We . all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in . ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,' Lenfest said. 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that . Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on the board of our new . company.' Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 'My father was my best friend. He . taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he . worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were . seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement. 'He loved his native . city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia. He believed in . strengthening education through his founding of charter schools, his . support of the Boys & Girls Clubs and his generosity to his alma . maters, Temple University and Dickinson Law School. 'But his greatest . accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and . me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.' Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife, Anne, had been invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon. Killed: Lewis Katz, 72, was among the 7 people who perished in the crash - which occurred just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer . Loss: Marcella Dalsey (left), executive director of the Drew A Katz foundation, and Anne Leeds (right), wife of Longport, New Jersey commissioner James Leeds, died . Victim: Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey was also killed. She is pictured with her husband Sam, a former Camden County prosecutor . The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin. Mr . Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the . Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of . interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher. Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash. Ms . Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ . Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012. Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim. Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake. The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years. Katz grew up in Camden, New Jersey and attended Temple University. Katz made . his money investing in the Kinney Parking empire and once owned the . NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils and donated money . to Temple University. A star-studded public memorial attended by former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Senator Cory Booker and entertainer Bill Cosby was held June 4 at the Performing Arts Center at Temple University, where Katz was a trustee.","The small aircraft erupted in flames on take off from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts May 31 .

"Young people have no idea about the country’s war history – with many unaware of the meaning of events such as D-Day or VE Day, a study has found. Research revealed that younger generations only know about certain conflicts and military events due to watching programmes or films about them. So can you do any better? Take our quiz below to see if your knowledge of history is British military history is better than many 18-35 year olds. 1. What year was the Battle of Britain? 2. The Falklands War was between which countries? 3. During which century was the English Civil War? 4. The Battle of the Somme took place during which conflict? 5. The term Blitz comes from the German word Blitzkreig. But what does it translate to? 6. What year did the First World War start? 7. Who was Prime Minister at the start of the Second World War? 8. When did the Second World War come to an end? 9. Why is there a statue of Nelson in Trafalgar Square? 10. Which decade did the Korean War take place? Scroll down for answers . D-Day: British troops landed on beaches in Normandy as part of the allied invasion of France on June 6, 1944 . Winston Churchill waves to crowds gathered in Whitehall on VE Day, May 8 1945 . While the vast majority had heard of the First and Second World Wars, youngsters were stumped at more recent conflicts such as the War on Terror and the troubles in Northern Ireland. The statistics emerged in a study by Universal Pictures to mark the release of a special range of DVDs in support of The Royal British Legion. Charles Byrne, The Royal British Legion’s Director of Fundraising, said: ‘With this year’s 70th commemorations of D-Day and the 100th Anniversary of the start of the First World War, we hope more young people will be engaged by key events in military history. ‘Encouragingly, a lot of young people . say their knowledge of military history comes from school, and we know . the Legion’s free school’s pack on Remembrance and History reaches 2 . million young people in the UK every year. The Bloody Sunday killings in 1972 took place during a civil rights march in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Thirteen civilians were killed while the 14th victim died from his wounds five months later . ‘We . can also see that conflicts shown in TV and films make a big impact so . would encourage everyone to pick up a DVD in this special range.’ The study of 2,000 18-35-year-olds found . that almost half of those polled didn't know that D-Day marks the Normandy Landings during the Second . World War, with more than one in five mistakenly believing it marks the . end of the First World War. Half . were also unaware VE Day (Victory in Europe Day), which took place last . week, is celebrated to mark the end of the Second World War in Europe. The survey found that young people knew about conflicts from television and films including the 2008 film The Hurt Locker (pictured) with Jeremy Renner as Sergeant First Class William James . Still celebrated to this day, VE day, as well as D-Day, mark significant moments in British history. D-Day, or the day of the Normandy Landings on June 6, 1944, marked the start of the European invasion during the Second World War. Thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches in Northern France initiating the effort to liberate mainland Europe from Nazi occupation. In total 75,215 British and Canadian troops and 57,500 US troops were landed by sea on D-Day. Another 23,400 were landed by air – it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) was the public holiday, celebrated on May 8, 1945, to mark the formal acceptance of Germany’s surrender in the Second World War. People gathered on the streets - many dressed in red, white and blue - to celebrate the fact the war was over. One in four also struggled to name 1914 . to 1918 as the dates of the First World War, while one in five had no . idea the Second World War took place from 1939 to 1945. More than a quarter of those surveyed were totally unaware of the war in Afghanistan, with even fewer admitting they knew about the Iraq war. And despite it taking place in living memory for all those polled, just 40 per cent knew that the Iraq war started in 2003. Instead, one in ten thought it was the day the Blitz came to an end. There was also a large number who admitted to knowing little or even to have never heard of the Cold War and Vietnam. The study also found that while 45 per cent say most of the knowledge they do have on the nation’s military history comes from their time at school, almost one in five, or 18 per cent,  picked up what they do know from TV programmes or Hollywood films. Less than one in twenty got their knowledge from talking to older grandparents or relatives. And surprisingly  almost four in ten said they have never spoken to older relatives or friends about their experiences living through military events in our past.

"Kane my man of the year . If you stopped the season right now, there would be four players in contention for player of the year: Cesc Fabregas for the purists, Diego Costa for his power, Alexis Sanchez for his impact and Harry Kane for his all-round game. For me, it would have to be Harry Kane. But it’s time to forget the story around him. Yes, he is a homegrown star, Tottenham’s first since Ledley King. Yes, he plays like a fan on the pitch. But he is so much more than that now. He is a genuine, top quality talent. Harry Kane races away to celebrate after he equalised in the second half at White Hart Lane . Kane has scored 11 goals in his last 14 Tottenham matches, and four goals in his last two games. He managed just three last season . It’s hard to spot a weakness in his game. He takes up intelligent positions like his hero Teddy Sheringham. He’s got the strength to hold up the ball and hold off opponents. He can link up with team-mates or take the ball and run with it. He can shoot with either foot, hit them from distance or from close-range and he is outstanding in the air. He takes penalties, free-kicks and he works as hard as anybody on the pitch. Chelsea striker Diego Costa (left) and Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez (right) have been in fine form . The big question for any young star is, can they do it in the big games? Just ask John Terry and Laurent Koscielny whether Kane can. Tottenham fans are loving seeing ‘one of their own’ succeed, and there were six young players in Saturday’s starting XI that the club have produced or helped develop. But it’s Kane whose performances have dragged Spurs into the Champions League contention. That’s why he’s my player of the season so far. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, celebrating scoring against Stoke, has been outstanding for the Blues . Tottenham academy graduate Kane roars in celebration after scoring his first derby goal on Saturday . City not so slick . Can Man City really be happy with how their season is going? Off the pace in the title race, just about in the Champions League and out of the FA Cup. For the squad they have, it’s not good enough. Yes, they have missed Yaya Toure, but at the start of the season people were ready to drop him. City’s home form is far poorer than this time last year and they need a shift in mentality because they have to be switched on in every game. Ibe is one for the future . I spoke to Steven Gerrard before his final Merseyside derby and he listed some of the most talented names at Liverpool. On that list was Jordon Ibe. After his performance at Goodison Park, you can see why. In what was a rather poor derby game, Ibe’s display was a bright spot. He was quick, sharp and desperately unlucky not to score. The shot he hit against the post was so pure that the ball barely moved in flight. Gerrard said Ibe has a bit of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling in him and that he could be one for England in the future. That’s high praise indeed, though if Ibe’s career continues to blossom, I’m sure he won’t be playing as a wing back for much longer. Jordon Ibe of Liverpool competes with Muhamed Bezic and Steven Naismith of Everton on Saturday . Super Simeone gets results . Away from the Premier League, we had one of the results of the season in La Liga. Atletico Madrid didn’t just beat their city rivals Real, they completely thrashed them. It’s not often you see Real Madrid on the end of 4-0 scoreline, but Diego Simeone has created an incredible work ethic within his squad. They all work unbelievably hard for each other and play right on the limit of the rules, but that is how Simeone likes his teams. He barks and snarls on the touchline and creates a frenzied atmosphere, and his players are desperate to please him — they even sprint when they are subbed off. It’s like Simeone has them all on a remote control. It’s a unique style and I doubt it would work with a group of superstars, but it certainly gets results with Atletico. Diego Simeone celebrates a goal as his Atletico Madrid side defeated Real Madrid 4-0 on Saturday . Chelsea have the ultimate warrior . Branislav Ivanovic has been a bit of a Chelsea hero recently. He scored the winner against Liverpool in that cup semi-final and ended the game with a boot full of blood. Then he hits a stunner with his left at Aston Villa to send Chelsea seven points clear. I think his left foot can be a bit of a swinger, but it did the business on Saturday. He’s not far off the Premier League’s top five goal-scoring defenders and when you consider how many games he’s played, and that he doesn’t take set pieces or penalties, it’s an impressive record. Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea celebrates scoring the winning goal at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon . Wayne wasted in midfield role . I keep hearing Wayne Rooney can do a job in midfield and that Louis van Gaal can turn him into the new Paul Scholes. Rubbish. Wayne Rooney is a centre forward. That is his best position. Nobody will convince me otherwise. He is United’s best attacker and he should be up front affecting games. He has the ability to play in midfield, but that can happen in a few years’ time. Roy Hodgson won’t be picking Wayne in midfield for England any time soon. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney attempts a pass against West Ham at Upton Park on Sunday . I think Van Gaal is taking the easy way out so he can play Robin van Persie and Falcao up front and not upset anyone. But Wayne can’t be enjoying it. It’s easy for him to stroll around and ping passes but he should be banging in goals every week, not wasting his ability in midfield. Don't write off my Dad yet... When my dad announced he was leaving QPR so he could have surgery, a lot of people assumed that was it for him. At 67 and after nine clubs as a player and manager, surely it was time to retire. Don’t count on it. Why? My dad is football mad. It’s all he’s ever known and when you have it in your blood it’s hard to let go. His timing has always been bad but he loves the stress of management, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see him back. Mum will be glad to have him out of the house, too! Harry Redknapp, in the dugout for Queens Park Rangers, resigned from the club earlier this month . Jamie's Premier League number crunching . 7 - Everton are having a hard time finding the net at the moment, and have scored just seven goals in their last 10 Premier League matches - just two this year! When you consider they didn’t manage a single shot on target against Liverpool until the 87th minute, it’s not hard to see why. It’s not all bad news though - they have kept three PL clean sheets for the first time since November 2013. 131 - After Saturday’s match, there have now been 131 PL goals scored in Tottenham v Arsenal matches - no other fixture has seen as many. 1 - Tottenham have lost just one of their last seven Premier League home games against north London rivals Arsenal (Won 4, Drawn 2, Lost 1). Striker Jermain Defoe of Sunderland celebrates scoring the opener against Swansea on Saturday . 1999 - Every goal scored in the match between Burnley and West Brom was headed — the first time all goals in a game of four or more were scored in this fashion since September 1999 (Wimbledon v Derby County). 12 - Spurs have won 12 points from goals scored in the final five minutes of PL games this season - twice as many as any other side. 36 - After finding the net against Swansea, Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has scored at least one league goal against every current Premier League side. 4 - Manchester City have gone four Premier League games without a win for the first time since November 2009. On the plus side, however, James Milner ended a 36-game run without a Premier League goal on Saturday.","Tottenham striker Harry Kane scored twice to beat rivals Arsenal 2-1 .

"On Monday evening we were treated to what has since been described as ‘a good draw’ for the FA Cup. There were gasps when AFC Wimbledon were picked out to play Liverpool and you will lose count of the number of references to the old Crazy Gang beating the Culture Club in the 1988 FA Cup final. Over the next few weeks, Dover Athletic will always be Dover Athletic from the Conference and Neil Warnock’s Crystal Palace will be the team battling for survival in the Barclays Premier League. Robin van Persie and Manchester United will travel to either Accrington or Yeovil in the FA Cup third round . Accrington and Yeovil will battle it out in a replay for the chance to host United . Likewise, you will not hear of Northern Premier League side Blyth Spartans without casual references to their heroic victory at Hartlepool. Accrington Stanley, a team immortalised by the Milk Marketing Board’s ad in the Eighties, or Yeovil Town, who used their famous sloping pitch at the old Huish Park to their advantage when they really were giant-killers, will host 11-time FA Cup winners Manchester United. See how easy it is to dramatise and glamourise the draw? It could be like that every year, and in every round, if we wanted it to be. The draw is a random event, but a simple tweak to the FA regulations would ensure that the team in the lowest league position would automatically become potential giant-killers. Suddenly Ipswich, fourth out of the hat on Monday evening, would play Southampton at Portman Road instead of travelling to St Mary’s. Wrexham would host Stoke at the Racecourse Ground instead of travelling to a half-full Britannia Stadium. The FA Cup draw threw up many intriguing ties, including a re-run of last season's final . Sheffield Wednesday would play Manchester City at Hillsborough (they have already been beaten 7-0 at the Etihad this season in the Capital One Cup). It goes on. There are a number of other benefits too, such as full houses in anticipation of a giant-killing and teams from the higher division (or league position) would be under more pressure to play a full-strength team. In a few weeks’ time, when the FA Cup third round weekend is underway, there will be the usual grumbles about clubs from the Premier League fielding sub-strength teams. Managers will be accused of disrespecting the oldest Cup competition in the world, as if the trophy itself actually has a say in it. There will be frequent reminders about tradition and history, but if we were such sticklers for that then the winning FA Cup-winning captain would be lifting the original trophy, commissioned in 1872. Instead the FA are on to their fourth trophy. It is the time for change, to accept that the competition needs some refinement if it is to move with the times and recapture some of the magic that has disappeared over the past 20 years. Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers will have to plot how to overcome AFC Wimbledon . Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa will cause Liverpool's defence problems with his size and power . Wimbledon celebrate their famous victory over Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final . We cannot convince ourselves to believe that Manchester United’s withdrawal from the competition in 2000, or the sensible decision to host the semi-finals at Wembley or the abolition of multiple replays are the reasons behind its decline. When Stoke do play Wrexham at the Britannia, when Cardiff face Colchester and Aston Villa host Blackpool, there will be plenty of empty spaces. It is not a good look. The home supporters will have little appetite for it and if you care to check the record books it has been ever thus. A simple, prudent change - reversing the fixtures - generates excitement and enthusiasm for both clubs and their supporters. It is the obvious next step. Beyond that the FA, traditional and as conservative as they are, should set up a working party to look into the future of the competition. The tournament needs revision. Other options should be explored, such as a one-off invitation to one of European football’s biggest clubs - Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich - to play in the competition. Imagine Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale back in the Cup - but in the colours of Real Madrid . There have been 133 rounds of the FA Cup since its inception in 1871 and it is in desperate need of a lick of paint. The FA could create an excuse, such as an anniversary, to bring in one of the glamour clubs from European football at the third-round stage. For the prestige and honour of playing in the world’s oldest cup competition, the likes of Bayern, Barcelona or Real, as obvious examples, would accept the invitation. Once the initial hysteria had subsided and forecasts of Armageddon had been averted, it would be something special to settle down on a Sunday evening to watch Yeovil Town take on the Galacticos. It would be a unique experience, something new even for Pep Guardiola and his Bayern Munich players. Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez playing for Barcelona at Yeovil, for instance, would be something special . Imagine the great Lionel Messi travelling to England for a third round tie at Huish Park, Victoria Park or the Racecourse. They would probably go on to win the Little Tin Idol, too. The inclusion of one top team from the continent in the tournament, even as a one-off, would generate excitement and an obvious commercial appeal for the FA. It might even attract a title sponsor. Bringing overseas opposition to the party seems a touch radical, but someone needs to breathe some life into the competition. It merits discussion. There have been enough changes over the years and we can only hang on to TV replays of Ronnie Radford’s belter in the mud at Edgar Street in 1972 for so long.

"Researchers have uncovered the genetic changes that turned the wildcat into a pet. Cats and humans have shared the same households for at least 9,000 years, but researchers say they knew very little about how they became domesticated. The researchers compared the genomes of domestic cats and wild cats, finding specific regions of the domestic cat genome that differed significantly. Cats have a relatively recent history of domestication compared with dogs; canines arose from wolves over 30,000 years ago, while cats have only been domesticated for 9,000 years. The researchers compared the genomes of domestic cats and wild cats, finding specific regions of the domestic cat genome that differed significantly. The scientists found changes in the domestic cat's genes that other studies have shown are involved in behaviors such as memory, fear and reward-seeking. These types of behaviors — particularly those when an animal seeks a reward — generally are thought to be important in the domestication process. The analysis of the cat genome led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found cats have a relatively recent history of domestication compared with dogs. Canines arose from wolves over 30,000 years ago, while cats have only been domesticated for 9,000 years. 'Cats, unlike dogs, are really only semidomesticated,' said Wes Warren, who led the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Early Edition. 'They only recently split off from wild cats, and some even still breed with their wild relatives. 'So we were surprised to find DNA evidence of their domestication.' One way scientists can understand the genetics of domestication is to look at what parts of the genome are altered in response to living together with humans, Warren said. The researchers compared the genomes of domestic cats and wild cats, finding specific regions of the domestic cat genome that differed significantly. The scientists found changes in the domestic cat's genes that other studies have shown are involved in behaviors such as memory, fear and reward-seeking. These types of behaviors — particularly those when an animal seeks a reward — generally are thought to be important in the domestication process. 'Humans most likely welcomed cats because they controlled rodents that consumed their grain harvests,' said Warren. 'We hypothesized that humans would offer cats food as a reward to stick around.' This meant that certain cats that would normally prefer to lead solitary lives in the wild had an additional incentive to stay with humans. Over time, humans preferred to keep cats that were more docile. The differences they found in the cat genome help explain characteristics such as why cats are almost exclusively carnivorous and how their vision and sense of smell differ from other animals like dogs, the team say. To digest their fatty, meat-heavy meals, cats need genes to efficiently break down fats. The team found particular fat-metabolizing genes in carnivores such as cats and tigers that changed faster than can be explained by chance. This more rapid change generally means these genes provide some sort of digestive advantage to carnivores that only consume animal proteins. The Scottish Wildcat . Felis silvestris:Even though the genomes of domestic cats have changed little since their split from wild cats, the new work shows that it is still possible to see evidence of the species' more recent domestication. The researchers did not find such changes in the same genes of the cow and human, who eat more varied diets and would not need such enhancements. Cats also rely less on smell to hunt than dogs. So it is not surprising that the researchers found fewer genes for smell in cats than dogs. But they did find more genes related to an alternate form of smell that detects chemicals called pheromones, which allow cats to monitor their social environment, including seeking out the opposite sex. This ability is not as important to dogs, which tend to travel in packs. But it is crucial in cats, which are more solitary and may have more difficulty finding mates. Cats also have better hearing than most other carnivores, including an ability to hear in the ultrasonic range to better track prey. Their vision is also exceptional in low light. The team also looked at a breed called Birman, which has characteristic white paws. To obtain the high-quality reference genome needed for this research, the team sequenced a domestic female Abyssinian cat named Cinnamon. They chose this particular cat because they could trace its lineage back several generations. This cat's family also had a particular degenerative eye disorder the researchers wanted to study. To better understand characteristics of domestication, the researchers sequenced the genomes of select purebred domestic cats. Hallmarks of their domestication include features such as hair color, texture and patterns, as well as facial structure and how docile a cat is. Cats are bred for many of these types of characteristics. In fact, most modern breeds are the result of humans breeding cats for their favorite hair patterns. The team also looked at a breed called Birman, which has characteristic white paws. The researchers traced the white pattern to just two small changes in a gene associated with hair color. They found that this genetic signature appears in all Birmans, likely showing that humans selectively bred these cats for their white paws and that the change to their genome happened in a remarkably short period of time. 'Cats tend to be more active at dawn and dusk,' said Montague, 'so they need to be able to detect movement in low light.' Accordingly, the team identified specific genes that likely evolved to expand cats' hearing range and their vision in low light. Even though the genomes of domestic cats have changed little since their split from wild cats, the new work shows that it is still possible to see evidence of the species' more recent domestication. 'Using advanced genome sequencing technology, we were able to shed light on the genetic signatures of cats' unique biology and survival skills,' said Warren. Cats also have better hearing than most other carnivores, including an ability to hear in the ultrasonic range to better track prey. Their vision is also exceptional in low light. 'And we were able to significantly jump start our knowledge about the evolution of cat domestication.' The cat genome sequencing project, funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), began in 2007. The project's initial goal was to study hereditary diseases in domestic cats, which are similar in some cases to those that afflict humans, including neurological disorders, and infectious and metabolic diseases. The group also compared the cat genome with those of other mammals — including a tiger, cow, dog and human — to understand more about the genetics of cat biology. 'We looked at the underlying genetics to understand why certain abilities to survive in the wild evolved in cats and other carnivores,' said Michael Montague.","Researchers found genetic changes behind domestication .

"A new season offers players a fresh start, a chance to banish a nightmare campaign from the previous year or show the world that they are not just a flash in the pan. It’s time to rescue careers and build some others. Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Both Courtois and Petr Cech have a point to prove, but after all the trophies Cech has won I would say the pressure is on Courtois. He has done everything he can on loan but now he has to prove he is the present and future. One slip and Cech will be breathing down his neck. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal very happy with Phil Jones in training . Target: Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois has to reproduce the type of form that caught in the eye in Spain . Kyle Walker (Tottenham) Two years ago Walker was the PFA Young Player of the Year and an England regular but he has not played for his country for nearly a year. He has had injury problems but his game has not developed as quickly as he’d have liked and he needs to improve defensively. Improvements: Tottenham's Kyle Walker still has to work on his defensive play . Phil Jones (Man Utd) He arrived as the next Duncan Edwards but he has not lived up to that billing so far. It doesn’t help that his role in the team is undefined and injuries have hindered his progress, but if manager Louis van Gaal shows belief in him as a pure centre back, he can prosper. Belief: Manchester United defender Phil Jones could prosper with a run at centre back . Test: Defender Chris Smalling has failed to build on an impressive start at Manchester United . Chris Smalling (Man Utd) Similar to Jones, Smalling has not pushed on as he might have hoped. Their lack of development left England with a gaping defensive hole at the World Cup — they were not ready. But Van Gaal improved Holland’s defence and he can do the same with Smalling. Tom Ince (Hull City) A lot has been said about the young Ince but now he has to live up to the hype. His loan move to Palace didn’t really work last season but you have to admire him for turning down Inter Milan for the chance to play regularly at Hull. If he doesn’t, shine, he’ll be back in the Championship. Jack Colback (Newcastle) He was impressive at Sunderland last year but it takes a brave man to cross the Wear to Newcastle, especially on a free. Sol Campbell faced bitter abuse when he joined Arsenal from Spurs, let’s hope Jack does not suffer as much. The only way to keep people quiet is to play well. Big opportunity: Midfielder Jack Rodwell can finally fulfill his potential at Sunderland . Jack Rodwell (Sunderland) He has been considered a hot prospect for too long and now he has a chance to prove his worth. His career stalled when he left Everton for Man City, so with regular football this season he can show us his undoubted talent. He needs to lose his reputation of being injury-prone. Joe Cole (Aston Villa) His homecoming at West Ham never really went to plan, so much so his boyhood club were happy to release him in the summer. Now at Villa, he has to show he’s still got the ability that once made him one of the most exciting English midfielders of his generation. Ability: Veteran Joe Cole still has the talent to light up the Premier League . Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) When you spend the summer sulking because you can’t move clubs, you have to prove you are worth the hassle. Whether he stays at Southampton or gets his move to Tottenham, Schneiderlin needs to knuckle down and forget about all of this. Jack Wilshere (Arsenal) The biggest problem for Jack has been staying fit. He takes the game to the opposition and to do that you need to be in supreme condition. Because he’s so talented he’s been able to get by but after a good pre-season, now he can show that explosive pace again. Point to prove: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has to rediscover his explosive pace . Challenge: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge now has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez . Focus: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers must build on second place finish last season . Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) After the season he had last time out, you might not think he has much to prove. But now he has to show he can lead the line without Luis Suarez. There’s no doubting his ability but he needs to become Liverpool’s No1 goalscorer, Mr Reliable. Brendan Rodgers (Liverpool, manager) Rodgers said last year it wasn’t just about Luis Suarez, it was about a team — now he has to prove it. He plays to win and always encourages his teams to attack. I enjoy watching his sides go forward but he needs to show last season was not a one-off. Roy Keane (Aston Villa, asst manager) It’s back to the day-to-day life of football now for Roy and it will be fascinating to see how he gets on, particularly with Paul Lambert. He’s not making decisions, so it will be a new perspective and he really needs a positive experience in club management after some failures. Upheaval: Morgan Schneiderlin must knuckle down at Southampton... or Tottenham . Big call: Tom Ince made a bold decision to snub Inter Milan and sign for Hull City . Perspective: New Aston Villa No 2 Roy Keane needs to make a positive impact . Tackle Keown .","Chelsea keeper Courtois now he has to prove he is the present and future .

"Lewis Hamilton is working on improving his single-mindedness as he bids to improve his chances of winning this year's Formula One world title. Hamilton, who topped the timesheet following Friday practice ahead of Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, has shown himself to be a more resilient character throughout the course of this season compared to years gone by. The technical problems with Hamilton's Mercedes, which have put him on the back foot for the majority of this campaign, may have impacted more significantly on him in previous years. Lewis Hamilton is working on improving his single-mindedness as he bids to win this year's world title . However, older, wiser and more experienced, he has instead responded by taking the necessary steps to ensure his sole focus is on beating team-mate Nico Rosberg to the championship. When it was suggested to Hamilton that he is allowing nothing to get in his way this season, he replied: 'I am working on that because that has been my Achilles heel in the past. 'It is something you cannot force. It comes with time, but it is something I've been working on for a long time. 'I am nearly 30, so bit by bit with those experiences I have had, they have helped massively. 'This year, with all the difficult scenarios I have had, what really encourages me is how I have come through them. 'Take the last race in Italy. Although I won from pole, I dropped to fourth at the start. 'To come back and fight through such a difficulty is so much more satisfying and more powerful. 'Whilst people enjoyed watching it, I get so much more from it, so those experiences have really helped me a lot.' Hamilton, who has previously allowed off-track woes to affect him, is benefiting from a more settled personal life. The 29-year-old's romance with on-off-on-again girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger is going through a solid phase, as is his relationship with father Anthony - who cheered on his son again at the Marina Bay Street Circuit with Hamilton's step-mother Linda. VIDEO Hamilton pips Rosberg to pole . Nico Rosberg still leads the drivers' championship but has seen his lead cut to 22 points recently . After watching him win in Italy to close the gap to Rosberg to 22 points in the standings, it is the first time Hamilton senior has attended races back to back for some considerable time. 'Being settled personally is always a huge part of it,' remarked Hamilton junior. 'I am getting older and managing things better, and although things can always be better and you can always try to improve, at the moment things are quite calm. 'The water is really calm on my side. It makes things a little bit easier.' Much will depend on the reliability of his car, which has so far cost him countless points - and almost certainly the championship lead. However, the title chaser pointed out: 'When I have made mistakes I've always recovered. 'Even when the car has had a problem, which has been the majority of the time, I have generally recovered from it. 'I feel like I have come back and maximised every race given the scenarios I've had to handle. 'I've no idea what lies ahead of me, but I am better prepared than ever in terms of having the experiences, and where I am, to handle what is to come.' Hamilton pointed out that when he's recovered when mistakes have been made in the past . On track, under the bright Singaporean lights, Hamilton produced a solid start to the weekend by leading the way in practice, finishing 0.133 seconds clear of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Rosberg, meanwhile, was down in 13th as his low-fuel qualifying run on the fast supersoft tyres was thwarted by Pastor Maldonado hitting a wall in his Lotus, bringing out the red flags. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third, three tenths of a second down on Hamilton, followed by Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari. Sebastian Vettel, four-times champion and winner of this event for the last three years, was a remarkable fifth - 0.551secs behind Hamilton in his Red Bull. At the end of FP1 Vettel's car suffered an engine issue which resulted in his mechanics spending all their lunch break and the majority of FP2 working to replace the system. With 10 minutes remaining Vettel finally made it out on track on a set of supersoft tyres to push himself up the order. Jenson Button was seventh in his McLaren, with Marussia's Max Chilton 20th and four seconds down, but with his FP2 cut short by a turbo problem that forced him to pull off track.","Nico Rosberg still leads the Formula One drivers' championship .

"The Obama administration said Wednesday it is withholding from Israel some sensitive details of its nuclear negotiations with Iran because it is worried that Israeli government officials have leaked information to try to scuttle the talks — and will continue to do so. In extraordinary admissions that reflect increasingly strained ties between the U.S. and Israel, the White House and State Department said they were not sharing everything from the negotiations with the Israelis and complained that Israeli officials had misrepresented what they had been told in the past. Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials privately blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself for 'changing the dynamic' of previously robust information-sharing by politicizing it. The comments came as a late March deadline to forge the outline of an Iran nuclear deal looms. Tension: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Is the United States heading for a good or bad nuclear deal with Iran? Good, says Washington. Bad, says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . Netanyahu has angered the White House by his open opposition to a deal he believes threatens Israel's existence, and by accepting a Republican invitation to address Congress about Iran in early March without consulting the White House, a breach of diplomatic protocol. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that sharing all details of the negotiations with governments that are not at the table would complicate efforts to get a deal that would prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon in exchange for sanctions relief. The talks are being held among the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States — Germany and Iran. 'The United States is not going to be in a position of negotiating this agreement in public, particularly when we see that there is a continued practice of cherry-picking specific pieces of information and using them out of context to distort the negotiating position of the United States,' Earnest said, when asked whether the U.S. was limiting the amount of information it shared with Israel about the talks. Not happy: The tensions between the United States and Israel over negotiating with Tehran plunged to a new low when Mr. Netanyahu engineered an invitation to address a joint meeting of Congress, in less than two weeks, to warn against a 'bad deal.' 'So, there is an obligation when you're participating in these kinds of negotiations to ensure that those consultations and that those negotiations are carried out in good faith. And that means giving negotiators the room and the space to negotiate,' he said. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki went further, confirming that one of the steps the administration takes to ensure that 'classified negotiating details stay behind closed doors' is to withhold them from Israel. She also directly blamed Israel for mischaracterizing the talks. 'I think it's safe to say that not everything you're hearing from the Israeli government is an accurate reflection of the details of the talks,' she said. 'There's a selective sharing of information.' But while Earnest and Psaki said the limitations on information sharing were longstanding, U.S. officials more directly involved in the talks said the decision to withhold the most sensitive details of the negotiations dated back only several weeks. Those officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the administration believes Netanyahu, who is facing a March 17 election at home, has made a political decision to try to destroy the negotiations rather than merely insist on a good deal. This, they said, had led to politically motivated leaks from Israeli officials and made it impossible to continue to share all details of the talks, particularly as Netanyahu has not backed down on his vow to argue against a nuclear deal when he speaks to Congress. Deal maker? Iranian President Hassan Rowhani. Israel says any pact that stops short of totally dismembering Iranian programs with weapons-making potential is deeply flawed . Neither Earnest nor Psaki would discuss the details of the leaks but senior U.S. officials have expressed consternation with reports in the Israeli media as well as by The Associated Press about the number of centrifuges Iran might be able to keep under a potential agreement. Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium and diplomats familiar with the talks have said Iran may be allowed to keep more of them in exchange for other concessions under current proposals that are on the table. Netanyahu has insisted that Iran, whose top officials have sworn to obliterate Israel, should not be allowed to enrich any uranium. The U.S. and its partners say that stance is untenable because Iran would never accept it. As the talks have progressed, Netanyahu's opposition to an agreement has increased over what he believes to be extreme concessions made to Iran that would leave it as a threshold nuclear weapons power and a direct threat to Israel's existence. The White House and State Department maintained that the U.S. will not leave Israel threatened. They also insisted that Israel has not been completely cut out of the loop and that overall security cooperation with the Jewish state remains strong. Administration officials and some lawmakers have said they will not attend the speech.","State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki says 'not everything you're hearing from the Israeli government is an accurate depiction of the talks'

"In October 2007, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy travelled to Seville to meet the man of the moment. On this occasion it was Juande Ramos. Sevilla’s coach had won two UEFA Cups on the bounce and seemed like a good bet to replace Martin Jol as Tottenham’s new manager. A few months after his appointment at White Hart Lane, central defender Jonathan Woodgate referred to him as ‘a proper manager’ when they progressed to the final of the Carling Cup. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has a tendency to appoint the 'man of the moment' at White Hart Lane . It looked like they were finally on to a good thing, but that has been said at Spurs a few times. Under Levy’s stewardship, this man-of-the-moment mentality has become something of a trend at White Hart Lane. They simply have to have it. Shortly after Ramos won the League Cup at Wembley with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in extra time - the club’s last major trophy - he was fired after a few dodgy results the following season. Harry Redknapp was rewarded for his survival exploits at Portsmouth and the victory over Cardiff in the 2008 FA Cup final by landing the Spurs job. Again, he was another man of the moment. Even Andre Villas-Boas, sacked by Chelsea in February 2012, was still operating in the after-glow of his treble with Porto when he replaced Redknapp. Juande Ramos was one such appointment and he won Tottenham's last trophy, the Carling Cup in 2008 . Steffen Freund, a former Tottenham player, was brought in from a decent position with the DFB to work as the assistant manager. Freund has since been moved aside and is working as a club ambassador. When things are going wrong, as they certainly appear to be at Tottenham, Levy will always make moves to appease the supporters. Ramos was sacked by Spurs later in 2008 . Which takes us to Paul Mitchell. The wheels were in motion to bring in Southampton’s head of recruitment several days before Tottenham were well beaten by Stoke at White Hart Lane on November 9. Earlier that week Mitchell had reluctantly been paraded by Southampton at the opening of the club’s new sparkling training centre, where he spoke enthusiastically about the future of the club. By then, he knew he was on his way to north London. His reputation has soared in recent months and rightly so. Mitchell was part of former executive chairman Nicola Cortese’s vision for the club. The signing of Dejan Lovren is, possibly, Mitchell’s biggest success. During his spell at Lyon, the Croatia central defender was overlooked by scouts of Europe’s leading clubs because of a perceived problem with his discipline. He was often suspended, missing key games in the French league because he accumulated too many bookings. To Mitchell’s credit, he had watched Lovren live so many times that he realised the Croat was a victim of the high defensive line employed by the Lyon coach Remi Garde. Southampton signed him for £8.5m in the summer of 2013 and he looked every inch a Champions League player in his debut season on the south coast. Harry Redknapp was rewarded with the Tottenham manager's job after his exploits at Portsmouth . Andre Villas-Boas was still basking in the glow of his Porto treble when he replaced Redknapp . A year later he was sold to Liverpool for £20m and what has happened to his form since then is Brendan Rodgers’ business, not Mitchell’s. Southampton’s capture of Lovren, and his subsequent performances at the heart of their defence, earned Mitchell respect throughout the club. He was a steal. His eye for a player is well known in the game and his enthusiasm for travel has distinguished him from many of his contemporaries at other clubs. This bodes well for Tottenham. Levy has started a massive restructuring programme of his scouting and recruitment divisions after realising just how far behind they are in terms of modern methods. For too long they have relied on the Scout7 and Wyscout systems to alert them to player performance around the world. Levy, aware that north London rivals Arsenal have 12 full-time, paid scouts, has realised they need to get out there and start watching some games. Mitchell is that man. He has joined a club that is widely-recognised as the most political in the Barclays Premier League and there are too many people wanting to hang around the first team on matchday. Part of Levy’s masterplan is to bringing some structure to the club’s recruitment policy after squandering the Gareth Bale money in a calamitous supermarket sweep before the transfer deadline in 2013. Mitchell, to his credit, is the answer. There are few more hard-working men operating behind the scenes and he will go to any game, anywhere. Paul Mitchell's task is to overhaul Tottenham's scouting system and have the success he did at Southampton . Current Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino lobbied for Mitchell's appointment . Mauricio Pochettino has been lobbying Levy for his appointment, promising the Tottenham chairman that he can make the difference behind the scenes. The pressure is on. It represents quite a change of heart by Tottenham’s head coach because he has left Oscar Perarnau, his sporting director at his previous club Espanyol, high and dry since moving to England. There was a time when Pochettino wanted Perarnau at Southampton and had argued his case for his arrival with Cortese. He remained loyal to Mitchell. There will be more upheaval at Spurs in the coming weeks as Levy recruits some full-time scouts to work with Mitchell. If it doesn’t work out this time, then it will be time for the main man to come under pressure.","Juande Ramos looked like a good bet after winning Carling Cup in 2008 .

'It [money] has not been an issue at all for me. It was not an issue in my discussions with various clubs,' Odegaard said. 'I chose what was best for me in sporting terms.' Having visited a number of Premier League sides before deciding to switch to the Bernabeu, Odegaard is set to start his Real Madrid career in the reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla, coached by legend Zinedine Zidane. 'It was a process where I visited several clubs, which was reported. A decision was made after that,' he added. '[Zidane is] one of the world's best footballers of all time.'

Meanwhile, Real could face the same transfer ban imposed on Barcelona after Fifa opened an investigation into their signing of under age players. The club presented Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva this week just three days after making a huge financial commitment to sign 16-year-old Martin Odegaard and the suspicion in Spain is that the club are preparing for the worst after Fifa’s merciless exclusion of Barcelona from the transfer market for the next 12 months. The investigation into Madrid focuses on two 12-year-olds brought to Madrid from Venezuela in 2012. Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach River Plate and Milan, Madrid snapped them up via an intermediary who has a soccer school in the Spanish capital.

The 23-year-old winger arrived from Wigan Athletic for £4.75million having failed to reproduce his stunning form from the 2013 FA Cup final on a consistent basis. Pulis said: 'Callum has got something to prove. He's a great age and he's just right for us. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE . Aston Villa have made a late charge to steal MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli from under Newcastle's noses. It is understood Paul Lambert has launched an ambitious attempt to land the 18-year-old midfielder before Monday's transfer deadline. As revealed by Sportsmail last week, Newcastle have made Alli a primary transfer target this month. Burnley are showing an interest in Celtic's Anthony Stokes as they weigh up late additions to their squad. The 26-year-old former Arsenal and Sunderland striker is open to a move and keen to return to England. Aston Villa have joined Newcastle by showing interest in MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli. Newcastle are willing to pay £4m rising to £5m and allow the 18-year-old to return to Dons on loan for the rest of the season. Villa have discussed a similar deal with slightly more up front for the England Under 19 international who has scored 12 goals this season. Lazio have expressed an interest in taking over Real Madrid's loan for Javier Hernandez. However, the move is doomed before it gets off the ground as the striker has already played for Manchester United in the League and Capital One Cup and can't play for three clubs in one season. Manchester United are ready to offer a contract to Salford City trialist Sadik El Fitouri. Sportsmail revealed how the 20-year-old right-back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first team fringe players. He has continued to impress in training and in games and United are willing to offer an 18-month deal. Crystal Palace have joined the chase for Bolton’s South Korean international Chung-Yong Lee as manager Alan Pardew eyes a hat-trick of Eagles signings before the close of the transfer window. Pardew has already signed £5.75million QPR midfielder Jordon Mutch and is close to signing former Newcastle United striker Shola Ameobi who is a free agent. But with Bolton looking to offload Lee for £500,000 as his contract enters its final six months, Pardew is interested in the 26-year-old wide player who he feels represents good value for money. AC Milan are on the verge of completing a loan deal for Roma and Italy forward Mattia Destro. Destro travelled to Milan on Thursday after agreeing terms with the club, who have already reached a deal with Roma. The deal includes an option to buy Destro at the end of the season for a reported 16million euros (£12m). Roberto Martinez has admitted he is unlikely to sign a striker to replace Samuel Eto'o as he backed Arouna Kone to deliver Everton's goals. Eto'o completed his move to Sampdoria earlier this week, which leaves Everton with Romelu Lukaku and Kone as their only recognised strikers. Kone has endured a wretched time at Goodison Park, scoring only once since his £5million move from Wigan in 2013 and being restricted to a handful of starts because of a serious knee problem, but Martinez's faith in him is total. Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard is being considered by MLS franchises ahead of next season. Howard, 35, is a big commercial draw following his exploits in the World Cup and would be open to a return. He is a popular figure at Everton but Roberto Martinez is working on bringing in a new goalkeeper that will eventually replace him. Tom Ince is closing in on a loan move to Derby County - but Hull City are asking for a fee of £300,000. The Rams are reluctant to part with such a hefty amount, particularly because east Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest didn't pay a penny for a loan earlier in the season. But Ince is happy to leave the KC Stadium in pursuit of first team football and is keen on playing for Steve McClaren. Borussia Dortmund are laying the groundwork for the potential departure of Mats Hummels to Manchester United. Hummels has underlined in recent days that he intends to see out his contract but it is understood meetings have taken place outlining a price to United of around £37million. Dortmund have also earmarked a potential replacement in Dinamo Kiev's Aleksandar Dragovic and have made contact this week. Sportsmail's Simon Jones is reporting Lazio may come in to take over Real Madrid's loan of Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez. The Mexican striker has scored four goals in 14 matches for Real since Louis van Gaal allowed him to go out on loan back in August. Tottenham target Yevhen Konoplykana has revealed his interest in a move to Roma and says that the Serie A side and his club Dnipro have an agreement in place. The winger, who scored a stunning goal against England at Wembley, is in high demand - with a number of clubs including Liverpool credited with an interest. But the Ukraine international insists that despite an agreement between the clubs, talk of an immediate move is premature. Sportsmail's Simon Jones reporting that Jack Cork's move from Southampton to Swansea could be agreed today and completed after Sunday's Premier League clash between the sides. Mario Balotelli's agent has revealed the striker is 'very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool but has no immediate plans to leave the club. The former AC Milan striker has failed to score a single Premier League goal since arriving at Anfield for £16million and has faced considerable criticism from supporters. But Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, said the striker is not ready to turn his back on Brendan Rodgers. Ravel Morrison has all but confirmed his transfer to Serie A side Lazio after posting a picture of his new shirt online. The 21-year-old midfielder travelled to Italy on Wednesday to have a medical and complete his move from West Ham, where he has fallen out of favour. And Morrison appears to have sealed a deal to play for the sixth club of his career after releasing a picture of his name on the back of a Lazio shirt with the caption: 'Ravel 4'. http://instagram.com/p/yb96AZICUE/?modal=true . Paul Pogba will leave Juventus within 18 months and could even be sold in the summer. The France international is being courted by a host of top clubs across Europe. Manchester United, who somewhat controversially allowed Pogba to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2012, are interested in bringing the 21-year-old back to Old Trafford. Roberto Mancini has implored Yaya Toure to move to Italy in the summer, and wants the midfielder to become his lynchpin at Inter Milan. The Ivorian's future at Manchester City has been an ongoing concern since the summer fiasco whereby Toure and his agent told half-truths about varying situations. Mancini said: 'He's been to Belgium, Russia, Spain and England, but he's missing Italy. It could be a good opportunity for him to come and try.' In Italy, Corriere dello Sport, report that Mattia Destro's move from Roma to Milan will go through today. Milan's vice-president Adriano Galliani made a personal mission to Destro's house in Rome to convince him to sign a loan deal. The paper also suggest that Roma are interested in signing Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano and Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka. Scott Sinclair has reportedly passed a medical as he looks set to complete a move to Aston Villa - as first reported by Sportsmail - and end an unproductive spell at Manchester City. West Ham are showing an interest in Bafetimbi Gomis at Swansea. The France international is keen to leave the Liberty Stadium and would be keen on a move to Upton Park. Crystal Palace have made offers for Gomis but the 29-year-old was reluctant to move to Selhurst Park. He has also been offereed to Schalke and Borussia Dortmund. German keeper Arvid Schenk has left Dundee after weeks after letting in six goals on his debut. The 25-year-old signed a short-term deal in October and made his debut in the 6-2 New Year's Day defeat by rivals Dundee United. Dundee's website stated: 'Goalkeeper Arvid Schenk has this morning left the club at the end of his contract.' MORE TO FOLLOW . Chelsea have agreed to cash-in on Andre Schurrle to free up the funds to sign Juan Cuadrado. The move for Colombian Cuadrado, 26, could even be completed in time for him to to play in Saturday’s top of the table game against Manchester City, with Chelsea eager to register him.

"As US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson beavers away on his potential Ryder Cup pairings, it is the combination of bad luck and bad judgement that is threatening to undermine his prospects. This week the PGA Tour season draws to a close with the FedEx Cup finale in Atlanta and the feelgood factor should be overpowering since two young American thrusters presently sit one and two in the race for the £6.2million bonus. Both have just completed outstanding victories, showing exactly the sort of composure under pressure that would make them ideal for Gleneagles. Trouble is, neither of them will be there. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watson picks Bradley, Mayan and Simpson . Eyes on the prize: But Tom Watson's (left) US captain's picks have been heavily questioned . Unlucky: 2008 skipper Paul Azinger thinks Chris Kirk was unlucky to miss out . Watson overlooking Chris Kirk in favour of Webb Simpson is looking a bigger mistake with each passing day, while Billy Horschel’s emergence a week late for wild card consideration is indicative of the sort of misfortune America can ill afford. The expressive Horschel, precisely the sort of passionate character who thrives at a Ryder Cup, summed it up well after his fine victory at the BMW Championship on Sunday. ‘Tom won’t be kicking himself for not picking me but he will probably be wanting to kick me for not playing like this a little earlier,’ said the 27-year-old. The turn of events has left America’s last winning Ryder Cup captain feeling distinctly uneasy. ‘I would have picked Chris over Webb, certainly,’ said Paul Azinger, skipper in 2008. ‘Chris has won twice this year, he’s hot and I like hot players. Why not pick a rookie? It’s OK picking experience if you’re European but so often with us it’s losing experience.’ Wildcard: 2012 US Open champion Webb Simpson has been selected for his debut Ryder Cup appearance . Late charge: Billy Horschel missed out despite his excellent recent form, including winning the BWM Championship . Just to complete the picture, Phil Mickelson will turn up at Gleneagles and find the first questions will be about his PR gaffe of walking out of the BMW at the halfway stage. His playing partner Keegan Bradley also dropped out. He was given the all-clear regarding a rules decision by the PGA Tour’s chief referee and still decided it wasn’t enough to settle his state of mind. His bizarre withdrawal cost him his place among the top 30 this week. Actually, there will only be 29 in attendance. The man who finished 30th was Dustin Johnson, and his absence is just one more sorry aspect of a team in a palpable state of disarray, with the Ryder Cup now only a fortnight away. Controversy: Phil Mickelson ruffled some feathers with his withdrawal in Denver . Out of contention: Keegan Bradley also dropped out of the BMW Championship . The first major occasion to take place in Scotland after the independence referendum will be the Ryder Cup. And, now there is the distinct possibility of a ‘Yes’ vote, it is intriguing to wonder what impact, if any, it would have on the event or the atmosphere. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, a keen golfer and high-profile supporter of the Ryder Cup, will be prominent anyway, but imagine if he is empowered with the mandate he seeks? One thing that must be running through the mind of Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley — if Scotland is awash with patriotic fervour, it might be a smart move to send Stephen Gallacher out in the opening series of matches. Referendum: Scot Stephen Gallagher would be a popular choice for the opening series of matches if the yes vote wins out in the Scottish independence referendum . VIDEO Watson picks Bradley, Mayan and Simpson . No surprise to see rabid sports fan Rory McIlroy take in the home opener for the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium on Sunday night. After his recent experience at Old Trafford, it must have been nice for him to see the home team win for a change. What was noticeable watching the match on television, though, was how often the cameras cut to McIlroy, who was given tickets by the Broncos’ star quarterback, Peyton Manning. He was shown signing autographs before the match and then profiled at least three times thereafter. If ever proof was needed he is now a worldwide, A-list sporting superstar, this was surely it. Superstar: Rory McIlroy was swamped by autograph hunters at Denver Broncos' season opener . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . 'What a week. I got to drive some sweet cars at the BMW and not I'm off to Atlanta. It just means the world to me.' American Morgan Hoffman started the FedEx Cup play-offs in 124th place out of the 125 qualifiers. Now, after shooting 62 and 63 at the weekend, he is one of 29 who will contest the finale in Atlanta and is exempt from the Masters, the US Open and the Open next year.

"Luke Donald or Lee Westwood? The man who has never lost a foursomes match on European soil or the rock of so many Ryder Cup victories? The man with a brilliant singles record and the only player to have competed in four Ryder Cups and never been on a losing side; or the golfer who is an inspirational figure both on the course and in the team room? That, I believe, should be the incredibly difficult choice facing Europe’s captain Paul McGinley on Tuesday on what promises to be an intriguing wildcard occasion on both sides of the Atlantic. For McGinley, it’s a High Noon in every sense with his three-card trick being broadcast to the nation at midday, while his opposite number Tom Watson’s choices follow on around midnight (UK time). Let us start with McGinley, and the four players in the frame for the three precious spots: Ian Poulter, Stephen Gallacher, Donald and Westwood. On paper, you would go for the three Englishmen every time, and never mind that the match is being played 34 miles from Gallacher’s home at Gleneagles. The trio have got the Ryder Cup medals to prove it, and few captains ever bestow a pick on debutants. Tough to split: Paul McGinley may have to choose between Lee Westwood and Luke Donald for the Ryder Cup . Tough choice: Donald is among four Brits in the running to make captain McGinley's Europe team . Out of form: Veteran and Cup inspiration Westwood isn't in good touch coming into the clash with the USA . But the problem McGinley faces is the palpable fact that all three Englishmen are hopelessly out of form. Poulter has garnered fewer world ranking points this year than any other player in the top 40 except the injured Tiger Woods. Westwood did not even make the top 100 who were eligible for the second FedEx Cup event that finished in America on Monday night, while Donald has not had a single high finish all summer. Going into a Ryder Cup with a quarter of your team misfiring to this extent in regular tournaments would surely be placing far too much value on experience over form and constitute a gamble veering towards the reckless. Gallacher, meanwhile, has gathered more world ranking points than Donald and Poulter combined. The match is being played on European soil and in his last four European starts he has finished tied fourth, tied 15th at The Open, tied seventh, and third at the Italian Open on Sunday. He finished so close to making it by right - just 1.16 points behind ninth-placed Graeme McDowell -it’s no wonder there is such a clamour for McGinley to make an exception in this instance and bestow a wildcard on a rookie. Mr Ryder Cup: Ian Poulter's won his last seven Ryder Cup matches and was an inspiration at Medinah . Rookie: Scotland's Stephen Gallacher has more world ranking points than Donald and Poulter combined . WILDCARD CONTENDERS . Age: 38. Ryder Cups: 4. This season: Disappointing doesn’t begin to cover it, with injuries playing a big part. Why he should be picked: Seriously? After what happened at Medinah? Why he shouldn’t: Inconceivable that Captain McGinley wouldn’t pick ‘Mr Ryder Cup’. Age: 41. Ryder Cups: 8. This season: Top-15 finishes at two majors and a win in Malaysia. Why he should be picked: Never let Europe down in all those eight matches. Why he shouldn’t: Can he still hole the big putts when vital points are on the line? Age: 36. Ryder Cups: 4. This season: Runner-up in PGA Tour event  and tied third in Europe’s flagship event. Why he should be picked: Europe’s best putter and wonderful Ryder Cup record. Why he shouldn’t: Coming off the most disappointing summer of his career. Age: 39. Ryder Cups: 0. This season: Wonderfully consistent, and beat McIlroy to win in Dubai. Why he should be picked: Fabulous ball striker, and hometown hero. Why he shouldn’t: Lacks experience. Can he handle the unique atmosphere? There is one other factor that ought to be considered as well, for you do not have to be a rabid advocate for Scottish independence to wonder what effect it would have on the atmosphere if McGinley went for three out-of-form Englishmen over the hometown hero. Alongside Gallacher, the case for Poulter is unanswerable. How could you possibly leave out the man who has won his last seven Ryder Cup matches and turned the last contest at Medinah in Europe’s favour almost single-handedly? Just to complete the picture, Poulter was playing average golf going into previous Ryder Cups and still delivered. So that leaves Donald or Westwood. Waiting for Donald is the perfect foursomes partner in his great friend, the revitalised Sergio Garcia. Waiting for Westwood would be 11 team-mates who all look up to him and recognise his contribution to Ryder Cup lore. Helping Westwood’s case is the fact one of McGinley’s assistant captains is Sam Torrance. He is one of Westwood’s closest golfing buddies and already on record as saying he believes he should be in the team. In the hot seat: McGinley will make his call on the final three wildcards for Europe on Tuesday . EUROPE . Already qualified: Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, Thomas Bjorn, Graeme McDowell. Three wildcards to be added. USA . Certainty: Keegan Bradley. Probable: Hunter Mahan. Possibles: Webb Simpson, Chris Kirk, Brandt Snedeker, Russell Henley. Already qualified: Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Speith, Patrick Reed, Zach Johnson. But the thing that might prove pivotal in this marginal decision is the fact Westwood has shown glimpses of his true form this summer. There was a special round of 63 to close out the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone and three rounds in the 60s - including one of 65 in the first round - at the US PGA Championship. From Donald, alas, the magic has been missing. Still, leaving out the match play specialist, and perhaps the best putter in European golf? One thing is for certain: whoever gets the call will be under immense pressure to justify his selection. As for the Americans, Watson has had a good three weeks following his embarrassing uncertainty regarding Tiger Woods, when even a fool could see Tiger was not in any fit state to play. Since then, Keegan Bradley has stepped up to the plate and will resume his formidable partnership with Phil Mickelson, as has Hunter Mahan, who will be burning to make amends for his fatal mistake against Graeme McDowell in their singles match at Celtic Manor in 2010. Miracle at Medinah: (from left) Justin Rose celebrates last year's Ryder Cup win Westwood, Donald and  Poulter . Regarding the third spot, that could well be determined by events at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston late last night, where a clutch of young Americans had the ideal opportunity to impress against Rory McIlroy. It should be some Wildcard Tuesday. QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘I don’t think he needs a swing coach. If I were advising him, I’d tell him: “You’re the greatest player that ever lived, just go to the range and hit shots”.’ Butch Harmon, the best coach Tiger Woods ever had, offers some sound advice in the wake of Tiger’s not-so-shocking split from his most recent guru, Sean Foley. Second chances in life are rarely so profitable or joyous as Colin Montgomerie’s on the senior circuit. An overwhelming 10-shot triumph at Woburn on Sunday in the Travis Perkins Masters was his third victory of a season that has also seen him claim two senior majors and has taken the 51-year-old Scot’s earnings to loose change short of $2million. By my calculations, that places him just above the amount mustered by Justin Rose for seventh place in the Race to Dubai.

"There’s something in Nathan Cleverly’s eyes that’s making me even more excited about this rematch between him and Tony Bellew. We all know this is a grudge match and that they don’t like each other. They hate each other, really. But I always had a bit of a thought that the spite was mostly coming from Tony’s side. For two years it’s all he talks to me about: ‘I want to fight Cleverly.’ He’ll constantly tell me how much he hates him, can’t stand him, even the look of him. He has nothing but violent thoughts towards him. With Nathan, I’ve always had the feeling it was maybe a bit more relaxed. This rematch was always on his agenda and it was a big part of our conversations when he signed with us. Then, after he and Bellew won in Liverpool earlier in the month, I saw a slightly different side. Bellew got up close, they nearly went for it and I saw in Nathan right there that he was willing to go, at ringside. Exchange: A war of words broke out between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew in Liverpool . Heated: The two warring British fighters will meet again in the ring in November . Speaking their mind: Both Cleverly and Bellew are interviewed by Sky's Ed Robinson . He wanted to fight right there. He wants this fight as much as Tony does. As a promoter this is good and bad. If this spills out of control, it will be bad for all of us. These guys are role models and it has to happen in the ring. But on the other hand, when the grudge is authentic and the fighters are well matched, then you have something special. I'd say there is much more venom in this than Carl Froch- George Groves. I think this fight will be something special. At the moment I am going over some of the final logistics. I’m down to two main options – November 29 in the Echo Arena or November 1 at the MEN in Manchester. Manchester will hold more, about 20,000 versus 12,000, but my instinct is leaning towards Liverpool. I have to take my hat off to Nathan, he went to Tony's back yard before and he is willing to do it again but ultimately the numbers will decide. I can reveal here that I'm working to ensure this fight is a final eliminator for a world title, even though I believe the winner AND loser will go on to fight for a world title. Title or not, this fight is huge. Challenge: Bellew calls out Cleverly after his win over Julio Cesar Dos Santos at the Echo Arena . Tight: Cleverly beat Bellew by majority decision in their first meeting at the Echo Arenia in October 2011 . I have signed Matthew Macklin and his first outing for Matchroom will be on August 30 in Dublin against Jorge Sebastien Heiland. It will be a WBC eliminator, with the winner moving within one fight of Miguel Cotto. It’s a huge bout for Macklin. We sold out at the box office after a few minutes. Heiland is a tough, live opponent. He is ranked No 4 and Macklin is No 9, so he has a tough night ahead. He came to us a few weeks back wanting an opportunity and now he has it. Although Andy Lee was on the radar, this WBC opportunity could set up a final eliminator with Martin Murray - what an enormous fight that would be. All roads had seemed to lead to Lee for Macklin, but while that would have been a huge fight in Ireland, this is the best way to a world title. For us, Macklin opens up the markets in Dublin and the Midlands so fans there can expect more shows. On board: Matthew Macklin has signed for Matchroom Boxing and will fight in Dublin on August 30 . On the same Dublin bill, Anthony Joshua will fight Yaroslav Zavorotnyi. This is a step up that I hope will get him some rounds. The challenge we are facing with AJ is that he is destroying everyone we put in front of him, regardless of their credentials. He is that good. This fight ought to test him. This guy went 10 rounds before losing on points to David Price, a big puncher, and has only been stopped twice, once against Nikolai Valuev and once in a European title fight. He is tough, has fought top fighters and has stopped 14 of his 16 victims. This fight will give us a good comparison with David Price, as that’s a fight we are looking at for the future. Our plan is to win this fight, then fight Michael Sprott in London on October 11. Then we go for a big name. It might be Sam Sexton, Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora. It might be Price. My personal opinion is that he would beat any of those now. But this is a special talent and we are managing him correctly. At the moment we are taking him around the country and the crowds are just amazing. Everyone wants to see him fight and rightly so. He is growing every fight. On the rise: Anthony Joshua's next assignment will be against Yaroslav Zavorotnyi in Dublin . Domestic tussle: Joshua could fight Liverpudlian heavyweight David Price in the future . Chisora-Fury is off due to a late injury suffered by Chisora. I mentioned earlier about the value of a proper grudge match. I’m not sure I ever saw that in Fury versus Chisora. After months of head-to-head press conferences the fight failed to live up to expectations at the box office and never really captured the public's imagination. I like Tyson, he’s a good guy. I have met him and he seems a decent fella in a sport that needs characters. I’d never tell him to completely change but as a role model in the sport he often over steps the mark and loses a bit of control, hence why the BBBC have been talking to him lately about his behaviour. It looked to me like sometimes he is pressured into behaving wildly in the build up to this fight to try and sell it. They had such a long lead up and so many head-to-heads that they always needed to say something new and exciting. It just didn’t feel very real and I think the punters can see through that. I thought that Fury would have won that fight and looked good in doing so. Abandoned: Tyson Fury's rematch with Dereck Chisora has been called off due to an injury . The Commonwealth Games are wonderful for amateur boxing but they are good for promoters as well. It’s competitions like this and the Olympics and world championships where promoters will have an eye on who the emerging talent is. At Matchroom we have always committed to young talent and I think it was a huge coup for us to get the likes of Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell, two Olympic gold medallists, after 2012. Going into these Games, I think the two guys making the most noise are Antony Fowler and Andrew Selby. They have had excellent amateur careers and I think they will be good pro prospects as well. Fowler reminds me a bit of Carl Froch in his style and work ethic– he is really good to watch. And Selby looks like one of the very best amateur talents to come out of this country. I’ll be keeping an eye on them and so should you. Glove affair: Antony Fowler will represent England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .","Cleverly-Bellew has more hate and venom than Froch-Groves .

"Gaffe-prone Vice President Joe Biden has learned a thing or two during his 64 months in the Obama administration, including the need to avoid broadcasting F-bombs like the one he let loose on Mar 23, 2010. That was the day the president triumphantly announced the signing of the Affordable Care Act. But Biden unwittingly stole the spotlight by introducing Obama, embracing him and saying – loudly enough for the podium microphone to capture it – 'This is a big f***ing deal.' '[A] piece of advice about that ""BFD"" stuff: . Assume every microphone is on,' Biden told a crowd gathered on Monday at the starting line of the annual Ride 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge, a cycling event that raises money for wounded-veterans charities. Scroll down for video of the infamous moment . I didn't mean it: Biden insisted he never intentionally called the Obamacare signing 'a big f***ing deal,' but his words looking intentional on network video feeds . Gaffer-in-chief: Biden's famous moments have included asking a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge applause,and saying of the 2009 federal stimulus that there was 'a 30% chance we're going to get it wrong' Riders travel 325 miles from Washington, D.C. to Virginia Beach every year on Memorial Day for the event. 'I just want . you to know, I didn't intentionally say that,' he added, according to CNN. 'I actually turned and I said, ""Mr. President,"" and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips.' 'Thank God my mother was . gone or I'd have been one dead vice president.' His words, however, were clearly audible and went out on every broadcast network covering the event. The Associated Press reported at the time that 'Biden appeared to be offering that perspective to Obama privately.' Moments later, then-White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs tweeted, 'And yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right.' A Ride 2 Recovery coordinator who introduced Biden playfully warned the crowd that 'for those of you who don't know, Joe is famous for some of his one liners.' 'There was a bill signing at the White House ... and he said it was a ""big f-ing deal."" And that was a quote ... If I may say, sir, Ride to Recovery is a big f-ing deal.' The introduction also included the prediction . that 'at some point in the future Joe is going to run for president . again.' In response, Biden was seen making a dramatic sign of the cross on his body. Biden's mouth often out-runs his brain, as he proved in 2010 with an open microphone and an F-bomb . Goofball: Biden mugged for a camera with Obama to launch his Instagram account, but was better-known for saying that in his home state of Delaware, 'you cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.' The vice president, who is mulling a White House run in 2016, also mentioned the controversy swirling around the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is accused of using phony off-the-books waiting lists to mask its failure to provide timely health care to battle-tested servicemen and women. 'That is a sacred obligation, and we’re behind right now,' the he conceded. 'The VA is having problems, and we’ve got to get to the bottom of it.' 'This is a long-term commitment this nation has to make,' Biden said, 'so it seems to me on this day we as Americans have to recommit ourselves not just with words but with deeds.'","Biden told Memorial Day charity bike riders that they he learned his lesson from the F-bomb he uttered on live television in 2010 .

"Looking back nearly two weeks on I am still stunned by the scale of Carl Froch's fight against George Groves. The pressure on everyone involved was so big, but no one carried more than Carl. The winner was always going to go on and become the biggest household name in British boxing and I always felt that despite everything Carl has achieved, he would be judged on that night. That’s brutal but that’s life. I went in to see him before the fight and I told him: ‘You simply have to win because everything you have achieved will mean nothing if you don’t.’ He said: ‘I know, it's unbelievable, eh?’ It’s not fair, but what can you do? The finish was stunning, the night was stunning. Job done: Carl Froch celebrates his win over George Groves at Wembley in May . Now we are looking at the next step for Carl. There is no cast iron guarantee that Carl will fight again unless the opportunity is right. If the right fight doesn't present itself there is a real possibility Carl will retire. There are three realistic options for opponents – a third fight with Mikkel Kessler, James DeGale and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. I don’t think Carl is in any rush to fight again and I don’t think in his mind he is 100 per cent about coming back. It is all about the opportunity. A fight in Las Vegas is what he really wants to do and Chavez would be the most realistic fight to happen in Vegas. It is not necessarily 'Vegas or nothing', but all the noises from Carl are that he has done almost everything and what could possibly follow Wembley? ‘What can get me motivated like I was for that fight?’ is how he looks at it. I had a meeting with James DeGale last week, I am meeting Sauerland Promotions on Wednesday and on Tuesday I spoke to Bob Arum about Chavez and Vegas. Like I said and Carl has said many times, he wants to fight in Vegas. I think he wants Chavez more, but there is always a case for big domestic fights and he likes going to war with Kessler. They like punching each other. If DeGale or Kessler could be made in Vegas then Carl would consider those as well, but being realistic Chavez is the Vegas fight and I know it would sell. Write caption here . The big one: Froch would rather fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in Las Vegas . We now need to look into the demand, appetite and money for all our options. DeGale is an interesting case because he is the IBF mandatory challenger, but Carl doesn’t have to fight him until February. It’s feasible that Carl will fight someone else this time and then come back to DeGale in Spring. It is also possible that Carl will take a break and come back next Spring, but if he comes back this year it is likely to be at the end of November. He wants Vegas and that is what I am working on. From one world title fight to another. We have agreed terms with Golden Boy for Kell Brook to fight Shawn Porter on August 9 at the Barclays Centre in New York. I have been quite vocal on Twitter in not announcing fights until contracts are signed. The process is simple – you agree terms and then you proceed to contracts. That is where we are at in this moment. We expect to execute those contracts within the next 24 hours. I don’t see any issues coming up. We tried everything we could to get Porter to the UK but there was zero interest from their team. We are very happy with the deal, though, and Kell is in fantastic shape. He has been training since March, when he had his last fight, and his weight is perfect. He is absolutely firing on all cylinders. I cannot see anything else other than a stoppage win for Kell Brook. Done deal: Kell Brook (right) is down to fight Shawn Porter on August 9 at the Barclays Centre in New York . No trip: Porter (here knocking down Paulie Malignaggi) didn't have any interest in a fight over in Great Britain . It is a big shout – Porter is a great talent. But let’s break it down. Porter’s win over Devon Alexander to win the IBF title was impressive, but Alexander was inactive. Then there was the performance against Paulie Malignaggi, which was impressive but how much does Malignaggi have left? Porter also drew with Julio Diaz, and went the distance with Phil Lo Greco. Shawn Porter is certainly not superman. I am confident that if he mauls forward and tries to fight like he did against Malignaggi, then he will walk on to one against Brook. Brook is not Malignaggi. When he hits you, you know about it. A deal will be done on Wednesday or Thursday and then Kell will have the fight he wants so badly. I was so happy to see Jamie McDonnell become a two-time world champion on Carl Froch’s undercard. He has had a horrible 12 months, having his IBF world title stripped because of politics, but he has the WBA world bantamweight title and we are now planning his next move. Who next? We saw Paul Butler beat Stuart Hall to take McDonnell’s old IBF belt and now we have the prospect of two British fighters in a unification fight. Frank Warren, Butler’s promoter, says he has made an offer, but neither Jamie nor I have received an offer. Just champion: Jamie McDonnell became a two-time world title holder at Wembley . Next up? McDonnell could face Paul Butler (right) in a unification fight . That said, it is a fight we would love to make. We have sent a written offer to Butler's team for a huge purse of £200,000. If Frank wants to beat that offer, then we will certainly consider it. We don’t want to play games, let’s make this fight. Brian Rose is fighting for a world title this weekend against Demetrius Andrade in New York. This is a huge opportunity for Brian. He has been out there for a couple of weeks and is living the dream. There are question marks over whether he can do it at this level, but he is a mandatory challenger and has earned the right to this shot. He is very confident and we all believe he can do it, but this is a tough, tough job. I am going to New York on Wednesday where I have a series of meetings lined up with Golden Boy, HBO, Top Rank etc to discuss all sorts of things. I am discussing Porter against Brook, Froch and Chavez, the possibility of Kevin Mitchell against Miguuel Vazquez for the IBF lightweight title, and the possibility of Lee Selby against Evgeny Gradovich for the IBF featherweight title. Plenty is going on. A Rose win would make this an incredible trip.

"An animal lover who lives in a remote mountain town keeps two adult lions as pets much to the annoyance and criticism of his neighbours and friends, who he says think they are just 'killers'. Ales Basista, 53, from Stupava in the Czech Republic, has been keeping lions since 2012, and has done everything from nursing them back the health to playing with them in the garden. His neighbours and friends meanwhile have been very critical of decision to keep and raise the lions, and many others around the world have disagreed with keeping lions as private pets. Scroll down for video... Ales Basista has been raising lions for two years since he rescued a lion cub from a circus and, with the help of a hospital, nursed it back to health . Playful: The big cats are really just that - big cats, and relish playing in the garden with their owners . All grown up: The lions are now fully grown, and have formed their own mini-pride - but this comes with its ups and downs . Mr Basista rescued his first lion from a circus when it was seven months old, back in 2012. The cub, named Alex, was born with deformities including a deformed spine. At the time, Mr Basista was convinced that the lion cub would have died without his help. A short while later, lioness Mijanka, just four weeks old at the time, joined the family at their home in the Czech Republic. Purr-fect: The lions, such as Alex (pictured) are friendly and would never attack their owners, but they do sometimes accidentally scratch them . Huge: The lions have outgrown their earlier and more cub-like beginnings, but still remain just as playful and enjoy socialising with Mr Basista and his family . Dangerous: Sometimes the lions, during play-fighting, common among adult lions, cause their owners to suffer scratches or slight injuries . Mr Basista's daughter Sarka with lioness Mijanka. She explains that their relationship has changed since the lions' childhood from friend to sometime competitor . Mr Basista remembers Alex's road to recovery, and especially how his deformity could have possibly killed him. He said: 'Alex was very ill and suffered from a twisted spine when he first came here - he had to spend four months in hospital. 'But now he is in good condition and is thankfully okay. 'I think if he stayed in the circus he would have died because they would not have been able to care for him.' Earlier days: Mr Basista with one of the lions during their adolescence - they have since grown to their full weight and height . Tiny: One of the lions as a cub, playing with a pet parrot in the garden - the lions have grown up around their human owners and so are very social with them . When they were cubs, owning both Alex and Mijanka was like owning a pair of slightly larger housecats - but now they are fully grown, it is very different . Both lions are from different areas of the world - Alex (pictured) is a male Barbary lion weighs 250 kg . Alex is a male Barbary lion weighs 250 kg, and Mijanka, a female Somali lion, weighs 100 kg. Together . they eat more than 200 kg of meat a month, which could be made up from . 70 chickens, nearly an entire cow, or two whole pigs. Mr Basista said: 'They eat beef, chicken, pork and the wild animals from the nearby forest. 'Also for a treat I like to give them cream and ice cream which they absolutely love.' Together both Alex and Mijanka eat more than 200 kg of meat a month - the equivalent of almost an entire cow . Occasionally the lions will play fight together, and while sometimes Mr Basista will join in, he has to occasionally step back as the lions might get carried away . Mr Batista believes his raising on the lions is about preserving the species - which could be in danger of becoming endangered, for future generations . Mr Basista said: 'A lot of people don't agree with people keeping lions in private hands but I think it's important to protect the genetic code of these animals' While Mr Basista treats the lions like pets, he is very aware of the dangers of keeping big cats in the garden, and deals with them on a daily basis. Things like play fighting can lead to accidental wounds, because despite the fact that the lions are just playing, they often don't know their own strength in relation to their human owners. 'I'm not afraid of them but I must respect that the lions are big.' 'When we're playing together I must be attentive - but they never attack me - only little scratches that is all. Mr Basista first rescued lion Alex when he was a cub at only seven months old, from a circus. He claims that Alex would have likely died if it weren't for his and the hospital's care . Mijanka joined Alex in the mini-pride months after, and they formed a tiny family of eventually massive pets . 'My daughter could play with both lions when they were small but now that has changed. 'Because Mijanka now protects her pride like in the wild she fears my daughter - almost seeing her like an enemy - which is not good.' Mr Basista's daughter Sarka, who has been involved with the lions since she was young, and they were cubs, has had to adapt to how their dynamic and relationship has changed. She said: 'I think Mijanka remembers when she was small and we were friends. 'We could play together go to bed and sleep together. Moving from outside in the garden, to inside their house in the Czech Republic is a slightly different transition, considering they are fully grown lions . Alex the lion, now fully grown, can be seen with a proper mane around his neck, which denotes his maturity and dominance . Mr Basista claims that the people who criticize the lions have the wrong idea about lions, and think they're only killers . 'But now she's became a woman and she's jealous of me - everything has changed. 'Alex is like her husband now and I'm another woman - she's scared of that.' When they were little, Mr Basista's daughter would play with the lions and sleep in bed with the female one - but now she's older this has gotten harder as the female lion sees her as a threat . Despite the criticism he has experienced from friends and neighbours Mr Basista believes he is doing the right thing by keeping the lions in captivity. He said: 'Most people have the wrong idea about lions, they think they're only killers but that is not right. 'Lions are social, sensitive animals and they're great. 'A lot of people don't agree with people keeping lions in private hands but I think it's important to protect the genetic code of these animals. 'It's about preserving this type of lion for future generations. 'They're very important to me - I love them so much. 'They give me back love the love I give to them. It's great for me.' Mr Batista's is one of several stories featuring in new Animal Planet series Preposterous Pets which begins on Thursday April 3 at 8pm.","Ales Basista, 53, from Stupva in the Czech Republic has raised two lions .

"The World Match Play Championship reaches its 50th anniversary this week with a return to its spiritual London home, but with sponsor Volvo ready to pull the plug. There are five European Ryder Cup players in the 16-man field — plus the spiky American Patrick Reed — but none of the English trio who were part of the winning team at Gleneagles, nor world No 1 Rory McIlroy. So will it be an anniversary to celebrate or a time to fret over the event’s lost lustre? Jamie Donaldson with his partner Kathryn after the Europeans secure victory on the 15th at the Ryder Cup . One look at the list of the early winners of the event would cause an inclination towards the latter. Six of the first seven tournaments were won by the Big Three: Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. But always to compare the event to those glory days would surely be a failure to recognise that the game has moved on. McIlroy is acutely aware that his position carries the unwritten responsibility to help grow the game around the world. After playing two events in Britain this month already, he is currently competing in Bermuda and will be moving on to play in the Far East, the Middle East and Australia before the end of next month. He can’t be everywhere, can he? Jack Nicklaus of the US (left) shakes hands with South African golfer, Gary Player after Player had defeated him 6 and 4 in the final of the Piccadilly World Match Play Tournament in 1966 . ‘We promote tournaments all over the world and have long accepted it’s not realistic to think you’re going to get all the best players for every event,’ said Guy Kinnings, global head of golf at IMG. ‘What you’re after is enough to make sure you put on an event that will do justice to the history of the tournament and I think we’ll do that. We’re back in London, which is great given the event’s history. We’re also still all in feelgood mode after a wonderful Ryder Cup and we’ve got key players like Jamie Donaldson, Graeme McDowell, Victor Dubuisson, Henrik Stenson and Patrick Reed.’ Back in the days of Jack and Arnie, all matches were 36 holes at Wentworth. Now they’re played over 18 and there is a three-day group stage at London Golf Club in Kent to determine eight quarter-finalists on Saturday, with the semi-finals and final the following day. So let’s toast the World Match Play at 50. It might not be the event we remember growing up but there will certainly be enough on show to make it a celebration. It all starts at the London Club on Wednesday. ory McIlroy of Northern Ireland hits a shot during the pro-am, prior to the start of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf at Port Royal Golf Course in Bermuda . By the time the next Ryder Cup is played on European soil in Paris in 2018, the country supplying the most representatives could, believe it or not, be the host nation itself. Only three Frenchmen have ever played in the biennial contest, but there could be three on show at Paris National alone if a gifted trio in their early 20s continue their progress. Leading the way, of course, is 24-year-old Victor Dubuisson, and what an inspiration he is proving to his countrymen. Right behind him is 24-year-old Alexander Levy, who is in the World Match Play field this week and already a two-time winner on tour this year, and 23-year-old Romain Wattel, who has finished 11th or better in five of his past six starts. The timing of that first French Ryder Cup is beginning to look propitious. Victor Dubuisson of France plays plays his second shot to the second hole during the third round of the 2014 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship . Great White may never bite again . It’s good to hear Greg Norman is on his feet again and back doing the day job as CEO of his Great White Shark business empire following the horrific chainsaw accident last month that almost cost him the use of his hand. As for his old day job, alas, the 59-year-old Australian has cast doubt on whether he will ever be able to play golf again. ‘We just don’t know yet,’ he told American television last week. ‘I had my first swing in the gym the other day, not hitting a golf ball but just swinging a light weighted club and it definitely feels different. I have to build up a lot of the muscle that was torn away.’ This column broke the news earlier this year that a long-running dispute Norman has had with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club meant there was little chance of him making a farewell Open appearance — it’s his last year of eligibility — at St Andrews in 2015. Now, sadly, the possibility looks even more remote. Golfer Greg Norman of Australia attends a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington to announce the Captain's picks for the 2009 President's Cup tournament . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘It is a little disappointing to see the dirty laundry being out in public. I don’t like to see people’s great reputations being brought down by something that shouldn’t really happen in public. It should be done behind closed doors; the analysis should start there, not in the press.’ Week three of the Great American Ryder Cup Inquest and some wise words from Englishman Lee Westwood, as he points the finger in the direction of chief mutineer, Phil Mickelson, for his all-too-public condemnation of the US captain, five-time Open Champion Tom Watson.","Five European Ryder Cup players in the 16-man field for the tournament .

"America’s Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson admitted on Monday he was deeply concerned about Tiger Woods’s prospects of being fit for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September. ‘It concerns me because it is an injury that he’s tried to correct,’ said Watson. ‘This doesn’t bode well right now.’ Even if Woods somehow declared himself fit, the worry for Watson would be that his back might go again in Scotland, as it did at Firestone on Sunday when he had to withdraw after nine holes of his final round of the WGC Bridgestone Invitational. VIDEO Scroll down to watch World Golf Championship highlights . Troublesome back: Woods did not look fully fit at Firestone, and he cut his final round short after nine holes . Woods was seeing a battery of specialists near his home in Jupiter, Florida on Monday to evaluate the injury and what happens next. While he did that, his caddie Joey LaCava made his way to Valhalla and mapped out the course being used for the US PGA Championship this week, which certainly earned him full marks for blind optimism. Woods played the following week after withdrawing with a back spasm at the Honda Classic in February but was in such pain by the end he had difficulty standing over a putt. A fortnight later, he underwent an operation for a herniated disc that kept him out for four months. Difficult time: The 14-time Major winner's caddie Joey LaCava is scouting the US PGA Championship course . Stark contrast: Woods looks a shadow of the player that dominated golf a decade ago . VIDEO WGC-Bridgestone Invitational - Final Round highlights . Tiger Woods has 14 major championships to his name, but has not added to his tally for six years. Jack Nicklaus, whose record haul of 18 majors Woods is chasing, once went six years without winning one before his remarkable 1986 Masters victory, aged 46. Woods is still on course to match Nicklaus, though. Aged 38, he has the same number of majors as Nicklaus did at that age, with the latter winning his 15th before his 39th birthday. We await to see what his next move will be on this occasion but surely under consideration is to take the rest of the year off and try to get fully fit in time for a serious tilt at the majors next season. What was really noticeable during the nine full rounds he has played to date was just how badly he struck the ball. Woods put it down to ‘needing more tournament reps’ and the usual stock cliches he fobs reporters off with, but this is the man who used to take the winter off and win his first tournament back in California almost as a matter of routine. Even before Sunday, the after-effects of the injury were clearly still playing their part in preventing him doing what he needs to do behind the scenes to perform at even a fraction of his best, so what is the point in carrying on until he is healthy? Following on from the US PGA Championship is the four tournament FedEx Cup series and Woods has next to no chance of qualifying for that anyway. Only the top 125 make it to the tee for the first event and right now he is outside the top 200. Doubt: Tiger's agent has said he might play at the US PGA Championship at Valhalla this week . Even if by some act of fool-hardiness he made it to Valhalla he would need something like a top-three finish to make the FedEx and the chances of that happening are right up there with Southampton going a month without selling someone. Next up after that, following a week’s break, is the Ryder Cup. If somehow selected, there has been some talk that Woods would be prepared to play in the Wales Open the week before Gleneagles to get ready but that appears highly fanciful. The great fear right now, of course, is that he has suffered something more than a temporary spasm that might be within the healing powers of a good physio, and has a recurrence of the original injury. Woods has had four surgeries on his right knee but, as we know, backs are an altogether different matter. Changing of the guard: Rory McIlroy holds the Bridgestone Invitational trophy aloft after winning at Firestone . You cannot keep going under the knife for a bad back. What we can say for certain at this stage is that all those years of pushing his body beyond its natural limits, of training with army SEALs and the like, have wreaked a terrible vengeance. With the best will in the world, with all this physical scarring, can anyone see Tiger ever again reaching the heights Rory McIlroy has touched in the past month and that he used to reach himself so frequently? We surely have not seen the last of Tiger, by any means. But the best of him? Sadly, that might be the case.","Tiger Woods had to withdraw from the WGC Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday nine holes into his final round at Firestone .

"The Van Gaal/Mourinho love-in made me sick . Berahino oozes passion for England - Hodgson should give him a go . In a short space of time, Liverpool have gone from having one of the best strikers in their history scoring their goals, to having potentially one of the worst strikers in their history not scoring goals. What should the Reds do with Mario? After the Real Madrid game, the attention given to the half-time shirt swap masked another fairly lame and tame performance from Balotelli. It’s not the greatest crime, to swap shirts, but it was poor judgment from the Italian. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool fans have their say on Mario Balotelli . Mario Balotelli and Pepe swap shirts at half-time during Liverpool's 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid last week . Balotelli reacts after another missed opportunity against Hull City at the weekend . Forget that though, let’s just focus on the football. Brendan Rodgers listened to all the criticism from ex-Liverpool players and managers who said that Mario should be dropped, or that they believe he won’t be at the club next season. Rodgers then had no choice but to pick his marquee summer signing. Had he dropped him, it would have appeared that he was bowing down to the critics. Balotelli showed signs of life against Hull City, but it was far from what could be described as a special performance. So what should Rodgers do to get more from his man? Or better still, maybe we should ask what can Balotelli do to put things right? Brendan Rodgers took a gamble by buying Balotelli for £16million in the summer . His lack of pressing and his limited energy are all too noticeable. He is the very antithesis of dynamic. Rodgers could sit him down and show him what Luis Suarez did last season of course, but then that would simply make Balotelli realise just how inferior he is to the Uruguayan – it could leave his confidence permanently shot, and undermine the relationship between player and manager. Better still, show him what Alexis Sanchez is doing at Arsenal. I was at the Stadium of Light at the weekend and not for the first time this season he was the stand-out player on the pitch. Alexis Sanchez streaks clear of Wes Brown to score Arsenal's opening goal against Sunderland on Saturday . His quality is obvious – that’s why signing him was a no-brainer – we all watched the World Cup, we’d all seen him for Barcelona and for Udinese before that. What has impressed me more is that he doesn’t wait for things to happen, he makes them happen. He chases lost causes, he causes problems for defenders, his work-rate is astonishing. And so after almost half an hour on Saturday, Sanchez’s refusal to just stand off Wes Brown and let him control the ball in his own half, then pass the ball unchallenged was rewarded with a mistake from the experienced Sunderland defender, and a clear run on goal for the Arsenal man. He finished superbly. That’s the kind of pressing Balotelli needs to learn. Sanchez celebrates with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after scoring his first goal on Saturday . And Sanchez kept it up right through to injury time when he grabbed his second. And this is the one that Balotelli really needs to learn from. In the 92nd minute Sanchez surged towards the Sunderland box. His wayward pass gifted possession to Sunderland, but Sanchez didn’t give up, he chased, forced Vito Mannone into a dreadful error, and picked up a second goal as a result. Mario needs to be full of running for the whole match – just like Sanchez. Mario needs to respond better when things go wrong – chase the ball if a pass goes wrong, don’t turn away or throw your arms in the air. Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer . He needs to be dynamic – just like Sanchez is. The reality for Arsenal is that Sanchez has saved their season so far – he’s been brilliant, so credit to Arsene Wenger for making the signing happen. If Balotelli takes time out to sit down and watch what Arsenal’s new man is doing, he might work out how to make good things happen for him at Liverpool, and how to prove his critics wrong.","Mario Balotelli still not scored in the Premier League for Liverpool .

"Divine inspiration: Pastor Mbenga, at VPA's Manchester branch, claims mixing olive oil and blackcurrent squash can cure cancer, HIV and diabetes . Cancer and HIV patients have been told to buy bottles of ordinary blackcurrent squash and olive oil for £14 by a church claiming the blessed goods are a 'miracle cure' for their illnesses. The Victorious Pentecostal Assembly (VPA) sells the over-inflated goods with the claim that once blessed by a pastor they can cure a host of serious health conditions. Undercover reporters found members of the VPA congregation in Manchester were told that if a terminally-ill person drank a mixture of the specially blessed litre of squash and 500ml bottle of olive oil, which were being sold at double their real value, their ailments would disappear. A church leader who identified himself as Pastor Mbenga also claimed to have previously cured diabetes and a brain tumour using the concoction. He said the mixture would 'do what no man can do' through divine intervention and guaranteed the cancer would be cured. 'God will take over with divine intervention and the cancer will disappear,' Pastor Mbenga told the reporters from Manchester Evening News. The church’s . founder, Pastor Alex Omokudu, who lives in a £1.8million mansion in Hornchurch, Essex, has also regularly appeared in television adverts claiming, 'doctors do not have the answer - we have got . the answer. We have got the answer to healing'. The products sell in several supermarkets for less than £6. Now a cancer charity has warned the practice is deliberately targeting the vulnerable and could stop patients from seeking proper medical treatment. Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK said people should be wary of 'miracle cures' and consult the advice of professionals. He said: 'It is shocking that anyone could exploit people with cancer in this way. 'We would encourage anyone affected by cancer to be cautious of any alternative therapies, especially those that claim to be ""miracle cures"". 'If a therapist encourages them to use an alternative treatment instead of conventional medicine prescribed by a qualified doctor, we would also advise caution.' Dr Michelle Harvie, research dietician at the Genesis Cancer Prevention Centre at University Hospital South Manchester Trust, urged patients to always seek the advice of medical professionals. She said: 'When people are suffering from cancer they are often desperate and will seek out alternative or a miraculous cure when it is often the more mundane treatments will do them the most good. 'The problem is none of this is based on any real evidence, but sufferers are often being told what they want to hear rather than what is medical fact. 'The sad fact is when someone is suffering from cancer they can often be at their most vulnerable and they want to do something to take control, but it is really important they adhere to treatments planned by their doctors and lead a healthy lifestyle.' Drink this: The Victorious Pentecostal Assembly claims the mixture of these ordinary supermarket goods, sold at double their real value, is a 'miracle cure' The church opened in Manchester last year and is the first northern base of the VPA, which has three other churches in Hackney, Luton and Barking. The organisation has previously been fined by Ofcom for making similar claims on its television channel. Believe TV, which is available on Sky and via the internet, has twice been blasted by the regulator for running promotional campaigns with testimonies from people claiming to have been cured of HIV, cancer and infertility. The church may also be breaking the law, as any advertisement, including verbal . claims, promoting products as treatments or cures for cancer is illegal . under the Cancer Act 1939. Trading standards officers have also been told about the practice and promised to look over the case. Pastor Mbenga however said he was not aware the church was breaking the law. He said: 'It is the word of God, it is in the scriptures that God can heal these illnesses and that is the message we are passing on to people. 'I wasn’t aware of that law, but we live in a free society and if this is what people believe then people should be free to believe in it and carry out their faith. 'We have seen divine intervention in the past where people have been healed of terrible diseases and believe that God has the supernatural power to bring about miracles. 'This is what we believe and we are just trying to help people, trying to help them live a better life by giving them the power through God to make changes in their lives. We are not hurting anyone.' Cure all: Leaders at the Victorious Pentecostal Assembly in Manchester claim the blessed mixture can 'do what no man can do' and guarantees people will be restored to good health . Growing membership: The church opened in Manchester last year and is the first northern base of the VPA, which has three other churches in Hackney, Luton and Barking . Victorious Pentecostal Assembly leaders have previously landed in trouble over claims of curing serious illnesses. The church, based in Barking, Essex, was founded in 2004 by Pastor Alex Omokudu. His . wife Patricia is a listed director of The Light Academy which runs . religious channel Believe TV from the same address. The channel has . twice been blasted by TV regulator Ofcom for making claims which . ‘exploited’ vulnerable viewers. The . channel was first rapped in August 2011 after a broadcast featuring . Pastor Omokudu in which people claimed they had been cured of serious illnesses by the church. One . woman said she had collapsed with 'a tumour in my head'. A relative added that she had thrown away her cancer medication . and purchased ""blackcurrant and oil"" from the church. When she then went to hospital for a scan, she claims there was 'no longer a problem'. Another man told the audience he was given two years to live with a brain tumour. The . man said he had come to VPA and had been cured with 'olive oil' - to . which Pastor Omokudu responded: 'We have got the answer to healing.' The . report concluded 'there was a material risk that susceptible members of . the audience may be exploited by the material broadcast on Believe TV'. In February this year the channel was fined £25,000 by the regulator for another broadcast featuring Pastor Omokudu.","Victorious Pentecostal Assembly leaders promise the over-inflated goods, which have been blessed, can cure serious health conditions .

"The U.S. government has accidentally named the top spy in Afghanistan on a memo given to reporters accompanying President Barack Obama on a surprise visit to Kabul. The memorandum included an individual named as ‘Chief of Station’ - the title given to the top CIA officer in a given country. It was immediately retracted, and a new memo was issued. The security breach was first reported late yesterday evening by the Washington Post, which declined to name the officer publicly for fear of putting him or his family at risk. Error: Journalists accompanying President Barack Obama on a surprise visit to Kabul yesterday (pictured) recieved a memo accidentally identfying the top U.S. spy in Afghanistan . U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan James B. Cunningham and 14 others were also named on the memo, including several senior military officials, according to the Post. They were all identified as having being included in a meeting with President Obama at Bagram Air Force Base, just outside Afghanistan's capital city Kabul. Reporters joining the president on the trip received the message via email, and it was then passed along to other news organizations as part of the ‘pool report,’ according to the paper. A pool report is a summary of events collected by primary reporters and then passed to other news organizations not in attendance for use at their discretion. More than 6,000 recipients received the pool report assembled by the Post’s White House bureau chief, the paper admitted. Promise: On his surprise visit to Afghanistan yesterday (pictured) - his fourth time in the country -  Obama pledged to bring America's longest war to a 'responsible end' by the close of the year . This is only the second time in recent memory a CIA officer’s cover was blown by the very government he or she is working to protect. Valerie Plame was infamously exposed by officials from President George W. Bush’s administration as they worked to discredit her ambassador husband while he railed against the government over the second Iraq war. It is not clear if the top spy in Afghanistan will be forced to return to the U.S. similar to how multiple CIA agents in Pakistan fled the country after their names were exposed.

On his surprise visit to Afghanistan yesterday, President Barack Obama pledged to bring America’s longest war to a 'responsible end' by the close of the year. He told troops at this sprawling military base that the war had reached a pivotal point, with Afghan forces assuming primary responsibility for their country’s security. While many of the 32,800 U.S. forces now in Afghanistan will leave in the coming months, Obama said a continued military presence could help protect gains made during nearly 13 years of fighting. Obama's visit, his fourth to Afghanistan as president, came at a time of transition for a country long mired in conflict. Most of the U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan are withdrawing ahead of year-end deadline. Elections are also underway to replace Hamid Karzai - the only president Afghanistan has known since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.","Kabul 'Chief of Station' was named on a memo to members of the media .

"It took a trip to the capital of excess to help an overweight party girl realise it was time to change her ways. After gaining a stone in just a week while on holiday in Las Vegas, Jazz Odeyingbo, 22, from Chelmsford, Essex, knew she had to take control of her weight problem. Jazz had already put on two stone in the months before her trip to the casino city, so by the time she flew home, she was 16 stone and a dress size 16. Scroll down for video . Reformed: Jazz Odeyingbo is now a size 12, left, after overhauling her unhealthy lifestyle. She rose to 16st and a size 16, right, by binging on McDonalds and boozing . Living to excess: Jazz, far left, realised she had a problem with her weight after a trip to Las Vegas where she gained a stone in a week . Jazz, who works for her step-father, David King's, furniture company, said she didn't go on a bikini diet before her holiday. 'There is a 24-hour McDonalds next to my flat and sometimes I would go there for breakfast, lunch and dinner,' she said. Then while in Vegas, she enjoyed the large portions, all-you-can-eat buffets and indulgent cocktails to the full without worrying about her waistline. She explained: 'It was a crazy holiday where I would start the day with ice cream for breakfast, followed by pancakes with maple syrup. 'For lunch and dinner I would just binge on the hotel buffet - going back for lots more helpings. 'It was boiling hot so I'd be drinking highly sugared Fanta all day and then going boozing and clubbing at night. Beat the bulge: Jazz booked into a boot camp to help her lose weight . No pain, no gain: The 22-year-old found the exercise difficult at first but soon began to enjoy it and lose weight . 'I worked out that I had put on 2lbs for each day of the holiday and a whopping stone for the whole week.' On her return, Jazz's boyfriend, Nile Morson, 24, didn't put any pressure on her to get in shape but Jazz's weight gain made her feel less confident. 'I love going clubbing and enjoy getting a little attention for my looks and suddenly I wasn't getting any at all,' she said. 'It was because I was a size 16 and fat.' Jazz decided to beat the bulge head on by signing up for an extreme military-style boot camp popular with reality TV stars including The Only Way Is Essex's Gemma Collins and James 'Arg' Argent and Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews. Hard work: Jazz put her all into the boot camp activities and lost three stone in six weeks . Zip back: Now Jazz is feeling full of confidence . The celebrities have boasted of losing a stone in a week following the strict regimes laid down by their ex-special forces trainers at the No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk. But the Boot Camp didn't come cheap and  Jazz had to ask her step-father if he could give her time off work and pay £4,000 for her to have a four-week stay. She said: 'I was so shy and nervous. I could hardly speak to any of the other bootcampers because I was so anxious,' she said of her arrival. 'On my second day of exercising I couldn't walk back from the beach as my legs were so sore, so they had to pick me up in the car while I was crying my eyes out. 'I could hardly walk on the hikes in the afternoons and was always struggling along at the back.' But she said the pounds started to come off giving her cause to carry on. 'When I had my first week's weigh-in and I had lost 13lbs! 'That was all the incentive I needed and I started pushing harder and harder,' she said. Then by the end of her four-week booking, she wasn't ready to leave so extended her stay. 'As I approached my fourth week, I knew that I was not ready to leave, so I booked another two weeks,' she explained. Working hard wasn't a problem for Jazz who put all her efforts into the workouts including long hikes and tough obstacle courses. After six weeks, she had lost three stone and two dress sizes meaning she's now a size 12. 'I lost three stone - all the weight and that extra flab I had put on in Vegas, she said. 'But more importantly I have totally turned life around.' While the price tag might seem hefty Jazz says it was worth every penny for her. 'I paid 4,000 because I wanted a single room on my own for such a long stay. 'I could have done it more cheaply if I had shared. I was lucky that my step father helped me with the cost. 'It was money very well spent. You get full on fitness training throughout the week starting with the dreaded 7am wake-up call and ending with the equally dreaded ice bath which aids muscle recovery. 'What the trainers are trying to do is not just to achieve weight loss but promote overall lifestyle change. So you learn about nutrition and where you have been going wrong previously in your eating habits. They create exercise programmes suitable to you - they deal with a wide variety of clients, from heavily overweight people working out for the first time to fitness fanatics who are really honing their bodies. 'I was starting from scratch and really needed to learn how to exercise effectively and how to fuel my body in a healthy way which would promote weight.'I live a completely different life now following my experience at No 1 Boot Camp. I have ditched so many of my bad habits and the healthier options I am choosing now seem much more natural.' Now Jazz eats more healthily and exercises regularly and is so confident in her new body that she is launching a new online fashion business, Hanging Pretty. She said: 'When I was overweight I was depressed and had no confidence. Now I have got all my old zip back. I cannot wait to launch the new business and start a whole new chapter in my life.'

"What do you do with Steven Gerrard? It is a debate that has been raging for most of the season and shows no sign of ending. Steven is no stranger to being a hot topic of conversation but, in all the years I've known him, I am struggling to remember a time when he has been scrutinised to this extent. Some critics believe he should be out of the picture. Others couldn't be without him. Where do I stand? Well, put it this way, if Liverpool were playing in a major final now, Steven would be one of the first names I'd put down on the teamsheet. My reasons would have nothing do with sentiment. Steven Gerrard is having a difficult season and here he trudges off after the home defeat by Chelsea . The Gerrard front cover of Liverpool's programme for Saturday's match against Stoke . Gerrard with Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson on the bench at the Bernabeu and (right) after losing against Real Madrid in the Champions League at Anfield . If Liverpool had a penalty or a free-kick in a dangerous area, Steven is the only person I'd want taking it. He's proven that against Ludogorets and Everton this season. He is also the man I'd pick to play a killer pass and the one I'd back over anyone else if he was racing through on goal. The issue, however, is that at 34, he doesn't get into those positions as regularly as he once did. Furthermore, the dynamic of the deep-lying role he occupied last season has changed as Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have not been around to provide outlets. After his outstanding efforts last year, he has yet to reach the same levels – who has in a red shirt? Steven is not a great protector of a defence. He's there to start attacks from deep rather than shield a defence as Dietmar Hamann or Javier Mascharano did for me. Now, though, his age is being tied in with his form. I know what it is like to reach such a stage. I remember playing in a game against Arsenal in March 2012, when Robin van Persie scored a winning goal in the last minute at Anfield, and dealing with critics saying I was finished. The Liverpool captain poses for Sportsmail during an exclusive interview earlier in the season . One of the high points of Gerrard's season as he scores a late penalty to beat Ludogorets at Anfield . A week later at Sunderland, Kenny Dalglish took me out of the team. We lost again, this time 1-0, but my replacement, Sebastian Coates, struggled and I was recalled for the next game, against Everton. Steven scored a hat-trick as we won 3-0. It was after the Everton game I realised it was best that I'd been taken out of the firing line at Sunderland. There is a saying in football, 'You have your best games when you don't play' and that was the case at The Stadium of Light. Your situation changes and people want you in the team. I found that again last year, when people were saying to me Liverpool would have won the league had I stayed. Who knows whether they were right? I knew when the end was coming. I had 18 months left on my contract and I knew I wouldn't sign another. Like Steven, I was mentally tough. But when you hear constant references to your age after a poor performance or a mistake, it becomes draining. The high point of Gerrard's Liverpool career, lifting the European Cup in Istanbul in 2005 . Gerrard heads Liverpool's first goal against Milan that night, which sparked a remarkable comeback . A swing of Gerrard's famous right boot rescues Liverpool in the 2006 FA Cup final, which they went on to win . Gerrard and Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez hold the FA Cup after victory over West Ham on penalties . You go into games wondering, 'Am I going to be physically able to get through this?'. In your head, you have no worries about reading and understanding the game but when your legs go, they do not come back. Brendan Rodgers and his medical staff have done a superb job managing Steven's fitness. Now they must manage the amount of matches he plays – Brendan, himself, admitted in midweek that Steven can't play three games in a week to the level he would like. Steven will have had similar thoughts. Over the next 18 months, Brendan will have to start to take him off and leave him out for his own good. People have questioned whether the manager has the resolve to do so but history shows he makes big calls. Andy Carroll, Luis Suarez, Pepe Reina and I will testify to that. But that isn't a bad thing for Steven. Can you imagine the reaction inside Anfield with 30 minutes of a tight game remaining and seeing No 8 getting stripped for action? With space to exploit and energy to change the game, he could be a lethal weapon. Another Gerrard rescue job - this time the goal against Olympiacos which got then through in 2004 . Gerrard and Jamie Carragher with the European Cup in 2005 (left) and exchanging the armband in 2013 . Sir Alex Ferguson did it brilliantly with Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, letting them miss the odd week, giving them 20 minutes from the bench and ensuring they were fresh for when he really needed them. That's what has to happen with Steven, who I am sure will sign a new deal. Pako Ayestaran, Rafa Benitez's former assistant, summed it up perfectly once when talking to us about squad rotation. He said it wasn't important how many games you played in; what was crucial was the amount of good games you played. Do not doubt Steven's ability to go on making contributions, but do not underestimate that he needs help. Take what is happening with Frank Lampard at Manchester City. He is surrounded by top players, is being used sensibly and his reputation continues to be enhanced. Rio Ferdinand, by contrast, can't get a game for QPR. Who would have ever said that a player of Rio's quality would see his time out on the bench at Loftus Road? You need assistance when you reach that stage and Rio isn't getting it. A very young-looking Gerrard (right) and Carragher (left) in action against Newcastle in 1998 . The Liverpool lads show their determination to win the ball from Manchester City's Kevin Horlock in 2000 . Gerrard and Carragher with the Carling Cup after beating Cardiff on penalties in 2012 . Carragher passes the armband to Gerrard during a Europa League match against Young Boys in 2012 . Steven's situation is somewhere in the middle of Frank and Rio. Liverpool need to sign a top defensive midfielder in the near future and it should not be that, on the 16th anniversary of his first appearance, he is still being looked to provide the inspiration. When the end finally came for me, against QPR in May 2013, it was a relief. I also had the added bonus that I had been playing well and was able to finish on my own terms. For his immense contribution, Steven deserves more. He might not do what the other members of Liverpool's top three all-time players did in their final appearances – Kenny Dalglish lifted the league, Graeme Souness hoisted the European Cup – but his journey has to end on a high. It is a huge blow for Jack Wilshere to face another prolonged spell on the sidelines and Arsene Wenger will be cursing losing a top player for three months. Wilshere was England’s outstanding performer in their last two matches, albeit against inferior opposition in Slovenia and Scotland, and won praise for the way he handled the holding midfield role. Jack Wilshere showed off his bandaged ankle as he recovered from Thursday's surgical procedure . He picked up this latest ankle injury by running through a packed midfield and, not for the first time, it is his ankle that is the problematic area. I fear this will not be the last time he suffers such an injury if he keeps playing an advanced role. Every game I see him play, he seems to go down at some point after taking a buffeting. It is clearly having a detrimental impact. The image Wilshere shared on his personal Instagram account showing Paddy McNair's challenge . Wenger stated publicly after his performances for his country that playing in the holding role wasn’t Wilshere’s best position but the question that now has to be asked is this: will being deployed in a holding role prevent these long lay-offs? I believe it will. Wilshere could be back in training by February, but it will take some time to get back to full fitness . This week I’m looking forward to… watching Southampton face their biggest test . Ronald Koeman's side have been given plenty of praise this season, attracting lots of admirers for the results they have secured, the signings they have made and the way they have played. They are second in the table, boasting the best goals-against column in the country, and people are wondering whether they should really be taking them seriously as contenders to finish the campaign in a top-four position. Ronald Koeman's Southampton side are looking to move further clear of Manchester City this weekend . Sergio Aguero will look to continue his rich scoring form for Manchester City against Southampton . Now we are going to find out. After hosting Manchester City on Sunday, a trip to Arsenal — who they knocked out of the League Cup — beckons before Manchester United head to the South Coast on Monday week. If they come through this period unscathed, their claims will be taken more seriously and I hope they do. Southampton have been the story of the season and it is remarkable they are up there after losing so many players and changing their manager. I just wonder, however, whether the depth of their squad will count against them. More will become apparent in the next 10 days.

Think about it: United have exactly the same points (37) from the same number of games (21); they have scored one goal fewer in the Barclays Premier League than the 35 Moyes’s side had managed, even after spending more than £150million last summer. But it goes deeper than statistics. Both the Manchester United fans and players believe in Louis van Gaal thanks to his pedigree in the game . Moyes was preparing for a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sunderland and had the Champions League last 16 on his horizon; Van Gaal has had no Europe and overseen one of the most embarrassing defeats in United history. Yet the 4-0 drubbing they suffered at the hands of MK Dons in August was quickly forgotten and when United failed to have a shot on target against Southampton last weekend, again there was no major inquest. Watching how that contest unfolded, I couldn’t help thinking back to a similar match under Moyes, particularly when Van Gaal put Marouane Fellaini up front and started playing long but took off the players who would provide the best crosses — Luke Shaw and Angel di Maria. The game in question was against Fulham. United drew 2-2 and Moyes argued afterwards that his side were unlucky because they had put in 81 crosses. No United fans had sympathy with him, nor did his players. Rio Ferdinand, for one, was openly critical about that approach in his book. That wouldn’t happen now and there is a reason — just as there is a reason why Van Gaal is not having his performance — or the performances of his team — scrutinised to the level that Moyes experienced 12 months ago. It comes down to one word: belief. United's players, including Wayne Rooney, arrive at Stockport station to get the train south to face QPR . Van Gaal and assistant Ryan Giggs start the trip to London ahead of the clash at Loftus Road . United were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup - yet Van Gaal escaped major inquest . Van Gaal looked shocked as his star-studded United team went down 4-0 to the League One outfit . Darren Bent scored a last-minute equiliser for Fulham at Old Trafford last season after United dominated . David Moyes had the weight of the world on his shoulders when Fulham pulled off a draw at Old Trafford . Van Gaal strode into Old Trafford after leading Holland to third place in the World Cup, exuding authority, certainty and, above all, with a c.v. that included league titles in Germany, Spain and his home country, not to mention a Champions League trophy. Do not underestimate what that is worth to players and supporters. I remember an incident not long after Gerard Houllier had become sole manager of Liverpool. It was January 1999 and we had been drawn against United in the FA Cup but had not won at Old Trafford since 1990. Michael Owen put us ahead early on and we were within minutes of seeing out the tie but were hit with two sucker punches in the last few minutes. The dressing room afterwards was like a morgue. The goals had left us feeling hollow but then we heard Houllier speaking on television. Ole Gunner Solskjaer scores a late winner to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup in the Treble-winning 1999 season . Gerard Houllier (centre) said he knew Liverpool would win at Old Trafford one day following the defeat in 1999 . ‘You know what,’ he said. ‘We have lost but, I guarantee, we will win here one day.’ Suddenly you start thinking to yourself, ‘he really believes this’. Houllier had been part of France’s technical committee when they won the World Cup six months earlier. His words, then, carried extra significance and they clearly worked. We lost only one of our next six trips, winning three. Something similar happened with Rafa Benitez. Before the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2005, his message could not have been more emphatic. ‘We will win,’ he told us. There was no wavering. He arrived with two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup, so we did not doubt him. But it should not be forgotten that both Houllier and Benitez had some awful results in their first seasons — Houllier was dumped out of Europe by Celta Vigo, Benitez was beaten in the FA Cup by Burnley — yet, like Van Gaal, they were never subjected to an intense focus. Rafa Benitez was convinced that Liverpool would beat Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-final . Benitez's belief was proved to be correct as Liverpool did win to progress into the Champions League final . There is an underlying problem for British managers there. I wrote last season how we needed Moyes to succeed at United, for Brendan Rodgers to flourish with Liverpool and for Roy Hodgson to do well with England to show that our coaches could compete at the top level. That is where the swagger Van Gaal possesses comes from; that is why he can speak as he did  in a press conference and be so blunt about Radamel Falcao. What reaction would there have been to Moyes saying one of the best strikers in the world has to prove himself? I love watching Van Gaal in front of the cameras every week; I love how he can be so dismissive if he doesn’t like a question and find his reactions very funny. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Angel di Maria show their dejection after conceding to Southampton . Southampton players celebrate their first win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in 27 years . Robin van Persie  argues with Victor Wanyama during United's defeat by Southampton . Van Gaal is known as a winner and that helps him even when his side are under-performing . Just like Sir Alex Ferguson, there is meaning to every word he puts out each Friday afternoon. People tipped United to win the title at the start of the season purely because of Van Gaal and I’m convinced that, had they beaten Southampton, he would have started talking up their credentials, especially with Manchester City dropping points at Everton. A victory would have left them nine points behind Chelsea but many players in the dressing room, along with countless supporters, would have believed him. Why? He is Van Gaal and has the record to back it up, particularly in big games. Manchester United celebrate their last Premier League victory - over Newcastle on Boxing Day . Having a name for winning is priceless. Things clearly aren’t working as well as Van Gaal would want. As the injuries that United have suffered shows, there have been issues with regard to his training methods and his adapting to the Premier League. He has also been lucky that Liverpool and Arsenal, who disappeared over the horizon when Moyes struggled, have not been more of a threat. This year, he has capitalised, beating both clubs, as well as drawing with Chelsea. Clearly he has had some fortune but not with his reputation. And that is why, no matter how underwhelming United have been, they will believe at Old Trafford Van Gaal has them heading back to the Champions League. Stones had a let-off but all bosses hate taking risks . John Stones got off lightly during Everton’s FA Cup replay against West Ham on Tuesday. The young England defender took on three players on the edge of his own penalty area and nearly cost his side a goal. I expressed that view on Twitter and the reaction I got was colourful, to say the least, but the main responses were that ‘you would have hoofed it!’, I was ‘a typical English dinosaur’ and, my favourite, that I was nothing but ‘a yard dog’. John Stones was criticised by Jamie Carragher on Twitter for taking on three players on the edge of his box . That last term never fails to bring a smile to my face. My Dad used it to refer to the old Coventry defender Brian Kilcline or Manchester United’s Graeme Hogg when I was a kid. Those two did not mess around! On a serious note, we have an idea that foreign coaches encourage this type of game, dribbling the ball out from the back. It is nonsense. Jose Mourinho bombed out David Luiz for taking chances at the back. Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez would have been furious if I, or anyone else, had tried that. Brian Kilcline (left) and Graeme Hogg (right) were two defenders who did not mess about . It was the same with England. Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello would not have stood for that. Another thing all those coaches do is select a target man for their teams — whether it be Emile Heskey, Peter Crouch, Didier Drogba or Diego Costa. Isn’t that typically British? We all want technically gifted players, for them to be brave, to show and receive the ball. John Stones does that really well but no manager in world football wants a defender who dribbles in his own box — whether they are from Barnsley or Brazil. This week I’m looking forward to seeing if the old Fernando Torres is back... The Madrid derby again made for compelling viewing on Thursday and the story of Torres scoring twice could not have been more romantic for Atletico fans. Is Diego Simeone the man to coax Torres back to the form he showed when he played for Liverpool? Certainly there were flashes of his best in the Bernabeu, not least in the emphatic finish for Atletico’s opener. Fernando Torres scored twice for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey . I started thinking about how he celebrated in front of the Real Madrid supporters when we beat them 4-0 at Anfield in the Champions League back in 2009. Torres was at his peak then and it has been a sad football story to see how things have gone for him since. Torres celebrated in front of the Madrid fans when he tormented them in a 4-0 win for Liverpool in 2009 . Now he is back at his first club, it could be that his career is going to finish on a high. There is a lot for Atletico to play for this season — La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey — and if Simeone can get Torres back to somewhere near his most clinical, they will have an excellent striker.","Louis van Gaal's record is very similar to that of David Moyes last season .

"Bacon-flavoured toothpaste and bacon doughnuts are testament to how much people love the cured meat. And now there’s a bacon-powered motorbike that belches out meaty fumes. The motorbike will feature in a documentary called Driven by Bacon about a man embarking on a road trip across the U.S. He will meet other bacon-lovers on his way from Austin, Texas to San Diego, California. A motorbike that runs on bacon grease will feature in a documentary called Driven by Bacon about a man travelling across the U.S. meeting other bacon-lovers on his way from Austin, Texas to San Diego, California . Minnesota-based meat company, Hormel Foods, collaborated with a biodiesel firm to make fuel for the bike from bacon grease. ‘We actually had the grease from our Rochelle, Illinois, plant so it is all 100 percent Black Label,’ Hornal’s brand manager Nick Schweitzer told local TV station Kaal. The bike can travel between 75 and 100 miles (121-161km) on one gallon of bacon grease, which works out at approximately $3.50 (£2.10). The fumes from the bike are said to smell of frying bacon, according to Modernfarmer.com. Scott Schraufnagel, from the advertising agency behind the trip, said that because the bike runs on B-100 bio diesel, there are ‘no hazardous waste materials’. Around one gallon of fuel is generated from one pound of bacon grease. A Minnesota-based meat company, Hormel Foods, collaborated with a biodiesel firm to make fuel from bacon grease (pictured in a stock image) Scott Schraufnagel, from the advertising agency behind the trip, said that because the motorbike (pictured) runs on B-100 bio diesel, there are ‘no hazardous waste materials’ Demand for left-over grease from chips and meat is on the rise as more people try to make their own money-saving biofuel. This had led to an increasingly number of grease thieves, Oilprice.com reported. In 2011, the U.S. National Renderers Association estimated that six million pounds of grease was stolen and was fetching between $300 and $900 per tonne. One politicians in North Carolina proposed that it should be made a felony to steal more than $1,000 worth of grease and suggested that people should have to have a license to sell it. The team told The Washington Times: ‘If there were a bacon biodiesel tanker spill in the ocean, the fuel would be safe and mouth-watering fish food. ‘This bacon biodiesel is nearly carbon-neutral, meaning it contributes almost zero emissions to global warming.’ Bacon is not the only food grease being used to power vehicles. McDonalds has used chip fat to power a fleet of vehicles in the UK. At the time of announcing its move in 2007, the fast food chain said it would save more than 1,650 tonnes of carbon every year - the equivalent of taking 2,424 family cars off the roads for 12 months. But less appealing fats have also been used to make fuel, including surplus lipids from liposuction patients - a practice which is banned in California and elsewhere. The bacon road trip team hopes to find people who are ‘excessively passionate’ about something - especially bacon - on their travels. The motorbike is set to arrive in San Diego in time for the city’s annual bacon festival, where the documentary will be shown at the end of the month. It is expected to be displayed at the Spam Museum in Minnesota later in the year.","Minnesota-based Hormel Foods, collaborated with a biodiesel firm to make fuel from bacon grease - and fumes smell of bacon .

"A baby boy died from meningitis after hospital doctors twice failed to spot the symptoms and dismissed his mother’s fears as ‘hysterical’. As the little boy screamed in pain in a waiting room, one nurse even suggested his parents wheel him around in a buggy because he was ‘a bit loud’. Hours later, 13-month-old Bobby Bushell was dead. The appalling standard of care he received was laid bare yesterday after his parents won a five-figure sum in damages from the hospital trust. Shocking failures: As 13-month-old Bobby Bushell (pictured with his mother in 2007) screamed in pain in a waiting room, one nurse even suggested his parents wheel him around in a buggy as he was 'a bit loud' Last night Bobby’s mother, Jane Hooks, said hospital doctors had ‘arrogantly’ dismissed her concerns he was suffering from meningitis. ‘The treatment by staff at the hospital was nothing short of disgraceful and the doctors arrogantly waved away my fears my little boy was suffering from meningitis – not once, but twice,’ she said. ‘Their attitude cost my son his life. If they had listened to a mother’s instinct instead of lazily dismissing me as hysterical then Bobby would be alive today.’ Miss Hooks said that as her son’s condition deteriorated and his screams became desperate, a nurse told her to wheel him around. ‘She came to me in the side room of the children’s ward with a sit-up buggy and said: “Can you wheel him round a bit? He’s a bit loud”. 'I was so shocked but told her he was so ill he couldn’t sit up or even hold his head up. It was such a dreadful thing to say. Just hours later Bobby died.’ Distraught: Bobby's mother Jane Hooks (pictured this week with her partner Craig Bushell) said hospital doctors in Doncaster 'arrogantly' dismissed her concerns that her son was suffering from meningitis . The tragedy unfolded on August 12, 2007 when Bobby became ill at home near Doncaster. His mother contacted an NHS out-of-hours service and took him to a local surgery where her own GP examined him at around 4.40pm. 'In desperation I grabbed a female doctor by the arm. She said: ""Your son is very, very ill""' Jane Hooks, Bobby Bushell's mother . Although he did not diagnose meningitis, the GP advised Miss Hooks and her partner Craig Bushell to take Bobby to Doncaster Royal Infirmary. They arrived at around 5.20pm and he was seen by a senior house doctor. Despite the little boy having three non-blanching rashes on his leg and chest – a classic meningitis symptom – the doctor decided only to monitor his condition. Miss Hooks, 29, a former retail worker, said: ‘He said he had a viral infection. I immediately asked for a second opinion. He told me a second doctor would only agree with him.’ Failings: The tragedy unfolded when Bobby (pictured left and right in 2006) became ill at home near Doncaster . Tragic: Bobby is pictured (left) at Christmas in 2006 and (right) with a cake on his first birthday on July 14, 2007 . Miss Hooks said a second doctor, a registrar, saw Bobby at around 6.45pm and despite the rash spreading on four different areas, also failed to diagnose meningitis. 'The treatment by staff at the hospital was nothing short of disgraceful and the doctors arrogantly waved away my fears my little boy was suffering from meningitis – not once, but twice' Jane Hooks, Bobby Bushell's mother . She said: ‘He was arrogant and dismissive. He refused to carry out a lumbar puncture which would have diagnosed meningitis.’ It took four more hours before Miss Hooks could persuade another doctor to help. ‘In desperation I grabbed a female doctor by the arm. She said: “Your son is very, very ill”.’ Bobby was then given intravenous antibiotics but it wasn’t until around 3am that a consultant finally examined him. Moves began to transfer him to Sheffield Children’s Hospital but it was too late and he died at 6.50am on August 13. Baby: Bobby is seen (left) in September 2006 and (right) with Mr Bushell on an Isle of Wight holiday in June 2007 . After birth: Miss Hooks and Mr Bushell are pictured at Royal Doncaster Hospital in July 2006 with their newborn son Bobby. The 13-month-old boy died at 6.50am on August 13, 2007 . The family sued the Trust but it refused to admit liability and fought the claim all the way to the courts. 'Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust denied liability and made his parents endure a five-year struggle to achieve justice for their little boy' Helen Budge, from law firm Pannone . Last month a judge dismissed the hospital’s defence and found in favour of the family at Sheffield County Court. They received a five-figure payout. Helen Budge from Manchester law firm Pannone said: ‘Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust denied liability and made his parents endure a five-year struggle to achieve justice for their little boy. It is to be hoped that the Trust has learnt lessons from this tragic episode.’ Sewa Singh, medical director at the Trust, said: ‘We offer our deepest sympathies and apologies to Miss Hooks, Mr Bushell and their families for any shortcomings in the care provided to Bobby.’","Bobby Bushell screamed in pain in Doncaster Royal Infirmary waiting room .

"Having criticised Arsenal’s players for taking a picture of themselves at Manchester City, I’m supposed to have been left ‘red-faced’ by an image that emerged this week. It is of me, in a towel, standing alongside Daniel Sturridge and Pedro Philippou, one of Liverpool’s physiotherapists. It was taken in May 2013 at Fulham, after my last away game, and Daniel had scored his first hat-trick for Liverpool. Daniel was over the moon and he wanted his picture taken with a Liverpool legend!

To try to say I am embarrassed now is utter nonsense — the same words I would use to express my distaste for this new fad. Seriously, this trend has got to stop. Arsenal did it last week but it goes on at plenty of other clubs, too. I’m all for players enjoying a win but shouldn’t the picture taking be saved for the games that matter, such as cup finals, when you can come away with proper memories? ‘Selfies’ shouldn’t be taken after you get three points: that, remember, is the job footballers are paid to do.","The trend of players taking 'selfies' has got to stop .

"I remember sitting in our annual captains’ conference at Lord’s each year with the likes of Steve Waugh, Stephen Fleming and Brian Lara, and almost to a man we would say that the sport needed to be careful about the amount of cricket we were playing. The International Cricket Council would blame the national boards for scheduling too many matches, and then the boards would blame the ICC for setting up the Future Tours Programme. The diaries were brimming with games. And it’s only got worse since I retired. It’s no great surprise to me that England are playing 17 Tests in nine months from April 2015 to January 2016. Equally, we shouldn’t be surprised if the players themselves are too exhausted to complete the course. Burn out? Stuart Broad (R) is being forced to endure a Test against India with a suspect knee . Barmy army! England fans paying £85 a ticket will be disappointed if stars are rested . Physically, it’s the fast bowlers who suffer. Look at Stuart Broad right now, hobbling through a series against India with a dodgy knee. It’s just not practical to ask these blokes to bowl consistently at 90mph — yet that’s what crowds want to see. The sight of Mitchell Johnson steaming in over the winter was amazing, no matter which side you were supporting. I just worry we’ll see it less and less. What we’ll get is a watered-down version of the real thing. Mentally, it’s the batsmen who can get into difficulties. Look at poor old Jonathan Trott. When you’re on the road all the time and are struggling for scores, the loneliness of your hotel room can be a dangerous place to be. Mind games: Jonathan Trott struggled with a stress related illness while on the Ashes tour of Australia . Don’t get me wrong. We all make a good living out of the game. And while that happens no-one is going to stand up and say enough is enough. They’ll just make their money more quickly and retire earlier, before riding off into the IPL sunset. But there’s another factor we should consider: the fans. If I’ve paid £85 months in advance for a day’s Test cricket, then find out in the week before the game that England are resting Jimmy Anderson, I wouldn’t be very amused. It’s all to do with greed. It’s punishing for those playing the game, and unfair on those paying to watch it.","England have been asked to play 17 Tests in the next nine months .

Three minutes after the tweet, following ridicule from some of his 13.6 million followers, he backtracked and said: 'Let me shut my black a** up!'

"Justin Bieber has inspired more ill will among Americans than the radical group Muslim Brotherhood - at least according to the popularity of a White House petition calling for the deportation of the troubled Canadian singer. The petition created by a Detroit resident asking to eject 19-year-old pop star from the U.S. and have his green card revoked has drawn nearly 261,000 signatures as of Friday morning, becoming the second most popular cause in the three-year history of the White House site. At 204,500 signatures, a petition to declare the extremist Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization is a distant second, followed by a plea to pardon CIA leaker Edward Snowden in third with 153,000 signatures. Scroll down for video... Unpopular: A petition on the White House website calling to deport Canadian teen idol Justin Bieber and have his green card revoked has become the second most popular plea ever . Legal trouble: The 'Slow Down' singer was arrested last month for allegedly drag-racing a Lamborghini while drunk in Miami Beach . The only petition to draw more attention than the Bieber deportation push was the 2012 plea to declare Westboro Baptist Church a hate group in response to their anti-gay protests at military funerals, Washington Times reported. According to the policy of the website launched in 2011, any petition that raises 100,000 signatures in 30 days must be taken under consideration by the Obama administration - a threshold that the Bieber plea easily met last month. The call to action was made January 23 by Robert Skryzynski, 24, of Detroit, following Bieber's humiliating arrest for allegedly drag-racing a Lamborghini under the influence and with an expired license in Miami Beach. 'We the people of the United States feel that we are being wrongly represented in the world of pop culture. We would like to see the dangerous, reckless, destructive, and drug abusing, Justin Bieber deported and his green card revoked,' the petition reads. Rough patch: The 19-year-old vocalist has been charged with assaulting a limo driver in Toronto in December (left) and he also faces DUI charged in Miami Beach (right) Wayward youth: Bieber, pictured here in an Instagram photo from last week, has been the subject of numerous reports about his suspected drug use and casual flings . 'He is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth. We the people would like to remove Justin Bieber from our society.' Skyzynski later explained that he used the tongue-in-cheek plea to kick Bieber out of the country as a way to draw attention to the problems with the White House petition portal, which he said foreign powers have been using to jockey for the attention of the U.S. government. ‘I feel like I finally brought America together on an issue for once,’ Mr. Skrzynski quipped to The Washington Times this week. The White House has said that it will issue an official response to the Bieber petition now that it has raised more than the required 100,000 signatures, but there is no timetable yet for when the statement will come. Historically, the administration has been slow to respond to petitions, and the responses are usually formulaic and of little note. But the signatories of the White House plea are evidently not the only ones who wish to see Bieber pack up his bags and hit the road north.

"After England claimed an impressive 266-run victory against India in the third Test at the Ageas Bowl, Sportsmail's NASSER HUSSAIN runs the rule over how both sets of players rated. Alastair Cook 9.5 . Just shows what a clear mind and runs can do. Win the toss and bat first. Outstanding from the first ball to the last. Didn’t put a foot wrong. Sam Robson 4 . Struggles outside off stump and as an opener that is a problem. Has to work out what to play and what to leave. Gary Ballance 9 . Brilliant in both innings; trying to set match up in first and going after it in second. Showed he can bat at different tempos. Wouldn’t have been given out in either innings with DRS. Stellar outing: It all went right for Alastair Cook in Southampton with England ending their search for a Test win . Ian Bell 9 . Brilliant return to form in first innings. Left the ball better outside off stump early and gave England the required tempo in absence of KP, giving his side chance to bowl India out twice. Joe Root 7 . Excellent second innings in one-day mode, selflessly going after runs quickly. Useful wicket and outstanding fielding. Has a great attitude. Moeen Ali 9 . Remarkable six-wicket haul against India. There are some great spinners who haven’t done that. No longer a part-timer. Has worked hard on the pace he needs to bowl and it’s paying off. Six of the best:  Moeen Ali (right) celebrates taking the wicket  of Bhuvneshwar Kumar . Jos Buttler 9 . Had a little bit of luck in his first innings but he made India pay with a superb aggressive innings. His glove-work impressed me even more on a spinning wicket. Outstanding debut. Chris Woakes 6 . Did not bowl badly and I would look to keep him in the squad. If Anderson isn’t available next week, England need a swing bowler like Woakes. Chris Jordan 4 . Hasn't been helped by being left out and then brought back in. Needs to be playing because he’s completely lost his rhythm. Took a brilliant catch and didn’t let his head drop. Safe hands: Chris Jordan caught both Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshewar Pujar (above) in the slips . Stuart Broad 8 . Great hostile bowling without being too short. Some of the short balls he did bowl nipped back in and caused serious issues. Back to his best and looked like he enjoyed himself. James Anderson 9.5 . His control of line, length and swing and the way he set up players like Dhawan was world-class. Delivered when his captain needed him. Mr Reliable: James Anderson, who faces a possible suspension, was at his immaculate best . Total 84/110 . Murali Vijay 5 . Played nicely in the first innings until he dragged one on. A good player but a dopey run out in second with no real dive will have made Duncan Fletcher cross. Shikhar Dhawan 5 . Has a problem with Anderson bowling around the wicket. Has worked with Fletcher to change his alignment but his technique, staying so leg side, looks vulnerable in England. Place under threat from Gautam Gambhir. Don't look back: Skikhar Dhawan is caught by Jordan off the bowling of Anderson . Cheteshwar Pujara 4 . Another couple of soft dismissals. He got a good ball in the first innings from Broad but he needs to knuckle down and get back to his best. Virat Kohli 5.5 . Looks vulnerable outside off stump. Got himself in twice but he has been playing the shot of the day rather than the innings of the day. That is a big difference. Ajinkya Rahane 8 . Played really well in both innings. People talk about Pujara looking like Rahul Dravid but I think Rahane is more like him. Very organised and in good nick. The little wall: Ajinkya Rahane hit half centuries in both innings at the Ageas Bowl . Rohit Sharma 4 . Don't have a problem with him hitting down the ground because too many Indian batsmen were passive against Moeen Ali. But he needs to commit fully to the shot and it didn’t work for India playing the extra batsman. MS Dhoni 6 . Captained the side well and batted nicely in the first innings. At times his glove-work looked a little bit sloppy in comparison to Buttler. Might think about the balance of the side. Ravindra Jadeja 6 . Couple of soft dismissals. Bowled OK but too quickly to really find the rough. Orthodox left-arm spinners go up and down to land it in the rough but Jadeja is constantly trying to fire it in. And that's out: Ravindra Jadeja is bowled by Ali on day five as India crumble to defeat . Bhuvneshwar Kumar 6 . Not at his best but he still bowled pretty well. Pitched the ball up and swung it and produced a couple of really good deliveries. Looked a little short of pace. Mohammed Shami 4 . Thought he’d be bowling better than this in the series. In the absence of Ishant Sharma he needed to stand up more and take more responsibility but it didn’t happen. Will be looking over his shoulder. Pankaj Singh 4 . Poor lad. He’ll bowl a lot worse and take wickets. Had Cook dropped, Ballance not given and Bell lbw turned down. Nice to see a genuine No 11 back in Test cricket!

"You only had to look at the difference in Alastair Cook’s reaction at the end of this Test and at the end of the Lord’s game to realise how much winning Test matches for England matters to him. This win, and the fact he got runs, will be a massive weight off Cook’s shoulders. It is impossible to understand the pressure you are under as England captain unless you have been there. When things are not going well you feel as if everyone is against you and, while it might be possible to escape the limelight between matches, you still have to do the day-to-day things and you feel as if you’re letting people down. Cheshire grin: Alastair Cook cut a far happier figure after England defeated India in the third Test . They think it's all over... Alastair Cook and Jos Buttler (R) celebrate after victory is confirmed . You feel like people are looking at you and talking about your captaincy or how badly you’re batting. Not contributing to the team is the thing that hurts the most as  captain. It was when I went through some of my darkest moments — walking down a hotel corridor in Sri Lanka,  knocking on Michael Atherton’s door and asking if I should stay on as captain. It’s a horrible place to be. As captain it’s very rare that you are scoring runs personally and the team is winning. That means there is almost always a downside after a match and that is why Cook should relish this moment, because he’s had the double whammy of losing games and not getting runs. Keep calm and carry on: When Alistair Cook is batting well the the rest will follow . In a spin: Moeen Ali inspired England to victory by unexpectedly taking six wickets . VIDEO My best day - Moeen . We are all human and want to be liked, so the reception he got when he was batting will have given Alastair an enormous confidence boost. It is abundantly clear the England cricketing public want him to succeed. I am still of the view that the most important thing for England is Cook the batsman. A lot of things will fall into place, including maybe his  captaincy, if Cook is getting runs. It was a brave decision for him to have a bat on a pitch with a little bit of grass on it here. But it was the right decision and he went in with a clear mind and deserved the luck he got at the start of his innings. Patriot games: The victory at the Aegeas Bowl obviously meant a lot to England's captain . When Cook is batting, everything is calm and comfortable. It is the most important thing for  England and it transfers into his captaincy. I thought he had an excellent game as captain. Virtually every move he made paid off and tactically he was very good. He learned from mistakes and set some very good fields. The way he used Moeen Ali showed he is building trust and that is paying off. The fundamental point, though, is that the England team will be better off when he is scoring runs consistently, not sporadically, and the management must decide if he can be that batsman while he is captain or whether at some point someone else has to do that.","England defeated India in the third Test to level the Series .

If England's captain is scoring runs then the rest of his game follows ."
"After England claimed a 3-1 against India at The Oval, Sportsmail's NASSER HUSSAIN runs the rule over how both sets of players rated. Alastair Cook 7 . To be here with a 3-1 win over India, after where he was on the podium after the defeat at Lord’s, shows how mentally tough he is. Sam Robson 3 . He has made batting look hard at times and the Lions tour this winter will be a big one for him. He obviously has technical issues. Gary Ballance 9 . Looks like a fluent version of Jonathan Trott. Very composed indeed. And that catch he took yesterday was a blinder. Man of the moment: Gary Ballance showed his composure to help his side to victory against India . Ian Bell 7 . Played outstandingly at Southampton and he’s allowed the odd quiet game, as he had at The Oval. Still a slight flaw when the ball’s around off stump. Joe Root 9 . He’s been in phenomenal form this summer and has got his tempo spot on. He looks so well-suited to No 5 — and must now stay there. Moeen Ali 7 . His off-spin has developed superbly after people were calling him a part-timer. One or two soft dismissals with the bat, but he’s here to stay. Jos Buttler 8 . Looks more thoughtful with the bat than some of us imagined he would be — he’s not just a biffer. Apart from a few bad moments at Old Trafford, he kept well. Utility man: Jos Buttler proved that he is capable of using the bat as well as the gloves . Chris Woakes 6 . Has been unlucky with the ball for much of the series, but he’s put on a yard of pace from last summer. The key will be how he fares when there’ s no swing. Chris Jordan 6 . Got better as the series progressed. Still some wayward deliveries there, but England can live with that as he mixes in some wicket-taking balls. Handy contributions with the bat. Stuart Broad 8 . Showed a lot of character, bowling through five Tests with a dodgy knee, then batting yesterday against the short ball after breaking his nose in Manchester. James Anderson 9.5 . My admiration for him grows by the day. To keep setting top-class batsmen up takes serious skill. When the ball’s swinging, there’s no one better in world cricket. Key player: James Anderson has proven that he is currently among the best bowlers in world cricket . VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Total 79.5/110 . Murali Vijay 6 . His fate mirrored the Indian team: he faded as the series progressed. Was worked over beautifully by Anderson: outswing, outswing, then inswing for the lbw. Gautam Gambhir 1 . A really odd selection when he hadn’t played Test cricket for so long. His run-out  summed things up — it was as if he wanted to escape the strike. Cheteshwar Pujara 4 . He kept getting good deliveries. Looks like the most technically organised of the Indian batsmen, but that counted for little. Nightmare: Gautam Gambhir was run out from a throw by Chris Woakes during the fifth Test . Virat Kohli 3 . England exposed his technical deficiencies superbly. Tried to fight hard yesterday but against Broad, Anderson and the moving ball, he wasn’t up to it. Ajinkya Rahane 5 . His superb hundred at Lord’s set up India’s only win, but — like Vijay — he faded. Drove a bit too early, which led to three caught and bowleds. MS Dhoni 6 . Showed that you can score runs without a great technique, but some of the decisions he made out in the middle were a little strange. His position as Test captain will be under pressure. Under pressure: MS Dhoni, pictured with Duncan Fletcher, will be under extreme pressure after his side's loss . Stuart Binny 4 . I just couldn’t work out what he was doing in the side. Dhoni obviously had no confidence in his bowling and he just looked to tee off with the bat. Ravichandran Ashwin 6 . His bowling held up an end and at least gave Dhoni some control — when he wasn’t trying too many variations. His batting looked in good nick. Bhuvneshwar Kumar 7 . The only one of India’s bowlers to play all five Tests and it showed. He started the series superbly, but his bowling (and his batting) fell away. Varun Aaron 7 . Hostile and unlucky — there were a few dropped catches off his bowling. He was the only Indian bowler to regularly unsettle England’s batsmen. Ishant Sharma 7 . Sharma bowled well here at The Oval to follow up his excellent display at Lord’s. He’s one of the few Indian players to emerge from this series with his reputation enhanced. Bright spark: India bowler Ishant Sharma can leave The Oval with his head held high . Total 56/110 .","James Anderson proved he is among the best bowlers in world cricket .

"More than 20 private schools are involved in child sex abuse investigations after dozens of victims came forward in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Some of the country’s leading institutions, including those attended by Nick Clegg, Boris Johnson and Tony Blair, face accusations of covering up abuse for decades. The allegations include rape. Lawyers acting for the alleged victims are demanding up to £400,000 in compensation for the years of abuse they suffered. Former Caldicott headmaster Roland Peter Wright . (left) was found guilty of indecency with a child last year while Mervyn . Rush (right) was jailed for abusing boys 40 years ago . Those seeking redress include former . pupils at Beeston Hall, a £21,000-a-year prep school in Norfolk. Mervyn . Rush, 68, who taught science at the school in the 1970s, was jailed for . 14 years in August last year after pleading guilty to 18 charges of . sexual abuse against ten boys aged between eight and 12. Victims were emboldened to come forward following the Savile scandal, according to one lawyer. Jessica . Standley, of law firm Slater and Gordon, said: ‘There has been an . increase in victims reporting abuse suffered at a variety of . institutions, including fee-paying schools. Sadly, in many of these . cases those in positions of authority knew of the abuse and failed to . take adequate steps to protect innocent children.’ With . compensation claims of up to £400,000 per victim, the financial . repercussions of these historical cases could cause the closure of some . prep schools, claims Tony Little, head of Eton College. It is possible . [some will have to close] but it is absolutely right this problem is . exposed,’ he said. Denstone College in Staffordshire is among the schools facing claims for compensation . Some 20 . former pupils of Ashdown House in East Sussex, which was attended by . Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Homeland actor Damian Lewis, claim . that staff committed ‘very serious abuse’ on children aged between seven . and 13 during the 1970s. The £23,000-a-year boarding school is a feeder . school for Eton and Harrow. Victims at Mr Clegg’s old prep school, £22,000-a-year Caldicott, in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, are also suing for damages. Peter . Wright, who was Mr Clegg’s headmaster, is awaiting sentence after being . found guilty last month of a series of sex offences. The Chorister . School in Durham, the £18,000-a-year prep school attended by Mr Blair, . recently settled a series of sex abuse claims. Police . investigated allegations by 23 former pupils that they had been . sexually abused by Canon John Grove, who was headmaster from 1957 to . 1978. Schools attended by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Boris Johnson are among those facing allegations of abuse . But the investigation . ended without any criminal charges as Canon Grove died in 2001 and . police found no evidence against anyone still alive. Many . victims say they simply want justice after years of staying silent. One, a 60-year-old man who attended Chorister, said: ‘All I really . wanted was an apology from the school and the church. ‘The Savile disgrace has  made it easier for victims to come forward.’ Beeston Hall has confirmed that its lawyers are handling claims  for damages.

"Everton are still looking to add two new players to their ranks with Tom Cleverley of Manchester United among the options for Roberto Martinez. The midfielder made his competitive debut for United three years ago and turns 25 on August 12. He has 78 first team games under his belt  but has been targeted as one of the squad's weaker links after failing to kick-on in the last year with any consistency. Everton manager Martinez was widely credited with improving Cleverley while coaching him at Wigan, where he played 25 games in 2010-11, and the Spaniard is keeping a close on developments at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Everton need to sign a few more players . On the move? Everton are interested in Manchester United's much-criticised midfielder Tom Cleverley, with manager Roberto Martinez believing he can reinvigorate the England man . Previous experience: Martinez worked with Cleverley when he was manager of Wigan in 2010-11 . Louis van Gaal made Cleverley captain for the friendly against Roma in the USA and will inform players on their return to Manchester this week whether they have made the cut for his planned 22-man squad. The midfielder did not excel against Roma but like many of the United players is enjoying his time under the new Dutch coach. Everton have already splashed out in excess of £35m this summer with Romelu Lukaku, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway signed, while David Henen's transfer from Anderlecht is close. A loan deal for Chelsea's Christian Atsu has hit stalemate but is still on, yet a transfer for Cleverley would cost around £8million. Bradford, Cleverley's first club, would also be due a percentage of any sell on. Decision time: Louis van Gaal will trim his United squad to 22 after their tour of the United States . Statement of intent: Everton have already spent big on striker Romelu Lukaku this summer . VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad . Martinez may yet prefer to bring in Lacina Traore on loan from Monaco or another striker but Cleverley's situation will be clearer by the end of next week. If they pull off two more deals without selling their stars it would be a huge statement of intent from Everton. The concern at United would be that Martinez could find the key to re-invigorating Cleverley. Van Gaal though will recruit in midfield and defence and has been pleasantly surprised by some of the other younger players' performances. Deals for Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund remain unlikely. LAMPARD ARRIVAL COULD MEAN CITY SALES . Frank Lampard's arrival at Manchester City has lifted hopes at other clubs that certain fringe players in the Premier League champions' squad will be be made available. Sunderland are among the front runners pushing for a deal with Jack Rodwell while Valencia remain eager to take Bruno Zuculini on loan. Incoming: Frank Lampard's arrival on loan at Manchester City could lead to the departure of other players . Good impression: Bruno Zuculini has looked good on Manchester City's pre-season tour of America . Oriol Romeu has returned from the Spanish League to Chelsea only to be loaned out to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart and Valencia want a defensive-minded midfielder to step in. Zuculini has only just joined from Racing in Argentina but showed on the US tour why City have brought him into their squad. Valencia now hope to give him a season in La Liga where he can continue to improve. However, they face competition for Zuculini from Deportivo La Coruna, who are also among the clubs to have expressed an interest in Liverpool's defensive starlet Tiago Ilori. SOUTHAMPTON CHASING 'MUSKETEER' SCHELOTTO . Southampton will hold further talks with Inter Milan over winger Ezequiel Schelotto on Tuesday. The 25-year-old should certainly give Ronald Koeman's team a better cutting edge as his nickname is 'El Mosquetero' or 'The Musketeer' - although that moniker owes more to his hair than his rapier-swishing style on the wing. It is understood the nickname he actually prefers is 'El Galgo' or 'the Greyhound'. Negotiations: Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is close to sealing the signing of Ezequiel Schelotto . Whatever name he wishes to use, Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is keen to push a deal forward. They have agreed terms on Dani Osvaldo and are discussing a loan for midfielder Saphir Taider also. Schelotto's agent Bruno Carpeggiani said: 'The situation with Southampton is active and we are waiting for the deal to go ahead.' Although Argentininian born and raised, Schelotto has been capped by Italy. He spent part of last season on loan at Parma. CANAS SWAPPING SWANSEA FOR ELCHE . Swansea midfielder Jose Canas is due to hold talks with Elche ahead of a return to Spain. Celta Vigo, who are playing a series of friendlies in England at the moment, have also shown an interest in the 27-year-old. Swansea manager Garry Monk left Canas out of the club’s pre-season tour to the US, leading his representatives to begin negotiations with Elche sporting director, Victor Orta. Return: Swansea's Jose Canas is holding talks with Elche ahead of a possible return to Spain . Swansea remain on the trail of Almeria's Ramon Azeez and have made enquiries about the Nigerian. Defender Chico Flores remains a target for Michael Laudrup at Lekhwiya. Wolfsburg have expressed an interest in Wilfried Bony, whose wage demands in excess of £100,000-a-week derailed a potential move to Liverpool. Those figures won't be easy for the Bundesliga side to accommodate either although they have also asked about a deal for Chelsea's Fernando Torres who is on around £150,000. Manager Monk said: 'Unless there's a concrete offer that we think is good for us and we want to do business, it doesn't matter. Even then, we're in control - so all of that doesn't matter, because it's speculation - Wilfried's our player.' Demands: Wolfsburg have shown an interest in Wilfried Bony, but his wages could be a stumbling block . NEWCASTLE SIGN FOREST DUO . Newcastle will sign Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow from Nottingham Forest on Monday and loan the pair back. Manager Alan Pardew remains keen to bring in another striker while a deal for Clement Grenier at Lyon remains a possibility. The 23-year-old France midfielder has long been in Newcastle's sights but he is keen to join a Champions League team. If one of those does not come along soon, the greater the Toon's chances become. Possible deal: Newcastle United have been keen on France international Clement Grenier for a while . LIVERPOOL WRAP UP MORENO DEAL . Liverpool's search for a left-back should be concluded soon as talks progress with Sevilla over the £16m transfer of Alberto Moreno. Sevilla have enquired about Sporting Lisbon's 26-year-old Jefferson Nascimento as a potential short term replacement. LAZIO INTERESTED IN KABOUL . Lazio's interest in Younes Kaboul should help Tottenham offset their pending outlay on Eric Dier and Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal. Tottenham have no plans to sell Jan Vertonghen as part of their defensive restructuring but will continue to listen to offers for Michael Dawson. Kaboul, 28, is valued at around £6m by Tottenham although Lazio want to pay around £3m. They are also looking to offload Michael Ciani to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have no interest in Samuel Eto'o, who is looking more likely to return to Italy at this stage with West Ham also looking at younger options. On his way? Lazio are willing to pay Spurs £3m for Younes Kaboul . WEDNESDAY IMPRESSED BY KELHAR . Sheffield Wednesday have offered Slovenian trialist Dejan Kelhar a short-term contract. The 30-year-old defender, who has won six caps for his country and last played for Red Star Belgrade, has been training at Hillsborough and played in some of their pre-season friendlies. Manager Stuart Gray remains keen to sign a striker but Kelhar has also done enough to earn a deal. Gray said: 'We are offering Dejan a short-term contract and hopefully he will be putting pen to paper for us. Nothing has been finalised, he is mulling it over at the moment.' STOKE STOPPER BACHMANN HEADS TO WREXHAM ON LOAN . Stoke's young goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann is poised to join Conference side Wrexham on loan.

"There is no escaping the irony. Just days after a Heineken Cup semi-final took place in front of 56,058 empty seats at Twickenham, fans are in up-roar about a dearth of tickets for the Amlin Challenge Cup Final. Followers of Bath and Northampton have launched a petition to have the secondary European final switched from Cardiff Arms Park to a larger venue. Their anger is understandable, as official allocations of 1,000 tickets to each of the English clubs have been rapidly sold out. Rugby has to be smarter and more flexible in these tricky situations, to present its best face to the world. Saracens v Clermont Auvergne should have been staged at the Madejski Stadium or Stadium:mk, in order to make a crowd of 25,942 represent a glorious spectacle. Mark McCall’s victors deserved better than to claim their finest European win in front of a two-thirds empty arena. No show: Saracens remarkable 46-6 Heineken Cup semi-final win over Clermont was watched by 25,942 fans . Electric: The fans in the cavernous stadium did their best, but a smaller venue would have done them justice . Dominant: Sarries Chris Ashton celebrates one of his tries in front of 50,058 empty seats . Tournament organisers are at the mercy of results, hence the need for contingency planning, especially in the Challenge Cup. If two French sides were contesting the final in the Welsh capital, a capacity of 12,125 would be ample, but two of England’s best-supported clubs can bring hordes across the border, so Cardiff City Stadium should have been lined up as a stand-by option. Surely there is insurance to cover such a scenario. The sport is on a multi-speed development curve. Some teams now draw vast armies in their wake, while others make do with modest platoons. Munster lie top of the man-power table, so much so that a loud cluster of their fans detoured to Twickenham en route to Marseille. Their commitment and fervour is phenomenal. Travelling support is a useful gauge of the game’s appeal. Irish sides are at the forefront with Ulster and Leinster, in that order, matching Munster’s red hordes for fanaticism if not for numbers. In England, Leicester are No 1, followed by Northampton, Bath and Gloucester. Minimal support: Just 1000 fans from each club will see Bath play Northampton in the Amlin Challenge Cup final . More must be done to encourage weekly migrations. Sensible kick-off times are essential. Why the trend for 5pm starts? Saracens may charter trains to ferry their fans home from Cardiff after a late finish to the Heineken final on May 24. Clubs need to encourage away-days; as Sale are doing by switching from Friday night matches to Saturday afternoons. Paying spectators whose allegiance takes them on distant trips want the game to be part of a day out or weekend break, so they must be accommodated. Rugby is not football; it needs to work harder to earn its popularity. The blizzard of tributes for Jacques Burger’s destructive master-class for Saracens at Twickenham last Saturday came as due recognition for a ferocious competitor. His defensive onslaught was a herculean effort by anyone’s standards, but certainly for a player whose career was nearly ended by a knee condition which still requires constant management. Burger’s refusal to be beaten by injury strikes a chord, as do his feats as an elite performer from a second-tier rugby nation. The Namibian flanker is savouring most of his career highlights in club colours, but next year’s World Cup may provide a fitting Test peak. Tributes: Jacques Burger's effort in the Heineken Cup semi-final was worthy of the praises he's received . Top level: After a European Cup final, the Namibia star could line-up at the World Cup against the All Blacks . If Namibia qualify for the tournament as ‘Africa 1’ from a four-team play-off in Madagascar this summer, the prize would be a place in Pool C and a showdown with the All Blacks at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford. While the result would be a foregone conclusion, Burger would certainly make the world champions know they had been in a battle. On the subject of recognition, there should be more for the man in charge of Bath’s charge into title contention this season. The West Country club finished seventh in the Aviva Premiership last season, but under Mike Ford they have soared to third place in this campaign, while also shifting away from a territorial approach to a more all-singing, all-dancing attacking game. Yet, the ex-England defence coach has not . been included in the shortlist for the Premiership Director of Rugby of . the Year award, which features Richard Cockerill (Leicester), Steve . Diamond (Sale) and Mark McCall (Saracens). Unsung: Bath director of rugby Mike Ford should be recognised for his work with the club this season . Ford and his opposite number at The Rec on Friday night, Northampton’s Jim Mallinder, can feel hard done by. The clash between their teams will go a long way to shaping the play-off equation and Bath are without Kyle Eastmond, who has been rested, while the Saints have left out Lions wing George North, who has been struggling to recover from a calf injury. Rugby’s officiating crisis goes on. The authorities have opened two cans of worms; the first involving the crack-down on dangerous ‘tip tackles’. In the Heineken Cup quarter-finals, Jared Payne of Ulster was sent off for taking Saracens’ Alex Goode out in the air, but last Friday Northampton wing Jamie Elliott was shown a yellow card for the same offence, after bringing down Mike Brown. Inconsistent: Ulster's Jared Payne was sent off but Saints' Jamie Elliott got a yellow for the same offence . Contact was minimal, but the incident provided further proof that referees are ruling based on the severity of the damage caused, rather than meeting the demands for uniformity from on-high. The zero tolerance stance has created chaos. Secondly, increased use of Television Match Officials has become a farce, with referees pre-empting their verdict by watching big screens in stadiums, or being damned if they don’t refer every marginal call ‘upstairs’. Last Sunday, Wayne Barnes and his assistant, Luke Pearce, correctly ruled that Simon Zebo had touched down for Munster, but they were berated in some quarters for not confirming by video. But they were right; the TMO is there to help in the event of on-field doubt. More common-sense is needed. Super Rugby is in expansion mode again, with an announcement on Thursday that the 15-team tournament will be replaced by a rejigged 18-team structure from 2016. The ‘Australasian’ Group will feature the current five sides from Australia and five from New Zealand, while the South African Group will feature a sixth franchise from that country, plus one from Argentina and another. Branching out: Last season's Super Rugby champions The Chiefs will soon be in a 18-team competition . The inclusion of an Argentinian team, despite the logistical challenges that creates, is a welcome move with the bigger global picture in mind, but the selection of the 18th team is likely to be a commercial exercise. The SANZAR consensus is that this side should come from the ‘Asian market’ - with profit apparently the prime consideration. What there should be instead is a Pacific islands team, perhaps based outside Auckland and supported by IRB funding. Why not really go for broke with an islands team and a franchise based in, say, Tokyo, as part of the Australasian group, and another African side in a new location – possibly Kenya?

"Alastair Cook was always going to get runs again at some stage. He is too good a player not to do that, but this was an important day for him, his mind-set and his status within the England team. No-one would want to go through what Cook has been experiencing and the reaction of the crowd when he was out showed how much this innings meant to the cricketing public. He is a likeable lad who people want to do well and to play an innings like he did under huge pressure shows what a mentally tough young man he is. Relief: Alastair Cook was back amongst the runs on day one of the third Investec Test against India . Agonsing: Cook was out for 95 on day one of the third Investec Test against India at the Ageas Bowl . VIDEO A great day for England - Cook . But Cook’s 95 does not change anything. We all want to see England’s best batsman, the man who will go on to become their leading runscorer, making scores consistently and the issue is how they get him playing like that all the time. One innings  does not mean all his problems are solved. England eventually have to make a decision on Cook. Getting him back to his best as a batsman is still more important to the team than his captaincy. He went past Kevin Pietersen and David Gower on Sunday and he will go past Graham Gooch and many other stars of the world game as long as his batting returns to its best. That means more to England than his leadership. He can get runs while he’s captain but it’s how England get the most out of him and in the back of Cook’s mind would have been the feeling he was not contributing, which is horrible for a captain. Focus: Cook was given a couple of chances, but fought hard for his 95 runs . Relief: Cook won the toss and decided to bat first on a greenish looking pitch in Southampton . All the reassurances from your team-mates do not mean anything if you believe you are not pulling your weight, especially when England are in such desperate need of a victory. Cook’s technical problems were still evident at times at the Ageas Bowl and the issue is how we ensure his mind is crystal clear, as it was on Sunday, while he works out the best way to score lots of runs. He was trying to get much further forward and that is not easy for Alastair who has always been a back-foot player. He cannot suddenly start playing like Matty Hayden and it will  take a lot of physical and mental effort to correct this weakness, which  has been exploited by bowlers. Ovation: England's under-pressure captain received a warm reception from the crowd . On his way: The England captain trudges off after falling five runs short of a century . He had a bit of luck but he deserved that after all the previous bad luck. Things even themselves out and good things  happen to good people. It would have been lovely if he had scored a century but he must think about his 95 and how he would have felt had he been caught by Ravindra Jadeja for 15. Now he has to keep on working to become the Cook we know and respect because there were only glimpses of it on Sunday. He needs to develop this different way of batting. It’s a work in progress. What this innings does is buy him time and clears the bees in his head. Cook’s brain will not be as scrambled the next time he bats.","Cook was always going to score runs at some stage .

"Whenever England lose we always blame them and say they are rubbish but when they win we can be reluctant to give them full credit and instead say that the opposition are terrible. The truth here lies somewhere in between. Yes, India were awful but that was because of how good England’s seam attack were, in particular Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. That was as hard as batting gets in Test cricket because England’s big two have been phenomenal. Lord’s was almost like a light-bulb moment for England. It was as low as they could get. Sometimes you need to hit rock bottom before you can hit back and it was so bad after the second Test that England’s senior players seemed to say ‘we might as well just go out and enjoy it now and see what happens.’ VIDEO Scroll down for MS Dhoni: It's difficult to know why we aren't lasting . Bowling attack: Jimmy Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad (right) were among England's best performers . Captain fantastic: Alastair Cook will be in high spirits after his side claimed a 3-1 win over India . Certainly Alastair Cook seemed relaxed at the toss at the Ageas Bowl, as if he had nothing more to lose, and he deserves so much credit for what has happened since then. Many people, myself included, doubted Cook and rightly so because I have always believed there was a lot of potential in this new England side and outside it with the likes of Alex Hales, James Taylor and Jason Roy and something must have been wrong for them to go 10 Test matches without a victory. So for Cook to have a good long look at himself and turn things around shows the incredible mental toughness of the man. A lot of people would have said ‘enough’s enough, I will just go back and bat’ which is what I wanted because his runs have always been so important to England. Instead he has proved us all wrong. Now he must remember why things have changed and what he and England have done to reverse their fortunes. So many of the things he did wrong have disappeared in the last three games. The field placings to tail-enders, putting everybody on the boundary for Angelo Mathews, not bowling Moeen Ali for hours on end, over-bowling Jimmy Anderson so he was exhausted. Cook has changed but he needed to because he was being tactically naïve. Winners: England celebrate after winning the Investec Test Series against India at The Oval . To have the clarity of thought to change when you are so low shows that this is a special guy. Yes Cook has had a bit of luck along the way but he has deserved that after all he has been through for nine months. He’s a good guy who has only ever done what he felt was best for the health of English cricket. Work still needs to be done on his batting. There was evidence of the problems he has had over the last year in the way he got out on Saturday. But he is getting there with the runs he has scored both here and in Southampton. Peter Moores has proved the right coach for this England team, too. He was the right man, after Lord’s, to question people and challenge them. Important factor: Peter Moores has had to pick his players up after a disappointing spell . VIDEO Coach Peter Moores praises 'outstanding' England . It didn’t work out the first time he was coach because he was dealing with a few senior players who did not want to be challenged but I think this crop actually do want that. And that’s both the young and senior ones. Yet beating an Indian side who have only won one Test away from home in three years is one thing. Taking on Australia and Mitchell Johnson is quite another. England must identify the areas where they need to improve and look after Anderson and Broad for that spell of 17 Tests in just nine months that follows the World Cup. But don’t be fearful of Australia. England, with so many players coming through, are a team to invest in. They are on an upward curve. Australia, meanwhile, have got some older players who might be going in the other direction. Let us see. There is much to look forward to.","Alastair Cook's England thrash India to win series 3-1 .

"Ryan Shawcross normally scores once a year. On New Year's Day the Stoke City defender broke protocol and got his second goal this season against former club Manchester United. It took the 27-year-old just two minutes into the Barclays Premier League of 2015 to remind us why it's the best there is (and why Bundesliga and La Liga can keep their winter breaks). January 1 had just about everything; goals, penalties, red cards, talking points, a twist or two, a Jose Mourinho rant, and more than a few questionable refereeing decisions. Was it the greatest day the Premier League has seen since it was founded in 1992? That's down to personal preference, but here are the statistics that may persuade you otherwise. Ryan Shawcross puts Stoke City ahead after two minutes against Manchester United in the Premier League . Shawcross celebrates his second goal of the season as Stoke and United got New Year's Day going . It is just the second time in English footballing history that two sides have been joint-top alphabetically after December . Just twice has this happened come the turn of the year. Chelsea and Manchester City have identical records - sharing 46 points, 44 goals for, 19 against, plus-25 difference. But Mourinho has only himself to blame for not being seven points clear in 2015. The Chelsea manager, in between insisting Premier League referees are conspiring against him, has been punished by former confidant Frank Lampard at the Etihad. Jose Mourinho on the bench at White Hart Lane as Chelsea went on to lose 5-3 against Tottenham Hotspur . Frank Lampard's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea have been vital in the title chase . Manuel Pellegrini is using Mourinho's own weapon against him after the 36-year-old was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June,  ending up in Manchester via New York. The former England midfielder's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea mean he has earned Pellegrini five points, and denied Mourinho two in the process. But there's good news for Chelsea. When Arsenal were tied with Manchester United on points, goals for, goals against and difference on January 10, 2004, Arsene Wenger went on to win the title. If Chelsea and Manchester City's records remain identical come May, then both sides would need a one-off winner-takes-all match to determine the champions. Fingers crossed, neutrals. Manuel Pellegrini has been using Mourinho's own weapon against him with the on-loan Lampard (right) There were 33 goals scored, the most  on New Year's Day since 1987 . Largely down to the evening's London derby between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, where  neutrals (and BT Sport) were relieved it was on television. And the five goals between Manchester City and Sunderland in their 3-2 thriller helped, too, all coming in just 16 minutes and 12 seconds. The early game, sadly, did not become a free-for-all, not even with Manchester United's £154million attack, but others made up for it. The 10 fixtures had 33 between them, the most since 1987 when 11 matches saw 34, including a 3-1 win for Oxford United over Southampton and a 3-1 defeat for Wimbledon by Arsenal. New Year's Day almost doubled the amount of goals on December 28, too, where just 17 goals were scored and three 0-0 scorelines played out. Not the worst of welcomes to the new year. Harry Kane scored twice for Tottenham as they went on to win 5-3 against Chelsea on New Year's Day .

The woodwork was struck 16 times - the most ever recorded on a Premier League day since 2006/07 . So, there could have been even more scored. Among those was Peter Crouch who could have nicked a win for Stoke City in the second half. You can try and mark the 6ft 7in striker, though it often does little good. He rose highest, but could not been the right post. At St James' Park, too, there could have been more than the six goals scored between Newcastle United and Burnley. The latter were desperately unlucky, hitting the woodwork  twice in one move through Danny Ings and Ashley Barnes during the 3-3 draw. It remains Manchester City who have hit the woodwork more times than any other club (12) this season, with Southampton and Burnley (both 11) catching up.

This doesn't happen. Mourinho doesn't allow teams he manages to concede five. To him, three is an disappointment. Four, an embarrassment. But five? That's what happened at White Hart Lane, largely down to their in-house striker. Harry Kane, shaking loose Oscar, scored from where he had no right to. It brought Tottenham level, and they went on to win 5-3. The only other time Mourinho  felt this was on November 29, 2010. He, then of Real Madrid, lost 5-0 against Barcelona at the Nou Camp. 'I hope this game does not affect us psychologically,' Mourinho said in the aftermath. 'I have spoken to the players and told them the title is not gone. We can't leave here crying.' Barcelona went on to win the title, never losing top spot following the 5-0 drubbing, and Real finished four points adrift.

Speaking of five, it was just the third time Chelsea conceded so many in a Premier League game. The others? Liverpool beat them 5-1 on September 21, 1996, at Anfield, and Arsenal beat them 5-3 on October 29, 2011, at Stamford Bridge with a Robin van Persie hat-trick.

Nigel Pearson's men fought back after two dubious penalties, both scored by the soon-to-be departing Steven Gerrard, claiming a 2-2 draw against last season's Premier League runners up. When else did Liverpool surrender a two-goal lead? Against Newcastle, when Gary Speed and Alan Shearer scored late goals, and Birmingham City after a Clinton Morison brace. Those two, strangely, came within a little more than a week of each other - Newcastle on September 2, 2002, and Birmingham on September 11.

Brendan Rodgers oversaw the third time in Premier League history that Liverpool let a two-goal slip at Anfield . Four referees that may have explained themselves if they were allowed to do so: .

But schadenfreude can be a funny thing. Some of them, so ridiculous, that they were laughable. Take, for example, poor old Wes Morgan. The Leicester City defender takes one to the face from Raheem Sterling, then hears Mike Jones blow his whistle for  a penalty. Referees aren't held accountable for their mistakes in the modern game, and this is where common sense should prevail.

"Praising children with phrases such as ‘well done darling’ may damage their confidence, a leading psychologist has warned. Stephen Grosz claims that comments such as ‘you’re so clever’ or ‘you’re such an artist’ could also hinder their future performance at school. He says that such ‘empty praise’ causes children to be unhappy as they feel they cannot live up to the false expectations. More harm than good: Praising your children can damage their confidence according to a leading psychoanalyst . Instead he advises parents and . teachers to bestow compliments less frequently and use phrases that . congratulate children for ‘trying really hard’. Mr . Grosz – who has practised as a psychoanalyst, a type of psychologist, . for 25 years – said: ‘Empty praise is as bad as thoughtless criticism – . it expresses indifference to the child’s feelings and thoughts. ‘Admiring our children may temporarily lift our sense of self-esteem but it isn’t doing much for a child’s sense of self.’ He also cites research showing that children who were heavily praised were likely to perform worse at school. Psychologists from Columbia University asked 128 pupils aged ten and 11 to solve a number of maths problems . Afterwards, some were told: ‘You did really well – you’re so clever.’ But the researchers told the other group, ‘You did really well – you must have tried really hard.’ Both . groups of children were then given more difficult questions and those . who had been told they were clever did not do as well as the others. In fact, the researchers found they even tried to lie about their results when asked about the experiment. Mr Grosz has written a book about human behaviour, The Examined Life, which includes a  chapter entitled How Praise Can Cause Loss Of Confidence. He says that when collecting his daughter from a nursery near their home in North London, he heard an assistant tell her: ‘You’ve drawn the most beautiful tree. Well done.’ Later, after she had done another drawing, the same assistant said: ‘Wow, you really are an artist.’ In his book, Mr Grosz writes: ‘My heart sank. 'How could I explain to the nursery assistant that I would prefer it if she didn’t praise my daughter?’ He added: ‘If you go to the local nursery you’ll hear this kind of stuff sometimes mixed in with teaching: ‘‘Oh, your drawing looks so like a Miro, darling’’ [the Spanish painter and sculptor]. ‘And so you get this mix of praise and teaching. I find it, to be blunt, aggressive. 'Because it’s saying: I don’t want to  engage with you as a person; I want to just praise you.’ Mr Grosz believes that many adults were heavily criticised when they were young and are now anxious to show they are different. But instead of overpraising children, he said parents should try to build their confidence gently. ‘Just listen to what your child wants to tell you, about what they’re interested in and what they’re passionate about,’ he added.","Stephen Grosz says that praise could hinder children's school performance .

"Figures showing a drop in the number of rape cases referred to the CPS by police were obtained by shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry . The number of rape cases being referred to prosecutors by police is at its lowest level in five years. The figures have prompted fears that adult victims in historic abuse cases are not being taken seriously as officers ‘cut corners’. Police forces in the last financial year sent 5,404 rape cases to the Crown Prosecution Service – over 2,700 fewer than in 2010-11. The drop-off came despite a steady increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in England and Wales over the past five years, from 13,096 in 2008-9 to 17,061 in 2012-13. This drop-off has come despite a steady increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry has voiced her concerns that officers under pressure following budget cuts may be ‘cutting corners’. Ms Thornberry, who uncovered the figures using a written parliamentary question, claimed she had been in contact with rape victims’ charities who said cases were being dropped that could have been sent to the CPS. ‘I think on the face of it this is a very worrying trend,’ she said. ‘The CPS is doing a lot of work on trying to improve the way in which they prosecute these cases and that is to be applauded but if they are not being given the cases to prosecute you have to ask why that is. ‘I don’t know the answer to that. I do though know the police have been subjected to 20 per cent cuts and they are difficult cases to prosecute with vulnerable prosecution witnesses that take a lot of time. ‘I’m seriously concerned that there may be corners being cut.’ She added: ‘The police are under huge pressure to produce results, to get convictions. Targeting cases that are easier to get convictions on, I can understand that. I don’t know whether that is the case or not but I worry that it may be. ‘I’m obviously in close contact with a lot of organisations that help victims and their view is that cases are being dropped that shouldn’t be dropped. ‘There is no further action, they are taking the decision in the wrong way too often. ‘I think that the difficulty is that these cases are hard and you have to have focus and they need resources and they need to be priorities. At a time of stress and strain and cutbacks it is very easy to lose site of the importance of these cases.' The charity Rape Crisis expressed fears the police may not be taking victims of so-called historic abuse cases seriously at a time when public understanding of sexual violence and the number of victims coming forward is at a uniquely high level following the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal and subsequent police investigations. Rape Crisis claimed the number of victims of historic abuse coming forward is at a uniquely high level following the Jimmy Savile scandal and subsequent police investigations . Katie Russell, of Rape Crisis, said what appears to be a decrease in justice for rape victims was ‘counter-intuitive’ and undermined efforts by police forces to improve their handling of such cases. She said: ‘We are certainly across the country seeing anecdotally a rise in particularly survivors of what is sometimes referred to as historic abuse coming forward, either to the police or to support agencies like Rape Crisis. ‘If that’s translating into reduced referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service obviously our fear would be that so-called historical cases and particularly cases where adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse come forward are not being handled as well or sufficiently or taken as seriously as they might be. ‘It seems really obtuse at this current moment which is almost unique arguably in terms of how much public awareness and understanding of sexual violence has been generated over the last year by media coverage of the Savile scandal and the subsequent Yewtree investigation and other similar cases. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker admitted he was concerned by the fall in number of referrals . ‘It would seem quite counter-intuitive that that period coincides with what essentially, certainly seems at first-glance a reduction in the levels of criminal justice for survivors so it is certainly a concern.’ Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker admitted he was concerned by the fall in number of CPS referrals. He said the Government had already met with the Director of Public Prosecutions and police leaders and agreed to establish a CPS-police scrutiny panel to look at how forces are dealing with rape cases. Mr Baker said: ‘Police reform is working and crime is down. However, I am determined to drive through the government’s commitments to improve the criminal justice system’s response to rape, to encourage more victims to seek help and to bring more perpetrators of these terrible crimes to justice and to push up level of convictions. ‘The government is concerned by the falls in referrals from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service, which is why we held a round-table with the director of public prosecutions and national policing leads. ‘A number of actions are now being taken forward including establishing a joint CPS-police scrutiny panel to review whether there is different local practice in the way rape cases are referred. ‘I take this area of work very seriously.’ The total number of rape-flagged cases . referred to the CPS by police forces in England and Wales for a charging . decision in each of the last five years is as follows: . The CPS figures were released by Solicitor General Oliver Heald in . response to a parliamentary question from shadow attorney general Emily . Thornberry.

"Whether you suffer hangovers is, in part, determined by your genes, a team of scientists has discovered . Whether or not you will fall victim to a monumental hangover after a night out drinking is, in part, determined by your genes, scientists have revealed. While the speed at which a person drinks, whether they eat before embarking on a drinking session and their tolerance for alcohol plays a part, a team of researchers believe a person's DNA will account for almost half of the reason as to why they are afflicted the morning after. The study examined links between the number of hangovers each individual reported experiencing in a year, and their genetic make-up, Live Science reported. The team studied more than 4,000 adults from the Australian Twin Registry to reach their conclusions. Their findings found genetic factors accounted for 45 per cent of the difference in hangover frequency in women and 40 per cent in men. Furthermore, the scientists discovered that those people who had the genetic variants involved in increasing the risk of suffering a hangover, also drank to excess more regularly than those lacking the hangover genes. They concluded that those genes, which dictate how often a person is struck by a hangover, may also control how frequently they get drunk. As a result, it is hoped the findings could help contribute to future research on alcohol addiction, researchers say. Study leader, Wendy Slutske, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said: 'We have demonstrated that susceptibility to hangovers has a genetic underpinning. 'This may be another clue to the genetics of alcoholism.' She said those who are less susceptible to a hangover, might be more prone alcohol addiction. The participants of the study revealed how many times they had got drunk in the last year, along with how frequent their hangovers were - telling researchers the number of days in the previous year they felt sick the day after drinking. And the twins taking part reported their 'hangover resistance' - whether or not they had ever experienced a hangover after getting drunk. The team of researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia studied more than 4,000 adults on the Australian Twin Registry to examine the link between genes and hangovers. File picture . Scientists found a strong link between identical twins in reports of hangover frequency and resistance, suggesting there are genetic similarities that play a part in determining if a person will fall victim to a hangover. 'With drinking alcohol, it is not ""one size fits all"",' Professor Slutske said. 'People are different in their ability to consume alcohol without experiencing adverse consequences, such as having a hangover.' Professor Slutske's team did note their study was limited because people's memories of their drinking habits, may not have been totally accurate.","Study of Australian twins reveals genes are partly to blame for whether you will suffer a hangover the morning after a night out drinking .

"Jeffrey Zients, a former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, is in charge of a 'tech surge' meant to turn the failed Obamacare website into a success in a single month . 'Healthcare.gov is fixable,' a former White House official tasked with resurrecting the disastrous Obamacare website assured reporters on Friday. Jeffrey Zients, once the acting director of the Obama administration's Office of Management and Budget, is now a management consultant. The White House brought him in this week to evaluate the website's woes and coordinate a plan to fix it. ZIents' team has tapped Quality Software Services Inc, or QSSI, as its systems integrator – the company responsible for overseeing the entire project. That job was previously done by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that arguably botched the job of coordinating 55 contractors' work and supervising the website's testing. The result has left Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius with egg on her face while she faces Republicans' calls for her to step down. 'I didn't realize it wouldn't be operating optimally before the launch,' she told reporters in Texas on Friday. 'We knew if we had another six months, we’d probably test further.' NBC News reported that she made the comments while on a tour of East Austin Health Center where she watched counselors help people struggling to use Healthcare.gov. Now, Zients explained, 'we are appointing what you can think of as a general contractor to manage the overall effort. There will be a relentless focus on speed and execution.' But QSSI might not inspire confidence since it's one of the primary contractors that was already on the job and contributing to the failed project. The Department of Health and Human Services has already paid it $85 million for work on the website. Andrew Slavitt, a VP with QSSI's parent company, told a congressional panel that software problems with Healthcare.gov were all the government's fault, and now his company will add to its $85 million haul with a bigger contract . Healthcare.gov has never worked as advertised, and is so fraught with bugs and glitches that only 3 out of 10 users who get past the registration bottleneck can then sign up for insurance . For that money, QSSI built the data hub that shared applicants' information with insurance companies, the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services. It also created the computer engine that registers individual consumers before they actually apply for insurance. That feature created the most visible Internet-traffic bottleneck during the first two weeks following the public launch of Healthcare.gov. In congressional testimony on Thursday, Andy Slavitt, the executive vice president of QSSI's parent company, blamed that problem on the government, saying the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) saddled QSSI with a 'late decision' to prohibit potential customers from seeing prices up-front. 'This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously,' he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee. That feature has since been rolled back, following widespread complaints by Republicans that the White House erected the barrier in order to prevent Americans from experiencing 'sticker shock,' and to collect personal information from website visitors whether or not they eventually enrolled in an Obamacare plan. In a Web video published during the summer, the Dept. of Health and Human Services insisted it was delivering Obamacare, and its insurance exchange website, 'on schedule' -- but meeting the deadline came with a steep cost in quality control . Tech bugs with Healthcare.gov aren't limited to the sign-up process: Data files getting to insurance companies are often flawed as well . QSSI did not respond to phone calls seeking comment about its suitability to oversee a failed project it had already contributed to. In a brief statement, it said, 'Working with CMS, QSSI will help monitor, assess, prioritize and manage the technical operations of Healthcare.gov to enhance the consumer experience.' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has seen calls for her resignation growing in number since the Oct. 1 botched rollout of insurance exchanges under the new federal health care law . Zients said during his conference-call briefing that he expected great things. 'By the end of November, the vast majority of consumers will . be able to successfully and smoothly enroll through Healthcare.gov,' he . said. That may be a tall order. In addition to Web traffic-related roadblocks, much of the data coming through the Healthcare.gov data hub to individual insurance companies is arriving in a garbled state, officials have admitted. In some cases, minor children have been wrongly identified as spouses. In another, a man;s data sheet reported that he had three wives. Subscribers may not know those mistakes are in an insurer's computer system until they actually use their policies and create chaos for doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. As it is, Zients claimed that 90 per cent of website visitors can successfully create an account on the site, but conceded that actually applying for an insurance plan was a 'volatile' process in which only 30 per cent succeed. CMS has reported that more than 700,000 accounts have been created since Oct. 1 on Healthcare.gov and individual states' health insurance exchange websites. But new concerns are emerging that a majority of those accounts may be used to enroll in Medicaid, not to purchase insurance plans. The federal government isn't scheduled to release actual insurance enrollment numbers until mid-November.","QSSI built registration bottleneck and data hub that is transmitting mangled enrollment data to insurers, collecting $85 million .

Kevin and Melissa Woods were angered after they found that their daughter, an 11th grade student at La Plata High School in Maryland, had been given a three page exercise examining Islam’s five pillars . Woods and his wife Melissa asked the school to give their daughter an alternative assignment, but were told that she either do the assignment or receive a zero grade . ‘We’re not teaching religion, we’re teaching world history,’ school spokesperson Katie O’Malley-Simpson told Fox News. She alleges that Wood was threatening to cause a disruption, which is why he was issued a no-trespass order last Thursday after a telephone call with the school’s vice principal Shannon Morris. ‘I told her straight up “you could take that Muslim-loving piece of paper and shove it up your white a**,’” Kevin Wood told SoMd. ‘If [students] can’t practice Christianity in school, they should not be allowed to practice Islam in school.’ Wood, a former corporal with the U.S. Marine Corps, where he was enlisted for eight years, denies that he had issued any threats.

"While some women can enjoy multiple orgasms a day, others can struggle to hit the spot. Now a machine that claims to deliver an orgasm at the push of a button has been patented in the U.S., but in order to tap into such convenient pleasure, there is some pain. The machine is designed to be a medical implant and includes an implant a little smaller than a packet of cigarettes, requiring an operation. It uses electrodes to trigger an orgasm. A machine that claims to deliver an orgasm (illustrated) at the push of a button has been patented in the U.S. that could one day be used to treat women with orgasmic dysfunction . A remote control could be used by an individual to send a signal to the implant. It would stimulate nerves with electrical pulses to trigger an orgasm. Contacts would have to be surgically inserted into certain nerves in the spinal cord. A signal generator would also have to be fitted under a patient's skin - possibly in their buttocks. Its creator hopes the box of tricks could be used to treat women with orgasmic dysfunction. Jim Pfaus, who studies the neurobiology of sexual behaviour at Concordia University in Montreal told New Scientist: ‘Some women confuse what's called sympathetic arousal, like increased heart rate, clammy hands, nerves and so on, with fear. That makes them want to get out of the situation.’ While Psychotherapy is a common treatment, the implant could ‘solve’ the condition using a more manual approach. A patient would remain conscious during an operation to fit the implant, where a surgeon will pinpoint the correct nerves to which to fit the electrodes in a patient's spinal cord. They would connect to a signal generator - just smaller than a packet of cigarettes - that could be implanted under the skin of a patient’s buttocks. The idea is that the implant could be triggered by a hand-held remote control, delivering orgasms at the push of a button – and it could even be programmed to deliver a number of orgasms per week or per day. A patient would remain conscious during an operation to fit the implant, where a surgeon will pinpoint the correct nerves to which to fit the electrodes in a patient's spinal cord (illustrated) Orgasmic dysfunction is when a woman either can't reach orgasm, or has difficulty reaching orgasm when she is sexually excited. Around 10 to 15 per cent of women have never had an orgasm. Surveys suggest that between 33 per cent and 50 per cent of women are dissatisfied with how often the reach orgasm, according to Medline Plus. Current treatments include: cognitive behavioural therapy and practical education. But details have yet to be decided and clinical trials are set to begin later this year. Stuart Meloy, a surgeon at Piedmont Anaesthesia and Pain Consultants in Winston-Salem, North Carolina is behind the technology and came up with the idea by accident. ‘I was placing the electrodes and suddenly the woman started exclaiming emphatically,’ he said. ‘I asked her what was up and she said, “You're going to have to teach my husband to do that.”’ Mr Meloy has not yet tested the device on men, but said there is no reason to think that it could not be used to achieve the same result. A Minneapolis-based company called Medtronic is set to conduct the medical trials but Mr Meloy said that the treatment is intended to be used in the most serious cases of orgasmic dysfunction because it is as invasive as a pacemaker. However, Dr Pfaus said that as teenagers currently endure painful operations to enlarge their breasts, they are likely to endure invasive surgery to reach orgasm more easily.

"CLICK HERE to see all the stats, goals and heatmaps from our brilliant Match Zone . The fat lady hasn't started to sing yet. She’s barely warming up. And Jose Mourinho knows football can be a cruel mistress. Arsene Wenger discovered that this time last year when Arsenal were top of the Barclays Premier League by four points and, eventually, they self destructed. Chelsea find themselves in similar surroundings. They are six points clear of Manchester City and the seventh club in Premier League history to go unbeaten in their opening 14 games. Of the others, three went on to become champions, the rest failed. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chelsea players celebrate Eden Hazard's goal against Tottenham that has maintained their unbeaten start . Blues boss Jose Mourinho has a history of winning silverware in his second season in charge . The Portuguese is hoisted in the air after winning La Liga in his second year with Real madrid . CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail columinists Jamie Redknapp and Martin Keown's views of the two-horse title races . It’s a good start but that’s about all it is, despite Mourinho’s mantra proving a hit once more. The Chelsea manager has a history of producing his best work not in the first year, but the second. At Porto and Inter Milan, Mourinho won the Champions League in his second season. At Real Madrid, the Portuguese manager beat Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering Barcelona to the La Liga title. At Chelsea, he is projected to break their own Premier League record of 95 points, perhaps scoring more than a century. They currently have 36 points with a hypothetical 72 to play for in this, Mourinho’s second season at Stamford Bridge following a third-place finish behind Liverpool and Manchester City respectively last year. High flying Chelsea are on course to beat Jose Mourinho's record points haul of 95 . Chelsea players take part in a training session ahead of their next Premier League game with Newcastle . It can be no coincidence. Mourinho, too, acknowledges having a year to settle in, to make his mark, to get his squad playing the way he feels best. ‘I think the second season is a privileged place to have the team in very good conditions,’ he said in September 2014. ‘There are teams and managers who work 10 or 15 years with the same team, and step by step with conditions to improve all the time. ‘But I think the second season is a good space for evolution, for improvement and for the team to be in the right condition.’ Diego Costa (centre) and Cesc Fabregas have arguably been the best signings of the summer . Costa has given Chelsea the prolific striker they needed after Fernando Torres' (left) struggles in west London . Didier Drogba has turned back the clock by scoring goals on his return to Stamford Bridge . So, what makes them such an unbeatable force this year compared to last? Can it really come down to something as simple as the new blood? Five players in - Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Didier Drogba, Loic Remy and Filipe Luis - at a cost of £88.3million, almost half of which was paid for by getting rid of David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain. Not to mention the return of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois from Atletico Madrid and Nemanja Matic in January, too. The hype has firmly surrounded Costa. The 26-year-old has single-handedly lifted the curse of Chelsea strikers at Stamford Bridge, bringing 11 goals to the Premier League in 916 minutes, seven of which were scored after his first four games. Hence the excitement when calculations revealed it took Fernando Torres 43 games to match that same total. Instant approval. Drogba and Remy, too, have proved suitable back-up, as Mourinho reiterated in an I-told-you-so kind of way after a goal apiece against Tottenham Hotspuron Wednesday night. Fabregas has been an inspiration and has already racked up 10 assists so far this season . Nemanja Matic (left) provides the steel to accompany Fabregas' silk in Chelsea's midfield . Matic's heat map against Sunderland - he became one of the first players to cover 100 miles in the league . But those behind are the workhorses. Fabregas has contributed 10 assists this year and, as the record stands at 20 by Thierry Henry, the Chelsea midfielder is well on his way to surpassing the total of his former Arsenal team-mate. Fabregas, much to the annoyance of Wenger, averages twice as many touches per game than his fellow signings. Again, it can be no coincidence. If that doesn’t outline the 27-year-old’s tirelessness, then this might: he and midfield partner Matic officially became the first players this season to cover more than 100 miles on the pitch. All this is not to say there aren't times when Chelsea can come unstuck and they have to rely on a smidgen of fortune. Take, for example, their 0-0 stalemate against Sunderland. Gus Poyet’s blueprint to halt the Mourinho train worked to perfection, namely because he starved Chelsea’s midfield and service to Costa, who was driven to distraction by John O’Shea. John O'Shea tackles Costa - Sunderland are the only team to have stopped Chelsea scoring in the league . Fabregas ran the show against West Brom (left) but he was comparatively nullified by Sunderland (right) Chelsea are the seventh team in Premier League history to remain unbeaten after the opening 14 games. Here's the previous best unbeaten runs, and how the team's fared... Arsenal (2003-04) – 38 games, won the league . Man Utd (2010-11) – 24 games, won the league . Arsenal (2007-08) – 15 games, did not win the league . Man City (2012-13) – 15 games, did not win the league . Man City (2011-12) – 14 games, won the league . Liverpool (2007-08) – 14 games, did not win the league . They came as close a side have to ending Mourinho's record. 'We played to win against a team that defended with nine players. It’s a critique. It’s just to be objective about their strategy. We couldn’t break them,’ Mourinho analysed afterwards. Fabregas managed 94 per cent completion with 153 passes against West Bromwich Albion previously. At the Stadium of Light, he was down to 88 per cent with just 112 as Sportsmail’s Match Zone shows. Sunderland shut Chelsea down for 90 minutes and escaped with a hard-earned point. Others are likely to try the same, which may be why Mourinho feels going 38 not out is unthinkable. Still, Chelsea look a far cry from the team that ‘parked the bus’ under Roberto Di Matteo against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final of 2012. They no longer turn to that strategy, even though the wheels never fell off. They won the final at the Allianz Arena in Munich against Bayern, spoiled the German party, and Di Matteo went his own way. Chelsea have not had to revert to the spoiling tactics that brought them victory over Barcelona in 2012 . Oscar is one of several players who have contributed to Chelsea's 33 league goals this season . But there’s a new approach this year, a more direct one at that by Mourinho. Chelsea make 53 more passes per game on average these days. They have a better completion rate, are opting for shorter passes, are more clinical in the final third and, to be blunt, know they can score more than the opposition on their day. The averages just keep rising. Their goals per game has shifted from 1.87 to 2.36, their shot accuracy has gone from 45 per cent to 54, and they are yet to concede a goal through an error. Despite their impressive record even Mourinho has said that going the whole season unbeaten is 'impossible' They have 33 goals in 14 matches through Costa, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar and Co, having scored 71 in total last year. Chelsea dominate the game, dictate it to their liking, and Tottenham were the latest to come to terms with that. Sure, there is a degree of luck. In football there always is. But Chelsea are a whole different component this year to last, as Mourinho continues to prove why his second time around is far better than the first.

"Gabriel Paulista will follow in the footsteps of Martin Keown and Steve Bould after he was handed the No 5 shirt at Arsenal. Gabriel, the 24-year-old Brazilian, was granted a work permit despite not yet having played for his country and joined the Gunners from Villarreal for an £11.2 million fee on Wednesday. And Arsenal have confirmed that he will wear the No 5, vacated by former club captain Thomas Vermaelen who joined Barcelona in the summer. Gabriel Paulista completed his £11.2million switch from Villarreal to Arsenal on  Wednesday . The 24-year-old will wear the No 5 shirt, the north London club confirmed on Thursday . Gabriel, who will earn a basic salary of around £60,000-a-week at the Emirates, admitted that playing in the Premier League was a dream come true and revealed that he joined Arsenal after a personal request to sign by Wenger. 'I came on his request, on the coach’s request,' he told the club's website. 'He asked to sign me and that gives me more strength and the will to be able to work. I see that he’s a coach that has been here for many years and this is important, not only for the team but also for the club. This is very important for everyone that works here in the club, to have a coach like this.' Despite the praise for his new boss, Gabriel also sees signs that Arsenal need to get better and improve on their performances so far this season. The 24-year-old defender was granted a work permit despite earlier fears it would be rejected . Sportsmail's Martin Keown and Kolo Toure have both worn the No 5 at Arsenal . 'The few games I have watched and witnessed, during the season, I saw that there is room for improvement,' he said. 'We have a lot to conquer because Arsenal is a very big club, we must always be at the top. I think it’s a club that will keep growing throughout the season, and that over the next few years we will be able to win important titles.' Gabriel will primarily compete with the likes of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker for a place at centre-half, a task he admits is 'not going to be easy' - but he can also play on the right or left side of the backline. 'I am very anxious and that is something that is normal to a young player, playing at such a high level,' he added. 'So I am very anxious to be able to start at this huge, beautiful stadium, a stadium that the fans come to, to be able to support us. It’s something I’ve always noticed when I watch Arsenal.' He was an ever-present in the Yellow Submarine's defence until being left out of the squad to face Levante last Saturday, with his move to the Emirates Stadium at an advanced stage. 'I came from a club that is not that big in Brazilian football (Esporte Clube Vitoria),' said Gabriel. 'I went to Spanish football and that was another dream come true, to play in Europe. 'A while ago I had a really huge desire to play in the Premier League, so since that point I put it in my head that I really wanted to do it. I had a talk with my family and I told them that it was my dream to play in the Premier League. Getting here to such a big club is so gratifying. 'I am arriving at a big club and the fans can expect to find a Gabriel with a great will to help everyone. Not just thinking of me as an individual, because to me that is not important. 'I care more about helping the team and my team-mates. I want to help everyone, so the fans can expect a Gabriel that on the field has a lot of will to be able to help the team win important things.'","Gabriel Paulista will wear the No 5, the Gunners confirmed on Thursday .

"An explosive new coroner's report reveals Hollywood star Natalie Wood sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body on her yacht before she went overboard and drowned in 1981. The new development suggests that foul play could have been involved in Woods' death and that she didn't accidentally fall overboard on her 60-foot yacht - as the original police investigation concluded. The new coroner's examination asserts that bruises found on the actress' face, wrists, knees, and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not, as the 1981 report concluded, as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side. Those bruises could have been 'non-accidental,' the medical examiner postulated. Refusal: Robert Wagner (left) has refused requests by detectives to be interviewed as part of a fresh investigation into the death of his wife Natalie Wood (right) in 1981 . Party: Ms Wood, Mr Wagner and actor Christopher Walken were aboard the boat - along with captain Dennis Davern (right) when she disappeared and drowned . Beaten: Ms Wood, seen here in 1962, had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten, according to a new coroner's report released in January . CBS News reports that the document pokes numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death was accidental - however it stops short of calling her death a homicide. The network also claims the Los Angeles County Coroner's new report indicates she was possibly assaulted aboard the yacht. Wagner's publicist, Alan Nierob, told MailOnline he would not comment on the report. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that Wood's husband, Robert Wagner, was with her right up until she went overboard. Her death was ruled 'accidental' at the time, but in 2012, the coroner changed the ruling to 'undetermined.' The coroner's office says in the new report that there is not enough evidence at this time to rule on the manner by which Wood died. However, the report plays special attention to the bruises found on Wood's body. 'The location of the bruises, the multiplicity of the bruises, lack of head trauma, or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water,' the report states. Fatal: This is the yacht Splendor that Ms Wood and Mr Wagner were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off Santa Catalina Island over Thanksgiving weekend in 1981 . Dangerous: Ms Wood reportedly could not swim. Her body was found floating in the water near Catalina Island hours after she went overboard . Tragic: New information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that Ms Wood's death was accidental (pictured here with Mr Wagner) Confession: Dennis Davern, the skipper of the yacht, says he lied to police about what happened the night Wood drowned . 'Since there are unanswered questions . and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined . by this Medical Examiner that the manner of death should be left as . undetermined,' Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran . wrote in the report completed in June. Wagner has told investigators that . Wood, who could not swim, must have fallen in the water when she got up . to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the . yacht. He is not considered a suspect by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. Wood's body was found to have a blood . alcohol content of 0.14 percent, nearly twice the legal limit for . driving. She was also found to be under the influence of a motion . sickness medication and a painkiller, which likely increased her level . of intoxication. Her body was found floating off Catalina Island, near Los Angeles, several hours later. The . captain of the yacht, Dennis Davern, claimed that a fight had broken . out between Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, who was also aboard to . yacht. He said that after Wood went to bed, he heard the fight continuing in her cabin, including sounds of a physical struggle. Mr Davern claims Wagner waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities. Wood, 43, burst into child stardom in 1947 playing little Susie, the girl who didn't believe in Santa Claus, in 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Wood later starred as Maria in 1961's 'West Side Story' and was nominated for an Oscar for her role opposite James Dean in 'Rebel Without a Cause.' Wagner, now 82, admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of November 28, 1981, but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed. He maintains he had nothing to do with her death, though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her. However, Davern reportedly offered an alternate explanation for Wood's death. Lana Wood, the actress' young sister, claimed to author Suzanne Finstad that Davern called her and drunkenly confessed that Wagner allowed his wife to drown. 'He said it appeared to him as though (Wagner) shoved her away and she went overboard. Dennis panicked and (Wagner) said, ""Leave her there. Teach her a lesson."" Dennis said he was very panicky that he was sitting and (Wagner) kept drinking and kept drinking. ‘And he’d say, ""Come on, let’s get her."" And he said (Wagner) was in such a foul mood, at that point, that he then shut up and was waiting for when, when are they gonna go to her rescue, until all the sound stopped,’ Lana is heard telling Finstad in recordings make for her 2001 book Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood. Lana continues on to say that Davern did not think that Wagner meant for Wood to die but he did not ‘run to her aid.’ 'Even if he did not kill her, which is what I understand the guy’s saying, it was – you know, that it – it was an accident,' Lana said. The setup: On November 28, 1981, the 60-foot yacht Splendor set out for Santa Catalina Island, a rocky island off the coast of California, 22 miles from Los Angeles. Aboard were Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood and the boat's skipper, Dennis Davern. The couple also brought Wood's newest costar, Christopher Walken, to celebrate their successful completion of filming for 'Brainstorm,' a science fiction thriller. Wood, Wagner and Walken departed the yacht and rode a dingy to shore, where they had dinner at Harbor Reef Resultant on the island. Waitresses reported that all three Hollywood actors drank heavily - mostly champagne - and were rude and boisterous. Witnesses say all three were very intoxicated about 10.15pm when they piloted the dingy back to the yacht, which was anchored offshore. Exactly what happened after the three returned to the boat remains a mystery. The tragedy: Wood's body was found floating in the water about a mile from the yacht about 8am on November 29 and the coroner determined that she had died of a combination of drowning and hypothermia. Her blood alcohol level at the time was . 0.14percent - nearly twice the legal limit for driving. She also had . motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system, which likely . increased her level of intoxication. The time of death is estimated at about midnight at on November 29. 'The fact that her stomach contained 500 cc of partially digested food material supports that opinion of that time of death being around midnight, especially given the information that dinner was consumed between 8 and 9pm,' according to the new report. However, Wood was not reported missing until 1.30am - fully 90 minutes after she went overboard, according to an interview with the manager of the restaurant on shore.","Natalie Wood had bruises on her wrists, knees and ankles that could have been 'non accidental,' corner's report finds .

"Apple iPhone 5S users take note – even when your phone battery dies, the handset can still track your every move. This is because when a battery dies, the phone keeps a small amount of power in reserve, meaning its low-energy chip can carry on collecting data from built-in motion sensors. It can’t track location, however, but it can reveal how many steps a user takes, or establish whether a phone was still being carried around when used with select, third-party apps. Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured, can track movements even when its battery dies. The feature was highlighted by Reddit user Glarznak.

"When Saracens and Harlequins resume hostilities on Saturday afternoon with a place in the Aviva Premiership final at stake, the match will serve as a high-profile stage for an intriguing leadership duel. England captains past and present will go head-to-head at Allianz Park. Steve Borthwick v Chris Robshaw is the subplot which may go a long way to defining this London derby. These are men who have both encountered turbulence in the glare of public scrutiny, but who are hugely respected within the game and revered as figureheads at their respective clubs. New wave: Incumbent England captain Chris Robshaw leads Harlequins into their semi-final against Saracens . Clash of titans: Former England skipper Steve Borthwick takes his table-toppers into the match as favourites . Both wield considerable influence, though their careers are at very different stages. Borthwick is two or three games from retirement; the uncertainty reflecting the winner-takes-all nature of this play-off for a place at Twickenham. For Saracens’ 34-year-old second-row forward, the end of this season could see a glorious climax to a decorated career. For 27-year-old Robshaw, much lies ahead. As the incumbent England captain, he reinforced his status during an impressive Six Nations campaign to banish the uncertainty which had previously stalked him in the role. If Robshaw leads Quins to May 31’s Premiership final, England coach Stuart Lancaster will appoint a stand-in leader for the Test series opener against New Zealand in Auckland, but the armband will be Robshaw’s again when he is available. So what of this semi-final match-up? One . man with a unique perspective is Lewis Moody, who  succeeded Borthwick . as England captain in 2010 and preceded Robshaw in the job. Head-to-head: Robshaw (left) and Borthwick (right) wield great influence on the field for their clubs . Bookends: Lewis Moody succeeded Borthwick and preceded Robshaw in leading England onto the field . ‘Steve as a . captain is very similar to his character... very intense and meticulous . in his preparation, certainly when it comes to the line-out and . restarts,’ said Moody. Intense: Borthwick's athleticism around lineouts and restarts is second to none . ‘Those are his specialist areas. His athleticism in those areas is still second to none. In terms of his work on the pitch, he is a pivotal figure for  Saracens. I don’t think you can compare the two in terms of the work they get through, because Chris’s impact on the game in that way is far more significant than Steve’s, but Steve is still a crucial figure. ‘He makes all the decisions and is the character who drives standards. You could see Chris’s impact last weekend in the game against Bath when he was man of the match. He just gets through so much work. ‘He’s not always the stand-out player and he’s not the guy who is going to make a 50-metre break, but he will give 100 per cent in every match. He’s so valuable to the teams he plays in.’ There is a perception that both Borthwick and Robshaw can be categorised as players who lead by understated example, but Moody suggested that  there are clear variations in their approach. ‘It will be a great battle between two contrasting individuals,’ he said. ‘Steve is more of a talker and has been a leader for a long time now. When he was England  captain I thought he was quite unlucky, because he actually did a brilliant job, as he does now for Saracens. ‘He understands the game and the areas that he can influence. Workrate: Robshaw may not always be the standout but his impact on games is remarkable, says Moody . ‘He is certainly  not a Lawrence Dallaglio, full of bravado, but his character has changed as captain over the years and these days he seems to be more vocal. If things go wrong he’s the one pointing the finger and he also antagonises the opposition. ‘If either is the lead-by-example type, it is Robshaw. He’s not really an orator but you can definitely see his confidence has grown in the role during his tenure with England. ‘He is making decisions quickly without relying on the other leadership guys around him so much. He is clear in his own mind now. I think he learned a massive amount from the tough times he went through after games against Australia and South Africa a couple of years ago. He has really developed as a captain and makes good decisions now.’ Borthwick is often damned with faint praise, despite ringing endorsements from those he works with. He is regarded as a work-horse and a player’s player, limited to low-key endeavour, but Saracens are diminished without him, as are Quins without Robshaw. ‘All the stats can be irrelevant,’ said Moody. ‘Especially at club level, there are individuals in a team who are absolutely intrinsic to its success. A good example of that is Bath’s captain, Stuart Hooper. He is never the stand-out player but that team wouldn’t be where they are without him driving standards, performance and attitudes. Not so long ago: Borthwick in a muddied England kit alongside James Haskell in 2010 . From the front: Robshaw leads Quins and England by example having proved himself worthy of the role . ‘Guys like Steve and Stu really set the standard but that is something that might not be recognised by people outside the club.’ Robshaw’s challenge was to convince sceptics he was the best candidate to wear England’s No 7 shirt. He has tackled that task with defiant gusto, in the same way that a previous, acclaimed openside for the national team once did. ‘Early on, he wasn’t considered really to be an international player and he used that frustration a bit like Neil Back did,’ said Moody. Robshaw has great admiration for his adversary today - praising Borthwick’s enduring influence, longevity and professionalism, and the way he recovered from some tough times with England. ‘I made my England debut under Steve,’ he said. ‘He is a brilliant captain and a brilliant man. There haven’t been many line-out operators as good and to play at the top level for as long as he has shows what a good player he has been. ‘He was involved with England when things weren’t going so well but he has come through that and gone on to win the Premiership with Saracens. Now he’s about to play in a Heineken Cup final. ‘I have a huge amount of respect for what he has achieved.’ That respect will be shelved for 80 minutes this afternoon. For all their respective qualities, only one fine leader can survive this knock-out showdown.","Saracens host Harlequins on Saturday in the second Premiership semi-final .
The winner faces Northampton Saints in the final on May 31 at Twickenham .
Borthwick and Robshaw are hugely influential players for their sides .
Sarries captain Borthwick will retire after the Heineken Cup against Toulon on May 24 or the Premiership final should they beat Quins .
Both players overcame criticism to be highly regarded in their roles .
Stuart Lancaster will name a stand-in captain for the first Test in New Zealand, but should Quins lose the semi it will be his again ."
"We are starting to plan the next move for Carl Froch and there are exciting times ahead with a number of options on the table. I sat down with James DeGale last week and I am confident he will fight Carl Froch sooner or later. The question at the moment is when. As you know, he is the mandatory for Carl’s IBF super-middleweight world title and Carl must fight him by the end of February. Carl’s preferred option is Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas in November or December, but I don’t think that is going to happen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James DeGale discuss taking on Carl Froch . Job done: Carl Froch celebrates his win over George Groves at Wembley in May . VIDEO Carl Froch vs George Groves II highlights . In line? DeGale is the mandatory for Carl¿s IBF super-middleweight world title . The big one: Froch would rather fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) in Las Vegas . I have had exploratory conversations with Bob Arum who would like the fight to happen in October so we will see how that plays out. That leaves DeGale and Mikkel Kessler as the realistic options for the end of 2014. Kessler III would be a great fight but we also know the value of a big domestic dust up. Carl is just back from a well-deserved family holiday and is in training for the BBC 1 show ‘Tumble’. The media requests are still coming thick and fast - surely he is a front runner for the Sports Personality award. At this point in his career, he has to select the fight that makes the blood pump and gets you out of bed at the crack of dawn for those tough hill runs. Money as always will be a factor but Carl more than most is driven by the competition and his desire to leave a legacy in the sport. I think DeGale would be a huge fight. It is a domestic fight between a legend of the sport and an Olympic champion who is looking to make history and become the first British gold medalist to go on and win a world title. I think that a fight with Carl and James could be made either this winter, in November or December, or possibly in the Spring. As I said, it is all in Carl’s court but what I do know about him is that he will not willingly vacate a title. He worked hard for his titles, he won’t just give them up. If a fight with Froch doesn’t happen this winter, I will look to get James DeGale a big fight at the O2 Arena on October 11 but all roads lead to Carl Froch. ............................................................................................ I’m a big believer that everything happens for a reason and Callum Smith cruelly missing out on an Olympic place has turned him, in my opinion, into one of the hottest prospects in world boxing. His technique, attitude, skill and power continues to amaze me. He lost in the final qualification tournament in Turkey in a poor decision in a semi-final fight that would have sealed it. A terrible decision. But look what he is doing in the professional ranks now. I am convinced he is going to go on to become one of Britain’s great world champions . People say I overhype him or put too much expectation on him. For a start I know he can handle it. And also I know how special this guy is. He fights again on my July 12 bill in Liverpool in a WBC International super-middleweight title fight and I have a blueprint in mind for getting him to the top. I have never doubted that he can do it. My dad watched his debut fight and afterwards he said to me that he had never seen a debut like it. Belt up: Smith celebrates after his victory over Ruben Costa in February . After 11 professional fights and nine knockouts I already think he could handle himself against the world champions at super-middleweight. I’ve seen him spar Carl Froch and many others - the kid is a class act. He is a beast at the weight – his back is huge – and one day I am sure he will be a light-heavyweight world champion as well. Before that, he has to come through his fight against Valdine Biosse in Liverpool and then I will continue to move up the World rankings in September or October. Realistically, I believe he is 12 to 18 months from a world title shot. His progress warrants that kind of plan but he has to keep winning. He has reached this title level even quicker than Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell, who are both blasting their way through. But Callum has already reached 11 fights, is charging up the rankings and the WBC love him. The building process starts now. Too many quality fighters are promoted poorly on the way up and when they get there, they don’t get the chance to capitalise on it financially. I want him to not only have big fights but fight for millions. He is good enough, exciting enough and has real pay-per-view potential. Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew also have fights on July 12. Neither man can afford a slip up on the night as their rematch later in the year will be a classic. The fingers will be crossed this Saturday hoping they come through against two big bangers and then we can start planning for a huge domestic clash. The warm-up: Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew also have fights on July 12... and neither can slip up . I’m in the process of drawing up a plan for Ricky Burns after his defeat in a WBC world title eliminator against Dejan Zlaticanin. It was a devastating loss and I know Ricky is gutted. One thing I can say with certainty is that no-one is giving up on Ricky. He proved his commitment by coming south of the border to prepare and he is as hungry as any fighter. But we will have to review some things, such as whether he is comfortable at the weight. He is having a holiday at the moment but when he is back I will take him to see our nutritionist and we will see if it is time for him to move from lightweight to light-welterweight. Go again: Nobody is giving up on Scotsman Burns, despite some devastating defeats . Defeated: Dejan Zlaticanin (right) wins the WBC International title over against Burns (left) I have seen him spar at 10st 3lbs and look absolutely ferocious. Then, when he comes down to 9st 9lbs he looks a little too frail. That is definitely something we will look at it. Next up I will put him out on September 13 in Manchester in an eight or 10-round contest. We are going to rebuild his confidence and down the line we will consider where we go. It looks like Scott Harrison might be getting his licence back - that’s a fight Scotland would embrace! After all the waiting we have a date and venue for Kell Brook’s world title shot against Shawn Porter. He will fight on August 16 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. It’s a great venue for Kell to finally win the world title he has been working so hard for. He is ready.

"Rules on GM crops should be overhauled to speed up the development of the technology, Britain’s chief scientist said yesterday. Sir Mark Walport claimed that the regulations, which have so far kept commercial GM cultivation out of Britain, are not fit for purpose and need urgent changes. His backing for the hugely controversial technology came as a report by his committee of scientific advisers risked accusations of arrogance by saying GM opponents had a ‘neurosis’ which ‘boggles the mind’. Rules on GM crops should be overhauled to speed up the development of the technology, Britain¿s chief scientist Sir Mark Walport has said, as he claimed that the regulations 'are not fit for purpose and need urgent changes' Sir Mark insisted that EU rules banning the commercial cultivation of GM crops had to be changed to feed the world. Critics immediately accused the Chief Scientific Adviser of ‘playing a dangerous game’ with the nation’s safety. There are concerns that tampering with genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ – strains which are more resistant to diseases, pests or produce higher yields – could unintentionally damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health. Dr Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘Government advisers are playing a dangerous game with farming and our food. Tougher, not weaker, regulation is essential.’ And Liz O’Neill, of GM Freeze, said: ‘Just because we can do clever things with genetics it doesn’t mean that we should, and it certainly doesn’t mean we should cut corners when it comes to safety.’ One of the authors of yesterday’s report by the Council For Science And Technology, which advises the Government, argued that the debate had been skewed by an anti-GM ‘neurosis’ which has slowed progress. Sir Mark Walport insisted that EU rules banning the commercial cultivation of GM crops had to be changed to feed the world . Genetic scientist Jonathan Jones, who recently developed a blight-resistant potato, said: ‘How anyone could think this is a bad thing boggles the mind. We need to better explain that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the GM method.’ Professor Jones likened current regulation to early cars having to go slowly behind people waving a red flag. He said. ‘The regulation of the technology is not proportionate. It is time to remove the red flags.’ The report, which was produced at the request of the Prime Minister, recommends sweeping reform to the EU’s  regulatory system, with crops licensed in this country in the same way as medical drugs. Sir Mark insisted that he did not want to reduce regulation but instead make it ‘fit for purpose’. He said: ‘We take it for granted that because shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there is no problem. But we have limited agricultural land around the world and in the UK. ‘Climate disruption and population growth are increasing the pressures on food supply. The challenge is to get more from existing land in a sustainable way, or people will go unfed.’ In a letter to David Cameron, he said: ‘We should have confidence in the scientific evidence which concludes that, when properly controlled, GM products are as safe as their conventional counterparts. ‘The longer the EU continues to oppose GM, while the rest of the world adopt it, the greater the risk that EU agriculture will become uncompetitive, especially as more GM crops are commercialised successfully elsewhere.’ All food containing GM ingredients, such as flour or oils, have to be labelled, but meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on GM products do not. Last year a Food Standards Agency study revealed 67 per cent of shoppers want all GM products labelled.","Sir Mark Walport said the country's GM regulations are 'not fit for purpose'

"Breakthroughs in IVF could ‘threaten our humanity’ by prompting parents to demand designer babies, Robert Winston has warned. The fertility pioneer said that he feared a time when the rich could alter the appearance and ability of children by tinkering with their genes. And he claimed a ‘toxic’ climate had been created by the desperation of childless couples and the pace of scientific developments in the booming IVF industry. Warning: British fertility expert Professor Lord Winston warns that recent breakthroughs in IVF treatment technology could encourage gene manipulation of foetuses . Warning of a resurgence in eugenics, the broadcaster and Labour peer said there was a ‘real risk that we could see that kind of attitude in our humanity occurring again’. In the future, he claimed, the rich may be able to pay to have babies with enhanced intelligence, musical ability and strength. Lord Winston’s comments will be hugely controversial among fertility experts, not least because he is a pioneer in IVF treatment and has helped to bring more than 10,000 babies into the world. Medical ethicists last night praised him for speaking out, saying it was refreshing to hear a scientist who ‘saw the bigger picture’ about the potential dangers. But his comments angered fertility groups. They said IVF was a ‘lifeline’ and it was wrong to suggest childless couples were looking to have a designer baby as the vast majority simply wanted a child. Lord Winston, who is instantly recognisable from his TV programmes such as Child of Our Time and The Human Body, told a fertility conference that new genetic screening technologies meant scientists working with IVF needed to be particularly aware of the danger of eugenics becoming more prevalent. Worry: Lord Winston claims the rich may be able to pay to have babies with enhanced intelligence, musical ability and strength . Taking aim at fertility colleagues and patients, he said: ‘One of the problems with our work is that we have been carried away with massive enthusiasms in reproduction. That mixture of enthusiasm and patient desperation is actually a very toxic and heady mixture. It is worthwhile standing back a little from the technologies that we employ. ‘One of the issues of the market is that rich people may well be able to afford, in due course, the kind of enhancement to their genetics that other poor people may not be able to afford.’ The 73-year-old added that a growing market for fertility treatments and pressure to enhance human qualities could mean we ‘end up with a society where some people may actually have something that might threaten our humanity’. Lord Winston, emeritus professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, was delivering a speech at the University of Kent titled Reflections on IVF technology – will we be human in 100 years?. He told fellow fertility experts: ‘The age of eugenics is one that we don’t think of as being important now.’ But he added: ‘In a world where there is conflict, where there is shortage of resources, shortage of water, shortage of food, climate change, I don’t think it is impossible that this is necessarily going to die out.’ IVF scare: Lord Winston, says experts and scientists have been 'carried away'  and that the breakthroughs might threaten 'our humanity' The hugely controversial theory of eugenics suggests that humans can be improved by preventing people with supposedly undesirable qualities or genetic defects from reproducing. Similarly, those seen to have ‘desirable qualities’ should be encouraged to have babies. It has been regarded as a toxic doctrine since it was used by the Nazis to justify a compulsory sterilisation programme, whereby ‘defectives’ were not allowed to reproduce. Josephine Quintavalle, of campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said that IVF gives people the chance to think about having a perfect baby. She added: ‘In many aspects, the opportunities to think about best and better are increasing by the moment.’ Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said: ‘If Lord Winston is saying this, I hope that people take notice. He is someone who is an expert in the area but also someone who sees the bigger picture.’ But Susan Seenan, chief executive of support group Infertility Network UK, said: ‘Most patients just want to have a baby.  They are not looking to have a designer baby.’ She added that to the average patient, IVF is a lifeline – and eugenics is the last thing on their mind. Dr Allan Pacey, the chairman of the British Fertility Society, said he doubts we will ever have the skill to alter complex traits such as musical ability. He added: ‘The law prohibits it, even if it was technically possible. ‘Most infertile couples are desperate for a baby, rather than a specific type of baby, and I don’t see that changing.’","Fertility expert Robert Winston warns against breakthroughs in treatments .

"BBC director general Tony Hall asked KPMG to look into historic golden goodbye deals, but his decision was questioned . The firm investigating the BBC severance deal scandal has spent thousands of pounds wining and dining some of the executives responsible for the most controversial payoffs, it has emerged. The corporation’s official auditor KPMG was asked by director general Tony Hall to look into historic golden goodbye deals following last month’s report by the National Audit Office, which found the BBC handed staff £369million over eight years. But his decision was questioned yesterday after it emerged the company lavished some of the key figures in the scandal with hospitality including concert tickets, champagne and meals at top restaurants. The BBC’s former chief financial officer Zarin Patel, who stepped down last month, accepted concert tickets on at least four occasions from KPMG. Along with human resources director Lucy Adams she also attended a dinner hosted by the firm at a top London restaurant. In 2011, Miss Patel attended a Coldplay concert at London’s O2 Arena as a guest of KPMG associate partner Karen Wightman. The same year, she was their guest at the Royal Opera House. Miss Patel and Miss Adams were jointly responsible for signing off all BBC severance payment deals over £500,000. Miss Adams personally approved some of the most controversial deals including a £1.02million payment to former deputy director general Mark Byford. The BBC's group finance director Beverley Tew has also enjoyed concerts at the firm's expense. She saw blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli in concert and in 2010 she saw Rod Stewart perform at the O2 Arena . Other executives to benefit  from KPMG’s hospitality include Miss Adams’ deputy in the human resources department, Rachel Currie, who was taken to watch a tennis match by the firm. The BBC’s group finance director Beverley Tew has also enjoyed concerts at the firm’s expense. Last year, it took her to a . performance by blind Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli and in 2010 she saw . Rod Stewart perform at the O2 Arena. Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to the head . of the National Audit Office this week asking whether KPMG ‘ought to . have picked up on and highlighted the widespread breach of policies in . the granting of severance payments and wider benefits by the BBC to . departing senior managers.’ He added: ‘I am concerned KPMG might not be a . suitable party to carry out such a review.’ A KPMG spokesman said: ‘An audit only . looks at whether payments have been accounted for and disclosed . appropriately in the financial statements, not whether there have been . any breaches of policy. Occasional proportionate hospitality is a normal . part of working life.’ A . BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC has strict guidelines in relation to . accepting corporate hospitality and no guidelines have been broken. Neither Zarin Patel, Lucy Adams, Rachel Currie or Beverley Tew were . involved in appointing KPMG to undertake the review of severance . payments.’ THE BBC discriminates against Right-wing views by making its online readers aware of the ideological viewpoint of conservative think tanks but not of Left-wing ones, according to a study. The corporation is five times more likely to include a ‘health warning’ pointing to the party affiliation of Right-wing institutions than of those of the Left when quoting their research on its website, the Centre for Policy Studies found. Its journalists are also more likely to refer to Left-wing think tanks as being ‘independent’, implying they are more reliable. Economist Oliver Latham’s Bias At The Beeb report looked only at BBC online articles rather than its TV and radio broadcasts. He said the findings prove the  BBC shows a ‘Left-of-centre slant’ in  its reporting. A BBC spokesman said it provided ‘impartial and independent coverage’ to a quarter of a billion people across the world. He added: ‘The CPS claims to have found bias in the way we describe think tanks. We use descriptions to help our audiences understand more about each think tank and think carefully about the words used.’","KPMG lavished some of the key figures in the scandal with hospitality including concert tickets .

The troops are just some of the 150 soldiers receiving intense safety training at Fort Campbell ahead of their deployment to Liberia, as part of the global fight against the spread of Ebola.

As soldiers prepare to face the deadly virus, it emerged over the weekend that a nurse who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan in Dallas, Texas, had contracted the virus - despite wearing all the correct protective clothing and following safety protocols. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, is currently in a stable condition with the virus in an isolation unit. For military families, the virus is raising a different kind of anxiety than the one they have weathered during 13 years of ground war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 'Ebola is a different problem set that the division hasn't (faced) before,' said Major General Gary Volesky, who will soon head to Liberia along with soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division.

Captain Alex Willard, who was undergoing the training, said the West Africa mission was far different than the kinds of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan than many in the 101st 'probably are more comfortable with'. At Fort Campbell, soldiers listened carefully as instructors spelled out the dangerous of Ebola, which kills nearly half of the people it infects. There are already more than 350 US troops on the ground in West Africa, mostly in Liberia, including a handful from the 101st. That number is set to grow exponentially in the coming weeks as the military races to expand Liberia's infrastructure so it can battle Ebola.

"This has been close to the perfect Test for England. You cannot complain about anything they have done from the start until the end of the fourth day. It was absolutely fitting that Jimmy Anderson should end up with a five-wicket haul on his 32nd birthday and England’s bowlers have been very clever in the way they have used the short ball in this game. In the second Test at Lord’s, they bowled short with the occasional full delivery but here they bowled full with the occasional short one, and that’s the way it is supposed to be. The captaincy of Alastair Cook has been good and he seems to have learned from the mistakes he made against Sri Lanka when he had everyone back. Scroll down for video . Captain marvel: Alastair Cook (left) has skippered well to put England in a commanding position against India . Fitting: James Anderson's 32nd birthday five wicket haul was suiting to the occasion as England dominated . VIDEO We're really hungry for a win - Root . On Wednesday morning he had three slips to MS Dhoni and that showed to Anderson that he could get him out. And the fact that they got the last two first innings wickets quickly meant that Cook did not have to go into bat with a scrambled brain, having been held up by tail-enders for three or four hours. He could run off and focus on his batting. The decision to bat again rather than enforce the follow on was a 50-50 one for me, because I think England would still win had they sent India back in again because the ball was swinging around yesterday morning. If everyone had been fit and firing and all four seamers were contributing, I would have sent them in again but because of the simple need to rest the big two - Anderson and Stuart Broad - because of the drop-off between them and the next two - Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes - it was absolutely the right decision from Cook. Impressive: Moeen Ali (centre) has really improved his spin bowling and is starting to look impressive . Solid: Debutant wicketkeeper Jos Buttler has been magnificent behind the stumps for England . England batted at the right tempo in their second innings. You do not tee off from ball one in a Test match. You have to play yourself in. And the declaration was absolutely spot on too. I would have done it no sooner nor later. Then England showed considerable energy in the field after four long, hot days. For your opening bowler to be able to run in from square leg and pull off a run-out from a direct hit was outstanding, as was the sight of another fast bowler in Jordan taking such a sharp diving catch at slip. There are some real pluses coming out of this game. Moeen Ali’s bowling is getting better and Jos Buttler’s wicketkeeping has been excellent. Hopefully the mental baggage and scarring of the winter is easing and the senior players can go from strength to strength now with the junior ones working around them.

"The true scale of Britain's soft justice system has been laid bare after it emerged 29,000 criminals have avoided prison sentences despite racking up 25 or more previous conditions. Research from the Centre for Crime Prevention revealed how habitual criminals are routinely avoiding jail terms with some even having received 300 or more previous convictions or cautions. Data from Freedom of Information requests shows that almost 112,000 criminals, found guilty of at least their sixth offence in 2012 avoided prison. Only has himself to blame: Authorities had no clue Zinnel concealed his millions at the time of his bankruptcy proceedings, but his desire to get back at his wife got the best of him after he tried reporting her to the FBI. That's when feds first smelled a rat in his money laundering case . More than 55,000 avoided prison despite 15 or more previous offences, 29,000 avoided prison despite 25 or more previous offences and 5,692 offenders avoided prison despite 50 or more previous offences. Peter Cuthbertson, author of the report and Director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'The courts are utterly failing to show they take crime seriously. 'Prison is the only sure way to protect . the public from hardened criminals. The most prolific offenders are . responsible for a growing percentage of all crime, and locking them up . would have a massive impact on the crime rate. How Britain's repeat offenders are dodging prison . 'New Zealand recently fought rising crime by letting criminals know that it is ""three strikes and you’re out"". In Britain, we don’t even have 300 strikes and you’re out.' Northumbria was found to have the softest courts in Britain with 96 per cent of all criminals avoiding prison. Warwickshire came next with 95.5 per cent, followed by Lincolnshire (94.7 per cent) and Dyfed-Powys (94.4 per cent). And contrary . to claims that women are treated more harshly by the courts, male . criminals with either one or two previous convictions or cautions were . found to be more than twice as likely to go to prison. Latest figures for the last week of 2013 show all but 1,561 of the 85,953 prison places were filled, with many jails are breaking point. Last . week we revealed how many criminals avoiding jail had been found . guilty of serious offences including rape, kidnap and arson. Of . almost 200,000 convictions for serious offences, just 52,000 were . jailed and of those only 6,715 were sentenced to more than four years . behind bars. Half of arsonists, burglars, sex . attackers and people convicted of conspiracy to murder, child abduction . and sex with under-13s avoided jail. Among . those walking free from court in 2012 were 736 arsonists, 69 rapists, . 1,177 people convicted of sex assaults, 2,745 fraudsters, 162 who killed . by reckless driving and 77 kidnappers. Only 14 per cent of the 4,659 people convicted of common assault were jailed and fewer than a quarter of . the 615 convicted of cruelty or neglect of children and 27 per cent of . people who caused death by dangerous driving were given prison . sentences. In 2012, 1,354 . people were convicted of arson, of which 618 were given immediate . custodial sentences, including 135 jailed for more than four years. Scott free: The areas of the country with the highest percentage of criminals avoiding prison . Even among those who are jailed, many are given soft sentences of less than six months, including 2,629 burglars, 1,057 fraudsters, 6,838 convicted of assault and 76 robbers. The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in response to a parliamentary question. Justice Secretary Mr Grayling said: 'Since 2010 those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer and we are continuing to overhaul sentencing to ensure that the toughest sentencing measures are available to the courts.'","Northumbria has softest courts in UK with 96% of defendants spared jail .

"While I feel there are plenty of modern bowlers who would be just as at home chucking darts at the Ally Pally as performing at Lord’s, I do feel Sachithra Senanayake is a victim of a haphazard and slightly unfair system. I’d rather see anyone with a suspect action being put on notice and monitored in match situations instead of being sent to the laboratory. Tell them they’re being watched and get them to bowl in short-sleeved shirts so the umpires can see exactly what they need to. If umpires continue to report any bowler, then they clearly have a case. A victim? Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake has been reported but is not the only bowler with a suspect action . I am thrilled by the response of many English batsmen to the opportunities in international cricket this season and it will be fascinating to see who the new panel of selectors go for when they name their first Test team. There’s one name I haven’t seen mentioned much but which really should be in the frame. Adam Lyth is the best I’ve seen this season. He’s solid, unflappable and confident and if I were England I would get this Yorkie in. You know what they say about a strong Yorkshire? If you don’t, they’ll soon tell you. Lyth spirit: Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth should be talked about for England .","Sri Lankan the victim of unfair and haphazard system .

"It is extraordinary to me that, after Jos Buttler had graced Lord’s with a quite magnificent century, England captain Alastair Cook should dampen it all down by saying that he’s not ready for Test cricket. I would have no hesitation in throwing Buttler into the first Test at Lord’s next week. This is yet another example of the sort of ‘Englishness’ I’ve seen time and time again where we concentrate on what someone cannot do rather than what they can. And what Buttler can do is absolutely fantastic. Keeping tabs: Jos Buttler remains in the picture for England's Test series against Sri Lanka . Centurion: Buttler scored a stunning ton at Lord's . First choice: Sussex wicketkeeper Matt Prior . I once heard that Marcus Trescothick was not ready before he played Test cricket. And Michael Vaughan. And Ian Bell. And they didn’t do too badly when they were given their chance. It was interesting to me that Peter Moores almost distanced himself from Cook’s comments and I sincerely hope that, if Matt Prior is not fit, England have the courage of their convictions and get Buttler into the team. I will give you two examples of wicketkeepers who were far from the finished article when they were given their chance in Test cricket and went on to become the best their country have produced. Sceptical: England captain Alastair Cook suggested that Buttler was not ready for Test cricket . Differing views: Peter Moores said Buttler remains in the picture for the Sri Lanka Test series . There were question marks over Rod Marsh and Adam Gilchrist when Australia first picked them but they were not concerned about their rough edges, only that they had the potential to be very special performers. As does Buttler. So come on England. Let’s be brave. Let’s be different. Let’s pick Buttler.","Jos Buttler scored stunning century against Sri Lanka at Lord's .
