"Ryan Mason would not still be a Tottenham player if previous managers had their way - knock-backs which have fuelled his determination to succeed under Mauricio Pochettino. A product of the Spurs academy, the midfielder made his debut for the club as a late substitute in the UEFA Cup at they won 1-0 at NEC Nijmegen in November 2008. Remarkably, it took nigh on six years - and loan spells at five different clubs - before finally making his first league appearance for the club, which even more astonishingly came for the 23-year-old as a starter in Saturday's north London derby at Arsenal. Ryan Mason gets stuck into Mesut Ozil during his Premier League debut in the North London derby . The youngster (centre) celebrates his stunning Capital One Cup goal with Andros Townsend and Harry Kane . The 1-1 draw capped a whirlwind week for Mason, which began with playing for the Under-21s at Sunderland and ended at the Emirates Stadium, via a match-changing wonder goal as Nottingham Forest were edged out of the Capital One Cup 3-1. 'It's been a massive week for me with three games in five days,' he said. 'I played for the reserves on Monday, then against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday and here.' That Forest match was just his fifth Spurs appearance and a first opportunity to feature under Pochettino - one which would no doubt have come sooner had it not been for injury curtailing an impressive pre-season. Mason thought 'oh, here we go again' at that point, but was also confident chances would be forthcoming under the former Argentina international after seeing him in action at Southampton. 'I thought his appointment was promising,' he said. 'He's the type of gaffer that if you're training well and playing well then you'll get a chance to play. Mauricio Pochettino cut an animated figure on the touchline during his North London derby debut . Ryan Mason admits he might have left the club if Mauricio Pochettino had not become manager . 'That's important, especially for me as a homegrown lad. 'There are not many managers in the Premier League willing to put homegrown players in and trust them.' That is certainly a marked change from previous regimes, when desire and self-belief was the only thing keeping Mason at White Hart Lane . 'Obviously there have been times when I have questioned whether I would have to move away,"" he said. 'I've had a few opportunities to leave, but I wanted to play for Spurs so bad that I never really wanted to think about leaving. 'I wanted to stay and give it a go and see what happened. Like I said, the change in manager helped me. Jan Vertonghen (no.5) battles for the ball with Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck . Younes Kaboul (right) started alongside Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen at the centre of defence . 'If previous managers were still in charge, maybe I wouldn't be here.' Pochettino was full of praise for Mason after his impressive Premier League debut on a night which saw Jan Vertonghen start alongside Younes Kaboul. There has been talk of the Belgian having a strained relationship with the Spurs boss - suggestions which perplexed the former defender. 'No, no, no,' Pochettino said. 'Maybe because I pick players in different games but any problem with Jan, this is wrong. 'We have a lot of games ahead and need to see and analyse the performance and analyse the situation after the game, maybe tired, maybe some problem, and after you need to manage. We have a strong squad and this is important.'","Ryan Mason made his Premier League debut for Spurs in the North London derby .

"A Ukrainian porn-star is hoping to become the first in her profession to be granted asylum in the European Union because of her job. Anastasia Grishay, who is known by her screen name Wiska, claims that she is being persecuted in her home country because of her work on porn films. She is requesting asylum from the European Union after fleeing to the Czech Republic in 2010 when she was investigated for allegedly producing and distributing pornography. Asylum seeker: Ukrainian adult film actress Anastasia Grishay is requesting asylum in the EU after claiming she was persecuted in her home country of Ukraine for starring in porn . The Czech authorities have rejected her asylum request but Ms Grishay intends to appeal to the European courts. Ms Grishay told The Times: 'I have been given 15 days to leave the country. They don’t care that we can’t go back to Ukraine.' The actress, in her early thirties, claims she was forced to flee Ukraine after welfare officers threatened to take her children into care because her job made her unsuitable to be a 'worthy mother'. Appeal: The actress plans to appeal to the European courts after her request for asylum was denied by the Czech Republic . She added: 'I was left alone with a child, worked as a model in various magazines. When I was asked to star in a porno movie I accepted because I needed the money. I have been trying to explain that I did not do it out of a love for the business but because I had to feed my son.' Ms Grishay now has three children with the youngest born in the Czech Republic. The porn-star is being supported by Femen, a group of Ukrainian feminists who stage provocative demonstrations such as stripping naked outside parliament and cutting down crucifixes.","Anastasia Grishay claims she was persecuted in Ukraine over porn roles .

"U.S. Senator John McCain has blasted President Barack Obama for going 'A-W-O-L' and utterly failing to show leadership in the wake of the attack on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in which 298 were killed yesterday. Instead of heading back to Washington to discuss the crash with his national security team and address the global consequences of the possibility that it was caused by a missile attack launched by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Obama traveled to New York City. He went to New York hours after devoting just 40 seconds to the tragedy at the beginning of a jokey 16-minute speech on transportation in Delaware. 'I don't understand this president ... this is what we used to call in the military A-W-O-L,' McCain told Fox . News. 'There's a direct loss of American lives here . and the president goes to a fundraiser? Help me out.' There has been no confirmation of any U.S. citizens losing their lives in the crash, but a Reuters report filed yesterday amid the confusion claimed that 23 Americans had died. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama greets people waiting for him after he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York on Thursday. Republicans are blasting Obama for heading to New York for fundraisers in the wake of the Malaysian Airlines plane crash . McCain unleashed: The hawkish senator warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russia or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane . Asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity if he agreed with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest that Obama's policies have 'substantially improved the tranquility of the global community,' McCain said with a straight face: 'Wherever there's a fundraiser.' McCain also called the White House 'cowardly' for relying solely on sanctions against Moscow, rather than giving the Ukrainians weapons to help them see off the Russian-backed separatists. The Senator had yesterday predicted that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russian involvement was proven in the outrage. Putin is believed to have been sending weapons to the rebels and the missile launcher that is believed to have blown MH17 from the sky is Russian-made. Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus took Obama to task over attending the fundraisers. He tweeted: 'With all that is going on, the last thing the president should be doing is fundraising right now. Now is a time for leadership'. Last night, Hillary Clinton went further than Obama or any member of the administration, saying that all indications showed the Russian-backed rebels were behind the disaster and that tough action was needed to 'put Putin on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by'. In an interview with Charlie Rose on the PBS network, she said that there should be 'outrage in European capitals' and sanctions against Russia should be stepped up and the Europeans should lessen their reliance on Russian energy. The White House said the president called Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, as well as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, as well as Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, on his flight to New York. Obama offered Razak 'immediate assistance to support a prompt international investigation' during their chat, the White House said in a statement. The president's first call upon landing in New York was to Secretary of State John Kerry, the White House said. He also called his national security team, which includes CIA Director John Brennan and the president's deputy national security advisers, the White House said, and directed them 'to continue offering whatever assistance is necessary to advance the international effort to determine what happened.' Afterward, he proceeded to the two fundraisers he was in New York to attend. Condolences? Obama briefly mentioned the plane crash in eastern Ukraine on Thursday before launching into his prepared remarks and blaming Republicans for slow-walking transportation spending . Lunch as usual: With his national security advisers tracking developments in Ukraine, Obama greeted people at the Charcoal Pit restaurant in Wilmington, Delaware before delivering his speech . While Obama was out raising money for the Democratic Party, McCain was appearing on the news networks, issuing verbal rebukes of both Obama and Russian President Vladmir Putin. 'This . was an airliner headed towards Russian airspace,' the Arizona . Republican said on MSNBC. 'And it has the earmarks – and I'm not . concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an . aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian.' 'If . that's true, this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly . unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are. And there will be . incredible repercussions if this is the case.' 'If . it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly . believing that this is a Ukrainian warplane,' McCain warned, 'I think . there's going to be hell to pay and there should be.' The senator's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds of luggage, airplane sections and even human remains in a nine-mile debris field where the Boeing 777 went down Thursday. He also told host Andrew Mitchell that President Barack Obama has mishandled the Ukraine crisis by going soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin and refusing to arm Ukrainian government forces. 'The United States – it has been insulting in how small and how little help we have given,' he complained. 'I mean, they have been begging us for defensive weaponry [but] we have not given it to them.' He also slammed the White House for the shallowness of economic sanctions the U.S. has pushed on Moscow after Putin annexed a region of Ukraine that was populated mainly by ethnic Russians. Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) talked to Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev after word reached Moscow of the attacked aircraft . Wreckage: Firefighters contained blazes at the site of the crash near the town of Shaktarsk, in rebel-held east Ukraine . 'The sanctions so far in exchange for Crimea have been minuscule,' said McCain. 'These . latest enacted by the Obama administration, I think, are helpful. But . if you ask the Ukrainian government that's struggling, they said they . need weapons [with] which to defend themselves.' McCain went directly after Putin, telling Roll Call that if the plane was fired on by 'separatists, which are also Russian, Vladimir Putin should be paying a heavy price.' Putin on Thursday called the idea of Russian government involvement in the plane's destruction 'stupiditry' and blamed Ukraine. 'This tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land,' he said, at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.' 'And without question, the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.' U.S. officials said Thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. The Associated Press reported that Soviet-era 'Buk' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist fighters.","GOP Senator said only places in the world that are more tranquil because of Obama are those that have fundraisers .

"Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain loves playing in such an attacking Arsenal team - but accepts they will always have to work at keeping it tight at the back. Arsenal recovered from going behind in the north London derby to a breakaway Tottenham goal for Nacer Chadli as Oxlade-Chamberlain's close-range strike secured a 1-1 draw. Arsene Wenger's side, however, had enjoyed plenty of possession and should have been ahead before a lapse in concentration from defensive midfielder Matheiu Flamini allowed Christian Eriksen to snatch the ball and set-up a swift counter. Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slots home the equaliser against local rivals Tottenham on Saturday . Oxlade-Chamberlain accepts it is a part of Arsenal's game which can hurt them, but is worth it for what the Gunners offer going forwards. 'That is the risk you take when you play the way we play football,' said England international Oxlade-Chamberlain. 'We try to take control of games, we like to set the tempo, We send a lot of bodies forward in a positive and attacking fashion and you do leave yourself at times a little bit vulnerable to the counter-attack. Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates netting against Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby at the Emirates . Arsene Wenger's side salvaged a point thanks to Oxlade-Chamberlain's first Gunners goal since February . 'It is just important that when we do, we have got people in the team that are willing to take the responsibility of holding back and being there to stop counter-attacks. 'But, yeah, I do love playing in this team and the style of play that we do, as I think all the players could say. 'We do, though, need to obviously be careful and make sure we are defending at the same time as when we are attacking. 'It is something we have always worked on because it is an area I am sure teams look at to try and break us down, so we have got to be ready for that.' Oxlade-Chamberlain handles the ball last season at Chelsea, which resulted in Kieran Gibbs being sent off . Despite attempts to reason with referee Andre Mariner after Kieran Gibbs was sent-off at Chelsea last season . Arsenal head to leaders Chelsea next weekend, where they were thumped 6-0 last season, in what was Wenger's 1,000th match in charge. Oxlade-Chamberlain, though, insisted that result would not make Arsenal any less cavalier. 'We do understand what happened there last season. Maybe we have got a point to prove there, we know this year we have got to step up in the big games and get some results in them,' he said. 'We are really looking forward to that game and we definitely give Chelsea the respect they deserve, but, at the same time, I have belief in my team-mates and we do in ourselves to be able to go to a place like Chelsea and set the tempo and hopefully take control of the game. 'There will be times in the game I am sure when they have a spell, because they are a top team. 'They are going to have their time, we are going to have ours, we just have to make sure that when we do have our chances we make them count.' Aaron Ramsey of Arsenal holds his leg as he lies on the pitch after picking up an injury against Tottenham . Arsenal were left counting the cost of injuries against Spurs, with captain Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey limping off in the first half, before Jack Wilshere, who suffered a twisted ankle, was replaced for the final 30 minutes. Wenger was at a loss to explain why soft tissue injuries continue to dog his squad. 'I don't know if we really have to look at it because there is no logic there,' said the Arsenal manager. 'It is two players who were not involved in the (cup) game in the week. We had quite a light week for them and we have to analyse what happened to them. I don't understand.'

"The decision to put six Birmingham schools in special measures 'to protect children from extremism' was dismissed as 'plain old Islamaphobia' by a senior teacher at one of the academies today. Lee Donaghy - the assistant head of the city's Park View School  - attacked the way his school had been portrayed by Ofsted inspectors and Government ministers. Appearing in front of MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee this afternoon, Mr Donaghy slammed public 'ignorance' of Islam and false allegations that his school segregated children and allowed extremism to fester. 'There’s been a wilful misrepresentation of things that we’ve done and some things have been outright lies,' he added. His remarks came after education watchdog Ofsted last week published a bombshell report  following allegations of a Trojan Horse plot to radicalise Muslim pupils in British state schools. Scroll down for video . The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in the new inspections . Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils . Tory Lorraine Fullbrook asked Mr Donaghy if he was saying that Ofsted had been 'prejudiced in some way'. Mr Donaghy said: 'Yes.' He also agreed that he had been 'victimised'. The senior teacher added: 'The way the school has been painted in the media has very little resemblance to the school that I work at.' He said: 'There's no school in the country with our intake that achieves better results.' Mr Donaghy did admit that the school 'could have done more to vet' the hate preacher Sheikh Shady Al-Suleiman before he was invited to speak at the school - even though he had allegedly previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'. The teacher said he only spoke about 'time management, preparing for exams and responsibility to community and family', Mr Donaghy said. His remarks came after Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, said 'a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip' in the schools. His report said head teachers had been 'marginalised or forced out of their jobs' by hardline school governors and there was evidence of an 'organised campaign to target certain schools'. Sir Michael described some of the findings as 'deeply worrying and in some ways quite shocking'. Education Secretary Michael Gove said hardline Muslim governors had led an 'organised campaign' to change the character of ordinary state schools. He revealed how one school had played the Muslim call to prayer over loudspeakers in the playground while another had invited hate preacher Sheikh Shady Al-Suleiman to speak even though he had previously called for 'victory to the Muslims in Afghanistan'. Mr Gove also attacked a school for banning non-Muslim pupils from subsidised school trips to Saudi Arabia and banning a baby Jesus doll from a nativity play. Inspectors had also revealed how raffles and tombolas at one primary school been banned - because they were considered 'un-Islamic' as they promoted gambling. It was also revealed that one academy's Christmas special assembly was cancelled and a termly assembly staged by a Christian charity had been scrapped. The terms 'white prostitute' had been used in assemblies. Education Secretary Michael Gove was forced to apologise to the Home Secretary Theresa May after private remarks criticising her strategy to tackle extremism were reported. Mrs May's furious aides hit back, sparking a Cabinet war . After the Trojan Horse allegations came to light earlier this year the Education Secretary Michael Gover ordered a probe by the schools inspectors Ofsted. But the controversy has left David Cameron's Government in crisis after Mr Gove was forced to make a grovelling apology to the Prime Minister for undermining Home Secretary Theresa May, whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the Education Secretary. The punishments were meted out after a furious Mr Cameron was compelled to intervene to stop a power struggle between Home Secretary Mrs May and Education Secretary Mr Gove. Mr Gove agreed to say sorry after private remarks he made criticising her and Home Office counter-terrorism boss Charles Farr over the Home Office’s handling of extremism in schools appeared in the media. Mrs May’s spin doctor, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit for leaking a damaging private letter to Mr Gove written by Mrs May. The Home Secretary insisted she did not know about the decision to publish the private letter to Mr Gove. Following the scandal David Cameron claimed extremism and division was flourishing because of a 'worrying' failure to push British values. He said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the Magna Carta and 'British valies'. Tony Blair said the alleged Islamic extremism in British schools was the same as that practised by Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorist network. He said the Trojan Horse 'plot' to bring hardline practices into Birmingham classrooms was part of a global extremist movement stretching from Britain to Africa to the Far East. The former Prime Minister said: “There is a very fundamental problem that we face, that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world. “That problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of the religion. It is a problem here in the region. It is a problem in countries like Pakistan, it’s a problem in the Far East. We can see from Nigeria and Boko Haram it’s a problem in African countries and it’s a problem in our own society as we can see from Birmingham schools.” He added: “We have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference. “Any politics that is based on a view that ‘This is my religion and if you don’t agree you are my enemy’, that is the ideology we have to attack and root out.” But some parents have accused Ofsted of looking for extremism. A governor at Park View School in Birmingham - one of the schools placed in special measures over fears of extremism - has accused Michael Gove and Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw of 'demonising' Muslims. David Hughes launched a stinging attack on the Education Secretary and the Ofsted chief inspector over their handling of the case and suggested that they had exploited the situation. In an open letter to Mr Gove and Sir Michael, Mr Hughes, who is also vice chair of Park View Educational Trust, warned that communities affected by the allegations feel 'frightened, betrayed and let down'. Dave Hughes, the vice chairman of the Park View school at the centre of the scandal, has slammed the Government for demonising Muslim communities.

"Lucas Piazon scored with a spectacular free kick in the 90th minute to give Eintracht Frankfurt a 2-1 victory at Hamburg SV in the Bundesliga on Sunday. In the process, Hamburger SV also set the Bundesliga record for going the longest without a goal before finally managing to score in the new season. Scoreless after the first five matches of the season, Hamburg needed to score inside the first 24 minutes to avoid beating Bochum's unwanted record from 1979. But they could not find the net until the 58th minute, when Nicolai Mueller canceled out Haris Seferovic's goal from the just before half-time. Lucas Piazon celebrates his stunning strike which denied Hamburg their third point of the season . The young Brazilian, on loan from Chelsea, was rightly delighted with the brilliant strike . In the earlier match, captain Paul Verhaegh converted a first-half penalty to give Augsburg a 1-0 victory over Hertha Berlin. Hamburg dominated possession but could not score in the first half, which ended with Frankfurt taking the lead largely against the run of play. Timothy Chandler broke through on the right and sent a useful cross that was not cleared by the Hamburg defense and Seferovic pounced at the far post to slot home. Hamburg stepped up the pressure after the break and finally broke the drought when Mueller picked up a through ball from Lewis Holtby and scored as Eintracht mistimed the offside trap. Nicolai Mueller had equalised, scoring Hamburg's first goal of the season in their sixth game . Mueller's tidy finish looked to have secured a vital point for the side sat bottom of the Bundesliga . The ball went through the legs of goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald, who was making his first start in the Bundesliga after the long-term ankle injury sustained by Kevin Trapp. Wiedwald's previous Bundesliga experience consisted of a combined 17 minutes in two appearances, but he had some good saves in the match. Piazon, a 20-year-old Brazilian only came off the bench with five minutes remaining, fired a stunning free kick from nearly 30 yards to seal Eintracht's victory. The ball soared high before taking a sudden dip to bury itself in the upper corner. Eintracht moved past Augsburg into seventh, while Hamburg stayed bottom of the league, still looking for its first win. The Chelsea youngster had only been on the pitch a matter of minutes when he stepped up to win the game . In Augsburg, the goal in the 27th minute gave the home side a third win of the season which lifted them to eighth place in the standings. Verhaegh had to leave the match in the 71st minute, still wobbly 10 minutes after a collision of heads with Hertha forward Ronny. After the match, Verhaegh was taken to a hospital to be examined. Hertha's only credible chance came early in the match when Salomon Kalou's shot was tipped over by Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz. Berlin stayed 14th. Raul Bobadilla earned the penalty after collecting a pass from Nikola Djurdjic and being brought down by goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. Tottenham loanee Lewis Holtby was unable to get his Hamburg side over the line for their first win . 'I am angry,' Hertha's coach Jos Luhukay said. 'We lost because of the referee. That was never a penalty.' Kraft also disputed the decision but Bobadilla said there was no doubt. 'l am not the type that just falls down,' said the powerfully built striker. Djurdjic returned to the starting lineup after being on the bench for three matches. 'He ran a lot and created a lot of space, that was the plan,' Augsburg's coach Markus Weinzierl. Djurdjic said he was just pleased to be playing. 'It's been an exciting week,' he said. Augsburg captain Paul Verhaegh scores from the spot despite the protests of Hertha boss Jos Luhukay .","Lucas Piazon scores magical 90th minute free kick .

"Jordan Henderson feels criticism of Steven Gerrard this season is totally unjustified. The Reds captain's perceived waning influence has been highlighted as a factor in Liverpool's shaky start to the campaign. But Brendan Rodgers' side were much more dynamic in Saturday's Merseyside derby and Gerrard's free-kick in the 65th minute appeared to have sealed victory until Phil Jagielka struck a stunning late equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw. Jordan Henderson (R) has leaped to the defence of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (L) Gerrard has now scored nine goals in Premier League Merseyside derbies, more than any other player. Henderson said of his 34-year-old midfield partner: 'Stevie's still one of the best players in the Premier League. 'There's no doubting his quality. A lot of teams have been putting someone to man-mark him, which shows just how good he is. I don't think he deserves any criticism. He's been the best player this league's probably seen in a long time and still is.' Liverpool had 24 shots compared to Everton's 11 and Tim Howard, who got a hand to Gerrard's free-kick but could not keep it out, was certainly the busier goalkeeper. Gerrard scored a free-kick to open the scoring for Liverpool against Everton . Former England captain takes praise after being criticised for his performances this season . Rodgers' team have struggled to recapture the form that almost brought them the league title last season, but the consolation from Saturday's result was certainly an improved display. Henderson said: 'It's disappointing. The performance was very good, back to the level we expect. 'The intensity was good all over the pitch, we worked hard, we were more fluent going forward and we made chances as well. And also we defended really well throughout the game so that was pleasing. 'We did quite a lot of work during the week on defending and I think we showed just how well we can defend, so that needs to be the case from now on. 'Then with the goal, there's not much you can do about that, it's a great strike.' Rodgers had hoped for a similar spark to last season, when a 4-0 victory over Everton at Anfield began a run of 37 points from a possible 39. Instead, their bubble was well and truly burst by Jagielka's wonder strike and it was the Everton fans left singing in the stands at the end. Phil Jagielka's unstoppable extra-time goal earned Everton a draw in the Merseyside derby . But Henderson is confident there will be no hangover with a busy fixture list ahead, starting with a Champions League trip to Basle on Wednesday. 'I don't think it'll affect us because the performance level was very good,' said the England man. 'We've got to take the positives out of that. The goal was in the top corner so we've just got to keep going and keep playing like that. If we keep putting in performances like that we'll win more than we don't.'","Liverpool drew 1-1 with Everton in the Merseyside derby .

"Eni Aluko made history by becoming the first female professional footballer pundit on a Match of the Day show and did not hold back on her criticism of Wayne Rooney’s red card. The England women’s forward shared a panel alongside Kevin Kilbane and John Motson on Sunday afternoon’s MOTD2 Extra, hosted by Mark Chapman. Afterwards, she tweeted: ‘Thanks for all your comments :) Im honoured to be the 1st ever female football pundit on @BBCMOTD Theres a 1st for everything :)’ Eni Aluko (second right) joins John Motson, Mark Chapman and Kevin Kilbane on MOTD2 . Eni Aluko was critical of Wayne Rooney's sending off for hacking down Stewart Downing . Eni Aluko thanked people on Twitter for their support after becoming the first female Match of the day pundit . England striker Aluko in action for Chelsea Ladies against Notts County . Aluko, who plays for Chelsea Ladies, appeared for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics and has 26 goals in 83 caps for England. In the 45-minute programme she gave analysis on Diego Costa’s injury, Southampton’s fine form, and Frank Lampard’s success at Manchester City. But she saved her most incisive opinion for Rooney, who was sent off against West Ham for bringing down Stewart Downing with a wild kick. Aluko, sister of Hull striker Sone, said: ‘There were four recovering defenders, there was no need for him to make that foul. Eni Aluko was forthright in her views as she made her Match of the Day debut . The Chelsea Ladies striker ranked Phil Jagielka's stunner in the Merseyside derby the goal of the weekend . She rated it above strikes by Graziano Pelle (left) and Charlie Austin . ‘It was very reckless, there was no need for him to lash out like that. If you think of professional fouls, I’ve always been taught it should be discreet. Your teammates clap and say you stopped a counter attack. ‘The problem was it was too violent. Diafra Sakho did a similar foul and only got a yellow card because it was more discreet. ‘Rooney will be relieved they’ve won the game because he could have cost his team three points.’ The sister of Hull striker Sone Aluko gave an insight into Diego Costa's ongoing fitness battle . And Eni Aluko also reserved praise for Frank Lampard as he continues his stunning Manchester City form . Aluko also offered her thoughts on Costa’s continuing appearances for Chelsea despite his hamstring issues. ‘He’s Chelsea’s best player at the moment,’ she said. ‘And you have to understand Diego Costa wants to play. When I’m 70, 80 per cent fit I’m saying to my manager, “I want to play”.’ On Lampard, who has scored four goals since joining City, she added: ‘He’s proving he’s still a Premier League player. Chelsea might think, “Gosh maybe we should have kept him”.’ Aluko also named Phil Jagielka’s stunning goal at Anfield was the best of the weekend, outshining strikes from Charlie Austin’s for Queens Park Rangers and Graziano Pelle’s for Southampton.

"Two-thirds of British people feel uncomfortable or awkward talking to somebody who is disabled, new research has shown. A fear of seeming patronising or saying the wrong thing causes people to worry about what they say around those with a disability, a new report by charity Scope has found. The study sheds light on why disabled people continue to face negative public attitudes, the charity said today. Scroll down for video . The disability charity Scope has launched a new campaign after research found that two-thirds of British people feel uncomfortable or awkward talking to disabled people . The Millennial Generation - those born . from the early-1980s to the 2000s - are twice as likely as older people . to feel awkward around disabled people. And one-fifth of 18 to 34-year-olds have actually avoided talking to a disabled person because they were not sure how to communicate with them. Off the back of the findings, Scope has today launched a new national advertising campaign which uses comedy to shine a light on the awkwardness that many people feel about disability. The adverts, which premiere on national television this Sunday, are fronted by comedian and presenter Alex Brooker, best-known for his role on Channel 4’s The Last Leg, which is now into its 4th series since the London 2012 Paralympics. They show Mr Brooker guiding viewers through a series of awkward situations that they may encounter with a disabled person, such as 'The Awkward ""I’ve bent down to speak to a wheelchair user, now what?"" Situation'. Mr Brooker, who has a prosthetic leg and hand and arm disabilities, said he hopes the campaign will get people talking about, rather than avoiding, the issue of disability. Appearing on Good Morning Britain comedian and TV presenter Alex Brooker discussed the issue. He said: 'Some people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not it's coming from a good place because it's just someone not wanting to offend' He said: 'Some . people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not . it's coming from a good place because it's just someone not wanting to . offend. 'I don't see anything wrong with being curious, I would be if I saw someone different and I'm disabled myself. 'It's just about getting past that and feeling confident because a disability is only a part of who someone is I think.' Channel 4’s coverage of the London 2012 . Paralympic Games had a huge impact and research at the time indicated . that it changed perceptions about disability amongst viewers. Richard Hawkes, Scope’s CEO, said: 'Awkward situations can be funny. We’ve all been in situations that have made us cringe. Nearly half of the British - 43 per cent - do not personally know anyone who is disabled . Two-thirds - 67 per cent - of those surveyed said that they would worry about . speaking about disability in front of a disabled person, with many . worrying they would say something inappropriate or use an offensive term . by mistake . Many . people said that getting to know someone disabled - 33 per cent - or getting . advice from disabled people - 28 per cent - would make them feel more confident . when meeting a disabled person . 'But imagine if every day, people avoided talking to you because they weren’t sure what to say or how to act. 'That’s the situation that many disabled people face today. 'We wanted to raise this issue in a light-hearted way, because it isn’t about pointing fingers. 'Not . enough people know a disabled person, or know enough about disability. This can mean people worry about saying or doing the wrong thing and . feel awkward. 'But it can also have a serious side. 'In . 2014 disabled people face many challenges. Many disabled people . continue to face negative attitudes, in the playground, in the street, . and from employers. 'We’ve launched this campaign to get us all thinking about what we can do to include disabled people more in our lives.' While . the adverts are light-hearted, Scope wants to highlight the negative . impact of discomfort about disability on disabled people’s lives. Recent analysis released by Scope revealed that in 2014, disabled people have higher aspirations than ever before, but that many disabled people feel that public attitudes to disability are still playing 'catch up'. Scope’s research reveals that when asked whose attitude most needs to change, disabled people were most likely to say the general public.","New report by disability charity scope found 67 per cent of the British public feel awkward talking to disabled people .

"Sorry: Dominic Grieve, the country's most senior law officer, has apologised after he said minority communities have brought with them 'endemic' corruption . A senior cabinet minister has apologised for claiming corruption in Britain’s Pakistani community is ‘endemic’. Dominic Grieve QC, the Attorney General, said sorry after pointing to a ‘favour culture’ among  Pakistanis – remarks which were quickly branded ‘offensive’. He told Saturday’s Daily Telegraph that corruption was a growing problem ‘because we have minority communities in this country which come from backgrounds where corruption is endemic’. But just hours later Mr Grieve backtracked and issued  an apology. In a statement he said: ‘If I gave the impression that there is  a particular problem in the  Pakistani community, I was wrong …  I believe the Pakistani community has enriched this country a great deal …  I’m sorry if I have caused any offence.’ His initial comments were rebuked by Tory MEP Sajjad Karim, who said they were ‘ill-advised’ and ‘offensive, divisive’. Mr Karim accused Mr Grieve of trying to ‘paint all British  Pakistani community members in a certain light’. The . MP, whose Beaconsfield constituency in Buckinghamshire has a . sizeable Asian community, said: 'I can see many of them have come because of . the opportunities that they get. But they also come from societies where . they have been brought up to believe you can only get certain things . through a favour culture. 'One of the things you have to make absolutely clear is that that is not the case and it's not acceptable.' Mr Grieve had previously said electoral corruption was a problem in constituencies such as Slough in Berkshire where Tory councillor Eshaq Khan (pictured) was found guilty of fraud involving postal ballots in 2008 . Asked . if he was referring to the Pakistani community in his comments, Mr . Grieve told the newspaper: 'Yes, it's mainly the Pakistani community, . not the Indian community. I wouldn't draw it down to one. I'd be wary of . saying it's just a Pakistani problem.' He used the interview to highlight the issue of electoral fraud as an area of particular concern. However, Tory MEP Sajjad Karim, the party's legal affairs spokesman in the European Parliament, hit out at Mr Grieve. He . told the BBC: 'As a member of the British Pakistani community myself, I . found these comments to be offensive, divisive; I do think they were . ill-advised and I'm afraid the very general way in which Dominic is . trying to make the points that he is making will have the net effect of . being seen as purely populist in nature.' He . added that it was 'quite clear when one carries out even the most basic . examination of the claims that he is making that the facts do not . support the argument that he is presenting'. Disgraced Khan and five others were jailed in 2009 for using 'ghost' voters to win a Slough Borough Council ballot (file picture) Mr . Karim continued: 'It's absolutely essential that if any politician in . an influential position, regardless of whatever personal political . ambitions that individual may have, it is essential that they do not try . and behave in a way that creates a general impression about any . particular community. 'If . Dominic has got any individual specific points he wants to make in . relation to voter fraud or anything of that nature that's quite a . separate issue and can be looked at. 'But . to try and generalise in this way and to paint all British Pakistani . community members in a certain light, I'm afraid that is simply . something that cannot be ignored and it is certainly not something that . the British public at large will accept from Dominic at all.' Today Mr Karim welcomed the Attorney General's apology. In a message on Twitter the North West England MEP said: ""Completely accept Dominic Grieve's apology. Thank you."" Tory chairman Grant Shapps said it was wrong to single out a particular community. Condemnation: Baroness Warsi, the Foreign Office minister, has previously said the Conservatives lost three seats at the general election because of voter fraud in the Asian community . Inflammatory: David Cameron sparked outrage on a previous visit to India by suggesting Pakistan was 'exporting terrorism' He . told the BBC: 'Of course corruption needs to be rooted out wherever it . is in this country. But we think that's something that needs to be . tackled everywhere, not in a specific community.' Mr . Shapps said the Pakistani community has 'done an awful lot to work in . this country and actually is a well-respected, established community . that I think has lent a lot to Britain'. He . added: 'I don't agree that pinpointing one community over another is . the right thing to do. Actually corruption is something which, wherever . it is, this Government wants to root it out. 'If . it's in voting, for example, then we have already passed a piece of . legislation which means that people have to individually register for . votes in the future. That will solve that problem. 'Wherever . corruption exists we'll make sure we root it out but we certainly don't . want to pin that on any particular communities.' David . Cameron sparked outrage earlier in his premiership when he accused . Pakistan of ‘exporting terrorism’ while on a visit to India. Baroness . Warsi, the Foreign Office minister, has previously said the . Conservatives lost three seats at the general election because of voter . fraud in the Asian community. Jailed for electoral fraud: Eshaq Khan . Disgraced Tory representative Eshaq Khan and five others used fake votes to oust longstanding Labour councillor Lydia Simmons from her seat on Slough Borough Council. The audacious scam in 2007 was described by the Crown Prosecution Service as part of an 'epidemic' which threatens to destroy democracy in the UK. Eshaq Khan, 52, received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perjury. During his trial the court heard that Eshaq Khan, a father-of-10, had been dishonestly elected as a Tory councillor in May 2007 after a scheme in which 'ghost voters' were registered on the electoral role. The fraudulent plot was uncovered when ousted Labour councillor and former Mayor Miss Simmons and her Labour team questioned the result. They pointed out that at a number of houses up to 19 names - all Asian - had registered in the run up to the election at the same address then opted to vote by post. Charles Miskin, prosecuting at the trial said the action of the convicted vote-riggers was like a virus that needed to be eradicated. He referred to a report by Electoral Commission Richard Mawrey QC which served as a warning that unless the UK election procedures are changed, the nation's democracy will be at stake. Citing the report Mr Miskin said: 'The systems to deal with fraud are not working well, they are not working badly - the fact is there are no real systems. 'Until there are, fraud will continue unabated. The system for voting would disgrace a banana republic.'","Dominic Grieve apologises for inflammatory remarks made in interview .

"A chartered surveyor is set to spend two months inside an eight foot water tank in a desolate island as he tries to raise money for charity. Nick Hancock is planning to set two endurance records by living on the 100ft island of Rockall and raise money for the Help for Heroes charity. Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than Rockall itself. Nick Hancock will live on the isolated 100ft island of Rockall inside an eight foot water tank that he has converted to be inhabitable . Being in such an isolated location, only four people have ever slept on Rockall. Less than 100 have landed on it. But Mr Hancock, 38, from Edinburgh, has even created a yellow living pod from an 8ft water tank, and made it cosy with spray-on insulation foam in a bid to spend 60 days on Rockall. He recently won £3500 from the Kukri Adventure Scholarship - following a presentation at the Royal Geographical Society in London - to help his bid, set for early June. The current record for time spent on Rockall is 40 days back in 1985 - when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the islet. Mr Hancock, who stayed for a short while on the isolated islet 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, hopes to spend a record-breaking 60 days on the rock to raise money for Help For Heroes. He plans to spend 60 days on the island inside this eight foot water tank that he converted . 'The RockPod survival shelter I have constructed is almost complete,' said Mr Hancock. 'It was recently insulated by Foamspray Technologies in Leeds, and I am now finishing it internally. The majority of my equipment and supplies have arrived and I have been distributing and packing them in the plastic drums, donated by Smiths of Dean, which I will use to get my kit onto Rockall. 'I fully expect that I will have to repack several times to ensure I know where everything is, but otherwise I feel confident that I will be ready in a month's time for this amazing adventure.' The expedition is being sponsored by Calor Gas who will provide a stove and the LPG needed to cook. In 2011 TV adventurer Ben Fogle said he wanted to lead an exhibition to ""reclaim"" Rockall for Britain. The isolated island of Rockall in the Outer Hebrides  is a 100ft wide and can attract waves of up to 95 feet high . 'I once tried to invade Rockall, unsuccessfully, and have first-hand experience of the ridiculousness of Rockall's size and the recklessness of attempting a landing. It is a realm of the sea, a kingdom governed only by the weather,' he said. 'Nick's attempt to not only land, but stay for 60 days and raise money for a very worthy charity is an apt gesture for an island so immersed in eccentricity.' Survival expert Bear Grylls added that it was 'an ambitious, exciting - and wonderfully mad - project, but in aid of a life-changing charity that needs our help.' Even TV adventurer Ben Fogle failed to land Rockall and he has praised Mr Hancock for the attempt . Belgian radio enthusiasts landed on the remote North Atlantic islet - Britain's loneliest outpost - in October 2011 and transmitted for more than 15 hours. The island is the core of an eroded volcano that erupted around 55 million years ago. The rock is 100ft wide and 70ft high and in the past Ireland, Iceland and Denmark have lain claim to Rockall and to the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it. Ownership is now being examined by the United Nations in the light of competing claims from Iceland, the Faroes and Ireland. The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810, by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion. In 2011 an adventurer dramatically cancelled his attempt to land on Rockall to reaffirm the UK's ownership of it - after half his team suddenly quit two days into the expedition. Andy Strangeway wanted to put a new plaque on Rockall to replace the one that was left in 1955 in what was the last territorial expansion of the British Empire. Yorkshireman Mr Strangeway also had to cancel a bid in 2010 to reach Rockall after there was a hold-up in getting the islet's first planning permission from the Western Isles Council - the nearest local authority. The Royal Navy annexed Rockall in 1955 and the Island Of Rockall Act 1972 declared it part of the Western Isles. Its exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831. But it was on September 18, 1955, that the island was officially annexed by the British Crown when three marines - Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott, Sergeant Brian Peel and Corporal AA Fraser - and civilian naturalist James Fisher were deposited on the island by a Royal Navy helicopter. Rockall is a formidable opponent for any adventurer, located 225 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and surrounded by choppy water . The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK's claim. During his reconnaissance trip last June, Mr Hancock did unfurl a Union Jack and tweeted on Twitter: 'Happy jubilee Your Majesty' but did, however, lose some equipment during his brief stay. The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11 feet x 4 feet, and is just 13 feet below the summit. There are no trees or bushes on the rock - just algae, seaweeds and one black lichen. Just over 20 species of sea bird and only six species of animal have been recorded on or near Rockall.","Nick Hancock plans to live n 100ft wide Rockall for two months .

"Three black comediennes will take the Saturday Night Live stage at some point today to fight for a cast member position opening up this January - and one of them is a noted critic of the show. SNL creator Lorne Michaels decided to break tradition and hire new talent midseason after facing criticism that the sketch-comedy show lacked diversity in its sixth year without a black female cast member. A source at the show revelealed to the New York Daily News that NBC Universal Diversity Scholarship winner Natasha Rothwell, stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata and sketch comic Kerry Coddett were the three women who made the cut for today's auditions. All three women are alumnae of the Upright Citizens Brigade -  an improv troupe founded by SNL alum Amy Poehler. They made the cut after performing in a showcase in New York on December 2. Scroll down for video . The final three: Sketch comic Kerry Coddett (left), NBC Universal Diversity Scholarship winner Natasha Rothwell (center) and stand-up comic Sasheer Zamata (right) are the three women who will audition for a SNL cast member position today . In November, Coddett wrote a scathing review of the show on the Huffington Post, responding to a comment from black cast member Kenan Thompson who said the show often auditions black females but finds they're never 'ready'. Coddett pointed to the show hosted by Kerry Washington in November, saying perhaps it was the white male dominated SNL writing room that wasn't ready to handle black female characters. 'The SNL writers showed what they could do with a ""read"" black actress: pigeonhole her. They took an Emmy-nominated actress and made her play a nagging firlfriend; a sassy eye-rolling assistant; and a rage-filled Ugandan beauty queen,' Coddett wrote. 'Why can't they create interesting and funny characters ourside race? How long will it take the SNl writers to learn that black is not a punch line?' Outspoken: Coddett criticized the show's writers in an essay in November, saying the characters they wrote for the Kerry Washington show relied on black female stereotypes . She continues to say that while she rarely finds black women playing outside stereotypes on TV, her fellow comediennes a creating new 'awkward', 'sophisticated', and 'hilarious' black female charaters on YouTube. 'If SNL isn't finding great black female talent, maybe it's because the characters we want to play don't fall in lilve with the caricatures they're used to seeing.' Coddett stated she doesn't believe there should be some sort of affirmative action diversity quota put on the writer's room, but that the white-male dominated group is becoming a crutch for SNL. 'If a group of white men are dictating what is being said, then there are so many different perspectives missing from the discussion,' she said. 'A relic of the comedy community, the SNL writers' room needs to be more diverse for the sake of being true to the art form and the audience. Rumors that a new player might be added to the cast started last week, when Gothamist reported that auditions were held earlier in the month at the Groundlings theater for black female comediennes in LA. Man behind the curtain: Lorne Michaels previously said that hiring a black actress was on the show's to do list . The rumor was confirmed by SNL's creator and producer Lorne Michaels who told the New York Times last Thursday that a black female cast member will join the cast in January - the first time Michaels can remember adding a cast member mid-season. 'All told we've seen about 25 people,' Michaels told the Times. 'A lot of people we saw are really good. Hopefully we'll come out of the process well.' Michaels added that as many as two of the nine that made it to the final round could make it onto the cast in January. But . he says he doesn't want to add too many women since the cast already . has five. Right now, the SNL cast consists of five men and five women, . with one female and six male featured players. Michaels . also revealed that he had vetted two black female players when he was . initially hiring for the current season this past fall. He . saw the two women during a performance in Chicago, but their . performances weren't as strong when they were invited to New York for . the final auditions. 'Then when the deck got reshuffled and as we premiered we realized, it looks a different way,' he said. That's when he started the unusual process of searching for a new cast member mid-season. Michaels . says he can't remember ever adding a new cast member in the middle of . the season, but says he has added players in March or April to get them . into the last episodes of the season. Four black women: In its nearly 40 years on the air, Saturday Night live . has hired just four black women. The first was Yvonne Hudson, right, and Danitra Vance, left, spent the . 1985-86 season on the show . No more: After Ellen Cleghorn, left, left the cast in 1995, there wouldn't be another black woman until Maya Rudolph in 2000. Rudolph left in 2007 and there hasn't been a black woman on the show since . While many have criticized the show for not having anyone to play prominent black females like first lady Michelle Obama, Beyonce or Oprah, Michaels says that has nothing to do with his hiring decision. 'That's a weird sort of way of looking at it because you don't judge comedy that way. Versatility is what we look for.' This will be the first time since 2007 that SNL has had a woman of African-American heritage on the show. The two current black cast members- Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah- were the ones to spurn the criticism this fall as they felt it was inappropriate that all impersonations of prominent black women meant that they would have to dress in drag. As a result, there have been no . sketches on the weekly program featuring First Lady Michelle Obama since . Maya Rudolph left the cast in 2007. 'SNL' has had just four black women in its regular troupe since premiering in 1975, including Rudolph who is biracial. Done: Cast member Kenan Thompson announced this season that he will no longer dress in drag to play black women. He had played the likes of Whoopi Goldberg (right), Raven Symone and Aretha Franklin in the past . 'It's not like it's not a priority for us,' Michaels said in an interview with The Associated Press in early November. 'It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.' News of the invitation-only auditions that have been taking place in Los Angeles and Chicago broke when pictures of the prospective candidates backstage hit the internet. Actress Bresha Webb said she was 'honored' to be one of the 11 black comediennes asked to audition on about two days notice in that instance. 'It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such short notice but, if you stay ready you ain't gotta get ready and we were READY!,' she told TheJasmineBrand.com. 'I can share that we all entered the Groundlings theater backstage having no idea what to expect. I had no clue who was apart of the showcase. Of course my comedienne friends (Tiffany Haddish, Beth Payne and Gabrielle Dennis) were there. And some talented ladies in sketch comedy were there that I had never met,' she said. It's happening: SNL's creator Lorne Michaels confirmed that a new black female comedienne will be added to the cast this January following reports that a 'secret' audition were held earlier this month in LA (those asked to audition pictured) Simone Shepherd, Lekendra Tookes, Azie Dungey, Amber Ruffin, Damirra Brunson, Nicole Byer and Mistry Monroe also auditioned according to Jezebel. 'We were all very supportive of each other and there was no sense of competition or pettiness,' Ms Webb said. 'We were just happy that some new black women in comedy were being considered and given a shot. We even held hands prayed after the showcase. It was refreshing. The show was also sold out. It was packed to the max.' Webb says she was invited to audition last summer, but was filming a television show and wasn't able to perform. One of the comediennes who auditioned in LA - Brunson- had a fan on the inside, as Pharoah has publicly lobbied for her to get one of the coveted spots. Supporter: Cast member Jay Pharaoh (left) has named Darmirra Brunson (right) as someone he would like to see join the cast . 'Why do I think she should be on the show? Because she's black first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on SNL. I said it. And I believe they need to follow up with it like they said they were going to do last year,' Pharoah told The Grio. The timing of the announcement comes not only as a result of the criticism but also due to the high-profile departure of cast member and head Seth Meyers, who will leave in the New Year to host Late Night when Jimmy Fallon goes to The Tonight Show.","Lorne Michaels revealed Thursday that at least one new black female actress will join the cast of Saturday Night Live in January .

"The pastor of 'America's manliest church' has stepped down after being charged with DWI last week for driving home drunk from a bar. Heath Mooneyham relinquished control of Ignite Church during this Sunday's service, contritely telling the congregation: 'My actions and behavior have led to grief and disappointment for my family, Ignite Church and the people of Joplin. For that I am truly sorry.' Mooneyham, who is married and has three children, was arrested on September 16 after being stopped by police at 10.30pm in Joplin, Missouri and failing a breathalyzer test. He was charged with driving while intoxicated. Scroll down for video . Heath Mooneyham, the controversial pastor of Ignite Church in Joplin, Missouri who gave away AR15 assault rifles to encourage reluctant followers through the door on Father's Day this year, has stepped down from the church after being charged with DWI . Mooneyham, a heavily-tattooed 36-year-old, launched his church in 2008 and is well-known for his bold tactics when it comes to converting followers. After finding his calling, the former small-business owner, who admits he spent several years off-the-rails in his early twenties, started his church at home. His audience has boomed to 800 faithful. A recent article by Shane Dixon Kavanaugh for vocativ.com called the church the 'manliest' in America as at the institution's core, is a message to encourage a young, male audience, aged 18-35. Ignite's website leads with the message: 'Casual atmosphere, serious faith, no weird stuff.' A typical Sunday sermon involves a live band, pounding out Christian rock anthems along with a message about loving God based on Bible teaching - although the subjects of sex, guns and drinking are not necessarily frowned upon. Church volunteers are called 'Rock Stars'. Slickly-produced videos on Ignite sermons are posted to YouTube and have titles such as 'Band Of Brothers', 'Spartan' and 'Grow A Pair'. Mooneyham, pictured with his wife Kensey whom he married in 2002, said that his DWI charge had let his family down . Followers of Mooneyham's Ignite Church gather for a meeting at his large home in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri . Earlier this year, Mooneyham, a Missouri native, featured a giveaway of two assault rifles at the church, in the hope of getting more followers through the door, vocativ.com reported. In a promotional YouTube video, where Mooney is pictured wearing a 'Drink Up Fortuitous One' t-shirt, he encouraged the reluctant faithful to come to church this Father's Day to have a chance of winning an AR-15 which is perfect for 'double-tapping a zombie'. Despite a plethora of critics who disagree with his dubious methods of drumming up new recruits, he told vocativ.com: 'We love our God. We love our country. We love our trucks. And we love our guns.' MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Ignite today but a church executive told the Joplin Globe that Mooneyham, who lives in a large house in the Ozark Mountains, would be undergoing alcohol addiction treatment and having time away from the church before it was hoped he could return. Mooneyham pictured with his large stash of weapons and ammunition at his home in Missouri . Pastor Heath Mooneyham, who is a huge Notre Dame college football fan, pictured watching a fame at his Ignite church . Mooneyham, 36, also said in his statement, which was posted on YouTube, that despite his 'rough, tough, renegade preacher image' he had been self-medicating with alcohol at the end of a stressful day or as a way to forget reality. According to his own website, Mooneyham has three children Kyndal, Elijah and Charlie with his wife Kensey, whom he married in 2002. His message to find God's lost sheep is simple. 'We target 18-35 year old men. That’s it!' he writes online. 'If we win the men, we win the women, the kids, the jobs, the town, the WAR! And we’ll do anything short of sin to accomplish this.'

"The thoughtful parents of twin boys who brought sweets, ear plugs and a kind note for the people on their cross country plane trip today explained why they went to such great lengths to appease their fellow passengers. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Christina Diaz, 38, and Michael Rubinstein, 32, said the bemused travelers thought Ms Diaz was a flight attendant handing out on-board snacks when she distributed the 'apology' bags. And, despite hours of hard work preparing the kits, their 14-week-old twins Arrow and Jasper didn't even let out a murmur throughout the five-hour flight from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. Ms Diaz and Mr Rubinstein have detailed their first flight with their adorable baby boys as well as the new notoriety their simple act of kindness has earned them. Cuties: Christina Diaz and Michael Rubinstein were terrified of flying with their newborn twins, Jasper and Arrow, so they stayed up all night making goodie bags for their fellow travellers . One person on the flight who was touched by the gesture, Andrew Merritt, snapped a photo of the packaged sweets and kind note and posted it on Reddit, where it struck a chord with internet users . Generous: In an exclusive interview with the MailOnline, Ms Diaz and Mr Rubinstein spoke about their first flight with their adorable baby boys as well as the new notoriety their simple act of kindness has earned them. Mr Rubinstein, 32, a geographic specialist for Google Earth, and Ms Diaz, 32, a photographer, live together in Berkley, California. They were terrified of visiting Mr Rubinstein's family on the East Coast, nervous not only about the trip, but of what they would do if Arrow Wyatt and Jasper Caleb were fussy on the flight. 'I was really, really nervous about getting on the flight with them,' Ms Diaz told the MailOnline. 'There's always that stigma of getting on the plane with babies because people get annoyed if they're crying.' She continued: 'We didn't want to encroach on people's personal space when they didn't have an option to go any where else.' Then, she remembered having read about a new mother who brought gifts for the other passengers on her flight and decided to do the same. With about $20, Ms Diaz went out to the store to pick up some candy and ear plugs. She printed out sweet notes to explain to the flight that they were new parents and that they would do the best to keep Arrow and Jasper quiet during the journey from San Francisco to Washington D.C. Sweet: Ms Diaz, left, remembered having read about a new mother who brought gifts for the other passengers on her flight and decided to do the same. Mr Rubinstein is pictured at right . The two spread out the gift bag ingredients and got to work the night before the flight, rushing to finish them in time. 'She was working on them until midnight the night before,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'I was relegated to cutting up the little notes.' 'We're twin baby boys on our first flight and we're only 14 weeks old! We'll . try to be on our best behavior, but we'd like to apologize in advance . just in case we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. Our mom and . dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear . plugs available if you need them.' 'We're twin baby boys on our first flight and we're only 14 weeks old!' the note read. 'We'll . try to be on our best behavior, but we'd like to apologize in advance . just in case we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. Our mom and . dad (AKA our portable milk machine and our diaper changer) have ear . plugs available if you need them.' The couple packed the 20 or so Ziploc bags in with the twins and headed for the airport. They got through security without a problem as the TSA agent had twins himself, and understood their fears of traveling with the boys. Once they settled in their back row, Ms Diaz got up and started passing around the packages, unsure how they might be received. 'People just took it thinking I was a flight attendant,' Ms Diaz said, 'and then a few minutes later, I guess they read it, and they started laughing.' Mr Rubinstein said that though he was busy watching the twins, he did notice the passengers' attitudes change once they receive their gifts. 'There was a guy who I was eyeing that kept looking back seeing the babies and he didn't look too happy. After she gave him the candies, he would look back and smile,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'That was definitely one person who was moved by it.' Consideration: With about $20, Ms Diaz went out to the store to pick up some candy and ear plugs. She printed out sweet notes to explain to the flight that they were new parents and that they would do the best to keep Arrow and Jasper quiet . Mr Rubinstein said he also heard another passenger who was pleased by their generosity: Andrew Merritt, the man who posted the photograph of the goodie bag that was shared by millions of people. 'I overhead him say, ""This is so cool I'm going to take a picture,"" Mr Rubinstein said. And the karma definitely paid off: the boys miraculously stayed calm throughout the whole flight. 'It was still stressful,' Ms Diaz said. 'Until we landed, I was like, ""I don't want to fly home!""' When they arrived in Washington, D.C., Arrow and Jasper met their grandparents for the first time. The family spent the next few days swooning over the babies, completely unaware of their mounting fame. Ms Diaz showed her sister-in-law a leftover package in passing and a few days later, her sister-in-law showed her the hundreds of articles the kind couple. 'At first we were a little incredulous,' Mr Rubinstein said. 'Then we spent the evening reading the comments.' The pair are still on vacation with their family and have already begun making more goodie bags for their flight home on Saturday. 'It was met with such a warm response,' Ms Diaz said, still slightly afraid of the journey. 'Maybe it's a lucky charm.' Thoughtful: Andrew Merritt received the package at the start of a journey to bike from Paris to Istanbul . Journey: Upon receiving the gift package, he . said he was 'overwhelmed with a positive view on mankind’s potential'. He was also thrilled with his new notoriety on Reddit . 'Brilliant and thoughtful parents handed these out to everyone on my flight,' Andrew Merritt wrote on Reddit, posting a picture of the Ziploc plastic bag filled with goodies and a note of explanation. Mr Merritt, a San Francisco jack-of-all-trades, explained that the mini travelers and their parents ended up being absolutely delightful. 'The parents were fantastic and the kids were better than would be expected. Mom was super nervous and obviously very tired, but still extremely nice to everyone around her. Not a mean or frustrated word from dad either. Saw them meeting his parents at baggage, who were seeing babies for first time, and got a bit teary,' Mr Merritt explained. Mr Merritt's tale occurred at the start of a very personal journey, the Redditor said on his blog. The 27-year-old from San Francisco just embarked on a bicycle trip from Paris to Istanbul after a bad break up. 'Last night I left San Francisco to begin my journey. I’ve left my job, home, and those closest to me to seek something I’m not sure I even understand at times,' he wrote. 'Once onboard, I realized that I was sitting in a row with not one 14 week old baby, but twins.' Upon receiving the gift package, he said he was 'overwhelmed with a positive view on mankind’s potential'. He was also thrilled with his new notoriety on Reddit. Popular: More than 1million people have viewed the image on Imgur in the past two days . 'I should also add that I submitted this photo on Reddit.com and it currently has more points that Barack Obama’s AMA (he came to the site last Wednesday). For those who are as addicted to Reddit as myself, this is quite a big deal,' he wrote. The idea immediately sparked chatter on the social news site, garnering over 3,000 comments and one million views after it was posted over the weekend. Most of the reaction was positive with one user calling it the 'most considerate thing I've ever seen ... it has fully restored my faith in said consideration.'","Christina Diaz and Michael Rubinstein made gift packages to apologize in advance if their twin boys cried on a cross country flight .

"The father of British-born ‘cop killer’ Alexandria Hollinghurst had a violent showdown with her boyfriend just hours before the couple took off on a rampage that ended with a police officer gunned down and the teens dead in an apparent suicide pact. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, 17-year-old Alex’s grandfather, David Hollinghurst, has revealed his son Tom’s desperate last-ditch bid to put an end to 18-year-old Brandon Goode’s relationship with his daughter. He has told how the family had watched in despair as his ‘beautiful granddaughter’ went off the rails – stealing, ‘vanishing off’ and getting into drugs. Heartbroken: David Victor Hollinghurst, grandfather of Alexandria Hollinghurst, pictured on his front porch at his home in Okeechobee, Florida . Final encounter: Mr Hollinghurst revealed to MailOnline that his son had a violent confrontation with Brandon Goode, 18 (right), before the teen and Alex Hollinghurst (left) ran off and gunned down a police officer . And he has exposed a fantastical plot hatched by the teens to steal a boat, sail it to Panama and live on a beach. Speaking from his home in Okeechobee, Florida, Mr Hollinghurst, 61, said: ‘Alex had vanished off in the night late on Wednesday and on Thursday Tom went round to Goode’s mother’s house and found Brandon there. Victim: Windermere, Fla., Police Department Officer Robert German was shot and killed early March 22, 2014,  after stopping Alex and Brandon and calling for help in an Orlando suburb . ‘He told me he yelled at him so all the neighbors could hear. He said he was going to have him charged with statutory rape if he came near his daughter again. ‘Goode wanted Tom to punch him so that he could report him for assault but Tom didn’t.’ MailOnline first told how Hollinghurst had been reported missing by her mother, Debra, on Thursday, March 20, only to return when the police officer responding to the call was out interviewing her in the family home. But Mr Hollinghurst claimed: ‘She came back but only so she could take what she could before running off with him again.’ According to Mr Hollinghurst, his granddaughter stole a computer, jewelry and ‘anything else she could sell,’ before disappearing one final time some time during the night. He tearfully recalled: ‘She’d been acting stupid like that for a while, vanishing off and coming back.’ Mr . Hollinghurst, a former truck driver from Manchester who moved to the . States in 1995, explained that he initially assumed this time would be . no different. But he said: ‘Tom phoned me on Saturday night at 7pm. He said, “They found her dad.”‘I said, “Where is she?” Off the rails: The 61-year-old grandfather detailed how his beautiful, intelligent granddaughter started stealing and turned to drugs . Happier times: Tom Hollinghurst, Alex and Debra in Blackpool, UK . ‘He just said, “She f***ing dead.” I just shouted, “No!”’ The teenage lovers' bodies were found in the Orlando suburb of Windemere 100 yards from where officer Robert German was shot in the head. They apparently killed the 31-year-old cop after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood Saturday morning. Mr Hollinghurst described the days since that awful moment as ‘one terrible time warp. It’s like one long day. It never ends.’ Asked whether he believed his granddaughter had taken her own life or was killed by her boyfriend, Mr Hollinghurst admitted he no longer knew what Alex was capable of. He said: ‘They found out that the pair of them had planned to go down to Clearwater and steal a boat then sail it to Panama and live on a beach somewhere. ‘I don’t know what she was capable of. I don’t know what he was capable of.’ Using her wiles: Alex's grandfather said the teen (right) was very pretty and knew she could use her charms to get whatever she wanted from her father . Lovers' plot: Alex (left) and her boyfriend allegedly planned to steal a boat, sail it to Panama and live on a beach . Living in fear: Mr Hollinghurst expected his granddaughter's boyfriend to show up at his house and kill him . When he heard his granddaughter was missing, he admitted, he half expected her to turn up at his home and feared her boyfriend would kill him. He knew that her parents had struggled to control her in recent months. He said: ‘She was such a beautiful little girl, the cutest thing and she knew it. She was always pretty and she could get whatever she wanted from her dad. ‘But she’d started stealing. She’d started with the drugs. She was so bright, so beautiful. She could have been anything.’ Apple of dad's eye: Alex's father, Tom Hollinghurst, was devoted to his daughter and nicknamed her 'Stick' because of her thin build . Mr Hollinghurst said that while Alex’s relationship with her mother was strained, Tom, 42, was ‘devoted’ to the daughter he nicknamed ‘Stick’ because of her slender frame and she to him. He said: ‘Tom loved his girls – Debra and Hannah and Alex. He adopted Georgia the oldest, Debra had her already. ‘He called them his ‘girly gang.’ They could get him to do anything.’ He said that Alex was ‘good as gold’ until last fall when she began getting into trouble. He said: ‘She disappeared off with her boyfriend just before Christmas and had only showed up at home again recently. ‘She wrecked her car in January – she just wasn’t looking left or right, just careless. She was stealing from the shoe shop where she worked.’ Shaking his head, he reflected how different the troubled teen of recent months was from the 11-year-old who came to America with her parents in 2007. The family initially lived with Mr Hollinghurst and his late wife, Lynett, who died from breast cancer two years ago. He recalled how Alex had settled into the local school before the family moved to Davenport a two-hour drive away. The last time Alex visited her grandfather was, he said, just before Christmas 2011. Her grandmother, who died at age 57, was desperately ill and she, sister Hannah and father Tom helped put up the tree and care for her. Reckless: Alexandria crashed her car in January because her grandfather said she was careless . Sticky fingers: Mr Hollinghurst said after running away from home, the 17-year-old (right) briefly returned to steal a computer and jewelry . Mr Hollinghurst said: ‘Alex was so good with Lynett. She couldn’t really talk, the cancer had gone to her brain and Alex devised a sort of chart so she could point to things, tell us what she wanted and it worked for a while.’ Now, he and the rest of his family are left struggling to understand how it all went so wrong, so quickly. The Medical Examiner has yet to conclude his report and the cause of death is still pending. Alex’s parents maintain she was killed by Goode and had not intended to take her own life. Whatever the truth, Mr Hollinghurst said he plans to leave America in the wake of the tragedy. He said: ‘I arrived here in 1995 with $300 and a job in Alabama but I don’t want to be here now. The whole American dream’s over for me now.’","Alexandria Hollinghurst's grandfather, 61-year-old David Hollinghurst, said his son confronted 17-year-old's boyfriend just hours before the rampage .

"Casey Anthony became the 'most hated mother in America' during her two-month trial for the murder of two-year-old daughter, Caylee. Now, defense attorney Cheney Mason, says that ‘the world owes an apology,’ to the young mother whom he has described as having ‘endured the unthinkable with the courage of a lion.’ It is three years since a Florida court acquitted Casey of the murder of toddler Caylee whose skeletal remains were found six months after she went missing in June 2008. Casey Anthony, who was found not guilty of murdering her daughter three years ago, is seen with Cheney Mason last summer, presumably taken at her home in an undisclosed location in Florida. Mason's new book 'Justice in America' has just been released . 'Chainless imprisonment': Casey Anthony's attorney says that despite her acquittal for the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, she's still serving a heavy sentence . Today, with the publication of ‘Justice . in America,’ attorney Mr Mason provides an excoriating insight into . Casey’s prosecution and mounts an impassioned defense of Casey with whom . he and his wife, Shirley, have formed a close relationship. In a forensic examination of the case, and the very notion of justice in America, he has slammed Anthony’s prosecution as ‘corrupt’; revealed how evidence was suppressed; claimed defense witnesses were intimidated and told of his ‘astonishment’ at Casey’s father, George’s testimony in court. And he has revealed that, to this day, not only Casey lives ‘like a prisoner’ in an undisclosed location, afraid to go out and battling a bankruptcy case, but he, his wife, and other members of the defense team endure persistent and serious threats. According to Mr Mason the FBI, Secret Service and American Postal Service have all been called to investigate such threats. Meanwhile Casey lives in a shared house, somewhere in Florida, attempting to make some sort of living through clerical work from home. Speaking to CNN last week Mr Mason revealed that Casey who accused her father of sexually molesting her, ‘does not have any blood family anymore.’ Instead he and his wife, Shirley, have become surrogate parents of sorts to Casey who was 22 when the case was first brought to national attention in July 2008. No evidence: Mason says there was no forensic evidence linking Casey Anthony's car or her person to the death of her daughter . By then toddler Caylee had been missing for 31 days. Her mother Cindy and father George testified that Casey left the family house with her almost three-year-old daughter on 15 June. On 30 June the family car, being used by Casey, was towed and when Cindy and George contacted their daughter she claimed she was on a mini-vacation in Jacksonville, Florida. She . subsequently claimed that she had left the child with a babysitter and . returned to find both mysteriously gone. When Caylee’s disappearance was . discovered Casey claimed to have mounted an investigation of her own. On . 15 July her mother Cindy made three 911 calls, reporting her . granddaughter as missing and infamously stating in one, ‘I found my . daughter’s car today and it smelt like there had been a damn body in the . car.’ It . was, according to Mr Mason, a statement never borne out by forensic . evidence and yet, in spite of Casey’s ultimate acquittal that statement . continues to be a defining moment in the minds of many who reacted with . outrage at the not guilty verdict. Insight: Despite being acquitted, Casey Anthony has not been forgiven the crime by the American public, who largely believe she got away with murder, says Mason in his new book . In a methodical survey of the trial and coverage Mr Mason has knocked down what he presents as prevailing myths that cling to the case and point to Casey’s ‘guilt’. He has dismissed reports that Caylee’s head was bound in duct tape as a ‘distortion’ and untrue, pointed to the fact that no blood or incriminating stains were ever found in Casey’s car, or clothes and no toxic substances found on Caylee’s hair, or dirt similar to that of the discovery site found on Casey’s shoes or clothes. Exactly where, and when, the body was found is, according to Mr Mason a key and contentious point. Caylee’s remains were finally, officially, found in December 2008. In fact meter reader Ron Kronk first reported finding human remains there in August 2008. Breathtakingly, Mr Mason has pointed out, that the Sheriff’s office failed to follow up on the report at a time when the nation was gripped with the search for the toddler whom many hoped might still be alive. The area had already been searched on multiple occasions and Mr Kronk’s report was dismissed. It was only his persistence and return to the site that led to law enforcement following through and the grim discovery being made official. According to Mr Mason the fact that the . exact location where Caylee was discovered had been searched on multiple . occasions before Mr Kronk’s first report suggests that the body had not . been missed – it just hadn’t been there. He . is clear in his assertion that the body had been placed there somewhere . between the time of Casey’s arrest and its discovery. As Casey could . not possibly have done this from her jail cell Mr. Mason points to this . as proof of there having been another involved. The . prosecution suggested that the area had been under water when initially . searched. When their expert witness, an hydrologist, did not . corroborate this theory, Mr. Mason reveals, they simply did not call . him. Mr. Kronk was not called either. Similarly Mr. Mason points to the . prosecution’s assertion that a software search programme had revealed . that Casey had searched the word chloroform 84 times on her computer. Though the cause of death has never been established this was presented . as damning evidence. But the . expert who had testified to this in court had also subsequently informed . the prosecution that this was a mistake and that the data was wrong. In . fact there was only one search. The . defense team asked for that testimony to be removed and the jury made . aware of the mistake. The motion was denied by a court that, according . to Mr. Mason, was prejudiced against Casey and caught up in the media . circus that surrounded the trial from the start. Vanished: When Caylee¿s disappearance was discovered, Casey claimed to have mounted an investigation of her own . Public condemnation: Mason says that because of the prosecution and unfair media coverage, many believe Casey Anthony murdered her child, despite her being acquitted by a jury . During the trial Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi went on television and asserted her belief in Casey’s guilt – conduct which Mr. Mason has slammed as ‘reprehensible, unethical and grossly unprofessional.’ In an amusing aside Mr. Mason has revealed how he attempted to weed out potentially bias jurors with a simple enquiry as to whether or not they watched HNL’s Nancy Grace. An admission to doing so was enough to guarantee exclusion from the jury. On one occasion, Mr. Mason writes: ‘We noticed that Ms. Grace herself was in the courtroom …During a round of interviewing that was already going very well, I said to the prospective juror, “Ma’am, I realize that the question I’m about to ask you, and your answer, may prove to be very embarrassing to yourself; but remember, no one here knows your name, nor can they see your face, and I do need to know the answer.”’ Pausing for effect in the now silent courtroom Mr. Mason pressed on, ‘Ma’am, as hard as it might be to admit, do you watch Nancy Grace?”’ When the woman answered, ‘No’ to spontaneous laughter in the court Ms. Grace ‘stormed out slamming the door.’ But there were few moments of levity in the case that held the nation in thrall and exerts a powerful hold over the popular imagination to this day. One of the . most shocking days, for Mr. Mason, was the very opening of the trial . when defense attorney Jose Baez set out Casey’s allegations that her . father had abused her and the prosecution called George Anthony to the . stand and asked him about the claims made in Mr. Baez’s opening . statement. George Anthony testified that he was ‘appalled’ by the allegations, which he claimed never to have heard before. Two . and a half years earlier when the jail letters containing the . allegations first became known, Mr. Mason has no revealed that he called . George Anthony into his office to inform him of them ‘man to man.’ Convoluted: Defense attorney Dorothy Clay Sims displays a crime scene photo during the 2011 trial. Mason says a man reported a body in the area where Caylee's body was found but police failed to follow it up . Most hated woman in America: Casey Anthony (pictured after being acquitted) and her defense team still receive threats, three years after she was found not guilty . To Mr. Mason’s great surprise Anthony did not react, at all. He then called in Casey’s mother, Cindy, to tell her of her daughter’s claims. In a meeting which he has now described as ‘one of the most uncomfortable of my career,’ Mrs. Anthony wept openly at her daughter’s claims. In what Mr. Mason refers to as a ‘parade of truth’ he points to the witness who took to the stand admitting a long-term affair with George Anthony and stating that ‘Caylee’s death was an accident that snowballed out of control.’ But Casey’s acquittal has had little impact on the public hostility which still burns fiercely and sees Casey living a life ‘in hiding’ to this day. As an example of her ‘courage’ and innocence Mr. Mason points to the fact that the most vocal opponent of a plea deal, in a case in which conviction could mean the death penalty, was Casey herself. After just 11 hours of deliberation the jury acquitted Casey of the murder charges and convicted her on four counts of lying to detectives. Ultimately the court reversed two of the four counts but by then Casey had already served time for the wrongful convictions. In January 2013 she filed for bankruptcy claiming about $1,100 in assets and $792,000 in liabilities.Today she lives in an undisclosed location in Florida in what Mr. Mason describes as ‘her present chainless imprisonment.’ 'Justice in America: How the Media and Prosecutors Stack the Deck Against the Accused' by Cheney Mason is out today, published by Title Town $24.95 .","'Justice in America' by defense attorney Cheney Mason out today .

"The parents of Florida 'cop killer' Brandon Goode, have broken their silence to offer their 'heartfelt sympathies' and a desperate apology to the family of the officer gunned down by their son and his British born girlfriend, MailOnline can report. In an emotional statement Ricke and Connie Goode, told of their 'unimaginable pain.' Mr Goode said: 'We are heartbroken and overwhelmed with grief. 'We cannot understand the senseless loss of Officer German's life, the death of Alexandria Hollinghurst and for our family, the loss of our 18 year old son, Brandon.' Devastated: The mother, pictured, and father of Florida 'cop killer' Brandon Goode, have spoken out after the death of their son, right, and his British born girlfriend Alex . Suicide note: Brandon Goode left an apologetic suicide note, pictured, to his parents who he claimed to love very much . Alex and Goode shot Officer Robert . German, 31, in the early hours of Saturday morning in Windermere, . Florida after the teen couple went on a rampage that ended with the . police officer's death and their own apparent suicides. Speaking . on behalf of himself and his ex-wife, Connie, with whom their son lived . Mr Goode said: 'Words do not exist to express the measure of our sorry . and sadness. 'Our . deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and . family of Officer German. We are so, so sorry for them for what happened . and they will be forever in our prayers.' He . continued: 'We know a community grieves and like everyone else in our . community we ourselves are struggling to understand this most horrifying . tragedy.' Hopes that . footage from Officer German's body camera might shed light on the final . moments of both him and the teenagers were yesterday dashed when it . emerged that the camera was switched off. The Medical Examiner's report is still pending. And so, according to Mr Goode: 'We . have no answers only questions. Whether mental illness or substance . abuse or something else, we are a family searching.' Victim: Windermere, Fla., Police Department Officer Robert German was shot and killed early March 22, 2014,  after stopping Alex and Brandon and calling for help in an Orlando suburb . He . continued: 'The pain were are each experiencing is unimaginable. There . is a young step brother and step sister that desperately need solitude . and love.' Mr and Mrs . Goode said that they were cooperating fully with the law enforcement as . they 'mourn their fallen brother,' in a situation in which 'too many . have been hurt already.' The . statement comes after Alexandria Hollinghurst's grandfather revealed to . MailOnline that the girl's father had a violent showdown with Goode . just hours before the couple took off on a rampage that ended with . German's death and their own. David . Hollinghurst revealed his son Tom's desperate last-ditch bid to put an . end to the 18-year-old's relationship with his daughter backfired . miserably. He said the . family had watched in despair as his 'beautiful granddaughter' went off . the rails – stealing, 'vanishing off' and getting into drugs. And he has exposed a fantastical plot hatched by the teens to steal a boat, sail it to Panama and live on a beach. Speaking . from his home in Okeechobee, Florida, Mr Hollinghurst, 61, said: 'Alex . had vanished off in the night late on Wednesday and on Thursday Tom went . round to Goode's mother’s house and found Brandon there. 'He told me he yelled at him so all the neighbors could hear. He said he was going to have him charged with statutory rape if he came near his daughter again. 'Goode wanted Tom to punch him so that he could report him for assault but Tom didn't.' MailOnline first told how Hollinghurst had been reported missing by her mother, Debra, on Thursday, March 20, only to return when the police officer responding to the call was out interviewing her in the family home. But Mr Hollinghurst claimed: 'She came back but only so she could take what she could before running off with him again.' According to Mr Hollinghurst, his granddaughter stole a computer, jewelry and 'anything else she could sell,' before disappearing one final time some time during the night. He tearfully recalled: 'She'd been acting stupid like that for a while, vanishing off and coming back.' Mr . Hollinghurst, a former truck driver from Manchester who moved to the . States in 1995, explained that he initially assumed this time would be . no different. But he said: 'Tom phoned me on Saturday night at 7pm. He said, ""They found her dad."" 'I said, ""Where is she?"" Heartbroken: David Victor Hollinghurst, grandfather of Alexandria Hollinghurst, pictured on his front porch at his home in Okeechobee, Florida . Happier times: Tom Hollinghurst, Alex and Debra in Blackpool, UK . 'He just said, ""She f***ing dead."" I just shouted, ""No!""' The teenage lovers' bodies were found in the Orlando suburb of Windemere 100 yards from where officer Robert German was shot in the head. They apparently killed the 31-year-old cop after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood Saturday morning. Mr Hollinghurst described the days since that awful moment as 'one terrible time warp. It's like one long day. It never ends.' Asked whether he believed his granddaughter had taken her own life or was killed by her boyfriend, Mr Hollinghurst admitted he no longer knew what Alex was capable of. He said: 'They found out that the pair of them had planned to go down to Clearwater and steal a boat then sail it to Panama and live on a beach somewhere. 'I don't know what she was capable of. I don't know what he was capable of.' Using her wiles: Alex's grandfather said the teen (right) was very pretty and knew she could use her charms to get whatever she wanted from her father . Lovers' plot: Alex (left) and her boyfriend allegedly planned to steal a boat, sail it to Panama and live on a beach . When he heard his granddaughter was missing, he admitted, he half expected her to turn up at his home and feared her boyfriend would kill him. He knew that her parents had struggled to control her in recent months. He said: 'She was such a beautiful little girl, the cutest thing and she knew it. She was always pretty and she could get whatever she wanted from her dad. 'But she'd started stealing. She'd started with the drugs. She was so bright, so beautiful. She could have been anything.' Apple of dad's eye: Alex's father, Tom Hollinghurst, was devoted to his daughter and nicknamed her 'Stick' because of her thin build . Mr Hollinghurst said that while Alex's relationship with her mother was strained, Tom, 42, was 'devoted' to the daughter he nicknamed 'Stick' because of her slender frame and she to him. He said: 'Tom loved his girls – Debra and Hannah and Alex. He adopted Georgia the oldest, Debra had her already. 'He called them his ""girly gang."" They could get him to do anything.' He said that Alex was 'good as gold' until last fall when she began getting into trouble. He said: 'She disappeared off with her boyfriend just before Christmas and had only showed up at home again recently.

"A former-Philadelphia man received a $490,000 settlement after he claims cops took him on an abusive ride in a police van and left him with a broken neck. James McKenna, 36, said that off-duty police officers told their colleagues to 'f*** this guy up' after calling those on-duty to arrest McKenna for 'belligerent' conduct outside a Center City bar in June 2011. James McKenna, 36, said that after being dangerously tossed around four times in the back of the police van, he could't 'muster up the strength' to get up . McKenna underwent surgery and was hospitalized for 11 days after the incident left him with hree broken neck vertebrae and two ruptured neck disks . McKenna told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the officers tossed him into a police van that sped along then came to abrupt stops knocking McKenna to the floor until his neck was broken. McKenna was handcuffed but unrestrained in the vehicle. 'I went down two or three times,' McKenna told the Inquirer. After the fourth fall, McKenna said, he couldn't get up. 'I couldn't muster the strength.' Hospital records obtained by the Inquirer appear to partially confirm McKenna's claims stating: 'While being transported, [patient] hit his own head against divider as reported by arriving officers' and 'hit head on police car door.' Police involved reportedly said that McKenna was drunk and belligerent and he injured himself by banging his head against cell bars. However, the Inquirer reports that McKenna's lawyer, Thomas J. Gibbons, presented a doctor's expert opinion as part of the lawsuit in which the doctor said that McKenna's injuries were far too serious to have been self-inflicted. McKenna has since moved to Quincy, Mass. telling the Inquirer that he no longer feels safe in Philadelphia . The  officers involved consistently denied being at fault for McKennas injuries and claim McKenna was drunk and caused harm to himself. Police say they arrested McKenna after he drunkenly punched a bartender. McKenna denies that saying the officer attacked him from behind because he didn't like how McKenna spoke to a woman at the bar. Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey repeatedly denied to comment on the issue, according to the Inquirer. The police vans have seat belts that prisoners are expected to hold on to during the ride. McKenna was handcuffed but unrestrained in the vehicle and was tossed to the ground multiple times. McKenna's suit lists three broken neck vertebrae and two ruptured neck disks as McKenna's injuries. He reportedly spent 11 days in the hospital and underwent surgery, but still suffers from limited mobility in his left arm and hand, according to the Inquirer. 'This settlement is a vindication for him,' Gibbons told the Inquirer Tuesday. The city agreed to pay the settlement in order to resolve a suit brought by McKenna more than two years ago. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey repeatedly denied to comment on the issue . McKenna has since moved to Quincy, Massachusetts, telling the Inquirer that he no longer feels safe in Philadelphia. The vehicle's restraining belts are a recent change to the wagon, the Inquirer reports. The change came following a 2001 investigation of abusive rides in the wagons as a witness-free way for police officers to punish suspects.","James McKenna, 36, suffered three broken neck vertebrae and two ruptured neck disks .

"The horrific details of the hazing that forced one New Jersey high school to cancel their football team's season have finally been revealed. A parent of a player in the football program at Sayreville War Memorial High School claims that seniors on the team would turn off the lights in the locker room, pin a freshman, stick their finger into the freshman's rectum and, at times, then put that finger in the young man's mouth. This happened on a near daily basis according to the report. Scroll down for video . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.' One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. The Middlesex County Prosecutor said it was investigating a report that seniors on the Sayreville High School football team hazed freshmen in various forms - some of which could be considered sexual assault . 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey cancelled their entire football season earlier this week amid reports of hazing and bullying .

"Omar Hussain, circled, pictured in Syria, where he has been injured in a gunfight . A British jihadi flew out of Britain to fight for Islamic State (IS), despite being stopped by airport police who knew he was suspected of planning to join the terror group in Syria. Extremist Omar Hussain told The Mail on Sunday how he caught a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul, despite being arrested by counter-terrorism officers and questioned about his travel to Turkey. The story of how Hussain, a former Morrisons supermarket security guard, left Britain under the noses of police officers came in an extraordinary ‘interview’ with The Mail on Sunday – conducted via Facebook – in which he revealed he was injured in a gunfight in Syria. Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was detained at Gatwick because six months earlier he had tried to fly from Heathrow to Pakistan, but was stopped by detectives suspicious he would then fly on to Syria to ‘take part in terrorist activity’. During the Heathrow arrest in June 2013, Hussain’s house was raided and his British passport confiscated for three months. But astonishingly, in late December, he was allowed by police to board a flight to Istanbul, even though Turkey was already a well-trodden route used by British jihadis to reach Syria. His account came as security chiefs and the Government are planning stricter legislation to prevent would-be terrorists leaving the country for groups such as IS. Hussain’s revelation was described as ‘shocking’ by former Government anti-terror advisor Lord Carlile, who called for a full inquiry into the details. Boasting that he had twice given British police the slip, Hussain displayed contempt for anti-terror officers last week, adding: ‘Just shows how easily deceived these police can b. I bet the 2 police who stopped me and questioned me r getting sacked. Lol.’ Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile said: ‘It is actually shocking that somebody who was stopped previously and prevented from travelling was able to travel to Turkey unimpeded a few months later, and is now shown to be, beyond any doubt, involved in violent Islamist Jihad. ‘This is the sort of case I would hope would be looked into by the Home Affairs select committee in order that some deep digging can be done to find out what’s gone wrong. ‘It is absolutely clear to anyone who has any real experience in airport security that much more joined-up working is needed.’ Hussain also sent The Mail on Sunday a collection of photographs which showed him in Syria, posing with children toting AK-47 assault rifles. Another showed him with a bandaged arm, taken, he said, after he had been injured in a gun battle with the more moderate Free Syrian Army forces, also fighting the Assad regime. Scroll down for video . Hussain told The Mail on Sunday how he caught a flight from Gatwick to Istanbul, despite being arrested by counter-terrorism officers . Last month, we exposed Hussain’s real identity after he gave an interview under a false name on BBC’s Newsnight, in which he said: ‘The only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.’ He refused to disclose where in Syria he was, but the location setting on his Facebook account showed him in Al-Bab, near Aleppo, an area under partial IS control. Hussain , who is British-Pakistani, issued a chilling warning that if the UK joined bombing campaigns with the US, there would be terror attacks within mainland Britain. He said: ‘I cannot say for certain what the consequences will be. However, no doubt the UK will be prone to attack from within.’ Hussain gloated over how he gave police the slip en route to Syria by flying from Gatwick to Istanbul . The jihadi also revealed how he or fellow British terrorists can return to the UK from Syria to launch attacks without being caught by the authorities. He said: ‘There are many loopholes in your system. What’s preventing me from going to India or Pakistan and coming back to the UK with someone else’s passport through a student visa? There are many ways I can return.’ When asked if British jihadis have already returned to the UK to launch attacks, he said ominously: ‘All I can say is no comment. There are certain things I cannot say.’ David Cameron has said that returning jihadis pose the ‘greatest and deepest’ security threat facing Britain today, but plans to deal with them are still unclear and no firm commitment has yet been made to new legislation to bar their return. Last month, the terror threat level was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’, meaning an attack is highly likely. He formerly worked at a Morrisons supermarket but refused to comment on whether British jihadis had returned to launch attacks . As Hussain gave his interview over the course of last week, British Muslim leaders condemned an IS video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines by a masked man with a London accent, dubbed Jihadi John. In the same video, Jihadi John showed captive taxi driver Alan Henning, 47, from Eccles, Manchester, whom he threatened to behead. Hussain said he supported the killing as it has been sanctioned by IS scholars, saying: ‘As for beheading Alan Henning, then I trust the scholars of IS in their judgment.’ Neither the Metropolitan Police nor Sussex Police would comment on Hussain’s claims. l About 66,000 refugees, mainly Syrian Kurds, have crossed into Turkey in just 24 hours, Turkish deputy prime minister Numan Kurtulmus revealed yesterday. Turkey opened its border on Friday to Syrians fleeing the Kurdish town of Kobane, where an attack by IS is feared to be imminent.

"Rachael Owhin, 23, raised nearly £11,000 in eight days after discovering she could not afford her tuition fees at Oxford University . An Oxford student who set up a fundraising page to raise money for her Masters degree has raised nearly £11,000 in eight days. Rachael Owhin, from Brent, London, was ecstatic after receiving an offer to study a MSc in migration studies at the Oxford University in March. But after she was turned down for a scholarship, the 23-year-old spent  three months worrying that her savings and bank loan would not cover the extortionate tuition fees - a staggering £18,110. She had saved £6,000 herself, and her mother lent her £2,000, but she was still £10,000 short. In an ambitious bid to raise enough money Miss Owhin, a law graduate at Sussex University, set up a profile on crowd-funding site Hubbub with the slogan ‘£10,000 in ten days’. She used #Oxford10000 to generate interest on social media, and rewarded people who donated to her cause. She promised that a £10 donation would get a public thank you on Twitter. Donors who gave £1,000 were rewarded with a formal invitation to a dinner at Wolfson College, Oxford. The page received 197 donations in just eight days, and her total now stands at £10,916 - meaning she can afford the tuition fees. One anonymous donor left £1,002 after seeing the campaign on Twitter. Her involvement as a mentor at the Powerlist Foundation - which provides career support for people from disadvantaged backgrounds - also led to a generous donation from Dragons Den star Piers Linney, who is one of the foundation’s trustees. Miss Owhin, whose mother works for a charity which helps disadvantaged children in the UK and Africa fund their education, said: ‘Going to Oxford is the fulfilment of all my dreams. ‘When they sent me the offer, they told me to apply for a scholarship for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. 'I thought I had a good chance of getting the scholarship but in June I found out I didn’t. I went to the toilet and cried - my dream became a nightmare. Scroll down for video . Miss Owhin, who volunteered at the 2012 Olympics, started a crowd-funding page after the university told her she would not be receiving a scholarship . Using the Twitter hashtag #Oxford10000, Miss Owhin's crowd-funding page was inundated with donations . ‘I had looked at crowd-funding, but I thought it was so ineffective. I needed serious money. ‘I did some research and decided that with the right social media campaign it was worth setting up a site. My sister came up with the hashtag idea in the shower. 'On the first day, one of my Tweets got over 700 retweets - thank god for Twitter. It’s amazing to see how social media can be used for good.’ Miss Owhin added: ‘Oxford had no way to help. I’ve called them so often and numerous times they’ve told me to just apply next year. That’s such a horrible thing to say, to have only one option. ‘There’s nothing in place to support minority students that can’t afford the course. The tuition fees are a huge burden for someone who isn’t wealthy. '£18,000, not to mention living costs, is extortionate. Most people can’t afford that.’ Miss Owhin will have to pay a total of £18,000 for her MSc in migration studies at Oxford, which starts soon . The 23-year-old saved £6,000 herself, and her mother lent her £2,000 - leaving her £10,000 short . An Oxford University spokesman said: ‘Fundraising for postgraduate scholarships is one of the University’s key priorities and this year over 1,000 fully-funded scholarships were available from the University, its colleges and supporters for new master’s and doctoral students in 2014-15. ‘But for the many aspiring graduate students who do not receive scholarships, it can be very difficult to find the money for their studies and we hope that more can be done at a national level to ensure postgraduate study is open to all.’ Other students hoping to complete a masters degree at Oxford have also had to turn to crowd-funding. Emily-Rose Eastop raised over £26,000 on Hubbub in July so she could study a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology. And Zu Barbie hopes to raise nearly £60,000 so she can complete a two-year MPhil in political theory. To make a further donation to Rachael’s studies, visit her donation page.

"A second division team in Brazil is resorting to hypnosis to try to avoid relegation. Portuguesa this week announced the hiring of a hypnosis specialist to work with the players, hoping he will help them improve their performance and lead the team out of last place in the standings.

Brazil national coach Luis Felipe Scolari also recruited staff to help his players mentally cope with the expectation of a home World Cup . With 10 rounds left, Portuguesa is 12 points behind the first team out of relegation zone.

"An alleged terrorist who is accused of killing four people outside a Jewish museum may hold the key to identifying ‘Jihadi John’, the Briton who beheaded two American hostages and is threatening to kill British captive David Haines. Security sources last night confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche had been questioned about the Briton, who appeared in two horrific beheading videos, after it emerged the Frenchman himself tortured Western hostages in Syria. A former French hostage said that Nemmouche was guarding the same prison which kept Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and where 'Jihadi John' also worked along with three other British terrorists, who were nicknamed ‘the Beatles’. Scroll down for video . Security sources last night confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche had been questioned about the Briton, who appeared in two horrific beheading videos, after it emerged the Frenchman himself tortured Western hostages in Syria . Mr Foley and Mr Sotloff were killed by Jihadi John in two videos released by the terror group Islamic State (IS). In the second, he threatened to kill Mr Haines, 44. A British security source has said that information gleaned from Nemmouche by French and Belgian intelligence agents about Jihadi John and other British captors has been passed to MI5 and the FBI, who are frantically trying to identify the terrorist. Nemmouche, 29, will stand trial on Thursday for the murders of an Israeli couple, a Frenchwoman and a Belgian, who were killed after he allegedly sprayed bullets at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May. The French-Algerian spent a year in Syria fighting jihad for IS before returning to Europe to launch the attack in Brussels. He was guarding an IS prison in Aleppo where most Western hostages were kept. French journalist Nicolas Henin was one of those inside. He told his magazine, Le Point, this weekend that one of the captors was Nemmouche, who was particularly fond of torturing prisoners. ‘When Nemmouche wasn’t singing, he was torturing people,’ said Mr Henin, 39. ‘Every night, blows would start raining down in the room where I myself had been interrogated. The torture went on all night long.’ French hostage Nicolas Henin arrives at the Villacoublay military airbase, outside Paris after being released in April this year . Mr Henin, who along with three other French journalists – Pierre Torres, Didier Francois and Edouard Elias – was released in April after a year in captivity, said he was also abused. ‘He looked at his hands, cracked his fingers like a boxer and adjusted his gloves,’ said Mr Henin, adding that Nemmouche used to ask him, ‘You see these motorbike gloves? I bought them to hit you. Only for you. Do you like them?’ All four have identified Nemmouche – who comes from the Roubaix area and spent at least a year in Syria as an IS militant – as one of the captors. Marie-Laure Ingouf, a lawyer for Mr Henin, said: ‘All the hostages confirm it. They all lived with him for several months.’ Nicolas Henin described how James Foley had endured tougher treatment from captors because of his U.S. citizenship, but always behaved with courage and dignity .","Sources have confirmed that Mehdi Nemmouche had been questioned .

"Accusing: Christopher Salmon said the Plebgate affair was 'uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy' An elected Crime Commissioner has accused Britain’s police forces of being ‘feral.’ Christopher Salmon has waded into the Plebgate row by saying that the scandal that led Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell to resign ‘appears uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy’. Mr Salmon, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed Powys, said: ‘The culture around them  [police forces] is too closed, too defensive, too politicised and, in some cases, feral. ‘In our ancient democracy, an elected Minister has had his career ruined by what appears uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy. It doesn’t get much more serious.’ He added: ‘For the sake of all those dedicated officers who wince every time they read a Plebgate headline, we must break open that culture. That requires greater transparency and fresh leadership.’ Mr Salmon’s comments came as it emerged that a senior police officer blocked disciplinary action against three officers who forced Mr Mitchell to resign, that an officer who investigated them will appear before MPs, and that a review of how the Met police handled the Plebgate affair has not been made public. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after an argument with officers at Downing Street who refused to let him ride his bike through its gates. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling the officers ‘f***ing plebs’ – a claim he has always denied. Mr Salmon’s comments came as it emerged: . The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to charge five of the officers involved after they were arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and unauthorised disclosure to the media. Mr Salmon, 35 - an Oxford-educated former Army officer who served in Kosovo and Iraq before becoming a businessman - made his comments after a week-long row between the chief constables of West Mercia, Staffordshire and West Midlands, and the watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The IPCC has accused the chief constables of refusing to discipline three officers - Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones - who held a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency and then allegedly lied about what he had said to force him to resign. West Mercia Police launched an investigation helped by Warwickshire Police and West Midlands Police, and supervised by the IPCC. Last week, IPCC deputy chief Deborah . Glass revealed that the West Mercia report first recommended the three . officers should be disciplined, but a later version said they should . not. 'Politicised': In the wake of the scandal police officers protested budget cuts outside Mr Mitchell's constituency office . The IPCC then ordered West Mercia to discipline the officers but it was ignored. The Mail on Sunday has established that the Deputy Chief Constable of West Mercia, Simon Chesterman, blocked the disciplinary action. Plebgate: Officers accused Mr Mitchell of insulting them when they did not open a gate for him to cycle through . The row is likely to escalate this week as the three chief constables - David Shaw of West Mercia; Andy Parker of Warwickshire and Chris Sims of West Midlands - face the Home Affairs Select Committee. This weekend it emerged that a church-going policeman, Inspector Jeremy Reakes-Williams, wrote the West Mercia report, recommending disciplinary action. But a month later, his recommendation was changed. He has also been ordered to appear before the Committee. Separately, this newspaper has established that Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe ordered Greater Manchester Police to conduct a review into its initial handling of Plebgate. The probe was completed in June, but Scotland Yard has refused to make it public even though Sir Bernard said the review was ordered to create ‘more openness’. Last night a Met spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to comment on the review in any detail at this time.’ Dominic Raab, the Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘The danger in not releasing this information is that it will fuel fears  of another level of cover-up.’","Christopher Salmon, Police and Crime Comissioner for Dyfed Powys Police, said the culture around police officers was too secretive .

"Online suspicions: Jeremy Clarkson with his second wife Frances Cain . Jeremy Clarkson employed a companycaught up in the ‘Soca files’ blagging scandalto unmask an ‘online weirdo’ who had targetedhis family, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The BBC host used the investigators to stop the man from distressing a member of his family after he posed as a British soldier who claimed to have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Clarkson, who has three children, was suspicious of the online contact and called in investigators to try to unmask him. He described the man as a ‘terrible online weirdo’ who had targeted a member of his family on the internet. But he declined to give any further details about the targeting, only saying it wasn’t of a sexual nature. The presenter and columnist had turned to a company which has worked with a private detective convicted of a conspiracy to ‘blag’ personal information for blue chip clients and wealthy individuals. The company, Greymans, now known as Optimal Risk, specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and high net worth individuals discreetly. The Mail on Sunday has established that Greymans used the services of corrupt detective John Spears, who was imprisoned last year after an operation led by the Serious OrganisedCrime Agency (SOCA). Mr Spears and three other private detectives all pleaded guilty to being involved in a conspiracy to trick banks and government agencies into handing over personal information about individuals. It is believed that Greymans is on the SOCA list of the 102 companies and individuals linked tothe criminal investigators which has been passed to the Commons select committee. In the Clarkson case, a source close to the firm claimed that Greymans used a private investigator to ‘blag’ the address of the ‘soldier’ by using a telephone number supplied by the man to a member of the family. There is no suggestion that Greymans or Clarkson were aware that the private detective obtainedany information illegally. Spotted: Jeremy Clarkson was pictured kissing former beautician and masseuse Phillipa Sage on a Greek island . Last night, Mr Clarkson, 53, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘About four years ago a member of my familywas . contacted by a terrible online weirdo which was very shocking indeed. I . became suspicious when I found out that the person who was targeting . the family member claimed to be a soldier. ‘His story simply didn’t ring true. For example he said he was sent to Afghanistan straight from Iraq– and I know that doesn’t happen. So we decided to bring in a private investigation company. That firm was called Greymans.’ He . went on: ‘They made some preliminary investigations and then reported . to us advising that we needed to urgently contact the police and that is . exactly what we did. The . family member received some guidance about handling communications with . the weirdo. But the matter was resolved very quickly by the police and I . am very grateful to them.’ Mr Clarkson added: ‘I do not know how the private investigators discovered the identity of the weirdo.And . I certainly wasn’t aware of any alleged unlawful conduct. Greymans did . find an address and a telephone number but I don’t know how this was . done. They simply reported back to us to advise calling in the police. As with any family, we are all just grateful that this shocking thing is . over.’ Founded by . Falklands veteran and ex-Parachute Regiment Major Mike O’Neill, 56, . Greymans was formed in 1993 and boasts that its clients include . multinationals, finance houses and law firms. Greymans last night failed to respond to questions about the Clarkson case. Last . week, Mr Clarkson was holidaying with the former beautician and . masseuse Phillipa Sage on the Greek island of Mykonos where they were . seen kissing in full view of other holidaymakers. The . presenter, who is reported to have earned more than £3 million last . year from his television work, cut a relaxed figure in a floral shirt, . blue shorts and blue driving loafers, while Ms Sage wore a striped . bikini. The blonde, who is employed by Brand Events, the firm behind Top Gear, and works as a freelanceron Top Gear Live, looked comfortable in Clarkson’s close-knit circle. Mr Clarkson’s second wife of 20 years, Frances Cain, was nowhere to be seen. In .

"One of Labour’s rising stars was last night accused of thwarting a mission to save the British doctor who died in a Syrian jail. The grieving family of Dr Abbas Khan, 31, claimed that Chuka Umunna – Dr Khan’s MP – told a delegation not to travel to Damascus to lobby for his release. Last night Streatham MP Umunna released a statement in which he insisted that he had done everything in his power to help Dr Khan. The family of Dr Abbas Khan, including mother Fatima and brother Afrozi, has said Labour MP Chuka Umunna stopped a delegation travelling to Syria to lobby for their son's release . Syrian officials, who have been accused of torturing the doctor, claimed that he ‘committed suicide’ by hanging himself with his pyjamas in the state interrogation centre in Damascus last week. The Syrian regime handed the body to the International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday, who took it by road to Beirut, from where it will be flown back to the UK. Mr Umunna, who is shadow Business Secretary, has said he did everything in his power to help Khan . The surgeon, who was a specialist registrar at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, North-West London, went to the Turkish-Syrian border in October 2012 to treat wounded refugees. He then crossed the border into Syria and began working in a field hospital in the war-ravaged city of Aleppo treating civilians. He was arrested within 48 hours by government forces as he did not have a valid visa. His arrest came at a time when hundreds of Britons were suspected of entering Syria to join Al Qaeda. No evidence has emerged that  Dr Khan had any involvement  with militants. Dr Khan’s sister Sara, 24, said that her family had expected Mr Umunna to discuss Dr Khan’s case with David Cameron. ‘He could have got my brother released much earlier as he could have pressed the Foreign Office to help,’ she said. Another member of the Khan family described Mr Umunna as a ‘chicken MP’. Dr Khan died just days before a delegation of British parliamentarians were due to visit Damascus to secure his release. The family say the group was initially due to fly out last month, but accused Mr Umunna of ‘sabotaging’ the plan by warning MPs about the safety risks. Labour MP Dave Anderson, who was going to lead the delegation, confirmed that he was advised by Mr Umunna not to travel. Mr Anderson said: ‘I then took further advice from a number of people, friends of mine who have got interests out there, and they said I would be OK.’ Outspoken MP George Galloway, who was involved in negotiating for the release of Dr Khan, said of Mr Umunna: ‘He was the dog which didn’t bark. Dr Khan was imprisoned in Syria after going to treat wounded civilians and was due to be released before the Syrian government claimed he hung himself . 'I don’t know why he was reluctant to get involved... Was it because of the false tittle-tattle around Parliament that Abbas was a Jihadi? I hope not.’ Mr Umunna said in a statement: ‘For over 12 months now I have  been in contact with members of  his family and the Foreign Office, doing what I can to assist the family as they have tried to secure  his release.’ The Foreign Office said: ‘We consistently sought consular access to Dr Khan and information on his detention. These requests were consistently ignored.’ Last night Dr Khan’s mother, Fatima, 57, was seen leaving the morgue in Beirut where her son’s body was being kept. Clearly distressed, she said: ‘They’ve killed my baby.’ The body was later transferred to the British Embassy in Beirut and was due to be flown to the UK today. As Dr Khan’s body was driven out of Syria yesterday a British medical convoy of 50 ambulances were heading into the country from Turkey. Dr Abbas Khan, the British Muslim surgeon who risked his life to save women and children in the Syrian inferno, is far more than an isolated hero or martyr. He is a rallying figure – a symbol of all that is decent and humane in the vast majority of the Muslim population throughout the world. Hence his martyrdom must not be merely acknowledged as an independent incident; he should be elevated into a figure of world importance. Dr Abbas Khan was due to be released on Friday after being arrested in Syria last year . His name should be perpetuated posthumously, perhaps by awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize, or putting his name to an institute for research on human rights, conflict resolution or countering radicalism. It would be a fitting tribute. I believe that the terrible story  of his imprisonment, which included sadistic treatment and torture, demands a clear and uncompromising attitude from all who wish to avenge it and prevent continuing practices of this kind. World opinion must reflect the fact that Dr Khan represents the best in universal values while at the same time intensifying an implacable and merciless fight against Jihadism and extremism. There must be no excuses for slacking in this respect. The treatment of this family man, tortured and killed in prison, defies description. I resent people telling me that it is something from the Middle Ages; it is not. The Middle Ages included some highlights of civilisation. No, this is the Stone Age plus technology. Dr Khan’s appalling case destroys the myths of the Islamophobes. It shows everyone that Muslims are on the same side as the rest of us in the fight for humanity and against extremism. This is not an argument based on partisanship for Israel, or a fear that Israel is threatened. Jihad threatens other Muslims and non-Muslims even worse than it does the Jews because they can look after themselves. Israel can ward off these attacks. But the rest of the world is not sufficiently protected because it is confused. The media has a crucial role in pointing out this international threat, a role it has not yet played. Dr Khan’s death must therefore be a clarion call to ensure there are no limits in the fight against Jihadism. Day before his death Khan wrote to his family, including son Abdullah, saying he wanted to come home . When you look at the excesses of the SS, or the Soviet torturers, even they were less brutal than the Jihadists, and less dangerous for one good reason: the Jihadist thinks he’s got God in his pocket. The Nazis and the Communists had Hitler and Stalin to look up to but the Jihadists claim to speak in the name of God, whether it be through their suicide bombers or their executions or their punishment amputations. One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria’s chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral. It ensures for Assad immunity from either military intervention or support in favour of the opposition – purely in exchange for the surrender of a chemical arsenal. An analogy would be the police saying to a mass murderer: ‘Look, if you’re prepared to show us where you keep your really sophisticated weaponry we promise that you can carry on killing in the old traditional way.’ In effect it means that Assad can continue undisturbed, supported by Russian and Iranian arms, to massacre women and children and almost certainly achieve victory. 'One cannot help feel that the so-called compromise over the dismantling of Syria's chemical weapons, brokered by Putin and accepted by Obama, is immoral' Numerous voices from the opposition are now expressing their regret at ever having taken up arms in the light of the failing support from the free world. Of course, the very convincing argument now put forward is that Assad is no worse – in some ways he may be better – than the radical extremists he is fighting. Today the situation is so terrible we don’t know which side is worse. But the point must be made that all this might have been prevented had the West, notably Obama, intervened at the outset; for instance, imposing a no-fly zone and guarding the porous frontiers against the influx of such extreme elements as Al Qaeda. The least we should achieve  now in honouring the memory of Dr Abbas Khan is to ensure that the barbarous acts against him and others are treated as a priority by all mankind.

"British detectives hunting for missing Madeleine McCann are looking for two German-speaking men whose computer-generated images will be broadcast on special TV appeals this week. Scotland Yard says the un-identified men were seen in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz at the time when Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007. Witnesses told Portuguese police who originally investigated the case that they saw two German-speaking men at the resort that day, but little or no importance was placed on them at the time. Now British detectives are keen to trace the two individuals to establish if they are connected to Madeleine’s disappearance or to eliminate them from the investigation, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. Scroll down for video . Moving: The McCanns during their Crimewatch interview to be broadcast tomorrow. They say they are hopeful . Fateful: The reconstruction will show Maddie's last game of tennis with her father before she went missing in 2007 . It will also show the moment she was taken from her holiday bed in Praia da Luz in Portugal six years ago . The E-Fit (Electronic Facial Identification Technique) images of individuals based on eyewitness reports will be broadcast on Crimewatch on BBC1 at 9pm. Similar appeals will be made on Dutch programme Opsporing Verzocht (Investigation Required) on Tuesday night, and on the German version of Crimewatch, Aktenzeichen XY . . .  Ungelost (Case Files XY . . . Unsolved) on Wednesday night, as Madeleine’s parents make an international appeal for information. Kate and Gerry McCann, both 45, will fly to Munich on Wednesday to make a live appeal from the  studios of Aktenzeichen, which is watched by five million viewers. A spokesman for the German programme said: ‘The reviewing and analysis of all available information has led to new insights and leads that, for the first time, point to Germany. Aktenzeichen shows the photofits of two men, who apparently spoke German, and to whom little or no importance was previously attached.’ The McCanns previously visited Germany in 2007 to make an appeal because a high number of German tourists were in the Algarve region when Madeleine went missing. Missing: Maddie with her younger siblings, twins Sean and Amelie, who are now eight . The latest mugshots will also be shown on Dutch TV as the two ‘German speakers’ may have been talking Dutch, as the two languages are often confused, said a police source in the Netherlands. Tomorrow’s Crimewatch programme will feature a dramatic reconstruction of the moment Madeleine went missing, giving the most detailed sequence of events ever made public that led to her disappearance from the holiday apartment where she was sleeping. The reconstruction – which includes Mr McCann’s 6pm tennis lesson when Madeleine acted as ballgirl – will be accompanied by a moving interview by presenter Kirsty Young with Kate and Gerry McCann. They talk about how much they miss Madeleine, who would be ten today. They will make a live appeal for members of the public to come forward with information. In a statement, the McCanns said: ‘We are greatly encouraged by new information coming to light, with the pieces of the jigsaw now fitting together. Kate and Gerry McCann will fly to Munich on Wednesday to make a live appeal on TV to five million viewers . The tennis match reconstruction is based on this image, which Maddie's parents distributed in a bid to find her . ‘We are really hopeful that the appeal on Crimewatch will bring further evidence which will take us a step closer to finding Madeleine.’ The Met refused to comment on whether the two men they were looking for were German-speakers, but a family friend said that detectives were on the ‘brink of a breakthrough’. The Met officer leading the investigation, Detective Inspector Andy Redwood, will make a live appeal for information on the programme. This image was released of what Maddie might look like now. The McCanns said they feel a step closer . Since Scotland Yard began reviewing the case in 2011, detectives have interviewed 442 people in 30 different countries and have drawn up a list of 41 potential suspects. Officers are pursuing 4,920 lines of inquiry, of which 2,123 had been ‘completed’.’ Detectives now believe that their ‘timeline’ holds the key to discovering what happened to Madeleine. Det Insp Redwood said: ‘Our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points. ‘I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.’","Scotland Yard were aware of the two men when Maddie went missing in 2007 .

"On the face of it, Princess Eugenie doesn’t have much in common with a US pop star renowned for her lewd behaviour on stage. But Eugenie and Miley Cyrus are united in one respect – they both seem to have perfected the rather crude dance known as ‘twerking’. The 23-year-old princess, seventh in line to the throne, has been pictured in a pose almost identical to the provocative moves Miss Cyrus controversially performed with singer Robin Thicke at a show in New York last month. Beauty and the beast: Princess Eugenie and a stuffed bear strike a similar pose to Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke at the MTV awards - as her friend Harry Wentworth-Stanley wags a disapproving finger . It was almost identical to the extravagant moves which singer Miley Cyrus famously performs . Eugenie appears to have adopted the dance’s posture – bending forward while moving her hips – in front of a stuffed bear. The . picture is believed to have been taken in a bar in the Swiss ski resort . Verbier where Eugenie was on a family holiday in February. The . image, which has just emerged, was uploaded to Instagram in March by . her friend Harry Wentworth-Stanley who appears alongside her. Former Disney star Miss Cyrus, 20, was at it again on Saturday when she gave a raunchy performance at a  festival in Las Vegas. The grainy image, showing 23-year-old Eugenie in knee-length burgundy dress, black stockings and a Tory-style blue rosette was posted in March. The break made headlines as the Yorks were joined by Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24 – and the young couple were seen hugging and kissing in public for the first time. The photograph is publicly available  on the unrestricted Instagram profile of Mr Wentworth-Stanley – the 23-year-old son of the Queen’s cousin, the Marquess of Milford Haven. At the same time, he posted six other pictures on the website – which boasts 150 million members worldwide – showing him and a group of friends enjoying the bars and restaurants of the Swiss resort. Twerking: Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke demonstrate the dance craze at the MTV awards . It is unclear whether the Princess was actually twerking in the photograph, but she adopted the dance’s distinctive posture, which requires bending forward while moving the hips . Just days after 20-year-old Cyrus – daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus – performed the  hip-hop inspired dance at the MTV Video Music Awards last month with fellow singer Robin Thicke, the word ‘twerking; found its way into the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary. Princess Eugenie’s Verbier holiday came only months after she graduated from Newcastle University with a degree in art history, English literature and politics. She is now preparing to move to New York, where she will begin working at a trendy auction house called  Paddle8 –  run by Alexander Gilkes, 34, who went to Eton with Princes William and Harry. Beatrice, meanwhile, has just finished a year working for the Cabot Square Capital finance house in  London. This is the second time in a week that a potentially embarrassing photograph has surfaced on Instagram after David Cameron was pictured snoozing on a bed, with his Ministerial Red Box lying next to him. The photograph was taken before the wedding of his sister-in-law, Alice Sheffield, and posted by her sister Emily. The bride-to-be was at the front of the picture, as a barefoot Mr Cameron slept behind her on the wood-framed four-poster bed. The picture has since been removed.","Picture of Eugenie is visible to all on the Instagram website .

"'There were legal ways.....and there were illegal ways,’ says PI . A private investigator jailed last year for paying a ‘blagger’ to steal bank details has revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at Lloyd’s of London. John Spears, a former Metropolitan Police detective, is one of four ‘rogue’ private detectives whose clients form the basis of a secret list of 102 blue-chip companies and law firms held by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). But in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, the 73-year-old investigator has dropped a heavy hint as to who is on the list, saying he was employed by three international law firms based in the City of London, who in turn were working for underwriters on Lloyd’s market. Revelation: John Spears, left, claims three international law firms could be among the 102 names on Soca's secret list. Right, Dan Summers . Spears, who served three months of an eight-month sentence after being convicted last year, said the underwriters would regularly ask him directly, or through lawyers, to carry out ‘financial investigations’  to assess the value of individuals and companies. Law firms who employed him included Herbert Smith Freehills, Richards Butler (now known as Reed Smith) and Clyde & Co. In most cases, Spears says, the enquiries were ‘entirely above board’. A lawyer working for the firm representing phone hacking victims hired private detectives who used unlawful methods to obtain sensitive information. Dan Morrison was a partner and asset-tracing specialist at Mishcon de Reya, where he was praised for his ‘aggressive approach to his cases’. In 2006 he instructed a detective agency, Carratu, to investigate the assets of businessman David Hughes. Mishcon was acting for a firm that had given Mr Hughes a loan and wanted to check his financial position. Unknown to Mr Morrison, Carratu passed some of the work to ‘enquiry agents’ Sharon and Stephen Anderson who ‘blagged’ confidential information about Mr Hughes. His bank account details were found at the couple’s address.They later pleaded guilty to more than 50 charges of obtaining information contrary to the Data Protection Act. Mr Morrison left Mishcon in 2011 and was replaced in effect by Charlotte Harris. There is no suggestion the firm, or Mr Morrison, was involved in, or aware of, any illegal activity. Mishcon cut ties with Carratu after it emerged the Andersons had acted unlawfully. Last night Miss Harris, who represented many of the Hacked Off victims, said: ‘I have never worked on a fraud investigation. I have no knowledge of this case.’ But sometimes he sub-contracted work to Dan Summers, identified in court as a ‘blagger’, who obtained sensitive information illegally. Spears and Summers, 33, were jailed last year following a Soca investigation and are at the heart of what is now known as the ‘blue-chip’ hacking scandal. The case prompted Soca to compile the secret list of names linked to the four private eyes but, despite protests from MPs, it has so far refused to release it. Soca claims it might jeopardise current and future Met investigations. The list was surrendered to Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee late . last month, but only on the strict condition that it was kept under lock . and key and not shown to the public. The agency said it has shared all its material with police, but Labour MP Keith Vaz claims below that argument was undermined when it was revealed that it only handed the list to Scotland Yard last Tuesday night. The Met said last night that Soca had been co-operating with them in handing over ‘huge quantities of electronic data from the investigation’. And a Soca spokesman said the Met had been provided with full access to . all material held by Soca, adding: ‘The operation team involved in the . preparation of the list requested that client information relating to . their ongoing investigation be removed prior to its release to the . committee.’ Spears was jailed after admitting asking Summers to obtain personal data illegally. Summers declined to comment yesterday after retreating to Cyprus with his family. Spears said Summers could ‘look at bank records... and find out if there were any payments going through’. He added: ‘You rang someone who you knew could obtain financial information. How they obtained it, one never knew. There were legal ways of obtaining it, and there were illegal ways.’ Spears believes the three law firms he has named and the Lloyd’s syndicate are on the list of names Soca compiled. The Mail on Sunday put a series of questions to Lloyd’s as well as the three law firms named by Spears. Lloyd’s said: ‘We are not going to give you a response’, while Herbert Smith Freehills and Richards Butler declined to comment. Clyde & Co said after undertaking investigations it had ‘found nothing to support the allegations’. Investigations: John Spears, jailed last year for his part in stealing bank details, claims he was regularly asked to carry out investigations for insurance institution Lloyds of London, pictured here . Comment: By Keith Vaz; Labour MP and chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee . The Home Affairs Select Committee concluded its first report into private investigators exactly one year ago. It followed public anger at the activities of some PIs who had broken the law to provide services to their clients in the newspaper industry. At that stage, it was perceived to be a media problem, although it now has become apparent that it was much more widespread. The use of PIs who have been engaging in criminality with impunity was shockingly rife as confirmed by the categories of individuals, organisations and firms in the Serious Organised Crime Agency’s secret list. Our report made several recommendations, principally the adoption of a regulatory system. It is normal practice that governments respond to Select Committee Reports within three months, but there has been a surprising dragging of feet and a strange silence from ministers. This week I was pleased to see  the Home Secretary at last announce her intention to bring in the regulation of PIs. In his inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson was asked to focus solely on the press. All major political parties have accepted his conclusions. The Prime Minister has reconfirmed his wish to extend the inquiry into a second part, primarily looking at the police. This cannot go ahead until criminal proceedings have concluded. The time taken by Leveson’s inquiry, its limited scope and the delayed response fuels the need for an all-encompassing second inquiry. The focus should also be on all those that have used PIs, not just the press and police. It is remarkable that organisations and individuals, who operate in industries which can affect your freedom, review companies’ accounts, or even appear in the pages of celebrity magazines, have been employing PIs who have been convicted of criminal activity. The clients involved are so diverse that this controversy has the potential to become even more serious than the examples shown in the first Leveson Inquiry. Following a formal request, Soca provided us with two lists of 102 names. In sending this information, Soca decided to classify it. Extended scope: The time has come to start Leveson part two and cast the net wider than the narrow remit of the press. Above, Lord Justice Brian Leveson . This prevented its publication. If we cannot publish the lists, they will remain locked up gathering dust. The only way to test the reasoning behind keeping the lists confidential is by establishing the likelihood and timescale of any new investigations. I was therefore very surprised to have received in the past 24 hours a letter from Met Police Commander Neil Basu informing me that Soca gave the lists to the Met only 96 hours ago. In other words, Soca had not even handed the lists to the Met until after we announced the publication of the categories on the list on Wednesday last week. Soca has not acted with the urgency that this matter deserves. This is even more puzzling considering the joint statement released on July 12 by Soca and the Met which stated that ‘the (Metropolitan Police Service) has been given full access to all material held by Soca’. Clearly this was not the case. It is amazing these lists were held by Soca without the police being told. Soca appears to have had the information on these lists for years and not acted upon it. Soca should review the classification on these documents and reconsider their objection to publication. In just nine weeks, Soca as a stand-alone organisation will be abolished and then form part of the new National Crime Agency. This is an excellent opportunity to clear its in tray. More than this, we need to get on and start the process for Leveson Part Two with an extended scope that goes beyond what the Prime Minister announced. Without action now, there is a danger that matters will drag on for years, or worse still, be buried for good. That would be an affront to our democracy.","Former police officer jailed last year points the finger in Soca scandal .

"A key aide of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad is to be awarded a prestigious degree by one of Britain’s top universities. Lamis Omar has been studying for a doctorate at Durham, and is likely to receive her PhD in September. Emails obtained by the Wikileaks website suggest that Ms Omar enjoys a close friendship with Assad. Something to hide? Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's close friendship with an aide has been revealed by Wikileaks . Fellow students say she had a large picture of the dictator on the wall of her home in the university grounds. Last night, officials at Durham University refused to say whether the institution has accepted money from the Assad regime in tuition fees. The emails appear to show that for the past four years, Ms Omar, who is believed to be in her mid-30s, has been working in Assad’s own department, known as the Ministry of Presidential Affairs. In more than 800 email exchanges between the pair, a picture emerges of a world of poetry and jokes, cocooned away from the bloodshed engulfing Assad’s country. They appear to have a close friendship, in which he buys her gifts and she repeatedly says that she ‘loves’ him. In the emails she refers to Assad, who has been married to British-born Asma, 37, for 12 years, as the ‘sponsor’ of her course. Is it right? Wikileaks have revealed a member of Assad's regime has been educated at Durham University . Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘Ethical questions need to be asked as to why Durham University is providing an education to a member of the Assad regime. Given the murder of thousands  of Syrians by the Assad regime, Durham should reconsider whether it awards this PhD.’ The emails were among a tranche of 2.5 million obtained by Wikileaks, a controversial website that publishes leaked documents. They were apparently written by Syrian officials and politicians, as well as Assad himself. The documents, which for the most part are written in English, reveal that Ms Omar’s official role was to translate Assad’s speeches. At Durham, her PhD thesis was on Shakespeare. Last night Durham University said: ‘We do not comment on the financial circumstances of individual students. Durham University does not have any formal or active links with the Syrian Government.’ Ms Omar could not be contacted despite repeated calls. And a spokeswoman for President Assad said she would obtain a response to the allegations. She  had not done so by the time we went to press. Helping hand: Lord Kenilworth redesigned al-Assad's summer palace, Wikileaks has revealed . A member of the House of Lords charged thousands of pounds to redesign the summer palace of Bashar al-Assad, emails obtained by Wikileaks reveal. Lord Kenilworth was hired to create a luxuriant new garden, including a spectacular water feature, at the Syrian dictator’s country residence near the coastal city of Latakia, the site of fierce fighting between government forces and rebels. The peer’s work was so highly valued he was invited to a formal meeting with Assad’s British-born wife Asma. But as violence engulfed the country, the relationship appears to have soured. Last July, Lord Kenilworth, 56, sent Assad’s office an invoice for £24,000. Two months later, he emailed a member of Assad’s inner circle, asking if he had ‘had a chance to find out when we might be able to receive payment’. The peer, known professionally as Randle Siddeley, has run a landscaping business since the mid-Eighties. The firm was commissioned by Assad in 2010. Initial stages of the work were priced at £176,500, with more bills to follow. Last night Lord Kenilworth said only: ‘We stopped working there 18 months ago. I can’t comment any further.’","Website suggests Lamis Omar enjoys close friendship with Bashar al-Assad .

"The full scale of spending on private contractors by the UK’s biggest police force is laid bare today as the nation’s most senior officer is summoned by MPs to account for millions of pounds in wasted public money. A leaked list seen by The Mail on Sunday shows the Metropolitan Police has signed deals worth £3.5 billion with more than 300 companies, to supply everything from high-tech weaponry to sandwiches. The huge sums will be scrutinised when Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe appears before a powerful group of MPs on Tuesday, with Scotland Yard under pressure to save more than £500 million without losing officers from the streets. Mounting costs: The Metropolitan Police have been criticised for their spending including £500,00 going on cleaning up horse manure . Full details of the Met’s spending with private firms, spanning more than a decade and with some contracts ongoing, reveal the force is paying out: . Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is the first time that we have received such a comprehensive list about the expenditure of a  police force. We will be exploring some of the expenditure with the Commissioner when he appears before the Committee on Tuesday.’ Joanne McCartney, chairwoman of the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘I think procurement at the Met does need to be looked at. We have raised issues with the Met’s spending on dog kennelling before. Its IT costs have been looked at before. ‘I think the budget needs to be tightened, otherwise it will mean fewer police officers being employed.’Jenny Jones, the deputy chair of the Police and Crime Committee, said: ‘Police officers tell me they see waste all the time at the Met. Aiming high: The force spent £21.1million on weapons and armour . They tell me it costs the Met £100 just to put a whiteboard up in their office. The police officers say they get angry because it means bobbies on the beat are cut back. There is waste at every level of the organisation.’ With national responsibility for counterterrorism and protecting VIPs as well as keeping Londoners safe, the Met currently has 31,548 officers, a further 2,738 police community support officers and another 20,000 civilian staff. Like other forces, it must cope with 20 per cent cuts to main Home Office funding, but the Met is yet to finalise how it will make savings totalling £548 million by 2015-16. The Met is behind schedule after the phone-hacking scandal led to the departure of three senior figures, including the Commissioner, while much of the past year was spent preparing for  the Olympics. However, although salaries account for a large proportion of bills, the Met cannot easily lose officers after London Mayor Boris Johnson made an election vow to protect police numbers. Frying squad: £920,000 went on 'bread and morning products' His Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Stephen Greenhalgh, has said that only about 500 posts will be cut and has promised to ‘sweat’ the assets and introduce ‘smarter procurement’ at an organisation he described as an ‘enormous beast’. Mr Greenhalgh told the Home Affairs Select Committee in September that he was ‘staggered’ by how much the force spends on IT. It also employs 802 in-house computer maintenance staff because counterterrorism officers are worried about the security risks of using outside external contractors. Mr Greenhalgh said the Met did  not need a ‘plethora of expensive buildings’ and spent a ‘staggering’ £200 million on running them. Last month, the force announced plans to sell its New Scotland  Yard headquarters, famous for its revolving sign, in an attempt to  save money. The reassuring presence of police stations across London is also under threat, with proposals to replace them with counters inside supermarkets and cafes. The full list of the Met’s 319 contracts with private companies, some dating back as far as 2003, suggest many more areas where the axe is likely to fall. According to the document, the total value of the listed deals is £3.5 billion. A third of this has gone on IT alone. The money spent on food and drink to be sold in canteens includes £920,000 on ‘bread and morning products’ and £148,000 on fruit squash. The outlay on weapons and armour included £3.2 million on Tasers, £7,000 on ‘grenade boxes’, £641,000 on ammunition for sniper rifles and £400,000 on Heckler & Koch pistols. A Met spokesman refused to say what its Recon Scout robots were used for on ‘security grounds’. The document also shows the force has spent more than £40,000 on storing evidence relating to their investigation into the death of Mr Litvinenko, who detectives say was killed with the poison polonium-210 in 2006. Fire power: The outlay on weapons and armour included £3.2 million on . Tasers (pictured), £7,000 on 'grenade boxes', £641,000 on ammunition for . sniper rifles and £400,000 on Heckler & Koch pistols . Among £13.7 million-worth of vehicles bought were a Volkswagen  Caravelle people carrier, 18 Ford Transit vans, mountain bikes, multi-vehicle transporters and six Jaguars. A Scotland Yard spokesman could not explain why it leased five electric cars for £64,000. In total, £10.9 million was spent on caring for animals – both those used by the force and those seized from the public. This included a £500,000-a-year deal with Balfour Beatty to remove manure from horse stables and dispose of it, and £1.3 million on ‘forage/bedding’. A further £22.6 million was spent on clothing, ranging from £151,876 for ‘embroidered inspector epaulettes’ to £46,134 on riot police balaclavas. Major contracts included £280 million to clean and maintain police buildings, £107 million to provide concessionary travel for officers and £220 million to repair the Met’s fleet of vehicles. Millions of pounds were also spent on fees for doctors who check on the health of suspects in custody. More unusual items of spending included £62,000 to improve oil storage at a bothy near Balmoral, £600,000 for ‘conflict management services’ and £358,696 to build a ‘temporary armoury’ in an ‘underground car park’. A spokesman for the Met declined to comment on individual contracts.  He insisted: ‘The Met gets best value for money through stringent procurement processes.’ A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime said: ‘The Mayor’s Office has put tough new processes in place to monitor spending, cut out waste and ensure more money goes towards frontline policing.’","£3.2m spent on Tasers with millions more on other weaponry .

"Prowling through the fields the fearsome feline patrols his hunting ground, pausing only occasionally to preen his luxuriant ginger mane. But hopefully this time domestic . cat  Teddy Bear, who has been blamed for inadvertently triggering Britain’s biggest safari hunt in living memory . by being mistaken for a lion, will be allowed to saunter off in peace. The . three-year-old pet – a Maine Coon which can weigh up to 25lb, be up to . 16in tall and 40in long –was seen stalking around his home in Clacton, Essex today after the panic from Sunday night. But the only thing he seemed to have on his mind was peering through a hole in the fence and lazily walking across a lawn. Teddy Bear: The lion on the loose turned out to be domestic cat Teddy Bear .

I've got my eye on you: Teddy Bear the Maine Coon cat casts a threatening glance as he peeks through a fence . The hunt is on! Teddy saunters across a garden - perhaps to pounce on something he spotted . And no one could blame him for slinking about after his brush with the limelight over the Bank Holiday weekend. Teddy Bear lives just a few hundred yards from where . holidaymakers spotted a big cat at a caravan park near Clacton in Essex . on Sunday. Following reports . of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police . helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to . run, were scrambled. Workers . from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the . fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were . temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. But . while the local community was plunged into terror, Teddy Bear’s owner . Ginny Murphy watched the drama unfold on television from Liverpool, . where she was away. And she immediately had her suspicions. 'Big as two sheep': Stephen (left) and Gill Atkin claim they saw the lion outside their caravan near Clacton, Essex . 'Witnesses': (From left) Bob Martin, from Canvey Island, and husband and wife Sue and David Wright say they saw a big cat during their Bank Holiday trip to Earls Hall Farm in St Osyth, near Clacton, Essex . Searching: Police were seen patrolling areas around Earls Hall Farm in St Osyth (pictured), near Clacton, Essex . Ready to shoot: An armed police officer patrols near the caravan site in Clacton-on-Sea last night . ‘It . clicked right away,’ she said. ‘We thought it had to be Ted as he’s the . only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to wander into . that field.’ After looking at the pictures of the supposed lion Mrs Murphy said she had no doubt it was Ted. ‘There’s no question about, it’s him. As we were away he probably went into the field to sulk. ‘From a distance, because he has a light-coloured mane he does look a little lion like. I can see why someone would think that. ‘He’s . a Maine Coon, which is the biggest breed of domestic cat. And he’s got . the personality to match, he has such a bad attitude and puts the dog in . his place all the time. ‘He thinks he’s the man of the house and has often been mistaken for a fox.’ Despite . Mrs Murphy’s certainty as to the culprit in Operation Pussycat, . however, there remain several witnesses who remain equally convinced . that the creature they saw was much more than just a little kitty. First . to spot the animal was Denise Martin, 52, a warehouse worker from . Canvey Island, on holiday at Earls Hall Farm with her husband Bob. ‘There . was some smoke from a bonfire, but it cleared I could see this shape in . the field, so I got the binoculars out,’ she said yesterday. ‘I said to my husband, “What do you make of that?” He said, “That’s a lion.” We weren’t scared at all – it was excitement. ‘You . don’t often see something like that in the wild. At one point time it . sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching. It knew we . were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself.’ Beware: Village green at St Osyth (pictured) near to where the beast was believed to have been spotted. Police have now called off the search of the area . People passing this photo of a lion around social networking site Twitter thought this was the lion that sparked the hunt. Police have confirmed it is a fake . Mr . Martin, a driver, telephoned police. They initially thought it was a . hoax and asked to speak to others at the site.

He was . brave.’ After speaking to Mr Atkin on Mr Martin’s mobile, the police roared into action. ‘They . were very sceptical at first, quite understandably,’ Mr Martin said. ‘When they did turn up but they missed it by three minutes.’ The hunt . certainly injected an unexpected dose of excitement into the community . of St Osyth, which until Sunday had held little intrigue for most except . weathermen and caravan enthusiasts. Officially . the driest place in the country (with just 20.2in of rainfall last . year, compared with the national average of 45.9in), its other claim to . fame is the neighbouring settlement of St Osyth Beach – Essex’s largest . concentration of static caravan parks. But . for 20 hours, the village – five miles west of Clacton-on-Sea on the . B1027 – became the scene of the dramatic big-game mystery. As . news of the alleged predator in their midst filtered down, what . followed was a mixture of unease and disbelief as villagers grappled . with the questions on everyone’s mind about the unusual sighting: had it . escaped from a zoo, circus or private owner? Was it born free or . something tamer? The search . teams failed to find evidence of a lion – no fur, no droppings, one . unconfirmed sighting of a paw print – and the police warning was soon . downgraded to be ‘a bit wary’ if walking in the country. Police hunt: Armed police are hunting a lion which was spotted in fields near a caravan site in St Osyth, Essex (pictured) On the loose: The lion was spotted in the village of St Osyth, near Clacton, Essex . Whatever . it was, it had not escaped from Colchester Zoo, as all its animals had . been accounted for. And a circus that had recently been in town told . officers it was not one lion short of a full big top either. As . the day wore on, the mystery deepened as photographs of the by now . world famous ‘Essex lion’ began emerging and, as so often in the modern . age, were circulated via social networking sites. Some were downright fakes, others simply seemed to make the situation even more woolly. One, supposedly taken of it at night by a car, was soon dismissed as a fake. Another, . taken by Mrs Atkin on her digital camera, looked to the untrained eye . rather like a sheep although she was genuinely believes it was ‘a big . cat with pointy ears and a white ruff’. Twitter, . meanwhile, was awash with parodies, fake pictures and jokes. More than . one gag dwelled on the fact that a luxurious mane and a permanent tan . meant this ‘lion’ would blend in well with the Essex natives. By . last night most of St Osyth’s 4,119 residents were sleeping a little . easier, safe in the knowledge that a rumble with a ‘King of the Jungle’ remains unlikely in their quiet neck of the woods. Beast: The creature, thought to be a panther, was spotted in the early hours of this morning (file photo) A panther has been spotted on the loose in the Cotswolds today. Kieran Bourne, 30, said he was convinced he saw a big cat in his headlights as he made his way home across Cleeve Hill in the early hours of this morning. He nearly collided with the animal by the side of the road, swerved, and saw it pounce into the bushes and disappear. Mr Bourne, who contacted a big cat expert after the sighting, believed it was the same creature which shocked residents in fields at Winchcombe, near Cheltenham, in April. He said: ‘It looked at me from the side of the road. I was coming round quite a sharp bend from Winchcombe up the hill to Cleeve Hill and it was on the left hand side of the road in my main beam – I nearly hit it. ‘It was the size of a large dog, about 2.5ft high and about 4ft long with a U-shaped tail curled upwards. ‘I swerved to the right to make sure I didn’t hit it and it pounced into the bushes. ‘I’m now 100 per cent sure it was a big black cat, with no markings on. It’s out there.’ Scary! Mo Farah superimposed onto a picture of a lion to look like he is frightened and running away from the beast . Is this the lion? Many Twitter users claimed TOWIE star Gemma Collins, pictured wearing fitting make-up, was actually the lion on the loose as hundreds of users posted their own version of the predator on the site .

"Honoured: Chris Preddie, has been awarded an OBE in the New Year Honours list . A relative of the killers of Damilola Taylor has been awarded an OBE despite boasting about robbing people in an internet video. Former drug dealer Chris Preddie – the cousin of brothers Danny and Ricky Preddie who killed ten-year-old Damilola – appears in the footage claiming to have mugged victims with his gang. Mr Preddie, 24, was listed in the New Year Honours for his work helping young offenders. But the award has angered Damilola’s father, Richard Taylor, who said he was ‘totally against’ Mr Preddie receiving it. Mr Preddie, of Finsbury Park, North London, was involved in gangs and sold cannabis until the age of 16. He then began working for Crimestoppers as a campaigner and is now a rap poet who tries to save teenagers from crime. He claims to have been raised in North London  and had no contact with his cousins, who are from Peckham, South London. But in a five- minute internet documentary about him in 2007, it is claimed he grew up in the South London neighbourhood where ‘Damilola was murdered’. The documentary adds that Mr Preddie left Peckham only after his cousins were convicted of the killing. In the video – called His Life In Rhyme – Mr Preddie is seen walking around Peckham where he says he spent his childhood. In one scene, he walks under a railway arch where he claims he and his gang used to ‘rob’ people and take drugs. He says to camera: ‘These are the parts where we just used to smoke, hang out, wait for victims to come, so that, basically, rob people and stuff like that. I think this was like the  robbing grounds.’ But when asked by this newspaper if he robbed anybody, Mr Preddie replied: ‘I never per se robbed anybody. If I did rob anyone, I would have got arrested and I would have got a criminal record, so no. I was obviously peer-pressured, and sometimes you fall to peer pressure. Once again, she [the documentary reporter] placed it in my mouth.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Guilty: Danny Preddie (left) and his brother Ricky Preddie (right) are cousins of Chris Preddie who has just been awarded an OBE. The brothers were convicted of Damilola Taylor's manslaughter . Crime scene: Damilola Taylor was stabbed on a north Peckham estate in November 2000 . When we asked if he grew up in South . London, Mr Preddie said he ‘spent time there’ as his maternal . grandmother was from the area. Mr Preddie’s mother, Mauricia John, . criticised Mr Taylor for saying her son should not have been honoured. ‘Damilola Taylor’s dad is p****** me off now,’ she said. ‘I feel sorry . for him but my boy’s a good boy. If Damilola’s dad messes it up for him, . I’ll go and see him personally.’ Mr Taylor said: ‘I don’t want to . engage in a war of words with her. I have made a principled comment, . where I said Chris Preddie should not get this award. There are people . who have done really good work after losing their loved ones in the . community. They should get the honour, not him.‘As far as I know it was a Preddie that robbed me of a loved one.’ Damilola died in November 2000 after being stabbed in the thigh with a  broken beer bottle.The Preddie brothers were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight years in October 2006.

"Scott Cupit dances with his investor Deborah Meaden on ITV's Good Morning Britain . It's the programme where millions see aspiring entrepreneurs pitch to win over some of Britain’s most demanding financial backers. To viewers of BBC2’s Dragons’ Den it would seem obvious that contestants have already fought a fierce battle to win a place on the show. But now one former contestant has lifted the lid on the BBC’s selection process, saying he was first headhunted and then cajoled into taking part. And The Mail on Sunday has since learned that he is far from alone – with nearly half the contestants on the current BBC2 series, 46 out of 97, having been similarly targeted. Scott Cupit, who runs a swing dancing school, made his astounding revelation about the ‘selection’ process on his company website. The 48-year-old says he was contacted out of the blue by the BBC and ‘talked into’ an audition. For Mr Cupit, who appeared on the opening episode of the 12th series with members of his dance company, Swing Patrol, taking part could not have been more straightforward. Once he bowed to the BBC’s entreaties, his only problem, he said, was having just ten days ‘to think about what on earth to ask for’, as he was happy with his business as it was and wasn’t seeking investment. First, he held an urgent meeting with his accountant. ‘I memorised my figures and got to understand my business a lot better. That’s an area I neglect because it bores me,’ he said. Then came his pitch: a swing nightclub. He entered the den dancing with six members of his troupe and invited the Dragons to join them. His idea was dismissed by all the Dragons – including Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen and Deborah Meaden. But, as Mr Cupit recognises, it made for a lively start to the new series, presumably what the producers intended. ‘They thought we would be a good balance for the TV because obviously the BBC want to put on a good show,’ Mr Cupit said. And despite the resistance to his nightclub plan, Mrs Meaden – a former Strictly Come Dancing contestant – was impressed with the business generally, investing £65,000 in return for a 20 per cent stake. The next morning, she danced with Mr Cupit on ITV’s Good Morning Britain and spoke enthusiastically about the venture. In a video on his website, which has now been taken down, Mr Cupit said: ‘When I spoke to him [the BBC researcher] he asked if I would consider going on the show. I was really surprised; apparently lots of people put in application forms but they hand-pick certain groups. We had been recommended. Scroll down for video . Scott Cupit appeared on opening episode of the 12th series with members of his dance company, Swing Patrol . ‘I was flattered but puzzled. They talked me into doing a screen test and I took some dancers and we went to West London. They said, “We’d love you to do it.” The only catch was I had ten days to be in front of the actual Dragons. After some consideration, I decided to go for it.’ Credited with bringing dances such as the Lindy Hop into the mainstream, Swing Patrol teaches 1,200 students every week at 27 venues across London and has featured on Blue Peter and Call The Midwife. The practice has been greeted with dismay by other contestants. Former contestant Ray Duffy, co-owner of Mask-arade, a celebrity facemask company based in Southam, South Warwickshire, said it was deceptive. ‘We applied through the normal channels and I was not aware of these approaches. It is less entrepreneurial if you are cajoled into it. ‘The perception of the viewer is that the business pitching to the Dragons has gone about it in a normal manner by approaching the show, not the show approaching them.’ A BBC source admitted that Mr Cupit had been approached directly but said the producers dispute he was cajoled. The BBC said: ‘As is made clear on the Dragons’ Den website, in order to showcase a wide cross-section of business ideas, there are many different ways that our production team source entrepreneurs and businesses to apply to take part. ‘Regardless of this, every applicant, without exception, goes through the same rigorous application and audition process.’ The 48-year-old says he was contacted out of the blue by the BBC and ‘talked into’ an audition for Dragons' Den .","Former contestant Scott Cupit said he was 'headhunted' for part in show .

"One entrepreneurial little girl has turned the theft of her iPod into a impressive business opportunity. Isabel Haig has replaced her stolen iPod - by setting up her own business selling hundreds of loom bands to other youngsters. The ten year old had been left heartbroken when her £300 music player containing her favourite One Direction songs was grabbed by a sneak thief whilst she was at a service station with her father. But instead of begging her family to by her a new one she got in a bulk load of the brightly coloured loom bands to make a pile of bracelets. Scroll down for video . Isabel has created her own loom band business to raise money to help her replace her iPod touch . Showing great entrepreneurial spirit, little Isabel turned her loss into an business opportunity . She then began selling them for £1 to £1.50 a time during fayres at her primary school and got herself her own stall under the brand name: 'Loomed by Izzy.' After her stock was snapped up, the youngster began to branch out - making loom band snakes and figurines and appointing eight year old sister Grace and brother Aiden, aged seven as her 'apprentices.' She is now inviting customers to place orders on Facebook. Isabel began selling her braclets for £1 to £1.50 a time during fayres at her primary school . Within only a month Isabel, from Astley Bridge, near Bolton, Greater Manchester had raised enough to buy herself a new iPod touch - but the youngster is refusing to halt her lucrative business. Her father Andrew Haig, 48, a jewellery agent said: 'Isabel is definitely the arty one of the family, she is really bright and intelligent and has a real eye for fashion, art is her favourite subject and she really excels at it. 'She does every single loom band herself, all we do is transport her to craft shows around once a fortnight and we bought her the starter pack and that is it - she is incredible at the designs and people can't believe a ten-year-old girl made them. The ten-year-old was already into the loom band craze before she started her business . 'She is brilliantly talented, her mother and I are so proud of her, she has really made a name for herself at the craft fairs and she is so generous - she has even given her brother and sister a 'job'.' He added: 'It started when I decided to take Isabel out for the day in March for her to see what I do - it was sort of a 'let's go to work with daddy day' and she was really excited. 'She took her IPod with her which had lots of pictures on and music by her favourite band One Direction. I stopped off at a service station and she put it down on the counter for a second and when she looked again it had been swiped. After her stock was snapped up, the youngster began to branch out and appointed  eight year old sister Grace (left) and brother Aiden as her 'apprentices' As well as bracelets, Isabel also makes loom band snakes and figurines (right) During school holidays, the ten-year-old spends up to three hours a day making her pieces . 'She was heartbroken, I told her it was fine and I would buy her a new one, I hated seeing her so upset about it. We were planning to buy her a new one when her mum and I had an idea. 'She had taken up doing loom bands, everyone at school was doing it and we found she was actually really good at it. She would beg us every other week for a few pounds to buy new loom bands and we were happy that she had found something to do, it was a nice little hobby. 'She was already making them for free for all of her friends but her mum thought she could sell them for £1.50. Isabel loved the idea, we told her that we would buy her a starter kit which had plenty of bands in and if she raised half of the money for the IPod, we would pay the rest. Despite having raised enough for two new iPods, industrious Isabel is refusing to halt her lucrative business . 'Over the Easter break in March she and Grace wre spending around two to three hours each day making loom bands and when she went back to school she had made £100 after two months. She then started at craft fairs and would make £100 each month, so far she has made around £600 and bought herself the IPod and a Furby plus treated her brother and sister. 'It is a really good thing to teach children that you have to work for nice things, it keeps them grounded and down to earth. Isabel will do this for a long time, she loves it and she is really happy making them and she has become much more independent.' Mother Lisa Haig, 38, a housewife said: 'I'm really proud of Izzy. She's worked really hard over the summer and it has paid off. She had originally been making loom bands for free for friends at school and I suggested that she sell them instead. She makes all sorts of styles.' Isabel said: 'I was really upset when my iPod got stolen and this was the best way to raise money to buy another one.

"On a corner of a street in Snizhne in eastern Ukraine, there is a gap where a block of flats used to be. In the wreckage of this destroyed four-storey building lies the chilling motive behind the mass murder of 298 innocent civilians – including ten Britons – on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. For Snizhne has become the main base for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s clandestine war on Ukraine, and after getting unprecedented access to this town controlled by pro-Russian separatists, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the most likely reason missiles were being aimed at the aircraft was revenge – pure and simple. Two days before the airliner was shot down near this town, Snizhne – part of the breakaway so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) which has declared allegiance to Russia – was bombed by Ukrainian air force jets, which destroyed the apartment block on Lenin Street, killing five women and four men and critically injuring a young boy. Snizhne is the main base for pro-Russian fighters in Ukraine and was bombed by government jets two days before MH17 was blasted out of the sky as it travelled through Ukrainian airspace at 33,000 feet . Ukrainian fighter bombers hit this apartment complex, killing nine people after hitting the building by mistake . The bombers were aiming at a rebel stronghold 100 yards further down the road which acts as Putin's HQ . Peshehonov Sergey, a newspaper editor in the town who helped pull bodies from the rubble, said: ‘There is nothing but hatred towards the people who caused this tragedy. ‘You have to understand that when we got the little boy out of the building, the lower part of his body was totally crushed by rubble. The boys [rebels] were very angry.’ It is thought the sortie had been targeting a separatist military base just 100 yards away – which has become the headquarters of Putin’s covert war. In the words of one local, the bombing attack ‘spread panic’. A day later, others are said to have died in attacks on nearby villages. And this seems to have set in train the chilling sequence of events which led a BUK anti-aircraft missile launcher to be driven across the Russia-Ukraine border on July 17, and moved around Donetsk region to a field outside Snizhne, where it launched the weapon that blew the Boeing 777 out of the sky. Although it is widely accepted that the pro-Russian rebels mistook the airliner for a Ukrainian military plane, tensions in the town were high, and locals callously explained the launch as ‘self-defence’. ‘I think taking down the Boeing plane might be the reaction to what’s happening in Snizhne and around our city,’ said Mr Sergey said. ‘The boys are just doing their job. The planes bring death into our city so they could have just thought that it [Flight MH17] was another plane that was about to bomb Snizhne. It’s pure self-defence.’ Despite the MH17 tragedy, pro-Russian forces continue to fire rockets and missiles at Ukrainian government targets using Grad rocket launchers which have recently arrived in the conflict zone, supplied by Russia . A column of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and rocket launchers crossed the border earlier this week . And as an international team of investigators were finally allowed access to the crash site yesterday, Putin and his henchmen showed no sign of scaling down their aggression. New photographs and video images of unguided Grad rocket launchers being moved across the border emerged yesterday, amid reports that a huge column of Russian military vehicles was massing a few miles behind the border. The Mail on Sunday was the first British newspaper to be allowed to visit the centre of Snizhne, and access was only granted because we asked about the Ukrainian bombing, rather than the downing of MH17. To reach the town, we negotiated six checkpoints on the road from the regional capital, Donetsk. At the last, on the edge of the town, a group of militants swaggered back and forth, armed with assault rifles. ‘We can’t let you through, there is fighting,’ said one, sunglasses resting on his head. As he spoke, a family in a car packed with belongings crossed in the opposite direction. On the windscreen was a hastily scrawled poster with the word ‘Kids’ in Russian, presumably, in case anyone mistook them for combatants. Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko inspected heavy armour near the capital Kiev . President Porosenko also received a demonstration of a fearsome silenced sniper rifle . Eventually, after we sent a message to the town’s military commander explaining that we wanted to report on the attack by the Ukrainians, the guards let us through. All smiles now where once they’d been sullen, one said: ‘Tell the truth or we will come and find you.’ With that he made a throat-slitting gesture and returned to his colleagues. Certainly few locals would have been particularly surprised to see the BUK mobile rocket launcher parked outside a supermarket on the afternoon of July 17, just hours before Flight MH17 was shot down. Residents said they had grown accustomed to the rumble of tanks and armoured personnel carriers moving around their town, with armed militiamen roaming the streets and setting up positions on the outskirts, in anticipation of a Ukrainian attack. Pro-Russian forces have access to heavy armour and guided missile systems in are area surrounding Snizhne . They said that Russian military hardware had been sneaked across the border into the Donetsk region under the cover of darkness in recent weeks. Accompanied by a young man in fatigues on an old Russian motorbike, we drove into the centre of the town along Lenin Street. There was no fighting, but the air was thick with tension. ‘There was fighting this morning nearby – the Ukrainians are getting closer,’ said the soldier. ‘But we held them off.’ He leaned on a railing, listlessly smoking a cigarette as we began to interview more locals. They told us that at least half the population has left town because they fear more attacks, their anxiety raised by the downing of Flight MH17. ‘Yes, many assume we will take the blame and fear a backlash,’ said Viktor, 76, who was on his way to the chemist to try to buy medicine for his sick wife. ‘I go every day but they never have it, supplies are running out generally. There is bread but not much other food. There is no money in the ATMs. Power keeps going off. We have been taken over by the DPR militants.’ Another man said it was ‘common knowledge’ that the rebels received much of their hardware from Russia and claimed his cousin spotted a convoy of tanks coming from the border a month ago. ‘Most of the movement is at night when there is an unofficial curfew,’ he said. Behind him lay the remains of the destroyed four-storey Soviet-era apartment block, once home to more than 200 people. Was the attack on MH17 a revenge attack after Ukraine bombed civilian flats in Snizhne by mistake . Now only 50-year-old Oleg Sapozhnik remains. ‘I am not going to leave and let them win,’ he said. ‘A Ukrainian plane hit us at 6.30 in the morning – I was still in bed. The building shook and there was this massive explosion and I tried to get out of the door but it was blocked by rubble. So I jumped out of the window.’ He took us room by room through the building. ‘Why did they attack these families? Why?’ After the attack, the militia began to ‘appear more panicked’, according to one local. Others spoke of seeing ‘tanks and military vehicles’ moving through the town later than night. Further down Lenin Street, less than 100 yards from the apartment block, we came across an empty supermarket and, adjacent, the sandbagged entrance to the militia’s HQ, a converted warehouse. This, several residents tell us, was the Ukrainian plane’s real target. ‘The rebels looked increasingly nervous after this,’ said one middle-aged woman. ‘And they were angry too, really angry, shuttling all over the place in their military vehicles.’ The following day something else happened to intensify their fury: an attack on the nearby village of Dmitrovka, in which, it is claimed, civilians were killed. It was at this point that the rebels decided to hit back, and 12 hours later began moving the rocket launcher around Snizhne. It was later photographed in the nearby town of Torez, under a tree near a supermarket. From there it was taken to the outskirts of Snizhne, where it was fired. On Friday, we requested an interview with the rebel commander in the town. ‘He doesn’t wish to speak to you,’ came the reply from his emissary, a rifle-wielding man in his 20s. ‘You must go back now.’ Back in rebel-held Donetsk, the expected major offensive from the Ukrainian army to retake the city never materialised, though there were reports of blasts in a suburb. Experts said the noise resembled those of Grads. Ukrainian security officials claim this photograph shows the vapour trail from the surface to air missile fired by pro-Russian forces towards flight MH17 as it approached the Russian border on its way to Malaysia . In all, Ukraine’s bloody insurgency has forced 230,000 people to flee their homes, including 130,000 who have sought refuge in Russia. Meanwhile, a pro-Putin Russian senator claimed a new Cold War had begun after the White House accused the Russian authorities of being in part to blame for the Malaysian airliner tragedy. ‘After this statement we can say that a long, tough Cold War has begun,’ said Valeriy Shnyakin, a member of the defence committee of the upper house of parliament. And the Russian government accused the US of ‘blatant lies’ over the crash. The Foreign Ministry said accusations against Russia were ‘a common practice in Washington when no evidence nor even references to the facts are given as a confirmation, which we could have verified and commented on. ‘All the White House says is limited to mentioning some “intelligence data” that cannot be presented or, and – this is totally absurd – “information from social media”.’ Russia’s protests, though, count for nothing in Snizhne, the town that will be for ever bound to that appalling explosion 33,000ft above them. ‘Not all of us want to live like this, in Putin’s pocket,’ said one elderly resident. ‘For years we were happy – but this has changed everything.’","Ukrainian fighter jets bombed an apartment complex two days before MH17 .

"Toothy grin: Luis Suarez smiles for the camera as he and classmates line up for a school photo in 1998 . In his school uniform of white tunic and blue ribbon, Luis Suarez is a picture of youthful innocence as he smiles for a class photo. Back in 1998, the World Cup outcast – banned for four months last week for sinking his teeth into Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini – was just another football-mad youngster who had yet to use his now-infamous incisors in anger. And although he was known for his fiery temperament even at a relatively young age, there was no hint of what was to come. ‘He could be hot-tempered, but Luis never bit anyone,’ his former teacher Shirley Souto told The Mail on Sunday yesterday. ‘There was never any biting at school.’ Yesterday, Suarez, who was 11 at the time the school picture was taken, insisted that he had not meant to bite Chiellini. But according to Uruguayan investigative journalist Ricardo Gabito, five years after posing for this photograph, Suarez was banned for 12 matches for his first recorded act of serious violence on a football pitch. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Gabito told of a shocking incident in which the future Liverpool striker allegedly struck a referee, cutting his lip, during  a youth match in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. And more shocking still, the incident led to the shooting of Gabito, who exposed how a top football official tried to cover up the assault, apparently believing it could badly damage Suarez, then on the brink of a brilliant career. At the time, 16-year-old Suarez was on the books of Nacional, one of the city’s two top clubs. In December 2003, in a crunch match against arch-rivals Danubio, he was booked for a bad tackle and shown a red card for arguing with referee Luis Larranaga. Scroll down for video . Suarez has been banned from nine internationals and four months of all football for the bite (pictured) It meant he would miss the championship-deciding last game of the season. According to Gabito and other witnesses, Suarez refused to leave the pitch – and lashed out. The former youth coach at the club, Daniel Enriquez, said Suarez pushed and headbutted Larranaga, but Gabito insists he punched him. Afterwards, Gabito says the man in charge of youth football  in Montevideo, Nelson Spillman, tried to pressurise Larranaga into changing his match report. According to Gabito, the teenager was given a 12-match ban, though this cannot be independently verified. Gabito was alerted to the murky affair by an anonymous caller. He says he found the referee’s match report and contacted Larranaga, who confirmed the story about being threatened. On December 12, 2003, Gabito’s article about the affair was published in his newspaper, La Republica. It didn’t name Suarez, but detailed the incident and Spillman’s alleged cover-up attempt. Just 11 days later, Gabito was shot as he arrived home in the  La Blanqueada district of Montevideo. Spillman, his brother Daniel, who drove the getaway car used in the attack, and gunman, Juan Carlos Martinez were all later jailed over the incident. That's our man! Uruguay fans hold up and wear Luis Suarez masks at the Colombia v Uruguay match last night . But throughout the investigation and trial Suarez – who had no involvement with the shooting whatsoever or any knowledge of the threats from Spillman – was never named. The disgraced striker claimed to Fifa’s disciplinary panel that  he did not deliberately bite Chiellini at the World Cup. But the seven-man panel ruled that the bite was ‘deliberate, intentional and without provocation’. He remained at his home with his family yesterday in the coastal resort of Solymar after receiving a hero’s welcome home. Even Uruguay’s president, Jose Mujica, turned up at the airport to greet him on Friday. Uruguay has been in collective denial over the incident. Another of Suarez’s ex-teachers, Miriam Mendez, said: ‘He was a normal boy and never aggressive.’","Former teacher: 'He could be hot-tempered, but Luis never bit anyone'

"One of the men arrested in a crackdown on suspected paedophiles is a junior doctor working in paediatrics. Raza Laskar, 31, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is accused of sexual activity with a child and possessing indecent images of children. He faces trial later this year. Chief Superintendent Caroline Ball said: ‘We know this man has worked in hospitals right across Greater Manchester and we understand the public will undoubtedly be concerned upon hearing about the offences with which he has been charged.’ 660 suspected paedophiles have been arrested following a crackdown by the National Crime Agency (NCA). The organisation targeted those across the country who had accessed images of child abuse online (library image) Police revealed last week that more than 660 men, many in positions of trust, were questioned during the six-month nationwide Operation Notarise. Most had no previous contact with police. The men include retired chemistry teacher Ian Bell, 66, from Wimborne in Dorset. He was imprisoned for  28 months at Bournemouth Crown Court last month after being convicted of 20 offences of possessing and distributing indecent images and movies of children. Another man, married insurance salesman Richard Wilson, 50, from West Parley, Dorset, was jailed for eight months on Friday after admitting 16 counts of possessing indecent images of children. On his laptop he had 8,553 pictures and 246 videos, including a 23-minute clip of child abuse. Police say 431 children  ‘in the care, custody or control’ of suspects have been protected.

"Secrets: Lee Towsey is the first person to speak publicly about what went on in the house . A former child actor has told detectives he was abused by undercover male police officers at a guest house at the centre of an alleged VIP paedophile ring. Lee Towsey made the astonishing claim to Scotland Yard’s Operation Fernbridge, which is investigating historic child sex abuse. He says it happened while he worked at the Elm Guest House in South-West London in 1982. At the time, Mr Towsey was 16, then under the age of homosexual consent. ‘I was naive and struggling to come to terms with my sexuality,’ he said. ‘After we had sex the officers offered me money.’ In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, he also tells of a sexual encounter with Cyril Smith – and how he was warned by police to ‘keep quiet about what and who you saw’. For years, the question of what went on at the Edwardian terrace in Rocks Lane, overlooking Barnes Common, has been the subject of speculation. It was claimed politicians, judges, pop stars, a high-ranking policeman, a member of the Royal household and an MI5 officer were among the visitors. There were allegations that some VIPs preyed on boys from a nearby children’s home. But until today no one with any first-hand knowledge of what went on has ever spoken publicly. In bombshell testimony, Mr Towsey, who worked at Rocks Lane for five months as a masseur, claims: . Mr Towsey has also spoken to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, whose book about Smith revealed how he abused scores of boys. Last night Mr Danczuk said: ‘This is a significant part of the jigsaw in what is a complex cover-up. It really moves on the need for a more in-depth inquiry.’ House of depravity: Owner Carole Kasir, left, and the infamous address in Barnes, right . Mr Towsey first visited Elm Guest House in February 1982. At the time he was pursuing his dream of becoming an actor. He later appeared in Grange Hill and Doctor Who. ‘I went out one night with a friend and we ended up going back to where he was staying in Barnes, which was on my way home,’ said Mr Towsey. ‘It was Elm Guest House. We had a couple of drinks in the bar and that’s where I first met Carole Kasir, the owner. She was kind of hippy-ish and made quite a fuss of me.’ She was less welcoming the following morning. ‘Carole’s demeanour changed. She said I had to pay for my night’s stay but I couldn’t afford it. She said: “You can work here as a masseur.” ’ Carole told him that some of the visitors were prominent people. Mr Towsey said: ‘She kept their names in a black address book, which she referred to as her insurance policy. ‘She said one was a Cabinet Minister and there were judges and politicians. I remember Cyril Smith but I didn’t know he was a politician until I saw his puppet on Spitting Image. ‘Carole told me not to let him in the sauna, as he had got stuck in there before and they had to take the door off to get him out.’ He added: ‘Smith wanted me to strip naked and massage him. I was also forced to watch as he masturbated.’ Carole came to confide in the 16-year-old, complaining how she was under pressure to contribute to Richmond police’s ‘Christmas fund’. ‘It was protection money,’ he said. In all, Mr Towsey slept with three people at the house. ‘They all turned out to be police,’ he said. ‘One came round in the first month. He was early 20s, good-looking, not the usual sort who went to the house.’ Scandal: The story in February 2013 . Mr Towsey saw the man again some months later – at Richmond police station – after he and the Kasir were arrested in a raid. Before that, Mr Towsey claims, two other undercover officers visited the house. ‘The first came in April and I had sex with him. He turned out to be one of the officers who later raided the house. ‘He came back about three weeks later and hired a room. He stayed two nights and on the second night his partner stayed too. I ended up having sex with them. Afterwards they asked how much and I told them that they were not clients and felt insulted they wanted to pay me.’ Mr Towsey continued at the house until the raid in June. He was charged with keeping a disorderly house and assisting in the management of a brothel. ‘That year was terrible,’ he said. ‘People were ringing up making death threats. I got a job in the kitchen at a bingo hall in Hounslow. My dad used to pick me up after work in his Nissan Sunny. ‘One day he didn’t turn up because its tyres had been let down. But he didn’t have time to let me know. Yet when I arrived at the usual spot, a Nissan Sunny was in the usual place and I got in the front. ‘There were three police officers inside. One of them was at the station following the raid. They told me they could pick me up at any time and told me keep my mouth shut. I never told anyone, not even my family.’ The day he was due at the Old Bailey, the charges against him were suddenly dropped. Kasir, who died in 1990, was found guilty of keeping a disorderly house but received a fine and suspended sentence. Mr Towsey was contacted by detectives from Operation Fernbridge in 2012. ‘They said they were opening up the case again because of Savile. I have had a couple of calls since to say they are still investigating but they haven’t moved anything on. I am considering legal action against the Met. I shut the door on it once and I want to shut the door on it again and move on.’ Scotland Yard declined to comment. By PAUL CAHALAN . Justice demand: Labour MP Simon Danczuk . A Labour MP says he is considering the sensational step of publicly naming an influential politician who allegedly abused boys at Elm Guest House. Simon Danczuk, who exposed former Liberal MP Cyril Smith, said he would use Parliamentary privilege – giving him legal immunity – to unmask someone ‘much more important’. ‘I have used privilege before and I would consider using privilege to name the Parliamentarian,’ he said yesterday.Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk published a book last week detailing how Smith, who died in 2010, abused hundreds of vulnerable boys over four decades. Unlike Smith, the politician he is now considering naming is still sitting in Parliament. Calling for a new in-depth inquiry into the activities at Elm House, which closed in 1982, Mr Danczuk said: ‘There is undoubtedly a cover-up. ‘This isn’t just about Smith, this is a much wider network of paedophiles, people who were abusing youngsters. We have to get to the bottom of it, not least because some of these people are still alive and should face justice. ‘Anyone who has any more information should come forward so that  we can all move on  from a horrible piece  of recent history.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lee Towsey told new investigation he had underage sex with officers .

"Robert Agostinelli has launched a legal battle against his former financee Charlotte Lucas, (pictured) to force her to return a £400,000 engagement ring he bought her . As a spectacularly successful financier, billionaire Robert Agostinelli might be expected to show a generous side to the women in his life. But the hedge fund boss has launched an extraordinary legal battle against his former fiancee – to force her to return a £400,000 engagement ring he bought her. Mr Agostinelli, an American tycoon who once tried to buy Liverpool Football Club, has been branded ungallant for making the legal demands against Formula One public relations executive Charlotte Lucas after their six-year relationship fell apart. ‘No one is particularly impressed at his asking for the ring back, said one friend. ‘It’s hardly what you would call chivalrous. And it’s not like he needs the money.’ Mr Agostinelli met Ms Lucas in 2007 and proposed a few months later, but the relationship is said to have soured after she discovered that he had been pictured holidaying with a Dutch model. Friends of Ms Lucas say the couple had another furious row last year and she called off the engagement and moved out of his £8 million London home. It is understood that Mr Agostinelli, 60, disputes this and insists he ended it. With both sides refusing to yield, the extraordinary dispute over the ring is now destined for the Supreme Court in New York – and at its heart will be the question of where the financier proposed. If it was in New York, as Mr Agostinelli claims, then he might have a case, although not a strong one. But if it can be shown that he gave her the ring outside of the United States, the law will favour Ms Lucas. In Britain, for instance, an engagement ring is classed as a gift  and always remains the property  of the recipient. Mr Agnostinelli’s lawyers made clear . their demands in a forceful letter to Ms Lucas in October. In it, they . set a deadline by which the ring should be returned, though that is now . thought to have passed. Matrimonial . law expert Nadia Beckett, a senior partner at Beckett Solicitors in . London, said: ‘I have never come across a case like this, it is . astonishing. ‘He sounds . like a very bitter man. It might be an option for her to forestall any . action in the US by bringing an action here against him under the . Married Women’s Property Act. ‘I believe that part of the purpose of an engagement ring, historically, was to provide security for the bride-to-be. If the engagement was broken off, particularly if it was broken off by the man, it served as financial compensation.’ Mr Agostinelli is the co-founder of the Rhone Group, the New York and London based private equity firm. Before that he was said to have played a pivotal role in building the asset management firm Lazard. In the book The Last Tycoons: The . Secret History Of Lazard Frères & Co, dollar billionaire Agostinelli . is described as a ‘suave, sophisticated, energetic international . financier with extravagant tastes and slicked-back jet-black hair’ It . describes how he sent luxury Frette sheets by FedEx to his hotel rooms . ahead of his arrival and always travelled with his personal gourmet . chef. Privately-educated Ms . Lucas, who grew up in Hertfordshire, was newly single when she first . met Mr Agostinelli having been previously married to another financier. Her friends say she has so far ignored the ‘shocking’ legal demand to return the ring. However . she has been warned by her solicitor that should the claim be approved . in the American courts she could be barred from entering the country by . customs. It is understood the ring cost £250,000 but was valued last . year at £400,000. Robert Agostinelli (left) and his former financee Charlotte Lucas, (right) split after six years together . Contacted yesterday, Ms Lucas refused to discuss the dispute,  although  a friend said ‘Charlotte was deeply in love with Robert and had hoped that he would eventually grow up.  But it seems she ran out of patience with him.’ A spokesman for Mr Agostinelli, who counts former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and former US President George Bush among his friends, also declined to comment. In the US, disputes over engagement rings are not uncommon and most states have laws governing ownership. Many states consider the ring a ‘conditional gift’ until the wedding day. This means that regardless of who might pull out, the ring must be returned. A New York judge ruled in 2006 that a woman could keep her diamond engagement ring because her fiance was not divorced from his previous wife when he proposed. In certain states, determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding. And some states treat a ring given on a birthday, Christmas or Valentine’s Day as an unconditional gift.","American tycoon Robert Agostinelli has launched a legal battle against his ex-partner Charlotte Lucas .

"A former Scotland Yard commander decorated by the Queen has condemned the ‘jobsworths’ who stopped him volunteering to man the phones in a tiny village police station. Bob Marsh, 74, who during his distinguished police career was in charge of protecting Royalty as head of the Royal and Diplomatic Protection Department, said he only wanted to help out his local community support officer in Billingshurst, West Sussex. But despite obtaining support for his application from a former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, he was turned down by Sussex Police. Decorated: Bob Marsh and wife Sandy on the day she was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order . Mr Marsh was told that he and his wife, a former Royal press secretary who also applied for an unpaid role, failed the vetting process because they had lived abroad for a while before moving back to Britain. ‘It’s a jobsworth thing,’ Mr Marsh told The Mail on Sunday. ‘We’ve given a lifetime of service to Queen and country and I think it’s sad that they have these silly rules. ‘All we wanted to do was answer the phones and deal with the public over the counter, which would have given the community officer more time to patrol the streets.’ Before being responsible for the Royal Family’s security, Mr Marsh headed Brixton Police during the 1981 riots and played a key role in the Met’s response to the Iranian Embassy siege a year earlier. When he retired in 1997 after a career spanning 40 years, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. Yet all this, plus a glowing reference from George Churchill-Coleman, who ran the Yard’s anti-terrorist branch in the 1990s, could not sway the human resources department at Sussex Police. Mr Marsh’s wife is Sandy Henney, 61, a former press secretary to the Prince of Wales, for which she was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order. She also worked for the Metropolitan Police for 14 years as a senior press officer and was vetted to work at Downing Street, the Ministry of Defence and the Crown Prosecution Service. But like her husband, her application for the job in Billingshurst  was rejected. Having joined the Met as a 16-year-old cadet, Mr Marsh spent the last seven years of his career running the elite squad charged with providing 24-hour security for the Royals and London’s diplomatic community. His work also saw him honoured with the Queen’s Police Medal. Sussex Police claim they are only following the agreed vetting procedures . ‘All this counted for nothing because we failed the vetting at the first hurdle,’ said Mr Marsh. ‘We moved back to Britain last year  having spent nine years in Spain. ‘We may not have been resident in the UK, but having lived in another EU country with reciprocal arrangements it would have been quite easy to check that we hadn’t attended any insurgent training camps in the mountains of Malaga.’ The couple were at a festival near Billingshurst last November when they were handed a leaflet asking for volunteers to help the local police community support officer (PCSO) run his office. ‘The idea was to get volunteers in to release him to patrol the streets,’ said Ms Henney. ‘We thought we’d be useful because of our backgrounds and it was a good way for us to get to know the community. We rang the PCSO and he asked us to come in for a chat.’ While PCSO Adrian Bell was delighted at the prospect of having such an illustrious duo joining his village crime-fighting team, he warned them they faced bureaucratic complications. However, the couple assumed they would not be insurmountable and posted their application forms to Sussex Police. ‘We then got another load of forms back from the human resources department,’ said Ms Henney. ‘They wanted to know everything about our relatives, whether they had even the most minor of convictions. ‘They also wanted to know if there was anyone else living in our house. There was a diversity form, all sorts of things. I turned to my husband and said, “I’m losing the will to live here, Bob.” ’ The application was supported by a reference from George Churchill-Coleman, former head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit . Mr Marsh added: ‘There were nine pages of it. I filled in fewer when I was vetted by the Security Services for my work with the Royals. ‘Seriously, I was positively vetted to a level I would have thought warranted being able to answer a phone or deal with a member of the public visiting a police office.’ His wife continued: ‘George Churchill-Coleman had already agreed to be a referee for both of us. And our second referee was someone who actually worked for Sussex Police. ‘But having received George’s reference, Sussex said that because the second person hadn’t seen us for a year we would need another one. ‘At this stage, we thought why should we put another friend through the bother if there was a strong chance we wouldn’t get through anyway? ‘So I said to human resources that I understood the residency demand would prevent us getting through and they said that was absolutely right. Why they sent more forms back and asked for another referee is beyond me. ‘The point for me is this is putting process before people. Why didn’t they apply common sense? ‘And what value is the EU if a police force in the UK can’t pick up a phone to the Guardia Civil in Spain to ask if we’ve been behaving ourselves for the past three years?’ Sussex Police said: ‘Although we don’t comment on individual cases, we do follow the Association of Chief Police Officers’ national  vetting policy guidelines for all forces, which set out a minimum residency period in the UK of three years immediately prior to any application for employment with the force. ‘However, any applicants who  are told that they have been rejected on those grounds can always seek  a review, which will be individually considered.’","Bob Marsh, 74, was in charge of protecting Royals during 40 year career .

"Drunk: Police caught Tracey Chambers driving erratically after she had downed three bottles of wine . A jobless mother who drove while almost five and a half times the limit has walked free from court - despite giving the highest alcohol reading for a woman motorist ever recorded in Britain. Tracey Chambers, 35, had already drunk three bottles of wine and was driving to buy more alcohol when police stopped her, a court heard. She told officers she was driving to an off-licence and had left her young child at home. She gave a breathalyser reading showing 188 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath - 5.4 times the legal limit of 35 micrograms. It is the highest reading ever given by a woman in the UK, but Chambers was spared jail when she appeared at Northampton . Magistrates' Court. She was banned from driving for three years and given a 12-month probation supervision order with alcohol treatment. Magistrates had heard how Chambers hit the bottle after . losing her job almost four years ago. The court heard that Chambers was arrested on April 13 on suspicion of being unfit to drive whilst under the influence of drink or drugs. Kim Dalton, prosecuting, said a . policeman was attending a road accident in St James Road, . Northampton, when he saw a Fiat Punto collide with a kerb near a pub. He then saw the car’s headlights flash several times, and heard the driver attempt to restart the car. Mrs . Dalton said the officer went over to the car to speak to the driver and . found Chambers slumped over the steering wheel smelling of alcohol. She said: 'She was subsequently arrested. She protested, saying she couldn’t be arrested. 'It was then substantiated the defendant had left a child on their own.' Mrs Dalton said Chambers had been verbally abusive while in police custody. The prosecutor said: 'At interview, the defendant fully admitted she had been drink-driving. 'She said she couldn’t remember exactly how much she had drunk, possibly two bottles of wine.' She later told police that it might have been three bottles. Chambers pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to failing to provide a specimen. Intoxicated: Chambers's reading of 188 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath is the highest ever recorded by a woman driver in Britain . The court heard that Chambers's breathalyser reading of 188 micrograms was given in a roadside test shortly after she was stopped by police. Later the same night she gave another reading which showed she had 147 micrograms per 100ml. She refused to provide another reading, which is a punishable offence. Neil Clark, defending, said his client’s problems started when she was made redundant. He . said she had not been able to find work since then, had been struggling . to make her mortgage payments, and had turned to alcohol when she . became depressed. Mr . Clark said she had seen her doctor since the offence and had been admitted to St Mary’s Hospital in Kettering, Northamptonshire, for . treatment. She was no longer drinking alcohol and was working with a social worker, Mr Clark added. Chambers's first breathalyser reading beats the previous record for a woman driver, set by Claire Louise Garrett in July 2010. Garrett, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, gave a sample containing 179 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath after police stopped her for driving on the wrong side of the road. Garrett pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol and received a three-year ban. The highest alcohol level recorded by a male driver was 191 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath, given by Polish worker Marcin Ziebac, from Coudon, Coventry, in January 2010.","Tracey Chambers was caught driving to an off-licence to buy more alcohol - while her young child remained at home .

"British Telecom yesterday delivered the biggest shake-up in football broadcasting in two decades. BT Sport left rivals BSkyB and ITV stunned after bidding almost £900 million for the rights to screen live Champions League and Europa League matches. The telecoms giant will show a number of matches for free, including the finals of both competitions, in a deal that will cost the channel £299 million per season for three seasons from 2015-16. Arsenal's Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) celebrates scoring the opening goal with Arsenal's German midfielder Mesut Ozil (left): Champions League and Europa League matches will now be screened by BT . BT has already secured the rights to show 38 live Premier League games a season and is now hoping that the new deal will greatly increase its subscribers and encourage more customers to buy broadband, phone and television services from them. Live Champions League matches are currently shared between ITV and Sky Sports, but from 2015 they will only be shown on BT Sport. BT promised to make football ‘more accessible and affordable’ and said it will show a match involving each participating British team for free every season. While BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, BSkyB said the deal was ‘far in excess’ of its own valuation. BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: ‘I am thrilled BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League.’ Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben with the Champions League trophy . John Petter, head of BT’s consumer division, said: ‘Our research showed that half of all homes in the country would like to watch more premier sport but one in five will not pay the £40 or so that Sky charges.’ BT’s victory is the most significant event in football broadcasting since 1992, when BSkyB acquired the rights to broadcast live fixtures from the newly formed Premier League in a deal worth £304 million over five years . In a statement, BSkyB said BT had ‘overpaid’. ‘We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation,’ it said. ‘There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we’d have paid more. ‘Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now redeploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.’ Mr Patterson said BT Sport is not charging existing broadband customers to watch live Premier League football but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published.","BT says it wants to make football more 'accessible and affordable'

"Ben Davies, 29, a former director of First Asset Management, the company thought to be at the centre of City of London police investigations . Barclays has promised compensation to thousands of customers whose confidential files were stolen and sold to rogue City traders. The bank has set up a dedicated team to deal with the fallout from the huge data loss and is ‘making progress’ in the hunt for the thief. At the same time, City of London police have launched an investigation after being contacted by the whistleblower who exposed the leak in last week’s Mail on Sunday. The plundered details of up to 27,000 accounts – including customers’ earnings, savings, health issues and insurance policies – are worth millions to investment sharks. Barclays would not be drawn on whether the final compensation bill would run into millions, but a spokesman said: ‘In all cases we will be making a gesture of goodwill.’ Detectives are understood to be focusing their inquiries on one firm in particular, City-based First Asset Management (FAM), which closed down suddenly last September amid complaints from angry investors. FAM’s details are included on a memory stick containing the files of 2,000 customers. One of its former directors is 29-year-old Ben Davies, who was disqualified as a director for 11 years last July. However he retained close links to the firm. Sources say he continued to pay the rent and ‘turned up at the offices every day’. When contacted by this newspaper, Mr Davies, who lives in White City, West London, insisted he knew nothing about the stolen data. Barclays will offer all customers affected by the breach compensation after sensitive details were leaked . A retired sales manager from the Wirral, who asked not to be named, told how he lost £40,000 with FAM. How the Mail on Sunday broke the story . The 82-year-old said: ‘I strongly suspect I am one of those caught in this scam. The fraud fits my situation so perfectly. ‘I have suffered sleepless nights and had to go to my doctor for medication. There has been a huge human cost. My wife and I have been through two years of purgatory.’ He has been a Barclays customer since he was 20 and in December 2009 sought investment advice. In 2012 he was contacted by a trader from FAM who persuaded him to invest in rare metals. ‘The metals were supposed to be held in a bonded warehouse in my name. Where? I don’t know. I don’t know why I didn’t ask. I was simply going to ring up and get my money, and that was it.’ However his calls to the firm went unanswered last September. Police are investigating. Meanwhile it was reported this weekend that Barclays has begun a search to replace its chairman Sir David Walker, 74, who took over in 2012 in the wake of the Libor scandal. Barclays declined to comment.","Bank has promised compensation to customers affected in scandal .

"Smiling contentedly and holding the hand of his great-grandson, this is the last known portrait of Nelson Mandela. It was taken in May as he rested at home in Johannesburg in his favourite armchair – just a month before he was hospitalised. For Mr Mandela’s family, the  picture stands as a charming souvenir of happier times. And for three-year-old Lewanika it will, says his father, become ‘something he will treasure when he is old enough  to understand’. It is a fitting final image of a  historic figure whom all of South Africa is mourning – yet also celebrating for his legacy of peace, a statesman whose influence will be deeply felt all around the globe long into the future. Final portrait: The last known photo of Nelson Mandela, taken in May, sees him with his great-grandson, three-year-old Lewanika, holding his hand and smiling . Balancing on the edge of the chair, Lewanika gazes intently at South Africa’s founding father, the man who became a symbol of his country’s struggle against injustice, but who the little boy knew simply as ‘Baba’. In an exclusive interview with  The Mail on Sunday yesterday Lewanika’s father Ndaba Mandela – Mr Mandela’s grandson – said he took the picture as he sensed it might be the last opportunity to  capture them together. ‘It was around May, one Saturday afternoon. We were literally just coming to say hello to the old man and we caught him watching the National Geographic channel on TV,’ Ndaba, 30, said. ‘He looked at Lewanika and said, “Come, come.” The old man’s face lit up when he saw him – as you know he loves children. They hugged and my son kept calling him ‘Baba’. It was so touching seeing them together.’ Ndaba, chairman of the Africa Rising Foundation dedicated to the economic development of South African youth, lives at Mr Mandela’s house in Houghton, Johannesburg, where the former president died last Thursday. Proud: Lewanika's father Ndaba Mandela, pictured with his wife Kgmotso in 2010, says he took the photo knowing it might be his last opportunity . Ndaba said: ‘We are so proud to be able to preserve this special moment, and honoured to show it to the world.’ Mr Mandela’s daughter Zindzi, 53, also told The Mail on Sunday earlier this year how much her father loved having his young relatives around him. She recounted the story of how, on his release from prison, he begged her to stop breastfeeding her son so that he could have the baby in his bedroom, to feed him and care for him each night. Zindzi said at the time: ‘My father lights up and smiles whenever children are around him. He adores them, and lets them climb all over him.’ The final picture emerged as Mr Mandela succumbed to a chronic lung infection first diagnosed during his long prison days when he spent months in isolation in a dark damp cell. His condition rapidly worsened early last week when his eldest daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, told of her sorrow at seeing her father ‘on his deathbed’. Yesterday Ndaba, the first family member to speak publicly since Mr Mandela’s passing, told of his ‘great sadness’ but added: ‘There is a sense of relief too that he is finally in a better place. It has been very comforting to know that there are millions and millions of people around the world who share our sadness. I have seen all the flowers outside the house, it is unbelievable.’ Of the photograph, Ndaba added: ‘One day I will tell my boy about his famous great-grandfather and the picture will be very special to him.’ Tata Madiba: Nelson Mandela, pictured surrounded by young supporters in 1992, cherished the company of children and would 'light up' in their presence, his daughter said . Loss: Ndaba said his son will one day be old enough to understand the power of his grandfather and of the poignant photograph . He recalled that Mr Mandela was sitting in his favourite chair in the comfortable sitting-room of his home, surrounded by prized books and photographs, when he brought the boy to him. At the time doctors were concerned at his worsening heart condition; his swollen hands, a symptom of his illness, are clearly visible in the picture. Within weeks he suffered a medical emergency in the middle of the night and was taken to a cardiac clinic in Pretoria where he remained for three months. In the picture, Mr Mandela is demonstrably happy and animated to be in the company of his great-grandson. ‘When he was born, I asked the old man what we should call him,’ recalled Ndaba. ‘And my grandfather said Ngubencuka which is the name of one of our ancestors. I must say I was already set on Lewanika but we gave him Ngubencuka as a middle name.’ ON his grandfather’s death, Ndaba became the most prominent male member of the Mandela clan. ‘Personally I now feel under a lot of pressure,’  he said. ‘We are the ones left to carry the name, perhaps me in particular. So many close friends in messages of condolence have said things such as, “You have to step up now, brother”.’ Ndaba was in Brazil representing his country at the World Cup draw when he heard the news about his grandfather. ‘I had only just arrived at the place when my aunt rang me. We came home immediately.’ Family ties: Nelson Mandela's youngest child Zindzi, portrayed with him 201, has spoken of how her father begged to care for her son . He said that around ‘90 per cent’ of the family gathered at Mr Mandela’s home which stands on a street lined  with jacaranda trees in the wealthy suburb. ‘It has been sad but everyone has been busy feeding relatives and organising all sorts of things. We had a big family meal today which was good.’ Among those who spent the day at the house was Mr Mandela’s  second wife Winnie. His third wife Graca Machel was at his bedside when he died, along with several of his grandchildren, and tribal elders from the Xhosa community. They were joined by a priest who conducted the the last rites. One sentiment expressed repeatedly by South Africans over the past few days is that Mr Mandela, their liberator who freed them from the oppression of racial apartheid by sacrificing himself to 27 years in prison, was a fighter to the end. He surprised his many supporters, friends and family members by surviving his 95th birthday in July. At the same time, some have expressed concern that in the final months he was kept alive only by ventilators and was given dialysis for failing kidney activity. He was said to be receiving nutrition and sedatives intravenously and unable to talk. Mr Mandela had six children, three of whom pre-deceased him. One was his son Makgatho Lewanika Mandela, who died of an AIDS-related illness in 2005, aged 55.  Makgatho’s grandson – in the photograph with Mr Mandela – was given his middle name. In all there are 17 grandchildren and 13 surviving great-grandchildren. Zenani, daughter of Mandela’s granddaughter Zoleka, died in a  car crash on the eve of the opening ceremony for the 2010 football world cup held in South Africa. She was 13. Ndaba said: ‘We are a big family and we will be here for the next few days. The first big event will be the memorial service on Tuesday. As for the funeral on Sunday, I am sure there will a few heads of state attending. I know that Obama said he wants to come and the president of France wants to come, and all dignitaries from over Africa. ‘I haven’t heard about who is  coming from England.’ play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","Last known portrait of Nelson Mandela sees him with his great-grandson .

"The Special Forces marksman who is said to have told his wife that members of the SAS ‘arranged’ the death of Princess Diana faces a Ministry of Defence investigation amid claims he sent emails to his wife revealing sensitive details. The marksman, known as Soldier N, is also said to have stored secret SAS tactical documents and videos of operations in Afghanistan. In one email sent to his wife, Soldier N writes about an SAS mission in which a child was shot and an elderly woman hit by shrapnel. Investigation: Soldier N faces an MoD investigation after he was also said to have illegally stored secret SAS tactical documents . In other emails written during  a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009 he describes – sometimes gleefully – how insurgents  are killed. Elsewhere he mentions the names of colleagues and locations where the SAS and Special Boat Service are based. One email discloses that the SAS were killing insurgents with missiles that had been fired from drones. Crucially, Soldier N also reveals the dates when he and the rest of his unit were returning to  Britain on leave. In one message written in August 2009, Soldier N tells his wife: ‘We have arrived in Kandahar, the next  part is to get to Camp Bastion  but our plane broke so we’re staying here tonight with the  guys from Poole [the Special  Boat Service]. ‘Don’t you worry about me.  You know that I shoot first, ask questions later.’ In another, written in the same month, he says: ‘We had a good morning today.

In emails written during  a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009 he describes - sometimes gleefully - how insurgents  are killed . ‘1st we tracked a bad bomber but couldn’t get him but an hour later 2 more bastards took over from him and were up to badness so we keeeeelled them with a missile.

I was glad the job went well last night, especially as I was Squadron Sergeant Major for it and we got a big player and a financier,  so all is well.’ Later that month Soldier N writes: ‘We were out last night,  so that’s probably why you  couldn’t sleep.‘It was a good job.

"Pupils at a Scottish school were left 'gagging in the corridors' after a sewage pipe burst inside the building and effluent spilled down the walls. Children stayed at home in droves because of the smell at Carnoustie High School in Angus while contractors battled to stop the flow of waste. One concerned parent branded the school a 'health hazard', while another, Michelle Penman, said her children had told her the smell was 'horrific'. Scroll down for video . Waste: Children were left feeling ill because of the smell of raw sewage at Carnoustie High School in Angus . Morning lessons and school dinner arrangements were disrupted as the sewage ran down the walls, through lockers and out of plug sockets. One parent, who asked not to be named, said children were left 'retching' during the episode. She said: 'A sewage pipe had burst and it was running down the walls in the kids' social area, and down behind the lockers where they keep their belongings and lunch. 'The Headmaster wasn't saying whether the school was shutting, all that he said for pupils to do was to take their lunch hour as normal, from one to two, and come back. 'They've also been told not to use the toilets in the meantime and so they've had to go home to do that. It's a health hazard.' Big stink: Lessons were disrupted as the sewage ran along floors, down walls and through light sockets . One witness said that cleaners were working 'with masks and mops' on one side of doors while 'unmasked support staff on the other side of the door' were moving pupils along. They described the stink as 'outrageous'. Michelle Penman and Jacqueline Patterson were other concerned parents. Michelle said: 'My two have said the smell is horrific. 'How can they expect them to do lessons smelling raw sewage?' And Jacqueline, who said the children should have been sent home immediately, described a horrific scene of effluent 'running through light sockets' and school lockers being surrounded by 'puddles of sewerage'. Morning lessons and school dinner arrangements were disrupted in the incident at the Carnoustie school . Some parents have voiced frustration at children being asked to return after lunch - despite pupils complaining that the smell was making them feel sick. Head teacher Fraser Booth had advised pupils to take their lunch break as normal during the incident on Thursday. But parents were contacted later by email and text and advised the school would open as normal today after a 'deep clean'. A council spokeswoman said: 'There has been a problem with a leakage of raw sewage. 'The affected areas, which are not classrooms, have been sealed off while we work with Robertsons, who are responsible for the maintenance of the building, to resolve the issue.' The local authority later tweeted that following a clean-up overnight, the school would be open today.","Pupils report 'horrific' smell at Carnoustie High School in Angus .

"Even amid the tumult, his last words are said to have resounded clearly. 'Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.' With that, Wallace Hartley, bandleader of the Titanic, was washed away - with his precious violin, in its case, strapped to his waist. Folklore has it that, moments earlier, in an incredible act of stoicism, he struck up the hymn Nearer My God To Thee to calm passengers as the doomed liner slid beneath the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Perhaps the story has been embellished a little over the years since. Certainly it is one of the most memorable scenes from the James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Yesterday, the violin of Wallace Hartley, bandleader of the Titanic, sold at auction for more than £1me . Yesterday, Mr Hartley's story reached its extraordinary conclusion in the sleepy Wiltshire town of Devizes. There, his precious violin - which memorabilia hunters regarded as something of a Holy Grail and assumed had been lost forever - was sold at auction for more than £1 million to a British Titanic 'connoisseur'. Hartley and his seven fellow band members all died in the tragedy in 1912. Their bodies were recovered two weeks later. A gift from Hartley's fiancee Maria Robinson, the violin was inscribed 'For WALLACE on the occasion of our engagement from MARIA'. Wallace was the son of a humble Lancashire choirmaster but Miss Robinson, 32, was a woman 'of private means' - the daughter of a wealthy cloth manufacturer. She paid around £40 for the violin in 1910, the equivalent of £2,630 today. The fate of Hartley's violin has always been a mystery to Titanic scholars. The bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the CS Mackay-Bennett and taken to Nova Scotia, Canada. Violinist John Law Hume from  Dumfries in Scotland and bass player John Frederick Preston Clarke from Liverpool were laid to rest in Halifax but Hartley's body was repatriated  to England and buried at Colne,  Lancashire, the town where he was born and raised. The Titanic pictured as it departs Southampton, England on its maiden Atlantic voyage . Newspapers at the time reported that . Hartley was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest. However, when the effects of Body 224 were itemised by The Office of the . Provincial Secretary in Nova Scotia, there was no mention of it. Other . than his clothes and spare change, he had only a ring, a pen, a silver . matchbox, a gold cigar holder, a watch and chain, a collar stud, a pair . of scissors and two pieces of correspondence. It was not among the . possessions handed back to his father Albion Hartley, who collected the . body from the  ship The Arabic at Liverpool docks. The assumption has . long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in . collecting the corpses. So . when the violin re-emerged in 2006 - it was found in an attic in North . Yorkshire - its rediscovery prompted feverish debate over its . authenticity. Titanic . specialist auctioneers Henry Aldridge & Son insist that nearly . seven subsequent years of research and tests have proved it to be the . genuine article. For while the violin was never included on any official inventory, it had indeed been recovered. This was because Maria, devastated at Wallace's death, wrote to the authorities explaining its sentimental importance and asking for it to be sent directly back to her. The draft of her subsequent thank-you letter to the authorities in Maria Robinson's diary reads: 'I would be most grateful if you could convey  my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance's violin. 'May I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you  personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf.' INSCRIPTION: The violin was a present to Wallace Hartley from his fiancee Maria (right) Steve Turner, author of The Band That . Played On, which tells the story of 33-year-old Hartley and the . Titanic's band said: 'The story behind the violin involves love as it . was a gift from his fiancee. And it of course symbolises bravery and . religion. He added: 'It sums up all that you would like to believe from the tragedy. You can't imagine anything more iconic.' He . added: 'Because the violin was a gift from Maria to Wallace on their . engagement, it makes sense that she was the rightful heir rather than . Hartley's parents. I wonder whether Hartley clung on to it so tightly . because it was a gift from his wife-to-be. Otherwise he might just have . let it go.' The violin . remained Maria's most treasured possession and she never married. On her . death in 1939, it was passed to her sister Margaret Robinson who in . turn donated it to the Salvation Army at Bridlington, East Yorkshire. 'Then . it was passed to a Salvation Army music teacher who played the violin. She passed it to one of her pupils called Eve, who held on to it until . she died in the 1980s,' said Mr Turner. 'When her son, a lecturer, came . to clear out her loft he fondly remembered playing it as a youth and put . it in his own attic.' There . it remained until 2006 when, unaware of its provenance, he began to . wonder whether 'it might be worth something' and asked an expert to . 'cast an eye over it'. By . the time the experts arrived at his modest three-bedroom bunglaow, he . had already worked out that it was 'Titanic related' and 'might be of . interest'. But . in an yet another twist it emerged yesterday that the lecturer, who has . not being named, died two months ago. 'His family has become the main . beneficiary,' said Mr Turner. 'He wanted a lot of the money to go to . charity. 'It was never about the money with him, though, as he would have sold it years ago. In . yesterday's auction, the violin had a reserve price of between £200,000 . and £300,000 and was expected to reach as much as £400,000.

There were gasps from the audience as the price . reached £350,000 and then raced upwards to £600,000. The room fell silent when bidding hit £750,000. The violin eventually sold for £900,000 (£1,185,000 once commission and VAT were added) after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Selling the violin had taken just ten minutes. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge  said the 'ecstatic' new owner was British. 'He is a very knowledgeable Titanic connoisseur. 'He will enjoy it and probably put it on public display in the future. He's a very successful individual.' The violin has been on exhibition since May at Titanic Branson and Titanic Pigeon Forge in the United States where more than 315,000 viewed it and later at Titanic Belfast, the award-winning visitor attraction in Northern Ireland.

"A commander of the terrorist group behind the Nairobi attack was questioned by MI5 over plans to blow up a Kenyan shopping centre four years ago. Bilal Berjawi, then a British citizen, was arrested in Kenya by counter-terrorism officers who claimed to be working on instructions from MI5. Berjawi, who also went by the name Abu Omar, was questioned again on his return to Britain by the Security Service. At the time, he was a secret member of Al Shabaab, but MI5 and the Kenyans accused him of being a member of Al Qaeda. Mourning: People light candles during a memorial service in front of the shopping centre . Prayer: A father lights candles with his son during the 24-hour vigil . According to his account, he was held . in Nairobi for four days by Kenyan officers who were fed questions by . MI5. They accused him of planning to blow up an Israeli-owned . supermarket in an attack sanctioned by Osama bin Laden. The . Westgate Mall, which includes a large supermarket, is Israeli-owned. Berjawi’s account, if true, suggests a failure of intelligence by MI5 . and the Kenyan authorities. Security . at the mall in the days leading up to the attack was lax, even despite . the Kenyan authorities receiving more recent warnings of an imminent . attack from the UN. Berjawi’s . account was given to Cageprisoners, a British charity which campaigns . against alleged mistreatment of terror suspects. Berjawi, . who is of Lebanese origin, went to Somalia and joined Al Shabaab in . 2006. He returned to the UK a year later to raise funds for the . terrorists. He stayed . at his family’s council house in North Kensington, West London, before . leaving for Kenya, where he was detained. He told Cageprisoners the . Kenyans accused him of being an Al Qaeda suicide bomber who had trained . in Afghanistan. 'He returned to Somalia in 2009 and rose to become a senior figure in the group Al Qaeda in East Africa, a radical part of Al Shabaab. He was suspected of crossing into Uganda in 2010 where he took part in the Al Shabaab attacks at two bars as fans watched the World Cup final. The blasts killed 74. He was stripped of his British citizenship and, according to Al Shabaab, was killed in January last year by a US drone missile. Last night, MI5 would not say whether it knew of an attack on Westgate Mall four years ago, but a security source said: ‘There is often terrorist chatter about targets for spectacular attacks and over the years the same targets pop up.’","Kenya had been warned of an Al Shabaab attack in late September .

"Barack Obama last night threw David Cameron a political lifeline by following his lead in giving US politicians the chance to veto air strikes on Syria. In an unprecedented move, the President said he was determined to bomb Syria – but not until Congress voted on the matter. In theory, as Commander-in-Chief of US forces, he could ignore any Congress vote against military action, but having invited them to do so it is considered highly unlikely. President Obama has declared the US should take military action against Bashar Al-Assad's regime . Speaking at the White House rose garden, President Obama said he would seek congressional backing for any intervention . The Syrian army restarted its barrage . on the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus just two minutes after President . Obama finished his speech threatening air strikes. The attacks had . stopped five hours earlier. Regime forces also immediately ‘intensified’ attacks on Aleppo in Northern Syria. But on the streets of Damascus, those opposing Assad reacted with fury and disbelief that US intervention was not imminent. ‘What did we go through all that for?’ asked one woman. ‘Assad is victorious.’ Speaking . from the White House Rose Garden, Mr Obama referred directly to Mr . Cameron’s decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue and again referred . to Britain as America’s ‘closest ally’. Mr . Cameron’s gamble backfired when Labour leader Ed Miliband, backed by . Tory and Lib Dem rebels, inflicted a shock defeat, keeping Britain out . of the conflict. Tory MPs . feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to Mr Cameron’s . standing at home and abroad – and to the Anglo-US ‘special . relationship.’ But Mr . Obama’s extraordinary decision to emulate Mr Cameron, immediately hailed . by the Prime Minister’s supporters as ‘a huge compliment’, could turn . the tables on Mr Miliband, who believed he had scored a notable success. As UN inspectors crossed the border from Syria into Lebanon, they were followed out of the war-torn country by a continuous flow of families . Within . minutes of Mr Obama’s statement, a relieved Mr Cameron tweeted: ‘I . understand and support Barack Obama’s position on #Syria.’ And Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted: ‘A fine speech by the President of the United States on #Syria.’ The extraordinary development from Washington came at the end of Mr Cameron’s worst week in No 10 since winning power in 2010. The . Prime Minister was widely criticised for misjudging his plan to support . US plans to punish the Syrian regime after the massacre of hundreds of . civilians near Damascus. According to US intelligence reports, 1,429 . people were killed by chemical weapons on August 21, including hundreds . of children. The Prime Minister quickly took to Twitter to endorse the president's approach . Mr Obama’s . warm praise for Britain came only 24 hours after the White House had . called France, which has backed the military action, as its ‘oldest . ally’. In one sentence, Mr Obama appears to have restored the old order. Mr . Obama’s comments about the need for a democratic vote on strikes . against Syria echoed almost word-for-word Mr Cameron’s  justification . for asking MPs to support him. Flanked . by Vice-President Joe Biden, the President said that he remained . convinced military action against Assad was needed and that there was no . need to wait for the  UN weapons inspectors to report on the massacre. Then . he explained why he was taking the same democratic course as Mr . Cameron: ‘Many people have advised against taking this decision to . Congress and undoubtedly they were impacted by what we saw happen in the . United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed . to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister . supported taking action. 'Yet, . while I believe I have the authority to carry out this action without . specific congressional authorisation I know that the country will be . stronger if we take this course and our actions will be even more . effective.’ A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘We are delighted the president has done this. It vindicates the Prime Minister completely.’ President Obama revealed advisers had cautioned against going to Congress, particularly in light of the Commons defeat David Cameron suffered . Mr . Obama said:  ‘We saw terrible images of the dead. All told 1,000 people . were murdered including several hundred children. Young boys and girls . were gassed to death by their own government. This was an assault on . human dignity and a serious danger to security.’ Mr . Obama assured the US public: ‘We will not put boots on the ground’ but . said the US was ‘prepared to strike whenever we choose’. He . added, ‘I know well that we are weary of war. That is why we’re not . contemplating putting our troops in the middle [of a civil war]. But we . cannot and must not turn a blind eye to actions in Damascus.’ Where could they strike? This map of Syria highlights the main strategic towns in the strife-torn country . Target Damascus: Locations within the Syrian capital that would likely bear the brunt of any attack . However . Vladimir Putin yesterday dismissed claims that Syria used chemical . weapons as ‘nonsense’ and challenged the United States to provide proof . before launching air strikes. The . Russian President insisted that if Washington had evidence Bashar . Assad’s forces ‘used weapons of mass destruction’ it should be presented . to the United Nations. But . Mr Putin said: ‘If they say that the [Syrian] governmental forces used . weapons of mass destruction… and that they have proof of it, let them . present it to the UN inspectors and the UN security council. ‘Claims that the proof exists, but is classified and cannot be presented to anybody, are below criticism.’ There was no immediate response to Mr Putin’s intervention from the White House. A UN convoy of vehicles, carrying the UN team of inspectors, crosses into Lebanon from Syria, at the Lebanese border crossing point of Masnaa, eastern Bekaa valley, Lebanon . UN weapons inspectors arrive at the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, in The Hague, in the Netherlands . President Obama said he was 'comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council' that had so far been 'unwilling to hold Assad accountable' The . President faces an uphill battle to get Congressional permission to . attack Syria. As it stands, the Republican-controlled lower House of . Representatives will almost certainly deny permission while the . Democratically-controlled Senate might give him a reluctant go ahead. Some . Washington-based analysts said last night that Mr Obama could suffer . the same humiliation as Mr Cameron – and lose the vote. His decision to delay military was criticised by Syria’s main opposition party, the Syrian National Coalition. A . spokesman said: ‘I am surprised that the President said he has the . legal authority and the moral responsibility to respond but then to pass . this on to Congress. ‘The people of Syria will feel that this is inaction. ‘This is a failure of leadership on the President’s part. ‘I . thought this announcement was to tell the whole world that he is going . to punish this brutal regime and let them know they cannot use chemical . weapons against their own people.’ But . last night Syria’s prime minister Wael al-Halqi said his country was . prepared for US military action. He said: ‘The Syrian army is fully . ready, its finger on the trigger to face any challenge or scenario that . they want to carry out.’","President Obama has said the US should take military action against Syria .

"The only map sketched by Lawrence of Arabia is expected to fetch up to £100,000 when it goes under the hammer in London next month. The map, on faded yellow paper, shows northern Arabia and was sketched by the famous adventurer and military commander some time between 1918 and 1922 as he described his battle alongside Arab troops. It records a 'pivotal moment' in the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire that led to the capture of the Red Sea port town Aqaba in 1917. Lawrence of Arabia's map is expected to fetch up to £100,000 when it goes under the hammer at Sotheby's in London . Experts believe it is the only map depicting the journey Lawrence took across the hostile Saudi Arabian desert in 1917, which eventually led to the capture of a major port. It shows the route he and a group of Arab armies followed after leaving the port of al Wejh, and then reaching the Hejaz railway. A spokesman for Sotheby's, which is hosting the sale, said: 'On May 19th they embarked on the next stage of their trek into the barren lands towards Wadi Sirhan - the historic route that is recorded in this map. All his own work: The hand-drawn map shows the route the famous explorer, above, followed as he fought in the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire . Old and new: The original and, right, Lawrence's route superimposed on a modern map of the area . 'Lasting five days until the 24th May 1917, this journey would prove to be one of the most hazardous expeditions Lawrence ever undertook in Arabia.' The drawing was done for a well-known cartographer and explorer called Douglas Carruthers who Lawrence befriended towards the end of the war. Lawrence knew that his travels towards Aqaba were of interest to cartographers and carefully created the map for his friend by carefully plotting the route on a single sheet of paper, signing it and writing the words ‘This is the only drawn copy so please do not lose it prematurely’. Parched: Lawrence, above, remarked on the ferocity of the Saudi desert after he made his trip . In 1962 it was donated to the Royal Society of Asian Affairs, where it has remained until now. Experts noted that even a seasoned traveller like Lawrence, who inspired a 1962 Hollywood film starring Peter O'Toole, remarked upon the desert's harshness, writing on the side of the map: 'Air streaming past as thick smoke with dust sun-blinking in it. Iridescent dusk.' He also wrote about the hot mudflats: 'Sun reflects from them like mirror - flame-yellow, cutting into our eyes like glare burning glass on closed lids. Head if veiled too hot: Besides camel might stray... Heat in waves and eyes often going black.' The lot is listed for 4 November at Sotheby's Travel, Atlases, Maps and Natural History auction.","Map records 'pivotal moment' in Arab revolt against Ottoman Empire .

"The number of men taking anti-impotence drug Viagra has swollen to 1.4million - after the price of the blue pills dropped dramatically. NHS figures for last year show that the number of men taking the drug has risen from 1.2million in 2009. And more than 3,800 prescriptions are being dished every day since Viagra's patent ran out last year. Impotence help: More than 3,800 prescriptions have been handed out every day since Viagra's patent ran out . Until recently, only men who suffered impotence as a side-effect of illness or those seen by a specialist could be given the pills on the NHS. But since Viagra's patent ran out last year, its cost has plummeted by 93 per cent and cheaper, generic versions of the drug have become available. Because of this, the NHS has allowed all men with serious impotence problems to be prescribed the drug. Previously, only men with certain medical or psychological conditions could access erectile dysfunction drugs on the NHS. Some doctors have said the move has the potential to save relationships, as an estimated half of all men aged between 40 and 70 suffer from the problem. But some doctors are worried that increased demand for the drug could add to GPs' heavy workloads. Until a year ago, branded Viagra pills, made by US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, cost £21.27 for a pack of four. Since the firm's patent expired in June 2013, rival companies have been allowed to make generic versions containing the same active ingredient, sildenafil, priced at just £1.45 for four pills. Viagra's cost has plummeted by 93 per cent and cheaper, generic versions of the drug are now available . In 2012, the NHS in England spent £88million on providing erectile dysfunction drugs to 180,000 men, of which £43million went on branded Viagra. Under the new rules, it estimates demand could nearly double in three years to 330,000 men using the NHS to get the pills. Erectile problems most typically affect men in their forties or fifties but younger men can be affected too. Patients will still need a prescription to get the drug on the NHS and doctors will continue to make decisions based on individual needs. A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Erectile dysfunction is a common and distressing condition and may be a sign of more serious underlying health problems, such as depression or hypertension. Now that this treatment is much cheaper we have made it more widely available on the NHS and we hope this will encourage more men to visit their GP.'","Cost of blue pills has fallen by 93 per cent since patent ran out last year .

"Star Wars fans' expectations went sky-high after a photograph of the Millennium Falcon and an X-wing fighter was taken from the air and published online. The picture, showing the spacecraft on set at Greenham Common near Newbury in Berkshire, was taken from a flight school plane flying over the area.

Your never know what you might see.!![sic]' Scroll down for video . Skywalking: The Millennium Falcon, left, and an X-wing fighter, right, were snapped from the skies above Greenham Common, near Newbury in Berkshire. The craft, which seems to be half-constructed in this photograph, is set to feature in the new Star Wars film . Her first flight: Han Solo's famous spaceship as it appeared on screen in the original Star Wars in 1977 . The former airfield was famous in the 1980s for the women's peace camp that sprang up around it in protest at the stationing of nuclear weapons on the site. One fan, Tom Bexx said: 'Newbury has become cool THE millennium falcon is here', with another, JasonJ, writing: 'It's not easy to try & hide the Millennium Falcon! Beautiful set'. Star Wars: Episode VII, which is due to be released in cinemas in December 2015, reunites many of the cast of the original films including Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. The movie's filming schedule was thrown into chaos in June when Ford, who plays Han Solo, suffered a broken leg after the hydraulic door of the Millennium Falcon fell on him at Pinewood. He has since recovered. Space tech: Wires and plugs litter the ground when the cast and crew filmed scenes for the new film in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, above, earlier this year .

Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, said the old guard were there to support the new members of the cast recruited by director JJ Abrams. He said: 'It was certainly unexpected. I already had a beginning, middle and end. I never thought we'd come back. To go on to those sets that evoked so many memories, it is just astonishing. 'It just seems like an unexpected gift.'

"Dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the 'wrong' shoes. Parents Maria Gordon and Paul Cummings from Fairwater, Cardiff, say their daughter, Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear. Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff, insists that letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable. But Courtenay's parents claim they never received their copy. Shoe ban: Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils kept out of lessons for the day at Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff . 'They were kept in the hall like prisoners,' said shop worker Mr Cummings. 'Courtenay has been wearing shoes like that to school for the last two years. 'She wore them in year seven and eight with no problem and we've had no letter from the school or head teacher about it. 'They said they'd sent a letter but we had none.' He said his daughter told him that at the first assembly of the year last Tuesday a teacher checked pupils and children with the wrong shoes. They were then taken to another hall, where they sat all day, except for dinner time. The case echoes other uniform crackdowns across the UK this term. Last week, around 100 pupils aged 12 to 16 were given their marching orders just minutes after turning up for the first day of term at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, because their footwear were not 'black, leather shoes' and were 'inappropriate'. The school, above, says letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable . And sixty children were banned from classes on their first day for wearing the wrong trousers at Heaton Manor School in Newcastle. Pupils as young as 11 were put in ‘isolation’ for up to seven hours because they did not adhere to a strict new uniform policy. Laura Rawsterne, 12, who suffers from a foot complaint was forced to write 'decent people take pride in their appearance' 40 times after turning up to Excelsior Academy in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear on Monday, in the wrong shoes. In the latest case in Cardiff, Courtenay's mum claimed the school did not ring her or her husband at home or work. Uniform rules: A section of the school's uniform rules as shown on the Cantonian High School website . 'It's ridiculous. We know they can't wear trainers but these are black, lace up, canvas daps. She's a very responsible 13-year-old and she was very upset. We were not notified on the day and neither was our work. 'Courtenay enjoys school and what annoyed her is she didn't know what she'd done wrong. They were kept in a hall on a hot day. It's disgraceful.' Headteacher Lois Spargo was not available for comment but in a statement the school said: 'The school, as with all other schools has a uniform policy to promote pride and identity among the pupils. Sole reason: The rubber-soled shoes that the 13-year-old girl wore to school . 'All parents and carers were reminded at the end of the last academic year of Cantonian's school uniform policy which clearly states that black shoes and not trainers, daps, boots or sandals should be worn. 'At the beginning of the current academic year there were a small number of instances of pupils not wearing the correct school uniform, including shoes. 'In each case the school made attempts to speak to the parents so the situation could be rectified. 'Pupils were asked to sit in the hall while the school attempted to contact parents. 'The hall is a bright, airy room with large windows and it is used for both Assemblies and some lessons. 'All pupils had access to all the facilities of the school as needed, including the school canteen, toilets, etc. We are glad to report that all pupils are attending all lessons.'","Courtenay Cummings, 13, among 30 pupils who missed lessons for a day .

"An electrician who was almost blinded when he was glassed in the face has slammed the judge who ordered his attacker to pay him just £200 in compensation. Andrew Stanley, 37, was left scarred for life after Lee Barber hurled a glass at him in an unprovoked attack in a pub. Mr Stanley needed six stitches to his cheek and three more above his eye and suffered a detached retina leaving him blind for a week. Scarred for life: Andrew Stanley, from Beeston, Nottinghamshire, needed six stitches to his cheek and three more above his eye. He also suffered a detached retina that left him blind for a week . Constant reminder: Mr Stanley says that the attack has left him with scars that still bleed to this day . But despite his scars still being visible months after the horrific attack, a judge let his attacker walk free from court. Now Mr Stanley, from Beeston, Nottinghamshire, says this final insult has only added to the stress he is going through. Barber, 34, a delivery driver also from Beeston, pleaded guilty to one count of assault at Nottingham Crown Court on 1 September. Recorder Simon Redhead QC spared Barber prison and ordered him to pay Mr Stanley £200 compensation and carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Shockingly, the court heard Barber has a string of previous convictions for assault and criminal damage. Recorder Readhead told him: 'I make it clear to you - you now have had your last chance. 'You will repay your debt to the public by doing unpaid work.' Mr Stanley was attacked while he enjoyed a drink in May with friends in his local pub, The Cricketers in Beeston. A group of thugs, including Barber, entered the pub before one attacked Mr Stanley's friend. When Mr Stanley pulled them apart and headed for the exit Barber launched the glass and a chair at him. The glass splintered when it hit the left side of Mr Stanley's face - leaving him with scars that still bleed to this day. Speaking today, Mr Stanley called for the law to be changed so glass attacks were treated as seriously as knifings which carry harsher sentences. He said: 'The atmosphere changed when these three blokes walked in, including the man who attacked me. Mr Stanley has called for the law to be changed so glass attacks are treated as seriously as knife attacks . 'I knew one of them but he was not someone I would talk too.

'I was leaving the pub when Lee Barber threw the glass at me. 'I am insulted by the £200 compensation. I should have got at least a week's wages. I want judges to take glass attacks as seriously as a knife attack. 'The scar on my face is going to give the wrong impression of me because it makes me look like a thug. This was an unprovoked attack on myself. It was like being stabbed by a knife. 'This week I had a shave for the first time. The scar started pouring with blood again.

"Near a church in the small Spanish town of Olmedo stands a bust of Nick Clegg’s father-in-law, a fitting testament to his civic good deeds. The Deputy Prime Minister spoke warmly of Jose  Antonio Gonzalez in his  conference speech last week and mentioned with some pride that he was the  town’s first democratically elected mayor. Mr Clegg is not the first political leader to use inspirational family members to ram home a message. And the point he was making to  Liberal Democrats in  Glasgow was that ‘rights and values should never be taken for granted’. Jose Antonio Gonzalez, Miriam Clegg's father, was mayor of Olmedo in Spain which has a statue of him . But The Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Gonzalez’s triumph in local elections is only part of the story of his political career. What Mr Clegg neglected to mention was that Mr Gonzalez was already mayor at the time, having been appointed – not elected – during General Francisco Franco’s 36-year dictatorship. Franco seized power during the Spanish Civil War and ruled subsequently with an iron fist, executing thousands of opponents, banning political parties and demanding unquestioning loyalty. It was against this background that Mr Gonzalez, a headteacher, entered politics in the early 1970s. At the time, as with the rest of Spain, Olmedo’s civic leaders were selected by Franco’s regional representative, the provincial civil governor. Jose Antonio Blanco, who has written a history of Olmedo and served as a socialist councillor, explained: ‘He became deputy mayor and later mayor some months before Franco died in 1975. ‘He would have sworn allegiance to the regime, as all local politicians did. There were no elections, though. No one could question his authority. There was no debate, no democracy. The people did what Senor Gonzalez told them to do. Mr Clegg is  not very well informed.’ Nick Clegg (pictured left with his wife Miriam) used his speech at the Liberal Democrat conference to praise his father-in-law who may have been placed in power by Fascist dictator Fransisco Franco (right) During Spain’s transition to democracy after Franco, Mr Gonzalez remained mayor, but was only elected in 1979, by which time, according to Mr Blanco, his political stance had softened to match the mood of the people. Mr Blanco said: ‘He did do all the things Mr Clegg said he did – improve schools, housing and get people jobs – and in many ways he was a good mayor. 'But much of what he did only came about much later when he was elected as a national senator as well as mayor.’ Mr Blanco believes fervently that in the early days, Mr Gonzalez – a ‘tall, well-dressed, charismatic figure’ – was a Franco ‘sympathiser’. He claims it would have been ‘practically impossible’ for him to have been appointed mayor during the dictatorship had he been anything else. It must be said, however, that it is not a view shared, publicly at least, by older residents of Olmedo, where Mr Clegg’s wife Miriam was born in 1968. And neither can Mr Blanco produce hard evidence to support his claim. ‘He was not a sympathiser, he was a good man who did fine things for this town,’ insisted 91-year-old Eloy Rincon Garcia, as he sat in the town square yesterday. Grief: Clegg's mother-in-law (right) and wife mourn the death of Mr Gonzalez who was killed in a car accident in 1996 aged 58 . A senior political figure in the town said she too did  not believe that Mr Gonzalez ‘truly’ believed in the Franco regime. ‘The only people who would know would be his family and Jose himself,’ she said. Mr Gonzalez died in a car accident in 1996 at the age of 58. Yesterday a spokeswoman for Mr Clegg conceded that Mr Gonzalez had first been appointed mayor during the Franco era but said any suggestion he had any sympathy with the regime was ‘utter rubbish, offensive and untrue’. She added: ‘He was part of the administration before and during the transition to democracy simply because he was head of the local secondary school. ‘He was then elected as the first directly elected mayor and remained the elected mayor for the rest of his life.’ But Mr Blanco questions why anyone who was opposed to Franco would wish to seek office as his representative, even at local level. ‘His political style was certainly very dictatorial,’ he said. ‘He had me expelled from several council meetings and once had the police throw me out when I accused him of favouring another town over Olmedo in a debate about a new school. ‘He adapted to democracy like a lot of people who served under Franco and continued in public life. But there is no doubt he was a product of Franco’s time.’ For Mr Clegg, his wife’s father remains an inspiration. He told his party conference: ‘He was hugely proud of being the first mayor to serve his community through the ballot box. ‘He sadly died some years ago, and there’s a small statue of him today outside the church in Miriam’s village. ‘Our small boys see that statue every holiday. And they always ask about why he was elected and no-one before him. We teach them that democracy and freedom are a fragile and recent thing in many parts of the world.’","Olmedo historian says that MrGonzalez swore allegiance to regime .

"Wills and Kate are not the only royals with news of a new arrival - keepers of Britain's only breeding colony of king penguins are celebrating the appearance of the first chick to be hatched there in five years. The wrinkly, grey chick may not look like much, but staff at Birdland are heralding its arrival as a breakthrough in breeding at the park in Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire. It is the first of three king penguin eggs to hatch this year. The park had previously not welcomed new king penguin chicks into the world since 2009. Scroll down for video . Bird in the hand: The chick is the first royal penguin to hatch at the Birdland park in Gloucestershire since 2009 . Keepers now have to rear the chick by hand, monitoring it 24 hours a day to ensure it makes it through to adulthood. They feed it using a bottle full of fish that has been liquidised in a blender to replicate the food it would be given by its parents in the wild. And despite being native to freezing Antarctic climes, the vulnerable chick has not yet developed feathers so it is kept in an incubator to keep it warm while it grows. Cuddly companion: Keepers have placed a toy penguin in the chick's box so that it becomes used to other birds . Staff have even put a toy penguin in its box so it can get used to the look of other penguins. Simon Blackwell, the park's manager, said: 'The birth of our new arrival is quite something. 'We are part of a European breeding programme for king penguins and have the UK's only breeding colony, but our penguins hadn't laid fertile eggs for five years up until now. 'This year they laid six eggs, three of which were fertile. 'One egg has already hatched and the penguin chick is doing very well indeed. Growing up fast: Staff at the park measure the little king penguin who they say is 'getting stronger by the day' 'So far everything has been going to plan - we have to hand-rear the chick and have been feeding it a diet of liquidised fish with a few fish fillets. 'It is getting stronger by the day. 'It is very hard to tell the sex of a penguin before it reaches maturity. Once it gets to about eight weeks old we will take a small sample of its feathers and run some DNA tests to find out if it is male or female. Boy or girl? DNA will have to be taken and tested in order to tell the bird's sex - only then will it get a name . Ugly duckling: The baby bird has yet to grow its distinctive feathers that help to protect it in its native Antarctica . King size: The king penguins are the second largest species of penguin and can grow as tall as three feet . 'There have been plenty of suggestions for names but we will have to hold off giving it a name until that point.' King penguins - Aptenodytes patagonicus in Latin - are the second largest species of penguin, growing as tall as three feet and weighing up to 2.5 stones. They are distinguishable by their orange-tinted breasts, cheeks and beaks. In the wild they live off small fish and squid and are native to the islands of northern Antarctica. Edinburgh Zoo is famously home to Sir Nils Olav, a king penguin which in 1972 was appointed Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian Royal Guard.","Chick hatches at the only breeding colony of king penguins in Britain .

"A woman died after she was hit in the face by a mountain bike as she watched her boyfriend compete in a downhill race. Judith Garrett, 29, was struck by a bike which flew into the crowd when a competitor crashed during the contest in Llangollen, North Wales. She was airlifted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent, but died the following day. Spectator: Judith Garrett, right, from Northumberland was watching boyfriend Peter Walton, left, compete in a downhill race near Llangollen, Denbighshire . Family grief: As well as her boyfriend, Miss Garrett leaves behind her father Bill, mother Lorna and sister Jane . Miss Garrett had been due to move in to her first home with boyfriend Peter Walton, 31, two weeks after the incident on Sunday, August 31. She had also recently been promoted at her work at a pharmaceutical manufacturers. Her father, retired BT engineer and local councillor Bill Garrett, 66, said his ‘beautiful, loving’ daughter was at the bottom of the course waiting to watch her boyfriend, who is ranked 39th nationally by British Cycling in the ‘expert’ category. But tragedy struck when another rider came off his bike and it catapulted into the crowd, hitting her directly. No one else was injured. Speaking from his home in Prudhoe, Northumberland, Mr Garrett said: ‘We’re all still very much in a state of shock right now. I don’t know if anything like this ever sinks in. ‘A rider came down and came off his bike, which went flying through the air and right into the crowd of people watching. ‘It came down into the spectators but Judith was the only one who was hit. ‘She was unconscious and had suffered a really bad head injury. Her boyfriend didn’t see what happened but as soon as he got a message, he came down to her. ‘It just seems to have been a freak accident.’ All to live for: She had recently been promoted at work and was looking forward to moving into a new home . There was no room for Mr Walton, a manager for a pharmaceutical company, in the air ambulance, so he had to drive for an hour and a half to the hospital. Last night he was too upset to speak. Mr Garrett and his wife Lorna, 64, arrived in time to say goodbye before their daughter passed away. ‘We went down as soon as we found out and thankfully at least we were able to be there with her at the end,’ he said. Miss Garrett, whose grandfather Ted Garrett was the Labour MP for Wallsend from 1964 to 1992, regularly travelled from Mr Walton’s family home in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, where the couple were staying, to support him in competitions. On the day of the Borderline Events UK Downhill Series competition, she had called her parents to tell them how beautiful the area was. Miss Garrett's father said the death of his daughter would leave 'a huge void' in the lives of her family . Struck by a bike: A post-mortem examination revealed her death was caused by a major traumatic head injury . The contest involved cyclists taking turns to complete the 2km route at speeds of up to 40mph. The first section of the course was described as so steep ‘it was vertical’ in a biking blog earlier this year. The event was nearly finished at the time of the incident at 5.30pm and was stopped afterwards. A British Cycling spokesman said: ‘British Cycling treats the safety of competitors and spectators as the highest priority and we will be conducting a full investigation.’ An inquest into Miss Garrett’s death was opened on Monday and adjourned until January.

"Balanced high above the ground on a cherry picker, powerful hedge-cutter in his outstretched arms and dwarfed by a tree many times his size, this gardener looks like he’s got his work cut out. But it’s a far from daunting task for David Swanton, head gardener at Powis Castle in Welshpool, mid Wales, for he and his team gather every year to give this magnificent 300-year-old, 46ft tall yew tree its yearly trim. The job has been made much easier by the introduction of easily-manoeuvrable cherry pickers that have replaced the cumbersome and hard-to-move wooden ladders of old, meaning a job that used to take many months now takes mere weeks. And when the team do get a chance to take a break, then the views from on high are certainly worth savouring. The centrepiece of the National Trust tourist attraction is the magnificent castle that was originally built in 1200 as a medieval fortress. But it’s often the magnificent gardens and greenery that draw the most gasps – vast hedges, magnificent borders that grow on a slope - giving the impression that they’re hanging in the air - and the enormous yew hedges that have grown to such an extent they've formed a tunnel that visitors can pass through. Head for heights: David Swanton, head gardener at Powis Castle in Welshpool, mid Wales, at work on the yearly task of trimming the enormous yew trees .

Vertical challenge: Some of the impressive shrubbery and gardens in the grounds are planted on steep slopes . Lift-off: The new cherry pickers help the workers to reach hard-to-get-at areas of the tree that were sometimes missed in the past . Tree way: The gigantic yew hedges have been around for 300 years and have grown to such an extent that a tunnel has been formed that visitors can walk through .

Green giant: Elements of the trees have fused together over hundreds of years to form one enormous green growth . European influence: The gardens have been designed according to French and Italian styles . Neat and tidy: A great deal of work was carried out in the early twentieth century to restore the gardens after they had endured a period of neglect .

"A mother who set herself the task of visiting every Red Lion pub in the UK has just reached a huge milestone - by drinking in number 500. Personal trainer Cathy Price, 55, from Preston in Lancashire, has spent almost four years trekking across the country to visit the pub with the most common name in Britain. Miss Price still has 120 pubs left to sup at before finally completing her quest to drink in all of the Red Lion pubs in the UK. Scroll down for video . Pub crawl: Cathy Price from Preston, Lancashire, has spent four years visiting Red Lion pubs across Britain. Here she is pictured at the Red Lion in Wellow, Hampshire . So far she has travelled a staggering 33,000 miles in her car, picking up just one speeding ticket and one note for bad parking. Her ambitious hunt has set her back more than £12,000 but the mother said the journey has been 'completely worth it'. Miss Price started the adventure after noticing a sign in a Red Lion pub in the Lake District which said it was the most common pub name in Britain. Epic journey: So far she has travelled 33,000 miles to visit Red Lion pubs across the UK, including this one in Bitterne, Southampton . She then made a huge list of all 620 pubs with that name in the UK and started crossing them off one by one. The personal trainer said: 'I was drinking in the Red Lion in Hawkshead and saw a plaque saying it is the most common pub name. 'I immediately imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country and came up with a crazy idea of visiting all of them. 'My friends and family thought I was crazy at first but now they travel with me and some of friends have been to 60 Red Lions.' And Miss Price has just visited the Red Lion in Dagnall, Bucks, to take her tally to 500. Lancashire lion: This Red Lion in Earby is just one of 500 watering holes she has visited so far . But she still has around 120 to go before she has completed her quest. At every pub she visits Cathy poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale, meaning she has now drunk 250 pints. But she still has to visit the Red Lion pub in Gatwick Airport - and is prepared to buy herself a plane ticket to cross that one off the list. All pints covered: Her pub pilgrimage means she has travelled to drinking establishments as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Penzance in the south-west. Here she is enjoying a stop-off in Builth Wells, Powys . She added: 'It was a great feeling reaching this milestone and I only have around 120 to go. 'There are around 620 Red Lions in the UK but some are closing down so I have to be quick. 'I'm trying to finish on Grand National day next year - on the fourth anniversary of me starting my quest. 'I have finished Devon, Cornwall and London, but I still have a lot to visit in Kent and Oxford. Luton lion: The personal trainer, shown here in Luton, started her adventure after noticing a sign in a Red Lion pub which said that it was the most common name for a public house in Britain . Miss Price pictured outside the 'Llew Coch' in Penderyn, Rhondda Cynon Taf - the name means Red Lion in the Welsh language . One for the album: Time for a snap outside a Red Lion in London. The personal trainer says she still has a lot of public houses to visit in the south of England . 'I've still got to go to the Red Lion at Gatwick Airport. Hopefully they'll let me pop in for a drink, otherwise I'll have to buy a plane ticket!' She has also collected a huge array of souvenirs including beer mats, glasses, pub t-shirts and menus. If the pub has its own accommodation, Cathy often stays the night with her friends and family to get the 'complete experience'. Studham stopover: If the pub has its own accommodation, she often stays the night with friends . Another visit to one of the many British Lions - this time it's the turn of Little Compton in Gloucestershire. Right: Posing with a red lion outside one of the public houses on her list in Chosley, Wallingford . She has visited all of the Red Lion pubs which are north of her hometown of Preston, Lancashire, but still has a lot to visit in the south of England. And by the time Cathy eventually finishes her pub pilgrimage she will have visited pubs as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Penzance in the south-west. She added: 'It has given me a great excuse to travel and has improved my geography - the journey has been completely worth it. One for the road: At every pub she visits Miss Price enjoys half a pint of ale, and she also poses for a photograph - as she did here in Mumby, Lincolnshire . Just passing through: Farnsfield, Notts, and Moore, Cheshire (right) are two more inns to be ticked off . Believe it or not, it's time for another refreshing real ale - on this occasion it's Ripley in Derbyshire . 'I have travelled 33,000 miles on my adventure but I still have a long way to go. 'I have one drink in each pub I visit and I probably spend on average 25 pounds visiting each Red Lion, including travel, food and accommodation. 'The majority of Red Lion pubs are within a hundred metres of an old church and they are usually on a High Street, Market Place and Main Street. Simply red: It's a thumbs-up after an enjoyable visit to the Red Lion in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire . 'It's a great way of meeting new people and everyone is very supportive and interested to learn what I'm doing. 'The journey has been amazing because I have visited hundreds of towns and villages I would have usually just ignored.' Her favourite pubs have been in Whitley Bay, near Newcastle, Freshwater on the Isle of Wight and one in West Bromwich, near Birmingham. The popularity of the name dates from 1603, when King James I ordered red lions to be shown on buildings . Cathy has even visited nine Red Lion pubs abroad - in Dubai, New York, France, Rhodes, Madeira and four in Australia. She added: 'My friends and I sometimes turn our visits into a holiday or day trip, stopping over for the night if they have nice accommodation. 'Thankfully, I can enjoy the drinks and lunch knowing my work keeps me active and will burn off the calories. I don't have a beer belly.' Only 120 left to go: The traveller enjoys a brief rest at Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire, as she reaches the impressive milestone of 500 pubs visited out of 620 Red Lions in Britain . The Red Lion is the most common pub name in the country, with a history dating back to King James I in 1603. When he came to the throne in 1603 he ordered all public buildings to display a heraldic red lion in a prominent place. The nearest pub to Downing Street is called the Red Lion and is a popular haunt for MPs.","Cathy Price, 55, from Preston has spent four years visiting pubs all over UK .

"Police are investigating a suspected poisoning attack that killed hundreds of tropical fish in a newly-opened pet shop. Around 300 fish were killed after a thick 'carpet of food' was poured into six tanks at Paws pet shop in Musselburgh, East Lothian. Staff believe a suspicious couple who were left unattended may have deliberately carried out the sabotage. 'Heartbreaking': Sam Lawson, 24, at Paws pet shop in Musselburgh, East Lothian, where 300 fish were killed . The total cost of the damage is estimated at £2,000 as tank filters will have to be replaced. Shop owner Sam Lawson, 24, faced the 'heartbreaking' task of spending six hours removing all the dead fish. She said: 'You wonder what goes through people's minds. 'Even if someone had a problem with me, there is no reason to hurt the animals. This has been an attack on Paws. Sabotage fears: It is thought a thick 'carpet of food' was poured into six tanks at the shop poisoning the fish . 'Whoever did this, it took thought and planning as they were in and out in a matter of minutes.' Miss Lawson said that the tanks were laced with toxic liquid and elevated levels of ammonia were detected in the water. Staff claimed the water had turned an unusual orange colour and many of the dead fish were tropical cichlids worth up to £20 each. No signs of life: Miss Lawson had to spend six hours removing the dead animals from the once-teeming tanks . Dr Martin Brammah, a tropical fish expert, said 'an ammonia spike in the water' was one of many possible causes. He said: 'If you wanted to poison them you could do it quite easily. 'If you have too many fish and then more food is added, ammonia is produced. It could have been a problem with the water supply, or even a lose wire. 'If someone poured something like a can of Irn-Bru in that could easily do it, particularly if the tanks are on a centralised system.' Jenny Quirk, 30, had been supervising the shop while Miss Lawson spent her birthday with her family. She believes that an older man and a younger woman went into the aquarium while she was busy dealing with customers in the front of the shop. She said: 'I feel so awful because I was minding the shop. Sam's the owner and doesn't take a lot of time off and she was away for her birthday. 'She must have thought ""I can't even leave the shop for half a day."" I feel like I have let her down.' Miss Lawson is now installing CCTV cameras in the store to prevent another attack. A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed a probe had been launched and called for witnesses to come forward. He said: 'Police Scotland officers responded to a complaint from the owner of a pet shop that someone poisoned most of the tropical fish in the shop by putting excess food into the tanks. Enquiries are ongoing.'","Three hundred fish die in suspected attack at shop in East Lothian .

"Scarred: Wayne Ingold was attacked when he answered the door at his home in Witham, Essex . A father of two scarred for life in a horrific mistaken identity acid attack has bravely released pictures of his 'appalling injuries' in a bid to track down the men responsible. Wayne Ingold opened a communal door at his block of flats in Witham, Essex when he heard a man banging. But the 56-year-old's life was forever changed in that fateful moment when he opened the door as a second men squirted his face and upper body with acid. The retired chauffeur - who had worked for pop supremo Simon Cowell - rushed back inside his home screaming in pain looking in his mirror to see his face 'melting'. Mr Ingold has now bravely allowed pictures of his injuries, taken whilst he was in hospital, to be released in the hope it will lead to arrests. Describing the horror attack, he said: 'I thought to myself, naively, why is this man squirting juice in my face? 'I put my hand up to protect myself, the guy carried on spraying it down my back, neck and shoulder. 'I took some of it in the mouth and swallowed it, it turned my face and some of my teeth black. 'Within seconds, the pain was unbelievable. I put my hands up to my face, turned and ran back into the flat. 'I looked into the mirror in the bathroom and it looked like my face was melting.' Mr Ingold was rushed from his home to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. He has undergone a series of skin grafts since the attack but doctors have warned him that he will be scarred for life. Scroll down for video . Horrific injuries: Mr Ingold has asked for the graphic pictures to be released in the hope that those responsible will be caught and brought to justice . Mr Ingold, who has also worked as a wedding photographer, has moved out of his home because of the emotional impact the acid attack had on him. He remains mystified as to why he was attacked but believes it was a case of mistaken identity, simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He said one of his two attackers shouted '55' as he opened the door, but that was not the number of his ground-floor flat. Crime scene: Mr Ingold has moved out of his home, above, because of the emotional impact of the attack . Mr Ingold has undergone weeks of painful skin grafts following the attack last month to repair the damage done. He believes it was only the quick thinking of paramedics that saved him. 'I managed to get to the phone and call 999. I was just screaming down the phone for them to come quick. It felt like it took 10 hours for them to come, but it was more like 10 minutes. 'If it wasn't for the paramedics' quick thinking it could have been a lot worse - they rushed me into the shower and washed me down for ages - I'd really like to thank them.' 'After the skin grafts, my legs looked like raw steaks, but the doctors are happy with the way the grafts have taken and have to moisturise my skin daily. Police have released e-fits of the two men they want to speak to in connection with the chemical attack . The horrific incident was particularly tough on Mr Ingold, who had to sell his photography business after suffering a stroke and brain haemorrhage in 2006 and had to learn to walk and talk again. He is hoping that his attackers will see the impact of what they have done and give themselves up to police. He said: 'Until a few weeks ago my face was still black. I just want to know what gives them the right to do this to an innocent person, to destroy my life and my son's and daughter's; we've all been through hell. 'Unbelievable pain': The father of two has had to have skin grafts following the injuries he suffered in the attack . 'I still feel terrible - my confidence is on the floor, I still get flashbacks of a guy throwing the acid on me then running around the corner. 'I just want them caught and brought to justice. If they can do it to me they can do it to someone else.' DC Alan Lewis from Essex Police said: 'The photographs clearly show how Wayne suffered appalling injuries in this incident. 'He has asked us to release them to show what these people are capable of causing and how they have to be taken off the streets and brought to justice. 'It is believed that this was a case of mistaken identity and extensive investigations have shown that there is no evidence that anyone in the area was the intended victim in this crime. 'We have now widened our enquires in to the London area but we are still hoping that people in Witham may remember seeing the two men in the e-fits. 'We also hope that someone might remember seeing the two men up to half an hour before the incident occurred. We believe that they seemed to be lost and were wandering around looking at property numbers before arriving at the flats. 'We know they had a blue Vauxhall Signum or hatchback-style vehicle that was seen in the area but we have no information about the index number or anything else that would help us find it.' Anyone who recognises the men in either e-fit or who has other information about the attack is asked to call Essex Police at Braintree CID on 101 or ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. A 19-year-old man was arrested following the attack but released on bail the next day as the investigation continues.","WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"A pair of unmistakable glasses which belonged to bespectacled funnyman Benny Hill have emerged for sale more than 20 years after his death. The wire-rimmed specs were worn by the slapstick comic in a 1973 sketch called The Deputy in which he played a bungling Wild West sheriff. Hill had eye-holes drilled in the thick lenses - because contrary to popular belief there was nothing wrong with his sight. Making a spectacle of himself: The wire-rimmed glasses that TV funnyman Benny Hill wore in The Deputy sketch for his hugely popular TV show are set to go under the hammer at C&T Auctions in Rochester, Kent . He became famous for his unique style of rude and raunchy comedy that often included chasing scantily clad women. His TV series The Benny Hill Show was such a hit that it ran for almost four decades and made him a household name. The glasses are the last item to be sold from a private collection of memorabilia assembled by a fan following Benny Hill's death in 1992. Experts have tipped them to fetch £600 when they go under the hammer at C&T Auctions in Rochester, Kent. The glasses are being sold with letters of provenance from Benny Hill fan club Benny's Place and Frances Bolwell, a costume designer who worked on The Benny Hill Show. Glen Chapman, a specialist in TV memorabilia at C&T Auctions, said: 'Benny Hill is a TV legend and there is nothing more recognisable than his round glasses. Double vision: The specs, pictured with auction tag, were worn in a 1973 edition of the comic's show where he played a Wild West sheriff. Hill had two holes drilled in the lenses as he couldn't see through the thick glass .

"An iconic pre-war racing car designed by the father of Bentley Motors has sold for £1.5 million at an auction. It was a world record price for the famed British marque at auction. The Lagonda LG45R Rapide - known simply by its registration plate 'EPE 97' - has been described as 'the most famous Lagonda of all'. This beautiful burnt-red two-seater vehicle that could reach 100mph was built in 1936 after Lagonda had appointed W.O. Bentley - the man who started Bentley Motor Cars in 1919 - as their chief designer. Scroll down for video . The Lagonda LG45R Rapide sold for £1.5m when it went under the hammer at the Goodwood Revival weekend . The car could reach speeds of 100mph and competed in races such as the Le Mans 24 Hours .

"The UK's smallest chapel is believed to have been found - purely by chance. The seven-foot-wide and 10-foot-long building is believed to date back to the eighth or ninth century. But Bill Devereux did not know he was the owner until he was painstakingly restoring Wilderness Millhouse in Gresford, near Wrexham, north Wales, which he bought 20 years ago. Tiny discovery: Bill Devereux found the tiny chapel when he was tidying up land near Wrexham in north Wales . The 66-year-old was clearing rubble away from a bank when he was astonished to discover the ancient, tiny place of worship buried low down near the house in Gresford, near Wrexham, north Wales. And he believes it could even be the 'lost' St Leonard of Glyn Chapel, whose precise location has been a mystery to archaeologists for years. Mr Devereux said: 'It took a while to get people round here to see it, but [historic monuments body] Cadw have been to inspect it and said it is one of the best preserved chapels they have ever seen. They have made it a designated ancient monument. 'We think it dates back to the eighth or ninth century. 'The house was built in 1420 and would have been built at ground level at that time. History mystery: Building could be 'lost' St Leonard of Glyn Chapel, whose location has been debated for years . 'The chapel has been built at a level a lot lower than that. 'The property had been burned down before I bought it 20 years ago and I've been restoring it. The chapel had been buttressed in on either side, so the first I saw of it was the roof at floor level and thought it was a really strange structure. 'I knew it was important, special, religious, with a deeper meaning. I see myself as a custodian, to make sure it isn't damaged, and want it saved for another 600 years.' Mr Devereux said he is ready to invite the public to view the chapel. He said: 'I want it to be sympathetically used, so if a practising Christian group want to hold services here, or anyone wants to visit, they can get in contact - I am happy to share, as long as they let me know they are coming beforehand.' Details about the St Leonard of Glyn chapel are vague. According to the Caer Alyn Archaeological and Heritage project website, as far back as 1254, one of the clergy who assessed the parishes of the Deanery of Maelor for taxation was one 'John de St Leonardi'. Prayer space: Mr Devereux says he is happy for people to hold religious services in the seven-foot-wide chapel . It is only through documentary evidence that anything is known at all about the medieval chapel of St Leonard's; the precise site of the building is still a mystery and the extant documents give very few clues, but it is believed to have been located on the west bank of the Alyn. The last mention of the chapel in the public records was in 1507 where it is apparently referred to as in 'Llai', and near the River Alyn. Phil Cox, of the Caer Alyn Archaeological and Heritage Project, said: 'We have done 13 years of research on that land and all the documents tend to put St Leonard's where Bill's chapel is, so it could be associated with it, have some connection, but possibly not be the actual chapel itself. 'It is certainly medieval so the dates are in line.' Two other churches that have previously claimed the distinction of being the UK's smallest chapel are St Trillo's in Rhos on Sea and Bremilham Church in Wiltshire.","Tiny place of worship is believed to date back to the eighth or ninth century .

"Retired doctor Peter Williamson thought he was going to be mugged . A retired doctor who assaulted a taxi driver with a walking stick because he thought that he would be late for a performance of a Puccini opera has walked free from court. Peter Williamson, 70 next month, sat stony-faced at the hearing, wearing a dark suit coupled with a cream pocket square as he pleaded guilty to assault with occasioning actual bodily harm. Hammersmith Magistrates Court heard Willamson flagged down Kevin Johnson's cab at 4.45pm on June 17 at Raynes Park to take him to an open air performance of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West (The Girl of the Golden West) in Holland Park, west London that commenced at 7.30pm. En route, Willamson announced that he had no money and needed to stop at a cashpoint. As they were driving up Warwick Road near Earls Court Williamson became rude and aggressive shouting at the cab driver: . Tom Gill, prosecuting, told the court that Williamson 'shouted at the victim 'where are we you f*****g c***' and demanded 'Where are you f*****g taking me. 'The victim could not understand why Dr Williamson was getting so irate and wanted to get him out of the taxi as soon as possible. He needed to get to the opera for 7pm and it was only 5.20pm.' Mr Johnson pulled up at a cashpoint near Sainsbury's on Kensington High Street, west London. As Williamson got out, a man was already at the cashpoint and he wandered off up the street. Mr Johnson got out the car to show him the way but as he approached Williamson the retired doctor raised his walking stick and struck the taxi driver. When Mr Johnson touched his head, he found blood. A member of the public called the police and the victim was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where he was given two stitches. Taken into custody, Williamson said that he thought Mr Johnson was going to rob him and steal his pin number. The open air Holland Park Theatre, home of the Opera Holland Park in London . Defence lawyer Edgar Fernando said Williamson, who is a fellow of the Royal Institute, was suffering from mouth and lung cancer. He added: 'It was a single blow. He admits assault and said he feared his bank card and pin would be taken away from him. He acted in self-defence although it was excessive. 'In his 71 years he has committed no offence. He has shown remorse, he did not want to cause injury and admits he acted in an antisocial way. Williamson received an 18 week sentence, suspended for a year. He must also observe a three-month curfew, from the hours of 8pm through to 6am, and pay his victim £200 compensation . Peter Williamson was on his way to to an open air performance of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West (The Girl of the Golden West) (above) in Holland Park, west London when he attacked Kevin Johnson . 'He has said whether he is given a 12 month prison sentence or not he will not commit an offence again. He is stressed to be here and feels his standing in the community has suffered by the reports, he has been punished enough.' He added his bank balance was minus £700 and he was living off a pension of £170. Williamson was jailed for 18 weeks suspended for a year at Hammersmith Magistrates Court (above) Chairman of the bench Joanne Varley told Williamson: 'The starting point for this particular category is 26 weeks imprisonment. 'However for 71 years you have been of extremely good character, [and] of good conduct, you have shown remorse, it was single blow and you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. 'However, as I have mentioned before, on the other side of things you used your walking stick as a weapon towards a man doing his public duty, namely being a taxi-driver.' Williamson received an 18 week sentence, suspended for a year. He must also observe a three-month curfew, from the hours of 8pm through to 6am, and pay his victim £200 compensation plus a victim surcharge of £80 and costs of £85.","Peter Williamson was verbally and physically abusive to the cab driver .

"Smoking is still considered cool by children trying to be popular, new research suggests. The news comes as a blow to the increasingly widespread anti-smoking message as study author Professor Thomas Valente said that not enough has been done to make not smoking cool. Shockingly, almost 70 per cent of adult smokers started at age 18 or younger and almost 3,900 children under 18 try their first cigarette every day, according to the American Lung Association. Considered cool: Popular teenagers tend to smoke and influence others to take it up in order to fit in, new research found . Popular teenagers tend to smoke and influence others to take up the deadly habit in an effort to fit in and be liked, the new research found. The study also found that students’ perceptions of their peers’ behaviour mattered just as much as whether or not they actually smoked. According to Hispanically Speaking News, Prof Valente said: ‘Popularity is a strong predictor of smoking. ‘We haven’t done enough to make it cool not to smoke.’ The findings from Prof Valente, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, confirms trends of smoking students in sixth through to 12th grade across America and in Mexico. Researchers found that the most popular students in ninth and tenth grade at seven predominantly Hispanic and Latino high schools in southern California were more likely to smoke cigarettes than other students. Warning parents: Study author Professor Thomas Valente warned parents to be wary of encouraging their children to fit in. 'There's a liability to that,' he said . ‘It’s the popularity that’s a risk . factor for smoking, and it’s very disturbing,’ Dr Norman Edelman, chief . medical officer for the American Lung Association and a professor of . preventive medicine at Stony Brook University, in New York said. Prof Valente warned parents to be wary of encouraging their children to fit in at school. He said: ‘We always want our kids to be popular, but there’s a liability to that. ‘By being popular you’re more aware of other things that are happening around you and you want to be sure to retain that popularity, which in and of itself is stressful.’ Researchers asked 1,950 student whether they had tried smoking and how frequently they had smoked in the past month. They were also asked about the smoking habits of their peers and how they thought their friends felt about smoking. The conclusions, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health on Wednesday reported that of ninth grade students, 25.6 per cent and 28.1 per cent of tenth graders admitted to smoking. In another recent study from Colombia University, about 17 per cent of American high school students admit to drinking, smoking or taking drugs during the school day. According to Cancer Research UK, one in eight British children become regular smokers by the age of 15 and trying just one cigarette can make children more likely to start smoking several years later.

"The last few days have been something of a whirlwind for Joey Prusak whose story has been all over the internet. The Hopskins, Minnesota Dairy Queen employee saw 'an older lady' steal a $20 bill from a blind customer after unknowingly dropping it on the floor. Joey ended up confronting the thief and asked her to return the money to its original owner. Scroll down for video... Serving up kindness: Joey Prusak, 19, an employee at the Hopkins, Minnesota Dairy Queen (pictured) gave a blind customer $20 out of his own pocket after he saw another customer steal the man's money he dropped on the ground . Honorable: Joey Prusak, 19, said that returning the money to the blind man 'felt like it was the right thing to do' When she refused, he ended up giving $20 back to her on behalf of Dairy Queen. It was, however, his own money. A fellow customer witnessed the interaction and wrote an email to the store which was then printed, posted on the store noticeboard and then photographed and posted online. Joey has simply said that he was just doing his job. Mr Prusak started working at the Dairy Queen in Hopkins five years ago when he was just 14. Sweet spot: The thieving customer was asked to leave and the witness said they will forever be a Dairy Queen customer after the incident (stock photo) Nice tip: A witness emailed the company and praised the employee . 'It's the only job I've had, the only . job I've needed,' he smiled. He is now the manager of the store and . essentially runs the branch. The . letter to the store explained how the customer saw a blind man had . taken his food and sat down inside the store to eat. Joey went . over to him and opened his wallet, giving him $20 of his own cash saying that . he wanted to give him the money 'on behalf of Dairy Queen' before . promising that it had the same face value as the bill he dropped. 'I . was in shock by the generosity that your employee had, taking his own . money out of his own wallet to give to the customer because some other . lady decided to steal something that wasn't hers,' the customer wrote. He talks about the incident, which happened on September the 10th, in the most modest of manners. '[After . the visually imparied man gave his order] right then and there I knew . when he dropped that $20 bill, game's over, he's not going to know,' explained Mr Prusak to KARE11. 'He . just kept walking and that's when the lady picked it up and I thought, . she's going to give it back 'cause she picked it up so quickly.' Mr Prusak said he then saw the woman her put the money in her purse. He didn't know what to say, at least not at first. When the customer reached the counter for her order, Joey confronted her. She claimed the money was hers and he said it wasn't. 'I . said, ma'am I'm not going to serve someone as disrespectful as you, so . you can either return the $20 bill and I'll serve you, or you can . leave,' explained Prusak.  'And she goes well it's my $20 dollar bill, . and I go, we'll then you can leave.' Accolades: Joey received a call from Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world (and a major shareholder in Dairy Queen) and he has had offers to appear on Queen Latifah's TV show . It was one of the other customers in the store who saw what happened and wrote an email to Dairy Queen. An impressed co-worker decided to post the message on Facebook and it ended up going viral. He . has been inundated with requests from various news stations and . websites that he has lost count, however he says he is excited about a . possible appearance on the 'Queen Latifah Show.' 'Warren Buffet called me this morning and we talked for about 10 minutes,' Mr Prusak said. Warren .

Mr Buffett said he’s planning future talks with Mr Prusak. 'I . go, ‘What I would like to know is why you’re calling here?’ He goes, ‘I . just wanted to call and thank you for all that you did. It means a lot . to me,’' Prusak said. 'He told me he was going to have me flown out in May,  to attend an investor's conference in Texas.' 'I was too star-struck to be asking questions,' he admitted. 'I didn't even know what to say.' Even with the star-studded attention, Joey Prusak remains humble about his deed.

"Cleaning up: Nick Grey, who poses with his cordless invention the Gtech, is the new James Dyson . Rumour has it that it’s practically impossible to get into the Dyson headquarters without myriad levels of security clearance. So secretive has the high-powered (in every sense) world of vacuum cleaners become that fear of espionage is rife. Dyson employees must use a fingerprint scanner to enter the building and, even then, access to most research areas is only for a select few. So when the man tipped as the next James Dyson leaps in front of me as I reach for a door handle inside his domestic appliance empire, it’s not a surprise. ‘I’ll need to get that,’ says Nick Grey. Of course, he will. Are we talking fingerprints here, too? Eyeball scanning? Am I going to be denied access until I swear not to divulge suction secrets to the Russians? Well, no. It’s turns out we are just talking a temperamental door. ‘It’s a bit stiff,’ he says cheerily, yanking it open. Welcome to the surprisingly low-tech world of Gtech, the little vacuum cleaner company that is taking on the big boys of dust-busting. Have you even heard of Gtech? Well, it is short for Grey Technologies, a name which even Mr Grey, 45, admits doesn’t have the pizazz of Dyson. ‘It’s not a very good name, is it?’ he frowns. ‘But I couldn’t think of anything. People don’t know how to pronounce it. Our customers phone up and say “I need a battery for my Getch”.’ All of which makes the success of Gtech’s flagship product, a lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner called the AirRam, even more unlikely. The AirRam may look unprepossessing, and its inventor admits that it was designed with the elderly market in mind. ‘The first customers were in the over-80 age bracket,’ he nods. But, as unlikely as it sounds, this machine has been, er, wiping the floor with the opposition with 32,000 of them flying off the shelves every month. And their fans love them. Not least because of their clever internal compression technology which crunches all the dirt into solid little bales which you simply tip out into the bin. The bales are made - in rather revolutionary fashion - just a few centimetres from where the dust and dirt enters the machine, rather than having to travel through reams of tubing. The absence of both bag and miles of tubes makes for a superlight machine too. Grey proudly shows how the AirRam can be carried with just one finger. He is, however, reluctant to reveal how he makes the bales of dirt, concerned as he is about competitors copying his technology. In the year to date, he says, the AirRam has outsold every rival cordless product. Gtech is now making lavish claims about it being the UK’s best-selling vacuum cleaner by value - hotly disputed by Dyson, of course. Sir James Dyson - the man who changed the face of the entire industry - is certainly familiar with Gtech. Last year, his company took the extraordinary step of taking full page adverts in national newspapers, claiming that Dyson’s sleek (and much sexier, it has to be said) cordless model, the DC59 Animal, boasted ten times as much suction as the AirRam. It was akin to Goliath inviting David to a duel. Dyson was also quick to pounce when Gtech insisted that their product was superior. It complained to Advertising Standards Authority, which upheld eight of the nine complaints and forced Gtech to change some wording on its adverts. Scroll down for video . Techy: Mr Grey's vacuum empire is run from his farmhouse near Worcester . ‘Yes, it was extraordinary to have the big boys come after us,’ admits Mr Grey. ‘Maybe we were a bit naïve about the wording. It never occurred to us that every word would be scrutinised by teams of lawyers.’ Vacuum cleaning companies have teams of lawyers? ‘Oh yes, Dyson have about 20, 17 in house.’ And how many do you have? ‘None.’ Although the company launched in 2001, it’s only in the past three years that Gtech has come out of the shadows. Last year it had a £20million turnover. Next year’s predicted turnover, says Mr Grey, is £40million. So can you smell the success at company HQ yet? Frankly, no. All you can smell is manure because Gtech is situated on a farm near the village of North Piddle in Worcestershire. Fifty cows stare at me as I pick my way across the yard. My mucky shoes are greeted with whoops of delight when I get inside, however. Lightweight: The AirRam is so light it can be lifted with a single finger - a fact of which Mr Grey is undeniably proud . ‘We love muck. One of the advantages of being out in the country is that people are always treading in some sort of goo,’ says Mr Grey, getting down on the floor to examine exactly what type of dirt it is (there are infinite varieties). Obviously, they do pay people to tread muck professionally. At the back of one barn is a scene which could have come straight from a Heath Robinson cartoon. Three menacing-looking vacuum cleaners are held in place over a revolving conveyor belt of carpet to test their performance. They turn on automatically for 14 ½ minutes, rest for 30 seconds, then turn themselves on again. All day and all night. Grey looks at them as one would gambolling lambs. Gtech still feels very much like the sort of business that was started in someone’s garage - which it was. Even now the products are likely to be tested by Grey asking his mother’s friends to ‘give them a whirl’. ‘Yeah, you can have all the lab testing in the world, but you can’t beat trying a prototype out in someone’s home, with real dirt and dogs and children and mess.’ So his home - he has four young kids - is presumably spotless?  ‘That’s the trouble. I test them so much we don’t have enough dirt! You need a few days build-up. We haven’t got a dog, unfortunately, so I’ve been known to stop people walking by my house with their dog to say “Can I come and clean your house?” ‘Most people like it - once I’ve explained. They don’t think I’m barmy, no, not really. I mean I don’t sneak into their houses at night, doing guerrilla cleaning.’ Don’t be fooled, though. This is not someone who has stumbled into success. Nick Grey’s rise has been methodical and determined. He wasn’t born with a burning desire to design vacuum cleaners. He left school with just two O-levels and got a job with leading vacuum maker Vax, which was where his love affair with appliances started. ‘I went in at the lowest level. It was my job to set up the lab for testing, get the dirt and spread it around, then clear up afterwards. I’d watch the engineers and think “I want to do that”.’ He progressed up the company, first getting his hands on ‘actual exciting machines’, then becoming involved in the design process. Powerful: Gtech's range has prompted a vigorous response from industry giants Dyson . After 12 years, he was running the engineering department, and studying for an Open University degree in his spare time. ‘I think quite early on I knew that one day I’d go out on my own. I did have big ideas that weren’t necessarily wanted. I wanted to go down the cordless route, but they weren’t interested.’ He was at Vax, at a lowly level, circa 1993, when James Dyson burst onto the scene. There was a bit of hero worship going on there. ‘To give him credit, Dyson completely transformed the industry. People like me see him as a father figure.’ Ouch. It has been said that Dyson made vacuum cleaners sexy. He laughs. ‘I don’t know about that, but he certainly made them trendy.’ Dyson say they have ‘very simply illustrated the difference between our technology and Gtech’s’ and that ‘they are the market leader in cordless vacuum cleaners’. Sadly, the home-spun appeal of Gtech may not last. Plans are in place for a move to new custom-built premises. 'Possible': Mr Grey has even floated the return of the vacuum bag in the near future for Gtech . He likes to cite Gtech as a great British success story, but the reality is that his cleaners are produced in China, as per the industry standard. ‘The fact is that you just can’t do it here and be cost-effective. I couldn’t have started a production line in the UK. It would have cost me a quarter of a million pounds. There was no way I had that amount of money. 'In China, I did it for £60,000.

"A plain-package law for tobacco products would reduce the appeal of smoking, according to a new study. This follows the recent legislation in Australia banning logos from cigarette packaging and the English ban on tobacco promotion in April this year. England has some of the strictest anti-smoking laws in the world with advertising and smoking in pubs and restaurants already banned, but new research claims that removing logos from cigarette packs would reduce the appeal even further. Logo no-go: The research supports the introduction of plain packaging as it reduced the appeal of smoking . In Britain a consultation was made by the Department of Health on plain packaging last month, the results of which have yet to be published. British Public Health Minister Anne Milton have said that the government is already considering whether plain packaging of tobacco could bring public health benefits in this country. The research suggests that plain packaging and the removal of brand descriptors are likely to reduce the appeal of smoking for young adults, supporting the recommendations for plain packaging. The Aussie way: This prototype unbranded pack is what will be sold in Australia after the ban comes into force . The study was made by a research group at the University of Waterloo, Canada. The report, published today in Biomed Central’s open access journal BMC Public Health, compared the appeal of branded and plain packs among women in Brazil. The authors found that many brands appear to specifically target young women by use of ‘feminine’ coloured packs, fruit flavourings, or by suggestive terms such as ‘slim’ or ‘superslim’. The women were quizzed to see if these cigarettes had the same appeal when presented in plain packaging which still had the brand name and description on them. As a final test, the women were able to choose which they would have preferred as a free gift, one of the plain or branded pack. Dr David Hammond also from the University of Waterloo who led this study explained: ‘The women in this study rated branded packs as more appealing, more stylish and sophisticated than the plain packs. ‘They also thought that cigarettes in branded packs would be better tasting and smoother. ‘Removal of all description from the packs, leaving only the brand, further reduced their appeal. ‘In the pack offer test, participants were three times more likely to choose the branded pack as a free gift.’ Benefits: Introducing plain packaging could reduce the number of young people taking up smoking . Tobacco use is responsible for 5.4 million deaths every year across the world and is a leading cause of preventable death. Like many other countries, Brazil has prohibited most forms of tobacco advertising, but has not addressed the issue of marketing by tobacco companies via the cigarette pack itself. The results from this study, the first to look at the effect of plain cigarette, backs up research in other countries, which has found that plain packaging makes cigarettes less appealing to young people, the authors noted.","Research found branded packs more attractive .

"PC Ian Terry, 32, was killed during a botched firearms training exercise by Greater Manchester Police in June 2008 . A policeman who shot dead a colleague has been given a reprimand but will keep his job despite being found guilty of gross misconduct. PC Ian Terry, 32, was killed during a botched firearms training exercise by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in June 2008. An inquest in 2010 found that PC Terry, a father of two, was unlawfully killed. But the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), much to the anger of PC Terry's family, decided that no one should face criminal charges. Today the policeman who fired the fatal shot, known only as 'Chris' was found guilty of gross misconduct at an internal disciplinary hearing of GMP. He received a reprimand but will keep his job, the force said. Another officer involved in the training exercise, 'Francis', has been required to resign. None of the policemen involved can be named publicly, after the inquest coroner and trial judge agreed with their lawyers that they should not be identified. PC Terry, from Burnley, Lancs, was shot as the firearms unit practised in a disused factory in Newton Heath, Manchester on June 9, 2008. The officer, who was not wearing body armour, was hit from a distance of about 12 inches by a blank round of specialist ammunition called round irritant personnel, which is not designed to kill but can be deadly at close range. PC Terry, from Burnley, Lancs, was shot as the firearms unit practised in a disused factory in Newton Heath, Manchester (above) on June 9, 2008 . He had brandished an unloaded handgun during the exercise while playing the role of a criminal fleeing in a car. The inquest jury at Manchester Coroner's Court in March 2010 ruled that there was a catalogue of failures not only by the officer who shot PC Terry but also in the planning, training and safety measures. The force pleaded guilty in July last year to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act and was fined £166,666 plus £90,000 court costs. The policeman today forced to resign, Francis, was convicted of an offence under the same Act last July and fined £2,000. A third officer, known as 'Eric', was acquitted of the same charge. Misconduct allegations identified by an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) were heard at an internal GMP misconduct hearing concluding today. The officer, who was not wearing body armour, was hit from a distance of about 12 inches by a blank round of specialist ammunition called round irritant personnel, which is not designed to kill but can be deadly at close range . PC Terry's family said: 'It has taken an unprecedented six years for the officer who killed Ian to face any form of penalty for his actions but after hearing all the evidence, an independent internal discipline tribunal has found that this officer has not only breached several rules of conduct but his actions fell far below what is expected of a police officer. 'We welcome the verdict but feel that this decision, together with the unlawful killing verdict reached by a jury at the coroner's inquest in 2010, confirms our opinion that the officer known as Chris should not have been allowed by the CPS to escape facing charges in a criminal trial. 'The tribunal have considered the circumstances of this case carefully and administered what they believe to be appropriate sanctions but the important result of this hearing is that we finally feel the officers responsible have been shown indisputably that they are undeniably to blame for Ian's death and we want them to know that we believe if they'd had the courage to face the consequences of their actions in 2008 and take responsibility for their actions, they could have saved our family six years of unnecessary pain and difficulty.' Police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester Tony Lloyd said: 'I would once again pass on my sympathies to Ian Terry's family, friends and colleagues. 'I welcome the outcome of this disciplinary hearing, but again question why the Independent Police Complaints Commissioner has taken six years to get to this stage. All this has done is prolong the heartbreak for Ian's family. It is insulting and it is unacceptable. Policemen outside the disused factory in Newton Heath, Manchester where PC Terry died . 'The IPCC needs to change the way it goes about its business, or else the Government needs to step in and put in place a regime which is fit for purpose.' IPCC commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'The IPCC investigation was concluded prior to the inquest into PC Terry's death in 2010 and the fact it has taken more than four years to reach this conclusion must have compounded the distress of PC Terry's family. 'This training exercise was poorly planned and high risk. Everyone involved will have to live with the fact that a popular and well-respected officer lost his life as a result of the mistakes made on that day.' Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, who joined GMP after the incident, said: 'It is six years since Ian died, six years that Ian's family has had to wait for a conclusion to what has been a complicated and frustrating series of legal and multiple investigative processes which have caused additional delay in bringing this to a conclusion. Joanne Terry, the widow of PC Ian Terry, speaking at Ralli Solicitors in Manchester alongside her solicitor James Riley . 'This hearing was the final stage in a very long process and I hope that this decision provides Ian's family with some form of closure and that they can all now begin to move forward. 'I would like to express my admiration for the dignity and resolve shown by Ian's family over the many years it has taken for the case to get to this point. 'Ian Terry was a complete professional, highly regarded by all his colleagues, who served the public of Greater Manchester with huge commitment and expertise.'","PC Ian Terry, 32, killed during firearms training exercise by Greater Manchester Police in June 2008 .

"Think Del Boy crossed with Bruce Willis, with just a hint of Dale Winton in the mix (if you can), and you've got Bruce Crompton. As real-life wheelers and dealers go, they don't really come bigger than this, certainly not if we're talking actual wheel size - because Bruce buys and sells military merchandise, big tanks mostly. And his tanks are stars. You've probably seen some of them in war films such as Saving Private Ryan. Bruce Crompton (centre) is described as the Del Boy of military vehicles . Brad Pitt on location in Oxfordshire filming WWII movie 'Fury', pictured with one of Bruce Crompton's tanks . Brad Pitt getting to grips with his tank, on location filming Fury, set during World War II . 'All those big important scenes when they blow up the tanks in Private Ryan - those were my babies,' he says proudly. Was he on site? Of course he was. 'I make a point of being there for something like that. These are historic vehicles, worth tens of thousands of pounds. I'm there to make sure that when a director says, ""Blow it up!"" no one takes him too literally.' He has 'taught tanks' - if you can do such a thing - to the best in the business. 'Tom Hanks (who starred in Saving Private Ryan) was surprisingly knowledgeable. He's quite a buff himself, and a real gentleman, with a passion for history. 'And Brad Pitt (who's recently been filming Second World War blockbuster Fury) knows his motorbikes. He's got a real collection. Whenever I'm on set with people like that they're always interested in hearing what I have to say.' Bruce is coming out of the shadows for his own starring role in a new series called Combat Dealers . Tom Hanks and his troops taking on one of Bruce's tanks in Saving Private Ryan . Bruce, originally from London but now based in Suffolk, is coming out of the film world shadows for his own starring role soon - at the helm of a new series called Combat Dealers, tracking his journey across the world hunting for rare and eye-wateringly valuable military memorabilia. It's a kind of Antiques Roadshow with guns, which might sound like a curious idea for a TV series but as it happens is quite a riot - mostly thanks to Bruce's penchant for pink trousers teamed with tan leather jackets. It's not too macho either. Yes there's quite a bit of footage of weapons experts trying not to blow their own feet off, and a man who thinks he's Steve McQueen trying, and failing, to get to grips with a wartime Harley-Davidson. But since he ends up wrapping it around a tree, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Bruce is a former paratrooper himself but his passion for all things military started at a young age. 'I had an Action Man with a tommy gun at the age of seven, and there was no turning back.' By 11 he had his first bona fide piece of history in his hands in the form of a German helmet. 'I walked past a house on the way to school every day and noticed that there were daffodils planted in this upturned helmet. I was obsessed by it. Bruce has been collecting war memorabilia since the age of 11 . 'On the last day of primary school I plucked up the courage to ask the owner if I could buy it off him. He tipped the daffodils out and said, ""Have it"". I've never forgotten that feeling. Once I'd got a German helmet, I wanted a British one. Then I started picking up gas masks, berets… that's how it started.' It wasn't designed as a business venture, but when he came into a job lot of gas masks and sold a few on he began to realise he could make a living from doing what he loves. Now he employs a team of experts, and together they scour the world for increasingly rare examples of wartime memorabilia. 'There's still an awful lot of stuff out there,' he says. 'We're finding interesting things in Norway at the minute, and Tunisia is fascinating. The big markets are in America, Japan and Russia, where collectors are willing to pay hundreds of thousands for a piece - maybe £200,000 or £300,000 for a tank.' Which they, er, drive around their big gardens? 'Some do, yes. For some, these are just playthings. But the serious collectors have entire collections, museums.' What's the attraction for Bruce? 'It's about holding this piece of history, imagining the piece of equipment as it was, taking it apart to restore it. Sometimes you can piece together the entire story: learn about the person who would have sat in the vehicle, who perhaps died in it. You can touch the bullet holes. It's very affecting.' He often displays his vehicles at fairs and shows - and has worked with veterans who know more than he will ever do about what it was like to operate the machines. 'That can be incredibly moving.' So how does one go about acquiring a Second World War military vehicle? The first episode shows us. It features Bruce charging off to Normandy in pursuit of something called a Schwimmwagen - 'basically a German vehicle that's not much more than a bathtub on wheels'. Bruce doesn't speak a word of French ('It's amazing how far you can get with hand gestures'), but against all the odds he finds himself in a dusty old garage gazing in disbelief at the very vehicle he was looking for after seeing it in an old photograph. Bruce's tanks have appeared in films such as Saving Private Ryan . Frankly, it looks like a rusty old pile of junk. 'Ah, well, I'd call it more rusty gold,' he says, the thrill still palpable. 'Schwimmwagens were basically amphibious cars used by the Germans, and I have a photograph of one taken in August 1944, after the Battle of Mortain.' This post D-Day battle is not as widely known as others from the period, such as those at Caen and Falaise, but experts believe it marked a key stage in the war, offering proof that the American Army could beat off heavy German counter-attacks. This particular Schwimmwagen is highly prized, says Bruce. 'The proof of its history - the photograph with its markings - sends the value through the roof.' The startling fact, of course, is that this priceless piece of history has been gathering dust in a farmer's barn for the past 70 years. Little wonder Bruce is almost in tears as he's led to it and allowed to examine it. 'I haven't been this excited since my wedding night,' he says. Alas, the Hollywood-type ending to this story doesn't happen. The farmer, who doesn't seem remotely impressed by the fact he's dealing with a man who knows Tom Hanks, says a categoric 'Non, monsieur' when Bruce offers to buy it. Bruce recently supplied tanks for the filming of the film Fury. He arranged for an entire fleet of them to be transported from his home in Suffolk to the set in Hertfordshire - at the cost of a cool £3 million . The cameras capture Bruce becoming more and more frantic as he ups the price. What's it actually worth? 'The sky's the limit,' he concludes, pointing out that bog-standard Schimmwagens, without this proven pedigree, can go for in excess of £120,000. But monsieur is not for budging, and Bruce is forced to leave empty-handed. 'It's tragic,' he concludes. 'But at least I know it's there. I know that this is my business, but the real passion for me is in the hunt. And I found it.' With an eye on the profit sheet, though, he quickly finds - and snaps up for, gulp, £70,000 - another Schwimmwagen, with the hope of restoring it and showing it in a military display. What happens when he gets this model home to his workshop? Well, it's revealed to have myriad leaks, of course. On the day he's due to sail it across a lake, even he is questioning his sanity. 'This could sink,' he says, as water starts to pour in. 'If it does, I might as well have thrown the £70,000 in the lake.' Combat Dealers starts on 30 April, 10pm on Quest . The money changing hands in this business is truly spectacular. Bruce has recently supplied tanks for the filming of the Brad Pitt film Fury. He arranged for an entire fleet of them to be transported from his home in Suffolk to the set in Hertfordshire - at the cost of a cool £3 million. 'They wanted some original German vehicles - that's like trying to find 20 Fabergé eggs. Then you have the costs of security and transportation. Authenticity doesn't come cheap.' At home he's known locally as Tank Man and his antics prove to be quite the talking point. 'Every year I do a military show in Holland and they actually send the Dutch Army over to collect the vehicles. That causes quite a stir in my sleepy little village.' And what does his wife make of his passion? 'Well, she doesn't share it. We have special storage facilities for all the tanks and she insists that the smaller stuff, and all my research papers, stay out of the house. But she can drive a tank. She sometimes has to load and unload them if I'm away on a trip, so she's quite good at it. It's a handy skill to have.'

"We've all bought a pair of shoes or a handbag without telling our spouses. But who buys a rainforest without sitting down at the kitchen table and having a discussion about it? Step forward Charlie Hamilton James, wildlife documentary maker and husband of TV presenter Philippa Forrester. After getting a call from 'a mate in Peru', he parted with £6,000 to become the proud owner of 100 acres of some of the most unforgiving land on the planet, on the slopes of the Andes - a patch of land it was going to take him four flights, followed by an eight-hour drive, to reach. A Place In The Sun it was not. Charlie parted with £6000 for 100 acres of land on the slopes of the Andes . 'It certainly wasn't going to be somewhere we'd go on holiday and take the kids,' he laughs. 'No, it was purely a conservation project. Because of where this land is situated, it was being used by illegal loggers to access the Manu National Park and cut down trees. My mate Rob, who works out there in conservation, said if we bought it we could work with some of the agencies and build a guard station on the land - stopping the loggers. With hindsight I was quite naive.' What did Philippa say when he finally told her about his purchase? 'She thought I was mad. She saw my folly long before I did because she's a conservation expert with a degree in environmental science, while I've only got three GCSEs. But she was great about it, ultimately. I think she saw it was something I had to do.' The couple, who live in rural Somerset and run their own TV production company, have three young sons - Fred, 13, Gus, ten, and Arthur, seven. Charlie says the boys were thrilled at the idea of their father's purchase. He didn't buy the land with a view to making a documentary about it, but when he finally went to Peru to see his land, he took the cameras with him. Charlie and his wife Phillipa Forrester and their sons, Fred, Gus and Arthur . The result is I Bought A Rainforest, and it's much more gripping than you'd expect a film about conservation to be. Yes there are trees, and a lot of explanations about why they're so important to the future of the planet. There are insects and snakes and glorious kingfishers, and startling footage of rare tribes like the Machiguenga. But in parts it's more like an episode of Breaking Bad than a David Attenborough documentary. One of the first discoveries Charlie makes is that his land used to be owned by a man called Tito, who'd been jailed for growing and processing coca, the plant cocaine is derived from. His son Gringo was a drug runner with a fearsome reputation. 'I'd basically bought a cocaine plantation,' says Charlie. 'I was told I'd bought the most dangerous piece of land off the most dangerous family in the most dangerous area of southern Peru, but it was too late.' He meets the men involved in the crop harvesting, who are 'smiley and friendly in the way narco traffickers apparently are before they kill you'. 'It was also the biggest eye-opener. I'd . demonised these people, thinking they were all big guys with medallions . and Uzis. But the more we heard about their situations, the more . complicated it all became' They agree to harvest their crop, however, and remove it from his land. Charlie and Rob arm themselves with machetes while they wait for the harvesting team to arrive - only to find they're women and children. Surreally, he's taught how to pick the leaves off the coca plants by a five-year-old girl. Her seniors all chew the leaves as they work. 'It was like a weird summer picnic, with drugs,' he says. 'It was also the biggest eye-opener. I'd demonised these people, thinking they were all big guys with medallions and Uzis. But the more we heard about their situations, the more complicated it all became.' Charlie and Rob eventually track down the supposed Mr Big responsible for the illegal logging on Charlie's land. His name is Elias, and he says he's just trying to feed his family. 'I thought it was all a sob story but I went to his home and met his disabled daughter, and realised it was true. These people weren't the b******s I'd always blamed for destroying the Amazon, they were just trying to survive.' Although Elias agrees to work for him for payment - replanting the forest instead of logging it - Charlie says he doesn't feel he'd saved the rainforest. 'If anything it's made me more depressed about the conservation issues involved. On a personal level it was the most brilliant - if terrifying - experience of my life. But I didn't come away with any answers.' In some ways, though, he was lucky to escape with his life because, having dodged drug barons and disgruntled locals, he returned to the UK with a rare flesh-eating bug that hospitalised him. 'No, that wasn't part of the plan either,' he admits. Next he's off to the US to take pictures for National Geographic magazine. This time Philippa and the boys are coming too. 'It's going to be a very different job,' he says, the relief evident. I Bought A Rainforest will be shown tomorrow at 8pm on BBC2.","Charlie Hamilton paid £6000 for his land in the Andes .

"Ashley opens up about how life in the Pussycat Dolls wasn't always fair . Unsurprisingly, perhaps, you get more sense from a member of a girl band when she's no longer a member of that band and has reached the grand old age of 32. There's no doubt Ashley Roberts could still rock the skimpy little outfits she used to wear in her days with the Pussycat Dolls - the band, fronted by X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger, whose risqué outfits and dance moves left very little to the imagination. But ask her about the wider implications of spending much of your twenties parading around in your pants (even if it is in the name of empowerment) and she gives a considered reply. 'Let's face it, we were a product,' she says. 'It wasn't a message we disagreed with - the band had been built on that sexy image, so running around in fishnets and undies was part of it - but it was quite weird. In your twenties you're trying to figure out who you are; making mistakes, wanting to be sexy, growing up as a woman.' All of which, she adds, is difficult when you're living in a bubble. 'One of the weirdest things for me, when The Dolls split four years ago, was having to adapt to the real world. Actually going to the supermarket to get my own groceries was a revelation. I'd never had to fill the fridge before, do my laundry, put petrol in my car. It was scary - but there was a kind of joy about it too.' When The Pussycat Dolls split it was generally assumed Nicole Scherzinger - always the focus, to the point where it reportedly led to feuding within the band - would go on to greater things. So it happened. As well as forging a solo career, she ended up on the X Factor panel, immediately acquiring a wider, more mainstream, fanbase. This has been the case too, to a lesser degree, with Ashley, who in 2012 was runner-up on I'm A Celebrity. The high-risk move (it involved eating camel's unmentionables) seems to have worked. She's since segued, via the judging panel of Dancing On Ice, into presenting work, most notably alongside Ant and Dec on Saturday Night Takeaway. So, is she having a fling with Declan Donnelly, as has been reported? 'No,' she says. 'That was the media having fun. I don't have a boyfriend. I never wanted to get married until quite recently, but now the first of the Dolls has settled down (Kimberly Wyatt got married in February) I'm thinking more about it. I just need to find the right guy. I love hanging out with Ant and Dec because they're such fun, but there's no romance.' Ashley (far right) describes being in the band as being a 'product' Later this summer, Ashley brings out her first album since leaving the Dolls, marking a return to the singing career she embarked on as a toddler in Phoenix, Arizona. Her father Pat was a drummer who played for The Mamas And The Papas, and she was on a stage almost as soon as she could walk. She jokes now that's why the Dolls' outfits never seemed a big deal to her ('I spent my whole childhood in leotards, tutus, sports bras; I was showing my midriff from the age of three'). Yet the speed with which fame did arrive - when she was a 22-year-old dancer - was phenomenal. The Pussycat Dolls, launched as a burlesque-style act, were catapulted to global fame almost overnight with the song Don't Cha. 'It was like a rocket,' she recalls. 'All of a sudden there were fans waiting outside the hotel room and we were getting flown across the world.' In the melee, she admits now, she didn't stop to consider the small print. Ashley denies rumours that anything romantic is happening between her and co-host, Declan Donnelly (right) 'People think we must have made enough money never to have to worry again, but we didn't. I'm not complaining - I got a home out of it - but did we make as much as we should have? Probably not. We knew there were certain amounts coming in that we weren't necessarily getting. At the beginning you don't pay attention to that - we were all so young and excited - but after seven years of touring, when you've made all these sacrifices and are burnt out, it matters.' It wasn't just, she says, that the record company was getting more money than she feels was fair, but that other members of the band - well, Nicole, the band's main songwriter - was too. 'It wasn't equally divided,' she says. 'It was partly because of the writing, partly... well, it just wasn't. And that was fine at the start, but not towards the end. Now, you look at bands like U2 and think, ""Why are they still together?"" The answer is they split everything equally.' She won't be drawn on the cattiness that seemed to surround the split, but stories have abounded of how only Nicole was allowed to speak in press interviews, and how she always got what she wanted. Is it true she didn't even travel with the others? 'Well, she did on flights,' she says. 'But on the tour bus, no. She had a separate bus.' Why? 'I don't know. To write, maybe. You'd have to ask her. Look, people have tried to say there was and is a feud, but it wasn't like that. We were five girls in a band. With that, you get situations - time of the month, relationships, egos, insecurities. We were five girls put together on a crazy rollercoaster ride. It was a family - a dysfunctional family, but still a family. I went through everything, good and bad, with those girls.' She says she's still in touch with Nicole, but while the other Dolls were at Kimberly's wedding, Nicole wasn't. 'She was invited,' says Ashley. 'But she couldn't come.' Immediately after leaving the Dolls, Ashley engaged a life coach, 'to help me work out who I was'. You can see why. Ashley has found success in TV, including her appearance as a judge on Dancing on Ice . As well as the rollercoaster of her professional life, she had a turbulent family life to deal with. When she was 14 her parents divorced. Then when her father's showbiz career dried up, he turned to selling cars but was declared bankrupt in 2005 and later accused of defrauding investors. Her younger brother Jayce, 27, has schizophrenia and has convictions for violence, indecent exposure, drugs and theft. For years she didn't mention him at all in interviews. Now she says his issues 'are finally being dealt with. It's heavy, but he's in a home now. He has the help he needs. When I'm back in Phoenix I visit him, hug him and tell him I love him more than anything. It's hard. You feel helpless. It breaks my heart.' She still sees her life coach regularly, and says she wishes she'd worked things out earlier. 'Growing up, you run to work or to music, or to your escape - whatever it is - and don't necessarily deal with the emotions underlying it all, especially in the US because we have a pill for everything. Everyone should have a life coach. We learn history, maths and science at school, but we don't have the tools to understand emotions; to release them and not hold on to anger. My life coach is my angel.' Ashley's new single Clockwork is out on 25 May.","Ashley prepares to release her first solo album .

"Sonia Elliman is an impeccably spoken septuagenarian who has produced three daughters: a judge, an opera singer and a legal adviser. So, she’s the most unlikely person you can imagine to have a conversation with you about wearing a bikini under her coat, accosting young men in the park or what it feels like to walk into a waxing salon and ask  for a vajazzle — that intimate body decoration so beloved of the girls in The Only Way Is Essex. Indeed, she’s rather stunned that she’s au fait with such topics herself, but then lets out a mischievous laugh. Naughty: Rosemary Macvie (left) and Sonia Elliman (right) are the stars of Off Their Rockers, an ITV hidden camera show where the pranksters are all old enough, frankly, to know better . ‘It is rather fun, isn’t it? It isn’t good for life to be too predictable.’ Sonia is one of the irrepressible stars of Off Their Rockers, an ITV hidden camera show where the pranksters are all old enough, frankly, to know better. The programme typically involves seemingly sweet little old ladies or dapper grandads needing help — sometimes with a mobile phone, often with directions — in the street. They usually pick young people, often teenagers, to ask for assistance. Then something untoward — embarrassing, rude or downright baffling — happens. So, we have the fusty old dear asking a complete stranger to help her read a text message from her doctor — informing her that she is pregnant with twins. Or the shuffling pensioner who asks the girl beside her at the bus stop for some assistance — with scattering her dead husband’s ashes while they wait for the bus. Prank: We have the fusty old dear asking a complete stranger to help her read a text message from her doctor - informing her that she is pregnant with twins . ‘Would you like to say anything, . dear?’ she asks, while the poor young woman looks on, speechless. This . was one of Sonia’s performances. One recurring sketch involves one of the pranksters approaching someone and asking them to pull their finger. When they do, the elderly lady breaks wind, says ‘That’s better,’ and walks off — invariably leaving their ‘helper’ incredulous, and often doubled over with laughter. Another requires two lady pranksters, who approach an unsuspecting soul saying that they are having a disagreement and could they have help in resolving it. Their question? ‘Which one of us has the better bikini body?’ Sonia’s CV might groan with highbrow theatrical jobs — she has been an actress since she was eight years old — but this particular job was quite a departure, though she does point out that she was once in a Kaiser Chiefs music video. ‘It was I Predict A Riot. It was a Victorian street scene and I was dancing around. I can’t quite recall why now. But it was great fun. I’d do it again.’ All the hoaxers are actors, and good ones, too, given how pretty much everyone falls for their sob stories. ‘It was quite embarrassing to do some of the pranks,’ says Sonia. ‘Because with real acting the person you are talking to is usually acting, too. ‘With this job, there was quite a lot . of improvisation going on. And we never knew whether the person we . approached was going to laugh, hit us or call the police.’ In one encounter, an elderly nun runs amok on her mobility scooter, wreaking havoc all round. Comedy: The programme typically involves seemingly sweet little old ladies or dapper grandads needing help - sometimes with a mobile phone, often with directions - in the street . Hidden camera shows were introduced to the UK by Jonathan Routh, a presenter and journalist who adapted a hit American show called Candid Camera for audiences here, and became its chief prankster. It ran for seven years in the 1960s and was revived twice in the 70s. The show made Routh a cult figure. Even though he died in 2008, aged 80, some of his most enduring japes are attracting new audiences on YouTube. The best include a talking postbox, edible goldfish and a flower on a restaurant table that takes sly sips of diners’ drinks. It didn’t always go well for Routh. Once, his target for a joke turned out to be a former heavyweight boxer — who gave him a black eye. Another time, preparing for a stunt near a bank, a passer-by thought Routh was acting suspiciously and dialled 999 to report a possible robbery in progress. But the viewers loved it. At the peak of his fame Routh received 1,000 letters a week from members of the public suggesting new hoaxes to try out. Actually, though, Sonia says, there was generally very little trouble and if  anything, people were only too anxious to help. ‘I . had one that involved the film crew putting my car in a skip in the . middle of the road, and I had to ask people to help me get it out. ‘I had an awful time trying to stop one man from calling the police. ‘Another time, I did have to be rescued by the camera crew. ‘I had proposed to a young man and, well, I think he took it a little bit too seriously.’ Rosemary Macvie —  78 years young, and currently starring in a play about the Spanish Inquisition, ‘which is rather more serious’ — admits she was a little  sceptical when she heard that her agent had put her up for the  job of being an Off Their  Rockers prankster. She speaks with an even grander voice than Sonia, and says: ‘One generally doesn’t approach complete strangers in the street. It was terrifying. I am not a street entertainer. I actually lost 7lb during filming.’ Still, she sounds like quite a convert. Her favourite jape involved her sitting on a park bench in London and asking the occupant where the nearest Tube station was. Learning curve: The programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category, but the actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation . When he said ‘Bethnal Green’, she had to say: ‘I am so sorry, dear, I am a little hard of hearing, can you repeat that, slower?’ The poor man did this 43 times  before, to her astonishment, offering to take her there. ‘This was a chap I would have been afraid to speak to in real life. He had dreadlocks, tattoos and everything. ‘But he was so kind and helpful. By the end I loved him. I could have eaten him up! ‘He got up and offered to walk me there, so I went with him and I just kept talking. I forgot all about supposedly being deaf. ‘I got away down the road before I remembered that the cameras were still going and I really better get back.’ Rosemary was constantly amazed at how kind, helpful and respectful members of the public were. ‘Not one person said “Silly old bat”, which I’m sure I would have done in their position.’ Star of the show, though, must be 76-year-old Seb Craig, who has the sort of face that screams character actor. He’s worked up and down the country in repertory theatre, spending some time running venues, and is a veteran of 70 TV commercials. 'I'm just glad to be working at my age, and I hope to be doing so for many years to come' Seb Craig . In his time he has flogged everything . from spectacles (he’s in the current Specsavers ad) to nappies and Ragu . sauce. Like Sonia, he’s also a music video veteran, having starred . alongside Annie Lennox. Seb — who had a triple bypass a few years back brought on by ‘too many chocolate buttons’ during a stint in panto — says that it may seem like an unusual career choice, but ‘who cares?’ ‘It’s just fun, isn’t it?’ he says. ‘I’ve been having a ball, getting out, meeting interesting people, making them laugh — eventually. His favourite prank? ‘There is one when I am jogging past a pub and there are people sitting enjoying the sunshine outside, and I grab one of their pints on the way past and pour it over my head,’ he says. ‘My biggest surprise is that I haven’t been punched.’ He says the pranks involving mobile phones don’t take an awful lot of acting. ‘Because I can’t use them! They gave me an iPhone and I didn’t really know what to do with it. Every time I have to show someone something on the screen, it goes blank and I don’t know how to get it back.’ Some of the sketches can be a bit risqué, though. Is there anything he found too rude? ‘Well, there was one sketch that involved me going into a shop and asking to photocopy something, er, unusual. Yes, that. ‘I objected to a word they used. I said: “I can’t say that if children are watching.” So they changed it.’ The programme may fall into the throwaway comedy category, but all three actors say they were surprised at what they have learned about the younger generation. ‘All of the youngsters we have met have just been so sweet,’ says Rosemary. ‘It really does restore your faith in humanity. I certainly didn’t expect that.’","Rosemary Macvie and Sonia Elliman star in Off Their Rockers .

"Frankly, it sounds like the plot of a charming little TV drama. An elderly couple on the eve of their 50th wedding anniversary set off on a canal trip around Britain, meandering through the countryside and meeting all sorts of characters, some more madcap than others. They have their own eccentricities, which makes for vivid viewing. His steering isn't perhaps what it should be so there's always the possibility of a crash (and no, viewers aren't disappointed); she's the sort of woman who hankers for a haircut in the middle of a boating holiday. The emotional punch comes halfway in, when it emerges that the 'slight condition' that makes her a tad forgetful (not least in remembering to undo the mooring ropes) turns out to be a form of Alzheimer's. Tim and Pru sailing down the canal in their slow boat that they have owned for decades . Is it a comedy or a tragedy, though? Possibly, like all the best productions, it's a bit of both, shot through with very British humour and lashings of tea (and occasionally something stronger). But this programme isn't fictional - which somehow makes it even more gripping. It's a Channel 4 documentary where two of our finest actors, Prunella Scales and Timothy West - who've been married for 50 years - take a trip along a series of canal networks, and down memory lane in the process. They may be well-known for being two of our most high-profile actors (and political campaigners to boot) but away from the TV studio or stage, Pru and Tim have long been keen narrowboat fans, having owned their own boat for decades. While they've spent the last half-century building their careers (her most famous  role is still Sybil in Fawlty Towers; he's a renowned classical actor who most recently popped up in EastEnders), every holiday was spent cruising up and down the canal network in England and Wales and their sons Samuel (now an acclaimed actor in his own right) and Joseph joined them on their jaunts (Tim also has a daughter, Juliet, from his first marriage). Prunella and Timothy with sons Samuel (left) and Joseph (right) in 1975 . 'We're canal nuts,' explains a gleeful Pru at the start of this televised adventure. 'We've been pottering around on them all our married life. We've had some of our best times. Whenever we get a break we dash off to our boat.' Indeed, these two were canal nuts many years before narrowboating was fashionable, and the home movie footage that's spliced alongside film of their current trip is glorious - showing youthful faces and almost empty stretches of canal. In narrowboat circles, they're quite famous (and for reasons that have nothing to do with acting). They spearheaded a campaign to restore the Kennet and Avon canal some 24 years ago, and steered the first boat through once the work was complete. Nearly a quarter of a century on, they return to this stretch of water - now a tourist magnet where the towpaths are awash with day-trippers and cyclists - to see how things have changed. At first it seems that everything has. The boat they hire (they still have their own, but it's moored elsewhere) has a TV installed, which appals Tim, who thinks boating holidays should be all about board games and books and conversation. The other striking difference from those bygone days, though, is how they have changed. Although they look sprightly enough clambering over locks and on and off boats, there's no getting away from the fact that Pru is 81 and Tim is 79. During the opening sequences they muse over the fact their 50th wedding anniversary is upon them. 'Fifty years - it feels more like 14,' says Tim, while his wife explains the thinking behind their trip. 'We're determined to make the most of what we love - while we still can.' They've always been endearing figures but the glimpse into their marriage offered here is hilarious and touching in equal measure. Timothy West in his recent appearance in Eastenders where he played Stan Carter . On the first morning, Tim bemoans the fact that his age means regular toilet trips at night which in the darkness, on an unfamiliar boat, can be 'bad news for the floor'. He wonders if he left a puddle. She reassures him, saying, 'Very good aim, darling.' But it's Pru's health that causes more concern. It's long been known in showbiz circles that she has problems with memory loss. Here, however, they open up about what that actually means. 'Pru has this condition - it's a sort of Alzheimer's,' says Tim. 'It's quite mild, but she can't remember things very well.' 'You don't have to remember things on the canal, You can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them. It's perfect for Pru, really.' Not that it's stopped her doing anything. At least not boating. Indeed, it emerges that this trip is possibly one of the few activities Pru can do that won't accentuate her problems. 'You don't have to remember things on the canal,' he explains, neatly glossing over the mooring rope incident. 'You can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them. It's perfect for her, really.' They aren't the sort of couple who always have to agree (the funniest moments in this film are when they bicker), but here they do. 'It can be a nuisance sometimes,' Pru says, 'but it doesn't stop me remembering how to open a locked gate or make the skipper a cup of tea.' Pru and Tim met in repertory theatre in the early 60s, and married in 1963. They reckon that between them they've performed in pretty much every theatre the length and breadth of Britain, although a few years back they bemoaned the fact they hadn't made it to the Scilly Isles. Theirs is one of the longest and most successful marriages in showbiz, and they still live in the same house they bought when Pru was pregnant with their first child. Everything about them screams solidity. Which makes Tim's fleeting confession - that his wife is no longer the woman he married - all the more affecting. 'When you think back over a long period,' he says at one point during the trip, 'this person I loved and enjoyed this, that and the other with doesn't really exist any more. It's another person. That's quite painful.' Prunella is most famous for her role as Sybill in Fawlty Towers . But as soon as the admission comes, it's brushed away and replaced with the optimism and joie de vivre that seems to characterise their marriage. 'But you mustn't think like that. Let's just take it from day to day. You notice how much she's able to do and how much she enjoys life.' Pru is quick to accentuate the positive too - usually with a dash to the kettle. 'I certainly do enjoy life and I can still perform my duties as crew,' she says, making another cup of tea and serving up the shortbread. 'Her sense of humour is still there,' confirms Tim. 'The same things make her laugh and we have a lot of fun. She's just growing old and, in a certain area, more quickly than either of us would like. But we're very lucky, really.' This is a three-part documentary series, each part focusing on a different canal trip. Viewers get a dollop of history ('when it was built the Kennet-Avon canal was the M4 of its day') and an appreciation of geography (although it was filmed pre-floods, when the sun seemed to be permanently shining). Pru and Tim would probably quibble with the idea that the programme is about them, given that it focuses on them meeting all manner of fellow canal lovers. Pru manages to get her haircut during the trip - courtesy of a hairdresser who runs Britain's only known floating salon. They also pop in to meet a young couple who not only holiday on the canals but have set up a permanent home on the water. Yet as a portrait of their marriage, and well-lived lives, it is spot on (and the fact that it's gentle and completely unshowbizzy is a bonus). So what's the attraction, for them, of a life on water? Pru sums it up. 'People are terribly friendly on the canal. There's a nice feeling about it. I think it's something to do with life at four miles an hour. It attracts people who like that rhythm. Each canal is different but they all offer this wonderful antidote to the hustle and bustle of modern life. You can't rush on a canal.' The enduring image of them is of him steering, while she gazes out the window, lost in her thoughts. 'Do I know where we're going or why we're going there?' she says. 'Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I just want to watch the countryside slide by.' Long may they sail.

"Shot dead: Millie Canjura, 31, was shot dead as she sat in her car outside her home. Her unborn child did not survive . A pregnant woman was shot dead as she sat in her car outside her family home in a 'cold blooded' murder on Saturday. Millie Canjura was shot multiple times at 8.40pm outside her home in Bay Shore, Long Island. Her unborn child also died in the attack.

"Philip Seymour Hoffman's dying wish was to keep his children in Manhattan - and away from Hollywood, according to reports. The actor's will, which was written in 2004, asked for his then-only child Cooper to be raised in New York City so he would be surrounded by the city's rich culture, arts and architecture. If it was not possible for Cooper to be raised in New York, Hoffman asked that his son be raised in Chicago or San Francisco - or at least visit the cities twice a year. TMZ noted . the absence of Los Angeles from the list. It was penned by Hoffman nearly 10 . years before he was found dead from a heroin overdose two weeks ago. Requests: Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died earlier this month, asked that his son Cooper (right) be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco in his will, which was penned 10 years ago . 'It is my strong desire…that my son, Cooper Hoffman, be raised and reside in or near the borough of Manhattan…or Chicago, Illinois, or San Francisco, California,' Hoffman's will reads. 'The purpose of this request is so that my son will be exposed to the culture, arts and architecture that such cities offer.' Most of his fortune was left to his longtime partner and the mother of his three children, costume designer Marianne 'Mimi' O’Donnell, whom he identifies as his 'friend and companion'. After Cooper, now 10, the couple had Tallulah, now seven, and Willa, five. The will indicates he also set up a trust for Cooper, . which he said should be used to pay for Cooper's 'education, support, . health and maintenance'. The actor pictured with two of his three children Cooper and Willa. He had left the family home at the end of last year to try to beat his drug addiction . Close: Hoffman and his former partner were estranged but he still saw the children most days . Cooper will get half of the money when he turns 25, and the rest at age 30, according to court papers shared by the New York Post. It is not known how much his estate is worth, but some estimates have placed it around $35 million. Court . sources added to The Post that the family have asked that the . Oscar-winning actor's estate be handled by a judge on an expedited basis . – a sign that the family needs cash. The children's parents became estranged last year when Hoffman slipped back into using heroin, but O'Donnell lived nearby in their $4.2 million apartment. But Hoffman remained close to his children, seeing them most days. He was also regularly spotted taking Cooper to basketball games. 'My spare time is really about hanging out with my kids,' Hoffman once told Us Weekly. 'If I'm free, a good chunk of that is going to be thinking about how to hang out with them.' Mourning: Hoffman left most of his fortune to his long-term partner Mimi O'Donnell, pictured center at his funeral. They had three children together - Willa, left, Tallulah, center, and Cooper, right . Loss: The couple became estranged last year reportedly after Hoffman resumed his heroine habit . Hoffman, . 46, was found dead on February 2 in his $10,000-a-month West Village . apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes, less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab for his addiction. The actor, who won an Oscar for 'Copote', was remembered at a funeral on February 6, where O'Donnell was seen comforting the sobbing children. Investigators have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a total of $1,200 inside a supermarket near his home the day before his death. Three people were later arrested during the investigation into the source of the drugs, including a long-time friend and 'drug dealer', Robert Vineberg.","Actor's will, which was written 10 years ago, asked for his son Cooper to be brought up in New York, Chicago or San Francisco .

"A couple today admitted child cruelty after being accused of keeping their young son a ‘prisoner in his bedroom’. The 50-year-old man and his 38-year-old wife each admitted a charge of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning or exposing the boy in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health between November 2007 and November 2012. The couple, from Paignton, Devon, submitted a basis of plea (pleading guilty but only on a certain set of facts) which was not accepted by the prosecution but the judge said it would make no difference to their eventual sentence next month at Exeter Crown Court. The boy's wicked parents will be sentenced at Exeter Crown Court (above) next month . At an earlier hearing before magistrates, prosecutor Philip Sewell claimed the boy, now aged 11, was locked in his bedroom for ‘long periods of time’ and not allowed out. He said: “He was sometimes unable to do anything other than relieve himself there. Sometimes a bucket was provided.” The lower court heard the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told a schoolteacher he had wet himself and was asked why. Neighbours and other family members had ‘concerns’ about the boy. Mr Sewell said the boy was also locked out of the house for ‘long periods of time’ without being suitably dressed and was taken in by other people. He said: “He was out in light clothing in the rain.” After the hearing Det Con Samantha Vignaux, who investigated the case, said: “He would be left out during the summer holidays in all weathers and would knock on neighbours’ doors to ask if children would come out to play. The 'icest little chap you would ever want to meet' was abused in Paignton, Devon . “Neighbours were unable to raise anybody at the house because they had gone out for the day. “It would be pouring with rain and the neighbours would give him clothes to wear. “On one occasion he was seen urinating in a neighbour’s garden because he couldn’t get in the house. “It is just a very sad case involving a young man and people who were supposed to take care of him but didn’t.” The child is now being cared for properly and the detective said: “He is the nicest little chap you would ever want to meet. “Nobody has a bad word to say about this little man. He has fantastic people looking after him now who are doing a proper parenting job and put his needs first. “It went on for so long because he didn’t tell anybody. It is a very sad story involving a delightful young man.”","Parents from Paignton, Devon admitted child cruelty and will be sentenced later .

"Underdog Japanese player Kei Nishoriki stunned the US Open today as he defeated Novak Djokovic to become the first Asian player ever to reach a grand slam final. He was watched by a host of stars including pregnant Chelsea Clinton, who tried to beat the heat in a white shirtdress as she was joined by her husband Marc Mezvinsky. In a remarkable display of endurance, Nishikori followed up punishing five-set wins over third seed Stan Wawrinka and fifth seed Milos Raonic with an even more extraordinary effort, grinding down the top-ranked Djokovic in two hours, 52 minutes on a sweltering Arthur Ashe Stadium court. 'It's just amazing, an amazing feeling beating the number one player and also playing much better in these couple of matches so I'm so happy,' the 10th-seeded Nishikori said. Underdog: Tenth seed  Kei Nishikori, from Japan, jumps for joy after he beat number four seed Novak Djokovic in five sets amid soaring heat at the US Open . Groundbreaking: The Japanese star, 24,  became the first Asian man to reach a men's singles final in a major tournament . Flagging: Djokovic said he was 'not himself' as he was outplayed in the soaring heat . Enjoying the show: Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky watched Novak Djokovic of Serbia play Kei Nishikori of Japan at the US Open today . Getting close: The former First Daughter and her husband looked very much in love as they soaked up the sun . 'It was really tough conditions today, felt a little bit heavy and humid too but I guess I love to play long matches and I hope I can recover well for the final.' The midday sun beat down on Arthur Ashe Stadium and a thermometer on court showed the temperature nearing 100 degrees (37 Celsius), not counting the humidity of close to 70 percent. The 24-year-old Japanese awaits the winner of the second semi-final between world number two and five-times U.S. Open champion Roger Federer and 14th seed Marin Cilic in Monday's final. ""I don't know what's going on,"" said Nishikori, who is coached by former grand slam champion Michael Chang. ""I was a little bit tight; especially it was my first semi-final in a grand slam."" Djokovic was magnanimous in defeat. ""It was not easy to play in these conditions but also he had more hours spent on the court. So it's no excuse,"" the Serb said. ""I expected him to be able to play another five-setter because he had two days off. ""He just played better in these conditions than I did. ""I just wasn't managing to go through the ball in the court. You know, I wasn't in the balance. Unforced errors. Even when the ball gets back to his part of the court it's pretty short; he takes advantage of it. On the other side I didn't. That's it."" Tender moment: Mezvinsky also kissed his wife's hand as they watched the tennis in humid temperatures in the high 80s . Vogue editor Anna Wintour was also in Flushing to watch Roger Federer take on Marin Cilic in the semi-finals. The Swiss player's wife Mirka, right, was also there to cheer on her husband . Nishikori arrived at sun-bathed Arthur Ashe Stadium looking fresh despite having played the latest finishing match ever at the U.S. Open on Tuesday in the fourth round against Raonic, when he walked off court at 2:26 a.m. local time. Two days later Nishikori was forced to go the distance again, out-lasting Wawrinka in a four hour, 15 minute battle. But the biggest test of all came with gusting wind, stifling humidity and courtside temperatures hovering around 100 degrees (Fahrenheit), turning the semi-final into a survival of the fittest against a surging world number one who had dropped just one set on route to the final four. A day earlier, Jenna Bush Hager matched her outfit with the occasion when she appeared yesterday at New York's US Open to watch the quarter-finals, dressed in a monochrome pleated minidress. The 32-year-old Today show correspondent and daughter of former president George W Bush was all smiles, and cheered animatedly as Swiss champion Roger Federer beat French rival Gael Monfils to secure a place in the semi-finals. Mrs Bush Hager, who left her 16-month-old daughter Mila at home, was on a double date with husband Henry Hager, as well as friends Colleen Dixon, a lawyer, and Graves Tompkins, a banker. Mrs Bush Hager paired her athletic outfit with a Chanel bag and wore her blonde hair loose. She posted a grinning snap to her Instagram, in which she poses with her husband and friends, captioned: 'Bad selfie watching good tennis at US Open! Fun!' A long-time tennis fan, Mrs Bush Hager was seemingly enthralled in the action; pictured at the edge of her seat as the tense game drew to its conclusion. From the looks of things, the mother-of-one was well-rested, just a day after she blamed 'sleep-deprivation' on stumbling into something of a political faux-pas. The next month there was more photo jubilation, this time for the former president's 68th birthday, in which the hands-on grandfather is seen tenderly feeding Mila a bottle in an Instagram snap, captioned: 'Happiest birthday to my old man and Mila's Jefe.'

"It's a photo that paints a picture of an idyllically happy family life. Chiwetel Ejiofor, now a Hollywood star and a strong contender for the Best Actor Oscar tonight, beams broadly as he hugs his little sister on the stairs of their London home. But just months after this snap was taken, Chiwetel’s life was hit by tragedy when his father was killed in a car crash, which almost claimed his young life, too. Idyllic family life: Chiwetel Ejiofor, (right) now a Hollywood star and a strong contender for the Best Actor Oscar tonight, beams broadly as he hugs his little sister on the stairs of their London home. But just months later, Chiwetel's life was hit by tragedy when his father was killed in a car crash . Talented: Arinze Ejiofor was killed in a car accident in his native Nigeria. Chiwetel was 11 years old in 1998 when he joined his father on the bonding trip. The car they were travelling in was involved in a head-on collision with a lorry. The 12 Years A Slave actor was the only survivor . His sister Zain, so happy beside him in the photograph, has now spoken of how that devastating heartache fuelled Chiwetel’s desire to be the best actor he could be –  and helped bring an intensity to his performance in 12 Years A Slave. And should he triumph at the Academy Awards, he is certain to pay an emotional tribute to his father, Arzine. Chiwetel was just 11 in 1998 when, on a bonding trip to Arinze’s native Nigeria, the car they were travelling in was involved in a head-on collision with a lorry. Chiwetel was the only survivor of the . crash that also killed three other passengers, and Zain believes it is . significant that her brother is now the same age as their father was . when he died. Siblings: Chiwetel and his sister Zain pictured at a Hollywood event . ‘He had been very close to his father,’ Zain says. ‘And while the whole family was suffering from his death, the impact on Chiwetel was especially intense. He became very focused and threw himself into everything with an intense passion. ‘It was as if he had been given a miraculous chance to live and he was determined to make the most of it.’ Initially it was thought Chiwetel had also been killed in the accident. ‘When they dragged his body from the wreck, he was very badly injured and lucky to still be alive,’ says Zain, now a financial correspondent with CNN. ‘He’d broken several limbs and sustained a serious blow  to the head that left him in a coma for a while. Doctors told my mother to expect the worst.’ Though only five at the time, Zain vividly recalls the anguish of her mother Obi and several adult relatives as they maintained a vigil by her brother’s hospital bedside. It would be ten weeks before the traumatised child was able to leave the hospital. And from that moment, Zain says, he seized life with a previously unseen passion. ‘By the time he was 13 he had developed this drive to be an actor,’ she says, revealing how his passion started while studying at the elite Dulwich College. ‘He started out in a school play. While other kids his age were hanging out, he would get home from school and lock himself in his room to learn his lines. 'I would go out with my friends and come home hours later only to find him still reciting Shakespeare. ‘Sometimes he even wrote the words on the walls and Mum would have to wipe them off.’ Chiwetel joined the National Youth Theatre at 17 and was accepted by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. But he left during his first year after getting a role in Steven Spielberg’s film Amistad. ‘It all seemed to happen very quickly,’ Zain said. ‘I remember there was a lot of joy in the house when we heard. I mean, it was Spielberg!’ Accolade: Chiwetel is among the favourites to be honoured with the Best Actor Oscar for his role in 12 Years A Slave. He is up against  Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bruce Dern and Matthew McConaughey . Inspired: Zain said she believes their father's death spurred Chiwetel on to become a successful actor. She said: 'It was as if he had been given a miraculous chance to live and he was determined to make the most of it' He went on to impress industry insiders with standout performances in films as diverse as Love Actually, Dirty Pretty Things and Kinky Boots. But it  is his performance in 12 Years  A Slave that has gained him international acclaim. Zain said: ‘He’s really dedicated to being the best he can be.’ Now 36, Chiwetel, who still bears scars from the accident, admits that the loss of his father has been a huge influence on his life and career, saying: ‘I think I have a constant reflective relationship with him. 'As I reach the age he was when he died, the relationship is becoming more acute. 'But I do think there’s a constant dynamic that will continue always; and be an influence on the kind of work I do.’ Chiwetel was born in Forest Gate, East London, in 1977, after his parents had fled the earlier Nigerian Civil War. Arinze was a musician who retrained as a doctor, and Obi was a pharmacist. Honoured: The 26-year-old actor has already won the Bafta for Best Actor at this year's awards, for his portrayal of Solomon Northup . International acclaim: Chiwetel left acting school during his first year to take up a role in Steven Speilberg's film Amistad. He has starred in Love Actually and Kinky Boots. But it was his role in 12 Years A Slave, alongside Lupita Nyong'o (left) and Micahel Fassbender (second left), that has won the actor international acclaim . Pride: Chiwetel's mother Obi and sister Zain, will sit alongside the actor tonight at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. Zain said: 'This is a day my family has been hoping and waiting for. We are all so unbelievably proud and bursting with joy. It's such a shame that our father is not alive to see how well Chiwetel has done' Chiwetel was the second child after older brother Obinze, now 38 and a businessman. And Obi was seven months pregnant with her youngest child Kandi, now a doctor, when she was suddenly widowed. Zain describes her mother as an indomitable spirit who taught her children that ‘education was our  key to freedom .  .  . perhaps it was because of her own humble background. As a girl she lived in a village where water had to be collected from a river and boiled before drinking’ It is a long way from that impoverished Nigerian village to the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where tonight Zain and Obi will be seated alongside Chiwetel tonight. ‘This is a day my family has been hoping and waiting for,’ Zain said. ‘We are all so unbelievably proud and bursting with joy. It’s such a shame that our father is not alive to see how well Chiwetel has done.’","Chiwetel Ejiofor's life was turned upside down when his father was killed .

"It seems Charles Saatchi's favourite table at Scott's restaurant holds no bad memories for Trinny Woodall despite being reduced to tears at it last week. The TV presenter was spotted crying her eyes out last Saturday in the company of the advertising mogul, but hours later they were seen arriving at his house with her suitcases in tow. Saatchi and Woodall returned to the scene of the teary crime on Sunday, as though to prove the point that they are happier than ever. Back on track: Charles Saatchi and Trinny Woodall return to Scott''s a week after she was spotted crying in his presence there . She looks happy: The couple were clearly putting the teary incident behind them . No hard feelings: Clearly the table doesn't hold any bad memories for the couple . It seems Trinny manged to put any issues from earlier in the day behind her to stay with the millionaire art collector last Saturday evening. Charles, 70, was seen arriving home ahead of her, alongside his daughter Phoebe and appeared to be in a jovial mood as he was spotted playing around in the street. Trinny's arrival was rather more . understated and she was helped out of the car by her driver who carried . the bags to the door for her. Making a change: Charles Saatchi changes up his style in a blue suit and white shirt while Trinny wears floral-detail trousers . All is forgiven? Trinny Woodall is seen arriving at Charles Saatchi's house after they reportedly rowed last Saturday . Good spirits: Charles was seen arriving back with his daughter Phoebe a little while earlier . Moving on: It seems that whatever happened earlier in the day has been put behind the couple . She wore the grey jacket that she was seen wearing earlier in the day at Scott's, draped over her shoulder. Earlier . in the day she had been seen apparently wiping back tears from her face . outside the couple's favourite restaurant in Mayfair. The exchange comes almost a year after Saatchi was seen rowing with his now ex wife Nigella Lawson in exactly the same spot. Let me in: Trinny was seen ringing the bell while a gentleman held her bags . Waiting: It seemed to take a bit of time before someone answered the door bell . His now girlfriend appeared to become . overcome with emotion during their three hour lunch, however lawyers for . both parties have denied there was an argument. However the images are still likely to raise questions about whether the couple’s nine-month romance is on the rocks. Onlookers claim the pair were indeed arguing and Trinny, who barely touched her food, burst into tears as the argument escalated, hiding behind huge dark glasses and smoking anxiously. ‘She was a bag of nerves,’ said one . onlooker. ‘Her hair looked all ruffled and her make up was smudged. At . one stage she removed her sunglasses to wipe away tears.’ Playful: Charles and his daughter Phoebe appeared to be in a jovial mood as they arrived back . The art mogul drank almost a full bottle . of red wine and smoked copiously during the lunch at what has become . their restaurant of choice. Trinny was also smoking but does not drink. As the meal ended, Saatchi stalked off towards the taxi rank while Trinny sat alone at the table for a moment as if trying to compose herself. She then followed him to the waiting cab. When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Saatchi denied there had been an argument. He emailed: ‘Why not send a photographer to Scott’s tomorrow lunchtime, and I will give Trinny a good throttling in time for your deadline?’ It is perhaps unfortunate that the images . emerge as Saatchi admits for the first time that he is a ‘narcissist’ who cannot hold on to a woman. Previously: Trinny gets passionate, and weepy, in a heated debate with stone-faced Saatchi outside Scott's restaurant last Saturday . In an astonishingly frank interview with Eton College’s Junior Chronicle, a magazine to commemorate the school’s traditional Fourth of June celebrations, he concedes that his self-obsession destroyed his three marriages to Doris Lockhart, Kay Hartenstein, and Nigella Lawson. ‘If you are a narcissist as I am, you . may find it difficult to hold on to your wives,’ he says, in his most . candid confession so far. ‘I never quite comprehend how it is possible to tire of my company, but it clearly is, and with reliable frequency. Upset: A tear runs down her cheek . ‘Personally I find my own company  perfectly exhilarating, but not when I’m alone.’ But, perhaps most tellingly, he offers a hint that Trinny is not slated to be wife No 4, saying: ‘I always propose to a prospective wife on our second date. I feel that if they can handle a couple of suppers they will have a grasp of what to expect. But no, they always seem to give up the struggle, leaving me anxiously seeking another lifetime companion.’ The sentiments about his relationships may or may not come as a surprise to Nigella, 54, who was pictured apparently being ‘throttled’ by Saatchi outside Scott’s in June last year. He first dismissed the row as a ‘playful tiff’ but later accepted a police caution. Trinny removed her glasses and glared at him and appeared to shout . The couple’s ten-year marriage unravelled after the publication of the pictures. She filed for a ‘quickie’ divorce and it was granted the following month. Just eight weeks after their divorce was finalised, Saatchi started to date Trinny, best known for the TV show What Not To Wear. She has told friends they are ‘hopelessly in love, but there have been claims she is increasingly frustrated by Saatchi’s reluctance to both show affection in public and take their relationship to the next level. The Mail on Sunday asked Trinny, and in reply received a response from lawyers acting for both her and Saatchi, denying there had been any falling-out.

"The father of Prince William’s friend Jecca Craig has been accused of callously dragging out a court case after a tourist was skewered by a rampaging elephant on the wildlife estate he runs in Kenya. Wendy Martin has spent 14 years fighting for justice after suffering horrific injuries during the attack. The elephant’s tusks pierced her torso from front to back, destroying one of her kidneys. The animal then tossed her in the air, dragged her battered body through the bush and knelt on her, its three-ton weight shattering her pelvis. Wendy Martin was on holiday with her husband and three children when she was gored so badly by a rampaging elephant that her intestines were left hanging out . Last week, she finally settled her long-running legal battle for an undisclosed sum. Defendants including Ian Craig had previously appealed a ruling that found them guilty of negligence and ordered them to pay more than £500,000 in damages. In an exclusive interview, Mrs Martin, who has spent £100,000 in legal fees fighting her case, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Frankly, it’s extraordinary I’m still alive, but I was branded as some kind of gold-digger. ‘I believe he hoped I would give up and go away but I wanted to know why it happened and to try to ensure no one else suffers a similar fate.’ She was attacked when on holiday at the Il Ngwesi Lodge in 2000 with her husband Steve, a British diplomat, and their children, Matthew, then aged ten, Rosanna, eight, and Emily, four. They had been living in Nairobi for four years and had been to the lodge – described as a ‘wilderness experience with little or no game’ – twice before and felt comfortable there. Mrs Martin, a physiotherapist from Godalming, Surrey, had been invited on an early-morning run by a guide when, with two other guests, they encountered an elephant protecting its young. The guide first told them to stop, but then shouted ‘run’ and they scattered. Mrs Martin later learned that had they stayed together, they would have had more chance of frightening the animal away – and also that the party were just 300 yards from the safety of the lodge. She said: ‘I remember every heart-stopping moment. I tripped and the guide hauled me, then I was running for my life. I could hear the elephant closing in on me. It had huge tusks and its ears were flapping.’ Terrified, she dived under a bush and curled into a ball. ‘Next thing I knew, its head was butting into me and I could hear the sound of its tusks slicing through the earth around me. Ian Craig, the father of Jecca Craig (pictured), who is friends with Prince William, owned the Kenya ranch where the attack happened . It pushed me about 60 yards through the bush, its tusks piercing my body before it picked me up and tossed me into the air. ‘When I landed, I can remember thinking that I must play dead in the hope it would stop. Thankfully, it worked. The elephant disappeared into the bush with a snort.’ Wendy was horrifically wounded. The tusks pierced her body from  front to back in four places, destroying her kidney and narrowly missing vital organs. Wendy recalls: ‘I was in excruciating pain. I looked down at my body and I’ll never forget the horrific sight. 'There were holes everywhere and out of my side spilled a mass of blood and flesh. I knew from the medical training I’d done as a physiotherapist that it was my intestines. ‘One of my first thoughts was that I needed to get covered up as I was getting cold despite the rising heat of the African bush, and that I was going to be die of shock.’ Incredibly, none of the lodge staff seemed to have any medical training. Realising that she was very seriously wounded, Wendy knew it was important to stay conscious, to stay alive. As lodge staff radioed Mr Craig for help, Wendy’s husband, who had been inside with their children, rushed to the scene. The distraught couple began to say their final farewell to each other and Wendy asked Steve to say goodbye to the children. But she clung on for about 30 minutes until Mr Craig arrived with two planes and a private nurse who had been caring for one of his friends with terminal cancer. Wendy was flown to a bush hospital an hour away, but doctors declared her injuries were too severe to treat with their limited facilities. She was then sent on to Nairobi, arriving in hospital four hours after the attack. It took surgeons six hours to stabilise her condition. Her list of injuries includes a destroyed kidney, which was removed, multiple fractures to her pelvis and bones in her lower back, broken ribs and wounds to the abdomen, lumbar areas and legs. Doctors warned her family to expect the worst. ‘I remember feeling certain that I would die from my injuries. Every time I opened my eyes, I  was astonished I was still alive,’ Wendy says. ‘The hardest part for me came four days later when the children came to visit for the first time, it still makes me tearful to think about it now. ‘I’d never been parted from them before, and they arrived to see my face swollen with bruises and my body hooked up to all sorts of machines. 'The three children just stood at my bedside and cried. They were very distressed and the look of trauma and pain etched on their faces will stay with me forever.’ After ten days Wendy, who had private health insurance, was flown back to the UK where she spent a further three months in hospital. But her shattered body required more delicate surgery. She risked paralysis during an operation to pin her pelvis back together with ten-inch metal screws and suffered from two lumbar and two abdominal hernias. The wound in her left leg also became infected, opening up to a point where it was gaping eight inches wide. ‘At one stage, I feared I was going to have to have my leg amputated,’ she says. ‘It was a very hard time for me. ‘I had to focus on my life hour by hour. I was in constant excruciating pain and there always seemed to be something else going wrong, meaning I had to be rushed back into hospital. It was very difficult with three children to look after.’ The once active and fit mother found that a good day meant hobbling around on a walking frame or using a wheelchair. Even after the wounds started to heal, she struggled to come to terms with her new body. ‘I felt like a mangled wreck,’ she says. ‘I’d always been very proud of my figure, I went to the gym and ate healthily,’ she says. ‘My body is covered with large ugly scars. At first I didn’t feel entirely comfortable wearing swimwear because people do stare at my scars, but now they are badges of my survival that I wear with pride.’ It took an astonishing three years of legal correspondence before it even emerged that there was no insurance at the lodge. ‘It was obvious to us that Mr Craig was distancing himself from what had happened,’ said Mrs Martin. ‘I had no idea at the time that he was a powerful landowner. ‘It’s been incredibly difficult watching his business and influence grow through his royal and society connections while he wouldn’t take responsibility for what had happened to me.’ Mrs Martin accuses Ian Craig (pictured) of dragging his feet over the court case and hoping she would go away . Mr Craig – whose daughter Jecca was with Prince William on a controversial boar hunt in Spain last week – is a shareholder in Il Ngwesi Lodge as well as its managing director and owner of the adjacent Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the Prince  proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010. Mr Craig and the two companies were found guilty of negligence in 2007 – which they appealed. During the long legal battle, it emerged that the lodge manager and Mr Craig knew a herd of elephant with young had been reported nearby. Mr Craig argued that a ruling against him would damage conservation efforts but Mrs Martin, now 53, said: ‘This case has nothing to do with conservation. It’s about having a duty of care to paying guests. ‘Neither was it about money. I felt a responsibility to try to prevent another family enduring such a horrific experience. ‘This ruling sends a message to every lodge in Kenya and has changed the law there for the better. Lewa now publishes a list of safety regulations, one of which says guests are not allowed out on foot without armed guides.’ When asked to comment last night, Ian Craig directed The Mail on  Sunday to a statement on the Lewa website, which stated: ‘On February 10, Il Ngwesi Company Ltd, the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and Ian Craig settled, for an undisclosed sum, the damages awarded to Mrs Wendy Martin and withdrew their appeal. 'This brings to an end the legal proceedings in the case.’","Wendy Martin visited Kenyan lodge with husband and three children .

"She was once hailed as the most beautiful woman in the world. But these days actress Diana Quick admits she sometimes wishes she had undergone plastic surgery as a younger woman. The 67-year-old star, who is best remembered for playing Lady Julia Flyte in the 1981 TV series Brideshead Revisited, says that when she looks in the mirror today, she no longer recognises the reflection. 'I had to go through some old pictures recently and was absolutely surprised by the changes on my face,' she said. Diana Quick pictured recently (left) and in 1981 series Brideshead Revisited (right) 'It was like looking at someone else. I don't think it's ungracious  to seek cosmetic help - it has crossed my mind from time to time and I have been tempted. But it's too short-term. Once you start down that road, you have to keep going. 'They say you have to do it in your 40s to get the full benefit, so it's far too late for me. In any case, I come from a family of surgeons and I think it should only be used as a last resort. Good looks are not something you earn. But as you get older how you look is a reflection of the life you've led. 'If you try to live as well as you can, then hopefully your face will reflect that. But it's unfair that we put so much pressure on women  to look good and then give them so much stick when they go under the knife to achieve this.' For all her misgivings about the ageing process, Diana is still strikingly good-looking and possesses a fierce intellect - she won a place at Oxford University when she was 17. Her acting CV is equally formidable, including roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company as well in films such as The Duellists and Saving Grace. But she is best known for her  role in Brideshead alongside Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews. The hit ITV series cemented her place as one of the country's leading actresses. It earned her a Bafta nomination and one magazine cover asked: 'Is this the most beautiful woman in the world?' Diana says: 'I don't think it's ungracious to seek cosmetic help - it has crossed my mind' While many ageing actresses complain about the lack of big screen roles for older women, Diana is always working. 'That's because I chose to become a character actor,' she explains. She combines her acting work with being director of the annual Aldeburgh Documentary Festival. Diana is about to star in The Big Meal, a new play by Dan LeFranc and directed by Michael Boyd at the Ustinov Studio in Bath - a venue with which she has a long-standing working relationship. 'It's a touching play about love, marriage, raising children and the general onslaught of life in which you turn around and find that youth has vanished and taken with it a lot of your dearest-held assumptions about the way things would turn out,' she explains. The month-long run starts on March 6.","Diana, 67, played Lady Julia Flyte in 1981 TV series Brideshead Revisited .

"Cynical tactics: Charles Saatchi pictured with his daughter Phoebe . Charles Saatchi cynically used his 18-year-old daughter Phoebe in a desperate bid to smear Nigella Lawson over her use of  illegal drugs, The Mail on Sunday can reveal today. The embittered advertising mogul encouraged his former wife Kay and their daughter to release a damning statement claiming that Ms Lawson had used drugs ‘regularly and heavily each night’ months before her use of cocaine and cannabis was revealed in court. An explosive document, which was endorsed by Phoebe and Kay, claims: . Ms Lawson has strenuously denied these allegations. The fresh revelations come as Ms Lawson gives her first interview since her former housekeepers were found not guilty of a £685,000 credit card fraud. She told The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine that she has ‘toughened up’ in the last year, adding in a statement sent through her publicist Mark Hutchinson: ‘I will survive this and move forward. I just want to focus on family life and work.’ In court earlier this month, Ms Lawson admitted snorting cocaine six times – to help deal with her late husband John Diamond’s terminal illness and when subject to ‘intimate terrorism’ by Mr Saatchi. She also admitted cannabis use but has categorically denied she was a ‘habitual user’ of drugs.Last night friends of the chef described claims that she used drugs every night as ‘ludicrous’. Leaking the document to The Mail on Sunday demonstrates the extraordinary lengths to which Mr Saatchi was prepared to go in order to destroy his wife’s reputation. The sensational statement, partly written by Kay Saatchi – Charles’ second wife – was sent in July, after the now infamous picture of him with his hands around Nigella’s throat emerged, leading to the couple’s divorce. Infamous scene: Saatchi appears to tweak Ms Lawson's nose at Scott's restaurant in June . Row: Saatchi and Lawson are pictured arguing outside their London home in 2004 . It begins: ‘I am furious that my daughter, Phoebe, was put into a dangerous environment with the heavy drug use of Nigella.’ She adds: ‘[Nigella] tried to involve [my] daughter in this arrangement but she refused, but kept it quiet from her father and [me] until the furore about Nigella and Charles’ relationship.’ The story about Nigella’s alleged ‘drug nights’ was planted on July 12, a fortnight before the couple were divorced, at the start of a sustained campaign against the TV chef orchestrated by public relations executive Richard Hillgrove, who has claimed to be advising Mr Saatchi. Second wife: Phoebe's mother Kay Saatchi . At the time, The Mail on Sunday did not run the contentious statement for legal reasons. But following the trial of former housekeepers, Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, it can now be revealed. The girls claimed in court that Ms Lawson was a regular drug user. The Mail on Sunday received the statement via email following a telephone call from a source close to Mr Saatchi about ‘concerns’ he wanted to air. The statement was written by an anonymous friend but endorsed by Phoebe, as she confirmed in a phone call where her father was present. After stating that Ms Lawson tried to involve Phoebe in drug taking, it added: ‘When Phoebe’s father learnt the truth from her, and from the staff in the house who would regularly find evidence, and also in  Nigella’s top floor study each morning, he and Kay were horrified. ‘Kay and Charles learnt that Nigella used drugs regularly and heavily each night, for an hour after dinner, and another hour before bed. It was a large house, and Charles spent his evenings in their bedroom, and couldn’t smell the evidence because they closed the doors to the upstairs and lit scented candles. 'Nigella had also installed an air fragrance distribution system throughout the house. The drug nights grew in regularity till they became a permanent feature in the last year. 'Phoebe believes that was when  Nigella grew distant and cold with her for not joining in. That was also when Nigella’s relationship with her father became distanced and distracted. ‘Nigella additionally had her staff prepare an extra two large versions [of joints], on a daily basis to be left on her desk, for her to consume privately during the night while her husband was asleep. ‘Kay feels that attempting to entice her daughter Phoebe into this druggy world was unforgivable; that she was young and vulnerable to peer pressure.’ The statement went on to say that Phoebe kept the allegations ‘quiet’ until she could see how deeply her father was upset about the break up with Ms Lawson. She then decided to ‘tell both her parents the truth about my stepmother’. Mr Saatchi told The Mail on  Sunday via email: ‘I feel like an  idiot being the only person in the house who knew nothing about  the drugs. The more details I received from the staff the more betrayed I felt.’ For months, rumours were fed to the media by a fast-talking PR about drug-taking in the Saatchi-Lawson household. The man behind the storm of rumours circulating online is a former salesman who has made  different claims about his relationship with Charles Saatchi. New Zealand-born Richard Hillgrove had said he was a ‘behind-the-scenes svengali’ to Saatchi. He claimed to be a valued adviser but also said he was not on the art collector’s payroll. Hillgrove, who lives in Somerset and favours wearing a Stetson, writes a blog, News Opinion. He posted a series of pieces about Nigella and allegations of her drug taking – and was then threatened with legal action by her lawyers. In an interview with The Guardian, Hillgrove conceded he had not spoken to Saatchi about the incident at Scott’s restaurant – yet later told journalists he was  a ‘behind-the-scenes svengali’. But friends close to Saatchi said Hillgrove had simply ‘fed Saatchi fascinating titbits’ of information about Nigella, and was not working for him. The two only met, they claim, when Hillgrove called Saatchi to say Nigella had threatened him with legal action. Hillgrove, a former salesman for media giant Northern & Shell, is a self-styled PR guru who also claimed to have represented three  stars of the BBC’s Dragons’ Den. But Duncan Bannatyne, briefly a client, said he ‘would not recommend him’. Ms Lawson insisted she was not a . ‘drug addict or a habitual drug user’ and denied ever authorising the . Grillos’ extravagant purchases, as they had claimed, in exchange for . them keeping her habit secret. Mr . Saatchi also denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in . which he called his ex-wife ‘Hi-gella’ and accused her of poisoning her . daughter Cosima, 19, with drugs and ‘trashing her life’. Last week, police said they would not be taking any action over Ms Lawson over her drug-taking, unless fresh evidence emerged. When . she took the stand at Isleworth Crown Court to give evidence against . her two former aides last week it was clear Ms Lawson felt it was she . who was on trial. Forced . to go into detail about her drug-taking, the 53-year-old spoke of ‘a . long summer of bullying and abuse’ and singled out a PR blog she said . had been ‘dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi’s reputation and savaging . mine’. In . that online journal, Richard Hillgrove made a series of intimate and . defamatory allegations about Ms Lawson before emailing them to . influential members of the media. Mr Saatchi denied in court that he leaked an email to the defence in which he called his ex-wife 'Hi-gella' and accused her of poisoning her daughter Cosima, 19, with drugs and 'trashing her life' More . mysterious, however, is how he became embroiled in the marriage . breakdown – or came to ‘represent’ Mr Saatchi in such a Machiavellian PR . campaign. More . bizarrely, Mr Hillgrove appeared to be simultaneously working for the . Grillo sisters. It was he who put their signed statements online before . the court hearing, although Ms Lawson’s solicitors quickly had them . removed. Last . night Mr Hillgrove refused to make any comment, and Richard Cannon, the . Grillo sisters’ solicitor, did not return The Mail on Sunday’s call. The offensive began on July 23, just over two weeks after Charles Saatchi revealed in The Mail on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife. Mr Hillgrove wrote an account of the now infamous incident outside Scott’s restaurant on June 9, claiming the pictures of Mr Saatchi grasping Ms Lawson around the throat were set up. The next day Ms Lawson threatened to sue Mr Hillgrove, but he refused to take down the offending material. On the July 31, Ms Lawson and Mr Saatchi were granted a decree nisi. Two days later, Mr Hillgrove tweeted a link to another blog in which he claimed Ms Lawson had used the pictures to leave a marriage ‘that has been on the rocks for over a year according to sources’. On August 5, Mr Hillgrove e-mailed the media insisting that the photographs were a ‘slur’ against Mr Saatchi. In an interview with the Guardian in July this year the publicist said he had not spoken to Mr Saatchi about the incident but by September he was telling journalists he was an unofficial adviser. And as the Grillo trial approached, Mr Hillgrove’s emails became more sensational. In his final missive on November 11, just 16 days before the start of the court case he wrote: ‘Nigella Lawson can’t hide from years of deception and cocaine abuse.’ Friends close to Mr Saatchi said that Mr Hillgrove had simply fed the art dealer ‘fascinating titbits’ of information about his estranged wife, and was not working for him. But those who have worked with Saatchi in the past say he is ruthless in the way he cuts people out of his life. One, who did not want to be named, said: ‘If you leave Saatchi and Saatchi you die… you don’t  exist anymore. It’s a bit like Chairman Mao. You’re simply written out of history.’ Was there a grain of truth in  Nigella’s claim that the campaign was designed to savage her reputation? Mr Hillgrove isn’t saying. Nor has he tweeted or emailed since the trial began, nor since the verdict of not guilty was returned last Friday.","Art tycoon launched PR offensive after daughter told him wife used drugs .

"There was a time not so long ago when Lizzie Cundy was regarded as little more than a glamorous accessory for her then famous footballer husband Jason. She was one of the original WAGs – wives and girlfriends of  Premier League footballers – whose elaborate grooming, surgical enhancements and excessive spending were carefully crafted to attract media attention. Tanned, slender and always primped, with long glossy hair and perfect nails, Lizzie fitted the mould perfectly. She worked hard at looking good and devoted herself to her home, her husband and their two sons. Playing for keeps: Seldner and tanned Lizzie Cundy has forged a successful career of her own . ‘I was told I was nothing without Jason, just a pretty bimbo,’ she says. ‘Now, he’s being referred to as Lizzie Cundy’s ex-husband. It’s not a competition but I bet he doesn’t like that.’ One senses that, secretly, she hopes it grates more than a little with her ex. For Jason walked out on Lizzie and their two sons Josh, now 18, and James, 13, in 2010 to be with mezzo-soprano Hannah Pedley, who has appeared in Royal Opera House shows and recorded an album of Gilbert and Sullivan. Despite the fact the marriage had been tempestuous, largely due to her husband’s ‘dark moods’, a devastated Lizzie took to her bed weeping. But eventually she picked herself up and began re-inventing herself, working hard to forge a career as a television presenter – specialising in fashion and celebrity interviews. Ex: Jason Cundy, pictured playing for Tottenham Hotspur in 1993, walked out on Lizzie and her two children in 2010 . Earlier this year, at 45, she made her West End acting debut, starring in the satirical musical WAG, to great critical acclaim. She has two film roles lined up, more television appearances in the pipeline and plans to work in America. Perhaps the only jarring note in her otherwise upbeat life is that when her 18-year marriage officially ended in divorce recently, it was the former WAG who had to pay her errant ex-husband a ‘substantial’ financial settlement. ‘I think I married the wrong footballer,’ she says without malice. ‘Instead of him having to pay for leaving me and the boys virtually penniless, I’m the one who will have to give him money. 'He is still a presenter on the radio channel talkSPORT but claims to be broke.’ She added: ‘Frankly, I think he’s wasted a lot of cash. He continues to live the high-spending life of a top football player. So, I feel I’m paying for his lifestyle.’ Most women would resent having to fork out money to a former spouse who had an affair, dumped her and claimed poverty. But Lizzie says it’s a small price for freedom. ‘It’s liberating because I feel it’s now my time to show what I can do,’ she says. ‘I have a good brain, whatever people think when they see me dressed up.’ Convent-educated Lizzie is hardly a typical WAG. Her late father, Derek Miller, was art director at the Saatchi advertising agency while her mother was a senior manager for fashion house Jaeger. She was expected to go to university, but decided to become a model after being spotted by the great fashion photographer Norman Parkinson. Stage presence: Lizzie, right. was praised for her starring role in the musicals WAGS . By the time she met and married Jason, a working-class boy from South London, 19-year-old Lizzie had modelled for Cosmopolitan and Vogue. She had aspirations to become an actress, but quickly shelved them for life with Jason. He was at Chelsea’s football academy and went on to play for Tottenham and Ipswich. Lizzie turned down primetime television jobs with Blue Peter and as Bruce Forsyth’s sidekick on Play Your Cards Right, to start a family. Jason, she says, did not want her to work full time. But plagued by injuries and two bouts of testicular cancer, during which Lizzie nursed him back to health, Jason retired in 2002 and became a radio presenter. By the time they parted three years ago, Lizzie was already a recognised face on the red carpet. ‘Jason decided he wanted to have a life elsewhere and left me with two children to bring up,’ she says. ‘I’ve had to work really hard to make sure they have the lifestyle they are used to. That’s been my motivation. ‘I could have crumpled and gone to pieces – in fact, I did for a while – but I had two boys to support. Keeping a roof over our heads and putting food on the table became my priority.’ Despite being devastated at the time, she argues it was the best thing that could have happened. ‘I’ve never been happier. It’s made me stronger and more independent. I’m a grafter; I have a lot of energy and don’t need more than four hours sleep. But I never thought I would ever have to earn my own living.’ In the heydays of Jason’s career, she was totally dependent on him. It was, she accepts, a privileged life. There was the obligatory mansion in leafy Hampshire, expensive cars, exotic holidays and closets stuffed with designer clothes. ‘Back then, WAGs were not expected to be more the arm candy. But Victoria Beckham, Coleen Rooney and myself broke the mould by working and making a name for ourselves.’ Lizzie was at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, where the England squad’s WAGs gained more publicity - not all of it positive - than the team. The manager blamed them for the less than stellar performances on the pitch. Four years later, she was a special guest presenter for ITV’s Daybreak programme during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Those who know her well say she is genuinely kind and loyal and possesses a ‘wicked’ sense of humour. These are some of the qualities that led to her becoming known as the WAG-ony aunt. ‘The other wives and girlfriends would come to me with their problems, because they knew I’d been through it all before,’ she explains. ‘They still do because they know I’m honest and discreet. ‘Adultery has been a big issue. There is a lot of temptation for high-profile players. When I first started seeing Jason, girls would send him pictures of themselves naked. Party person: Lizzie, left, can be spotted out and about with famous figures like Apprentice contestant Luissa Zissman, right . 'You have to have a strong relationship to trust your partner not to stray.’ She ended up with an advice column in a well-known glossy magazine. These days, however, Lizzie wants to be taken seriously as a presenter and actress. ‘The musical WAG was a huge risk because I felt a lot of people expected me to fail,’ she says. In the end, the production ran for eight weeks and the theatre was packed every night. It was, she says, such a triumph that John Travolta has bought the movie rights. ‘It’s going to be a cross between Grease, Glee and the Full Monty. The finances are in place and I’ve been told I will keep my stage role.’ But before that she is looking forward to interviewing actor Sylvester Stallone before an audience at the London Palladium later this year. And she is starring in a movie with Al Pacino, called Isle Of Dog. She has had to prove herself many times over because, she says, people believe if a woman cares about her looks, she must be an airhead. ‘People constantly underestimate me. Because I’m more than a WAG. ‘Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I hate being called one. After all, The tag has certainly helped to make me who I am today, but it’s not like I’m still married to a footballer so I think it’s time to bench it.’","Lizzie Cundy, 45, was one of the original WAGs .

"Charles Saatchi and Nigella  Lawson are said to be in a bitter dispute over two former personal assistants accused of misappropriating £170,000, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The case has caused tensions in Mr Saatchi and Ms Lawson’s marriage and friends say it was a factor behind their row at celebrity restaurant Scott’s earlier this month, when the art collector was pictured  ‘strangling’ his wife. Saatchi, 70, is taking the women to the High Court after they allegedly spent tens of thousands on designer goods, taxi journeys and a flight to New York. Francesca Grillo and her sister Lisa were hired by Nigella to be her aides but allegedly spent over £170k . Lisa Grillo leaning out of the window of her flat at Kensington Gardens Square. She is being sued along with her sister for misappropriating funds . Friends say he last week asked Ms Lawson, 53, to move her belongings out of their £14 million Chelsea  mansion after making it clear he would not apologise for grabbing her by the throat. The Mail on Sunday understands that after Saatchi accepted a police caution for the strangling incident Nigella told the police he had never hit her before. Italian sisters, Francesca, 34, and Elisabetta ‘Lisa’ Grillo, 32, are claimed to have ‘misappropriated’ the money to splurge on luxuries such as a £3,616 Virgin Atlantic flight to New York and designer goods from Prada, Miu Miu and Chanel. They were first employed by Ms Lawson when she was married to her first husband John Diamond, who died of cancer aged 47 in 2001. When she married Saatchi in September 2003, both took roles working for Ms Lawson and her new husband. Francesca Grillo was  paid £28,000 a year while Elisabetta was paid £25,000. Photos were published of Charles Saatchi grabbing Nigella Lawson by the throat as they ate at Scott's restaurant . The case is thought to be one of the factors behind the argument between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi where he appeared to grab her by the neck . Their jobs ranged from looking after Nigella’s  children from her first marriage – Bruno, now 17, and daughter Cosima, now 19 – and Saatchi’s daughter Phoebe, 18, by second wife Kay Hartenstein. They also carried out activities directly related to Saatchi’s business activities. They were sacked last year over the allegations and Saatchi started High Court proceedings against them. They also face criminal charges and are due to appear at Isleworth Crown Court later this year.Nigella treated them as trusted confidantes, paying tribute to their work in her 2011 cookery book Recipes From The Heart Of The Home by writing: ‘I give heartfelt thanks to .  .  . my kitchen confidantes: Lisa and Francesca Grillo.’ As a result, the impending cases, according to a source, have created a deep rift between the celebrity chef and her husband. ‘The Grillo girls had been very close to Nigella for a long time,’ the source says. ‘She brought them into the marriage and she has naturally been very defensive about all this. I don’t think she particularly wanted them to be sued. That’s one of the things they were rowing about over the now infamous lunch. Friend's say that he refused to apologise for grabbing her, and asked her to remove her belongings . The TV chef's cookery equipment was also removed. This crepe maker was loaded into the van with the rest of her belongings . ‘Charles was criticising her for allowing the assistants free rein and things clearly got a bit heated. One of them was allegedly spending money on Chanel handbags and other designer stuff. He thinks Nigella has been too easy on them.’ According to court documents lodged at the High Court of Justice, the sisters’ responsibilities included acquiring goods and services for Saatchi, Nigella and their children. They were given access to two credit cards but only for business purposes. They were also permitted to use a taxi fare account with ComCab, but only ‘for journeys undertaken in the course of carrying out their duties’. But in July 2012, Rahul Gajjar, finance director of the Saatchi Gallery group, claimed that unauthorised purchases may have been made using the credit cards, including a £3,616 Virgin Atlantic flight to New York. Francesca is accused in the High Court document of ‘misappropriating’ some £166,132 and Elisabetta £5,617. The pair, were said to be ‘in flagrant breach of their contractual and/or fiduciary duties as employees’. The writ says Saatchi is expecting to recover more than £25,000. Another source connected to Saatchi says: ‘The sisters were  often asked to fly to, say Munich,  to collect a picture and Saatchi issued the pair a credit card to  cover expenses. ‘The pair are devout Catholics with previous good conduct with not a blemish on their record. ‘It was Lisa who first started working for Nigella as a personal assistant. The story, as I understand it, is that she actually worked for Nigella when her first husband John Diamond was alive – so for longer than ten years.’ Nigella is said to have been very upset about the way things ended with the sisters, who have strongly denied the allegations. When approached last week, a visibly upset Lisa said: ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’ Pot plants were also removed from the house today in the third day of moving . Well-used pots and pans believed to be possessions of Nigella Lawson are taken from the home . Meanwhile, Ms Lawson is still living in a Mayfair bolthole after being forced to remove her belongings from the family home. Saatchi is said to be convinced that Nigella’s friends have been briefing against him and worried that ‘lots of dirty linen’, could be aired in public in the criminal case against the sisters. But friends say Ms Lawson is – despite everything – still in love with her husband and after he accepted a police caution for the strangling incident she told the police he had never hit her before. She is said to be distraught that Saatchi has made no attempt to get in contact with her and friends are worried about her mental state. ‘She’s been desperate to repair the relationship and desperate to talk to Charles,’ says one confidante. ‘Her plans for the future are  to throw herself into her career  and America. But she would still consider rebuilding if he would make a gesture. ‘She is doing anything she can to get some sort of reaction from him. It is Charles, by his lack of action, who is ending the marriage. ‘He is still controlling Nigella,  who now feels that she will be dumped without even a sorry or conversation. He has effectively dumped her by stonewalling her and asked her to move her stuff out of the family house.’ Another friend says: ‘Nigella  has been devastated by Charles’s complete radio silence and the fact that he has just ignored her. ‘She has desperately been waiting for a sign or even a sorry and an indication that they can work this out. But he hasn’t. Instead he privately blames her for ruining his life and feels that if they reconcile that he will forever be seen as the wife beater. ‘He is very worried about his  legacy and so has been quietly licking his wounds.’ Yesterday, Richard Cannon of Janes Solicitors, who is acting for the Grillo sisters, issued the following statement. ‘Our clients will  continue to vigorously defend themselves both in the civil proceedings before the High Court and the  criminal proceedings before the Crown Court.’","Francesca and Elisabetta ‘Lisa’ Grillo allegedly ‘misappropriated’ funds .

"Francesca Grillo was a self-confessed ‘eBay addict’ long before her employers took her to court – and even boasted about her love of flashy labels. In 2005, the younger Grillo sister admitted she had spent £30,000 in just two years on designer products from the auction website and said her shopping addiction was so serious, she ‘needed help’. Francesca, then 25, said: ‘I was blown away by what you could buy – absolutely anything, from furniture to Fendi bags, vintage clothes to holiday homes. Francesca Grillo confessed to being an eBay addict in 2005 . ‘Within a few months, I was hooked. I fell in love with designers such as Marc Jacobs, Prada, Gucci and Moschino.’ She had been working as a housekeeper for Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi since 2001, when she joined her sister  Elisabetta, 41, at their Belgravia  property. Francesca revealed how she became ‘hooked’ on making bids on eBay,  comparing the thrill of winning a bid to ‘driving a Ferrari’. She said: ‘Then there was the second rush of excitement when I received my purchases. When they arrived, it felt like Christmas. ‘As the months went by, I bought items I didn’t really want simply because I couldn’t bear the thought of anyone else getting them.’ The Grillo family home in Plati, Italy where the sisters will spend Christmas with their family . Francesca described how her taste for designer goods led to out-of- control spending. ‘Soon the temptation to blow my budget became too great and I started buying ridiculously expensive items. My biggest splurge was £700 on a pair of Gucci glasses, Fendi boots and a Marc Jacobs scarf – all in one day.’ Francesca claimed that her spending destroyed her relationship with her then boyfriend, who confronted her after finding bags full of expensive gear. ‘He was furious that I was spending money on clothes when I should have been saving up to buy my own flat, and our rows over my spending soon escalated,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘I never thought he’d make me choose between him and eBay, but in the end he couldn’t take any more.’ Francesca said her passion for eBay developed into a dangerous ‘addiction’ that led to her boyfriend leaving her. ‘Until he left, I didn’t think I had a problem. I reasoned that I didn’t drink, smoke or do drugs. But now I know my eBay addiction was just as strong as someone who is addicted to alcohol or gambling.’ Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo arriving at Isleworth Crown Court during the case earlier this month . On the surface at least, the contrast between this fashion-filled London  life and the dilapidated streets of Plati, the sisters’ home village in Calabria, could hardly be greater. In the very ‘toe’ of Italy’s ‘boot’, it is a place of cracked roads, unfinished buildings and wandering farm animals. But there are luxury cars here, too, and high-end handbags, and £500 shoes on the feet of teenage girls despite the many potholes of the  isolated village. Because there is tremendous wealth in Plati, and it comes from its intimate connection with the feared Calabrian mafia, the ’Ndrangheta, once famous for its kidnappings, now known for supplying drugs. So while Francesca may blame eBay for her love affair with designer labels, it’s just as likely that the sisters brought their luxurious tastes with them from their home town. There are fewer than 4,000 residents in Plati, and some 90 per cent are said to have mafia associations, including, according to one police source, three generations of Grillos. The sisters’ father Michele served 15 years for his part in the gang that snatched Tullia Kauten, a fashion store owner, from the streets of Milan in 1981. Nigella Lawson leaving Isleworth Crown Court after giving evidence at the case during the trial . Today Michele insists that he has served his time, is reformed and earns a legitimate living as a truck driver for the construction industry.  He shares a modest flat with his frail wife and their youngest daughter on the outskirts of Milan. Speaking through the window of his black Mercedes SUV, in his first comments since Elisabetta and Francesca were acquitted of a £685,000 credit card fraud against their former employers, he railed against the threat to their good name. ‘This story has damaged the reputation of my daughters. Good job it went the way it did. I would have seen to it personally, otherwise. ‘My daughters were trapped between two people fighting. Where were all the accountants, what were they doing? ‘If someone spends your money, you get rid of them. The credit cards were in the company name. ‘Why did Nigella keep them working for her for another four years?  I am an honest man. I have a record and have had problems with justice. But I have my own respectable business. I drive a truck, now. I did not need the money of the English.  I sent money to my girls. Their bank accounts were frozen and they needed to pay for the lawyers. ‘They will be flying from London to Plati next week and we will spend Christmas all together.’ Local people say Michele, who spent much of Elisabetta and Francesca’s early years in prison, encouraged them to live independent lives. ‘He never wanted them to become involved in the criminal life that has been the lifeblood of the village,’ one woman said. ‘He was determined they would not follow the traditional route of being married off in some arranged dynastic mafia marriage. He encouraged them to travel abroad.’ Elisabetta, who is known as Lisa, was the first to leave. In 1992, she applied for work as an au pair and spent four years in High Barnet, London, before returning to Italy. In 1999, both sisters sent CVs to a London au pair agency, and Elisabetta ended up as a nanny with  Nigella, who was married to Sunday Times journalist John Diamond, then dying of throat cancer. Francesca, meanwhile, worked as an au pair with an American family living in Chiswick, West London, before joining her sister in the Saatchi-Lawson household. Anna Maria, the eldest of the four Grillo girls, remained in Plati, where she married locally. She is currently living in the family’s four-storey house with her extended family of aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. Yesterday she expressed her delight at the outcome of the trial and said she was planning a family party to celebrate her sisters’ homecoming. ‘I’m so happy the people on the jury realised it was unfair and found them not guilty,’ she said. ‘I can’t believe that after my  sisters both sacrificed so much of their own lives to look after Nigella, she turned against them. ‘My sisters were so devoted and worked such long hours that they have not found time for children of their own. ‘As far as I was concerned, they were let down. They are good girls.’ It is likely that the entire village will turn out to welcome its famous former residents. This notorious criminal hotspot, a centre of the drug trade, might seem a curious destination for Cosima  and Bruno, Nigella’s children with John Diamond. Yet in the immediate aftermath  of their father’s death from throat cancer, this is where the Grillo  sisters brought them. ‘They took them here to help with the grieving,’ says the sister’s aunt, also called Francesca Grillo. ‘My niece adored those children and they came here a few times. They were like family.’ But after the extraordinary revelations of recent weeks, it seems unlikely they will be returning. Michele Grillo was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in a kidnapping . When fashion store owner Tullia Kauten . was snatched from the streets of Milan and bundled into the boot of a . waiting car the  only witness was a barking sausage dog called Kiki. It was four months before the 43-year-old was freed by the Calabrian mafia, following payment of  a ransom of almost £400,000 . The . 1981 kidnapping is testament to the terrible efficiency of the . ’Ndrangheta mob. It also offers a colourful insight into the background . of Elisabetta and Francesco Grillo, whose father Michele was sentenced . to 18 years in prison for his part in the crime. At . the trial of Grillo and 14 others, Ms Kauten explained the appalling . conditions in which she was held. ‘I was blindfolded and tied to a camp . bed, and with earplugs,’ she said. ‘The sensory deprivation led to . hallucinations and depression.’ At . the time, kidnapping was the scourge of rich Italians and a major . source of income for the mafia. The Grillos’ home town, Plati, was . dubbed Italy’s ‘kidnap capital’. The most famous victim was Paul Getty Jr, heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the world. Seized . in Rome in 1973 when he was 16, his ear was chopped off and sent to his . family to terrorise them into paying a multi-million-pound ransom. The ’Ndrangheta mob is known these days for its expertise in drug trafficking. In . 2003, hundreds of police officers stormed Plati, arresting more than . 100 villagers, including the Grillos’ uncle Pasquale. Police uncovered a . vast labyrinth of underground tunnels, walkways and bunkers, used for . hiding during raids, and to store and smuggle drugs. An . investigation revealed there was a plan to spend public money on . restoring the tunnels. The town council was dissolved and replaced by a . special prefectoral commissioner due  to deep mafia infiltration.","Admitted being an 'eBay addict' in 2005 before employers took her to court .

"Controversial: Steve Coogan with Anna Friel as the Raymonds in their heyday . The son of porn baron and property magnate Paul Raymond has attacked a new film about his  father as a ‘tawdry farce’ – dismissing Steve Coogan’s portrayal as an ‘insulting caricature’. Howard Raymond, 53, who inherited 20 per cent of the family property empire, has refused to co-operate with director Michael Winterbottom on his movie, The Look Of Love. He also took legal action to prevent it using the title The King Of Soho, a name associated with his father. He has, instead, agreed to back a rival warts-and-all film which will have that title and will be based on the diaries of his mother Jean which will, he claims, tell the true story of his parents’ rags-to-riches rise. The Look Of Love, which opens this week, boasts a star cast including Coogan, Anna Friel, Stephen Fry and Matt Lucas. But it is Coogan’s role as his father that has attracted particular anger from Howard, who claims the comedian has turned his family story into a ‘Carry On Soho’. ‘My father was nothing like Alan Partridge, the Coogan alter ego,’ he said. ‘It’s a caricature of a man who was so much more complex and who did a lot to make Soho the vibrant entertainment hub that it is today.’ Paul Raymond was a controversial figure who dominated Soho and the pornography industry throughout the Seventies and eventually built up a £650 million property empire in London’s West End. His interests included theatres, bars, magazines and strip clubs, frequented by everyone from The Beatles to Sinatra. The most famous was Raymond’s Revuebar, which he turned into a private members’ club to evade the censorious attention of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, which in the early Sixties barred models from moving. By 1967, the venue was purely hosting striptease. This would, in turn, make way for glitzy, big-budget erotic shows. But Howard claims that his father helped change Britain, by lifting the sex industry from an illicit  and seedy enterprise into a mainstream business. This week, he will launch a new gin, bearing the King of Soho name in tribute to his father. Scroll down for video . Offended: Howard Raymond, right, son of Soho sex show boss Paul Raymond has described a new film about his life as a tawdry insult . He said: ‘People have called him a pornographer, but it wasn’t porn – not like we see today. That was the name that was attached to him and the one that stuck, but really it was titillating seaside-postcard stuff.’ The public image of Raymond in his heyday was of an absurdly flamboyant character who sported an elaborate comb-over hairstyle, comical specs and a perma-tan, and had on each arm a busty blonde, bursting out of an ill-fitting garment. But Howard recalls a father who played football with him in the garden and who always kept  Saturdays for his family. Nightspot: Paul Raymond's Revuebar in Soho is pictured in 2003 . ‘He would sit and watch the wrestling on television during the afternoon, then have a snooze on the sofa. ‘Both my book and film based on it will be a far more personal account than anything already out there in the public arena,’ he said. ‘It’s about my family life rather than his public persona. I wanted to do it because I was fed up with reading things that weren’t true. ‘A lot of people wanted to tell a ‘‘t*** and bums’’ story, but I didn’t think that was a fitting tribute for my dad. 'One major Hollywood production company said they wanted Hugh Grant to do it or something, but I don’t think he was right, so I said no. ‘There were things in my mother’s diary that happened before I was born. She gave it to me before she died in 2002. ‘She was going to write a book and there are pieces in the script critical to the early days from her notes. I suppose it’s difficult to imagine how poor they were – they just didn’t have any money sometimes.’ Howard adds: ‘I found out she had an illegal abortion in 1953, before I was born, because they could not afford to have a child. She talks about how devastated she was. 'They were in a situation where they couldn’t afford to have children. ‘In the diary, she wrote that my father made her do it and she didn’t know if she would ever be able to forgive him. ‘She was devastated, which comes across in her diaries.’ When Raymond died aged 82 in 2008, there was speculation of a rift between him and his son, who now controls a large part of the estate. But Howard insists this is untrue. ‘I’ve never read so much rubbish in my life,’ he said. Portrayal: Actress Anna Friel, left, plays Paul Raymond's wife Jean, right, in the film . Devoted: Paul Raymond pictured with his daughter Debbie in 1989 . ‘There’s this perception that he and I never spoke to each other, but that’s totally false. I saw him once a week, which is a lot more than many people see their parents.’ Equally false, he says, was speculation that his father had planned to turn the entire empire over to his sister Debbie, before she died of a drugs overdose in 1992. ‘Utter tosh!’ Howard exclaimed. ‘My father loved her very much, but he once told me, “She couldn’t run a chip shop.” So, he would never have left her in charge.’ Raymond did, however, leave the biggest slice of his wealth to Debbie’s daughters – India Rose, 22, and Fawn James, 27 – who were the other main beneficiaries in his will. Howard, who runs Raymond Estates, the property company left by his father, says he is satisfied with his lot. ‘My job is to pass on the estate as intact as possible. He left me at least 20 per cent, at  least that’s what I’d admit to. I don’t really think it’s anyone else’s business what the situation is. ‘My father’s legacy is Soho. Thirty years ago I never imagined anyone attaching themselves to the area but, thanks to him, people now want to be attached to Soho.’ High life: Paul Raymond pictured with four of the dancers from his club .","Howard Raymond says film portrayal of his father is an 'insulting caricature'

"It was her simple gesture that Les Misérables star Anne Hathaway found so heartrending. The woman was speaking falteringly about being forced into prostitution in order to feed her children when she broke down, weeping uncontrollably. Then, as if to hide from the shame, she raised a hand to cover her face. In that briefest of moments, Hathaway knew she had found the inspiration for her role as Les Misérables’ tragic heroine Fantine, who resorts to selling her body for the sake of her daughter. Hathaway said: ‘I just said to myself, that’s who she is. She exists; this won’t be an inventive performance. She’s living in the world right now and I must do the reality of the suffering justice by telling the truth.’ Indeed, the 30-year-old’s empathy with the unidentified woman inspired her to give a performance so remarkable that it has been described as ‘magnificent’ and a ‘tour de force’. Two harrowing scenes in particular reveal why her portrayal has been hailed by critics: in one she sings the musical’s most famous and haunting song, I Dreamed A Dream, and in the other her hair is cut off live on camera. There was a lot riding on the critical reception of the film, which opens in UK cinemas on Friday. Based on Victor Hugo’s powerful novel about poverty and revolutionary spirit in 19th Century France, Hathaway was taking on a role which has been played worldwide by some of theatre’s most established singers. Yet the actress, who has described portraying Fantine as a ‘dream’, more than justified the faith of British director Tom Hooper, who cast her over hundreds of better qualified musical actresses. Hooper says he was entranced by the way Hathaway sang in close-up. Her intensity was in part due to having been fascinated by the musical since the age of seven, when . she saw her actress mother, Kate, performing in it on stage. This emotional connection helped Hathaway to throw herself into becoming Fantine with a passion that was unnerving. She insisted on her own hair being cut off for the role and, despite Hooper’s best efforts to dissuade her, went on an extreme diet to shed 25lb from her already slender frame and attain the emaciated look of the tuberculosis-stricken heroine. Hathaway also spent months on her own meticulous library research and would turn up on set carrying binders stuffed with historical papers. However, it was watching a current affairs programme on prostitution that truly inspired her virtuoso performance in the film, which also stars Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried. ‘There was one woman who kept saying, “I come from a good family,  I come from a good family.” I just heard the heartache of loss in her voice,’ Hathaway explains. ‘She doesn’t know how her life got where it was. After having lost everything, she needed to feed her children. She burst into tears while she was talking. And not just tears, it was soul-racking sobs. Praise: Anne Hathaway in her role as Fantine for which she is hotly tipped to win an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress . ‘I’ll never forget, even though her face was [pixelated] to maintain her privacy, how she raised her hand to her forehead. It was the most heartbreaking gesture of despair I had ever seen. So, I didn’t leave myself an option not to go there, because to do anything else would be denying the truth.’ It was this desire for authenticity that prompted her decision to have her own locks shorn for the scene in which Fantine sells her hair to buy food for her child. Hathaway was clear that she didn’t want to look like a well-groomed Hollywood star pretending to be . Elegant: Anne Hathaway at the London premiere for Les Miserables showing off her short new hairstyle after she had it cut off during filming . abroken woman. ‘When I got the role, I had an inherent empathy for the character and a feel for it and a desire to tell the truth in playing her.’ Yet, she almost changed her mind about her hair at the last minute and found that the tears she was required to shed during filming flowed naturally. ‘I was very scared the day we were going to do it. I was sort of regretting offering the option to Tom [Hooper]. I was shaking. ‘After it was done, I looked in the mirror and burst into tears. I realised that I couldn’t take it back. It changed my identity  .  .  .  I was inconsolable. I didn’t think I was that vain.’ However, the dramatic cut turned out to be a shrewd move, enabling her to channel her sadness at losing her auburn locks into the scene, and also giving her a sophisticated new look. Hathaway has always been canny about her career decisions. In the 12 years since she burst on to the scene as a fresh-faced, haphazardly dressed teenager in The Princess Diaries, she has worked hard to be taken seriously. Her profile grew steadily thanks to a starring turn in The Devil Wears Prada in 2006 and a steady stream of roles in hits such as Brokeback Mountain, Becoming Jane and Alice In Wonderland. Yet, after years of playing wide-eyed ingenues, Fantine represents a breakthrough role for the actress, capping a year in which she has turned 30 and married actor-turned-jeweller Adam Shulman. She is hotly tipped to receive the Best Supporting Actress Oscar at next month’s Academy Awards. Explaining the personal significance of the role, Hathaway recalls being enthralled when her mother Kate performed in the musical. ‘I was seven when I first saw the stage production. My mother was playing the factory girl and  different members of the ensemble. I can remember that pretty well. ‘The whole story was very real for me. It never felt musical or like it was a group of actors playing a group of characters. I felt for them so deeply, even though I was very young.’ The evening her mother stepped in as an understudy to play Fantine is etched on her memory. ‘I really do think that was the night my soul fused with this music. Never knowing, of course, that it would come back and enter my life in the way that it has. I always kind of thought that this was [her mother’s] role and untouchable, but when I found out that it was the only one I was up for, I just thought OK great, then I want to play Fantine.’ Her commitment to the character has, in turn, had a profound impact on her personal life. She was so happy in the company of Shulman, then her boyfriend, that she struggled to evoke the misery she needed to project as Fantine. ‘He walks into a room, and I light up. I can’t help it,’ she says. So, a few days into filming, she made the heart-wrenching decision to tell him they had to be apart during filming. Yet there was never a time when she didn’t believe they were destined to be together. ‘I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life,’ she gushes. The couple started dating in November 2008, just five months after the end of her disastrous romance with Italian businessman Raffaello Follieri. Hathaway broke up with Follieri, her boyfriend of four years, days after he was arrested on fraud and money-laundering charges. Family portrait: Anne with her actress mother Kate who she watched perform in the stage production of Les Miserable as a child . Hathaway’s diaries were seized by FBI agents looking for evidence, but she did not face any charges. Follieri, who was subsequently convicted and recently released after four years in a Pennsylvania prison, has since claimed they were about to get engaged when he was arrested. Hathaway maintains a dignified silence, choosing instead to focus on her happy new life. She reveals that her wedding to Shulman was influenced partly by her dramatic hairstyle change. He was so shocked when he saw her new look for the first time that he blurted: ‘OK, without giving anything away about what is coming in the next few months, how do you feel about being a short-haired bride?’ They were married in a secret ceremony in Big Sur, California, last September, after filming had ended. Hathaway’s gown, which she wore with a white headpiece and veil, was designed by Valentino. With her career and personal life at an all-time high, Hathaway is thinking about motherhood. ‘I have wanted to be a mother since I was 16,’ she says. ‘But I also wanted to have a career, so I have been chomping at the bit to be a mother for a really long time. I also had to find a baby daddy first.’ Now that she has the right man, she is planning a large family. ‘I’d like to have as many as I can afford, not just financially but in terms of time, because you want to make sure that each one feels special. I’d like to have a few naturally and adopt.’ First, though, she is set to star in Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi thriller Robopocalypse. And before that is the announcement on Thursday of this year’s Oscars nominations. Should she go on to win the award as widely expected, amid the jubilation and glamour Hathaway will no doubt reflect on the fate of a desperate, unnamed woman whose selfless sacrifice and palpable  suffering spurred her to give the performance of a lifetime.","Star reveals empathy for unidentified woman in documentary .

"A 19th century 'autograph book' - comparable to a modern yearbook - has been unearthed, offering us a glimpse into what life was like for a 14-year-old girl living in 1892. Shane Kent, 18, from Milibrae, California, found the book in a box of his great, great grandmother Agnes Nevin's possessions and posted it to Reddit. It contains life advice and nuggets of wisdom for Agnes in the form of handwritten notes from her friends and relatives, dated between 1892 and 1893. 'Take my advice and married be, Before you are over twenty-three,' one entry reads - one of several marriage mentions - signed by a man called Charley Righter on May 15, 1893, from Livermore, California. Priorities: A yearbook dating back to 1982-1983, belonging to a then-14-year-old girl, Agnes Nevin, has been unearthed, with advice including, 'Take my advice and married be, Before you are over twenty-three' (pictured) It seems Agnes didn't take the advice of Charley, whoever he was, to tie the knot before she was 23. According to a document uncovered by her great, great grandson Shane, she didn't marry until October 3, 1906, when she would have been 28. 'Agnes is your name, Single is your station, Happy be the little man, That makes the alteration,' wrote another friend, who signed her name, 'Mary R.' The 'happy little man' that Agnes would marry 14 years after she received the autograph book turned out to be Frank M. McCormick, then 33, from Livermore. Little is known about their lives together, but the couple had two sons; one born in 1909, when Frank was 36 and Agnes was 31, and another four years later in 1913. Fragile: Books such as the one belonging to Agnes, who died a widow in 1957 when she was 79, (pictured) were known as 'autograph books' and contained notes and pearls of wisdom from friends and relatives . Ignored advice: According to a document uncovered by her great, great grandson Shane, Agnes didn't marry before she was 23, she waited until she was 28, and wed Frank McCormick on October 3, 1906 . Words of warning: 'Dear Agnes, Let your life be like a snow-flake, which leaves a mark but not a stain,' offered another friend, Helen Seller, seemingly advising Agnes to watch her reputation (pictured) 'Cousin Agnes, When you get married, And live up stairs, Don't get proud, And put on airs,' wrote M McManus, another acquaintance fond of advice that rhymes. 'Dear Agnes, Let your life be like a snow-flake, which leaves a mark but not a stain,' offered another friend, Helen Seller, seemingly advising Agnes to watch her reputation. Her brothers made no mention of a future husband, but instead pointed to the importance of friends as being key to a happy future. Stay modest: 'Cousin Agnes, When you get married, And live up stairs, Don't get proud, And put on airs,' wrote  M McManus (pictured) A peek into the future: 'Agnes is your name, Single is your station, Happy be the little man, That makes the alteration,' wrote another friend, who signed her name, 'Mary R' (pictured) Agnes' brother George Nevin wrote in 1892: 'Dear Sister, May your pathway through life led [sic] you into fields of happiness, Where none but friends sincere await, To welcome you.' One woman, Ana Phillips, concurred, but added another of life's great joys. 'Next to acquiring good friends, the best acquaintance is that of good books. Your loving friend,' she wrote. Brotherly love: 'Dear Sister, May your pathway through life led [sic] you into fields of happiness, Where none but friends sincere await, To welcome you,' wrote George Nevin in 1892 (pictured) Bookworm: 'Next to acquiring good friends, the best acquaintance is that of good books. Your loving friend,' wrote Ana Phillips, dated 1983 (pictured) Sage advice: 'True worth is in being, Not seeming In doing each day that goes by, Some little good - not in dreaming, Of great things to do by and by,' wrote Agnes' 'True Friend, Gracie' (pictured) Perhaps the most thoughtful and in-depth entry came from Agnes' 'True Friend, Gracie.' 'True worth is in being, Not seeming In doing each day that goes by, Some little good - not in dreaming, Of great things to do by and by,' she offered, essentially advising Agnes to put her money where her mouth is, and to actually do 'good' rather than aspire to be good. Agnes and her husband Frank appear to have stayed together until their deaths, Frank in 1952 when he was 79, and Agnes five years later, when she was also 79. The couple would have shared their lives through World War I and II, the Great Depression, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; as well as the invention of airplanes, radios, and shortly before they died, Bikinis and LEGO.","The book belonged to Agnes Nevin, a woman who was born in California in 1878, married aged 28 and died in 1957 when she was 79 ."
"A paralysed teenager died in police custody after removing his tracheostomy tube while in his cell, an inquest has heard. Darren O’Connor, also known as Lyons, was seen on CCTV completely removing the tube from his throat at South Shields Police Station after he had been arrested for breach of bail in July 2010. Police and paramedics battled to replace the tube for 90 minutes before it was finally put back in by A&E staff at South Tyneside Hospital. Tragic: Darren O'Connor died in police custody after removing a tracheostomy tube which enabled him to breathe properly while in a cell. Mr O'Connor is pictured in hospital aged 18 after his cycling accident . Grieving: Michelle O'Connor, pictured with son Darren (left) and arriving at the inquest today (right), told the court that the teenager was aware of the potential consequences of removing the tube . But the 19-year-old had already suffered a heart attack on the way to hospital, and the lengthy period with restricted oxygen proved fatal. South Tyneside Magistrates' Court heard that Mr O'Connor, who had sustained brain injuries and was partially paralysed after cycling into oncoming traffic in October 2007, was arrested for breaching his bail conditions. He had been caught in South Shields town centre later than the hours his electronic tag allowed. But the court heard that he completely removed the tube which enabled him to breath properly while in his cell at the police station. Home Office pathologist Mark Egan said that Darren died as a result of a cardiac arrest due to hypoxia - a lack of oxygen. The court heard that the teenager had spent a month in a coma, and 14 months in hospital after his cycling accident. Evidence: Michelle O'Connor, pictured outside South Tyneside Law Courts today, said that her son would 'never' deliberately harm himself . Mr O'Connor was eventually fitted with a permanent indwelling tracheostomy tube, and experienced severe difficulty with scar tissue around the hole in his throat. His mother Michelle O’Connor, 40, wept as she told the court how her son had struggled to come to terms with the tracheostomy, which had left him unable to speak. She said: 'He wanted his voice. 'That’s the one thing he wanted. 'He used to say to me, ""Mam, I’m not bothered about my leg or anything like that."" 'It was just his voice. He just wanted his voice.' Mrs O’Connor also told the court that Darren knew the dangers of removing the tracheostomy. She said: 'Darren knew the consequences of taking the tracheostomy out - that he would die - that he could not put the tracheostomy back in. 'Only I was trained to do it. 'That’s what I couldn’t understand. He never did it at home for the year and a half, so why do it that night?' When asked if she thought Darren would deliberately harm himself, Mrs O’Connor responded, 'No never', and added that Darren had been in good spirits in the run up to his death. The inquest heard that Darren had removed his tracheostomy once before, in a taxi that was taking him back to hospital before he was fully discharged after his accident. At the time Darren was distressed to be returning to hospital. It also became dislodged accidentally on one occasion in his sleep while he was in hospital. In a statement read out to court, Dr David Meikle, the consultant in charge of Mr O'Connor’s care, said that the teenager was aware that removing the tube would not immediately render him unable to breathe, but could prove fatal if left dislodged. Paralysed: Mr O'Connor, pictured in hospital with mother Michelle, was seriously injured in a cycling accident in 2007 . Arrest: Mr O'Connor was in a cell at South Shields Police Station, pictured, when he removed his tracheostomy tube . The statement read: 'It is certainly my understanding that Darren was aware that removal of his tracheostomy tube would lead to a fatal closure of his airway. 'Darren would be aware that removal of the tube would not immediately render him unable to breathe. Struggle: Mr O'Connor is pictured before his accident aged 10. His mother told the court that he struggled to cope with the loss of his voice caused by the tracheostomy tube . Pathologist Mark Egan described Darren’s windpipe as being dangerously narrow - gradually closing as time passed. He said: 'The normal windpipe should have the diameter of a little more than a penny. 'At the surface, Darren’s was the size of a five pence coin, so it was considerably narrower. 'At its narrowest end his windpipe was a little bigger than a Bic biro.' HM Coroner Terence Carney said: 'He (Darren) took it out and couldn’t or wouldn’t put it back in. 'An ambulance was called. 'He was transported to South Tyneside Hospital. En route he had a cardiac arrest. 'They had difficulty putting it back in. 'When he got to the hospital and when they put it back in and were about to start CPR he was not recovered. He was sadly dead.' The court was told that problems with scar tissue in and around the windpipe were a contributing factor to the death. The inquest continues.

"A handyman who sliced his hand to the bone with a machete claims he was turned away from a GP surgery - because he was not a registered patient.

But despite dripping with blood Mr Box was turned away by staff who refused to help him because it was not his usual clinic. Glenn Box accidentally hacked into his hand with a machete while cutting back bushes. He stumbled into the local surgery begging for help but claims he was denied help because he wasn't a registered patient . He claims he was forced to drive himself eight miles to hospital where medics told him he had cut though his tendons and gave him 14 stitches. He said: 'I’m disgusted at the way I was treated. I had been cutting through twigs and branches with my jungle knife when I cut straight through my hand. 'I’m a bit of a Rambo and I’m not squeamish, but was shocked to see I had cut through to the white tendons. 'I have never seen that much blood in all my life so I knew I had to get help straight away. 'Everyone I have told has said they think it is wrong that trained medical staff refuse to help in an emergency. 'I left the surgery in shock and I was losing so much blood I worried I would collapse. 'I decided to try to drive to the hospital, thinking if I started to feel faint I would pull over and call an ambulance.' Mr Box, from Radstock, Somerset, went to St Mary’s Surgery in nearby Timsbury, but was turned away because he wasn't a registered patient. He added: 'I had hoped being a local they would bandage me up to stop the flow of blood - but they just pretty much told me to go away.

Jackie Yeates, practice manager at St Mary’s, said: 'I cannot comment on the individual case but the general rule is that you should go to your own surgery if it is within the local area as they are best placed to treat you as they have your medical records. 'If someone has minor injuries the best option is to go to Paulton Hospital but this again depends on the individual situation.' She added she was unaware of the situation at the surgery at the time of Mr Box's visit on September 9. But she added it may have been the case there were no doctors or nurses at the surgery at the time due to afternoon home visits.","Glenn Box, 54, accidentally hacked into his hand while cutting back bushes .

"A mother-of-three diagnosed with an 'inoperable' brain tumour has defied medics after undergoing radical surgery in the USA to have it successfully removed - and could now live another 15 years. Laura Fischer-Beards was just 37 when she was given the devastating diagnosis after developing pains in her neck. The nurse was told the tumour was benign but that it was too deep within her brain to operate - and she had between just three to 12 months to live. Scroll down for video . Laura Fischer-Beards, with husband Mark and sons Elliot, Henry and Sebastian, was just 37 when she was given the devastating diagnosis she had an inoperable brain tumour - and just months to live . She underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which proved unsuccessful. An attempted biopsy also caused her to have a bleed on the brain, temporarily paralysing her down her right side . NHS Doctors in Birmingham and London told her the tumour was like a 'spider wrapping round her brain' and warned her there was nothing more they could do. Instead, they tried to manage her condition with chemotherapy and radiotherapy - which proved unsuccessful. But the now 39-year-old refused to give up for the sake of her three boys and researched alternative treatments not provided on the NHS or privately in Britain. Mrs Fischer-Beards, and husband Mark, 41, a police officer, found a pioneering treatment available in the USA for £80,000 called 'awake craniotomy with mapping'. Without hesitation, she flew to Chicago two weeks ago. Last Wednesday she underwent the procedure - which involved cutting open a slice of skull - while awake. Incredibly, to avoid injury to her language, motor and sensory functions, she had to recite her children's names and birthday's so  during surgery. NHS Doctors in Birmingham and London told Mrs Fischer-Beards the tumour was like a 'spider wrapping round her brain' and warned her there was nothing more they could do . Instead, Mrs Fischer-Beards, and husband Mark, 41, a police officer, found a pioneering treatment available in the USA for £80,000 called 'awake craniotomy with mapping . And after the five hour operation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital she was delighted to be told doctors had successfully removed 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour. Doctors say the surgery could have extended her life by up to 15 years. Mrs Fischer-Beards, from Berkswell, near Coventry, West Midlands, said she was desperate to survive so she could be there for her children . She said: 'It was a choice of giving up or fighting and I am not a defeatist. 'I couldn't just give up when I have three young children who need me to be there for them. 'I think anyone in my position would do the same and fight as hard as they can to stay alive.' She and her husband said they were left with no option after a 42-day course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed to get her condition under control. An attempted biopsy caused her to have a bleed on the brain and temporarily paralyse her down her right side. A scan then showed the tumour's progression had not slowed. After meeting a doctor at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in Chicago, she took the brave decision to undertake the radical surgery last week . After the five-hour operation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital she was delighted to be told doctors had successfully removed 100 per cent of the enhanced tumour - which could extend her life by up to 15 years . Consultants admitted they had run out of ideas and encouraged her to look for more radical treatment elsewhere. After meeting a doctor at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, she took the brave decision to undertake the radical surgery. Mrs Fischer-Beards added: 'I had private healthcare, so it wasn't about taking money out of the NHS, just about their belief in my chances of survival which they thought were virtually nothing. 'I have to admit it was a risk and I was really scared because I had to remain awake throughout the surgery so they could check my brain was functioning normally. 'But you do what you have to do to survive.' Mrs Fischer-Beards is now fundraising to pay for treatment, not covered by health insurance . She is now recovering in hospital and is expected to return to the UK soon. But the family is now left with a crippling bill of £80,000 for U.S. surgery, not covered by UK private healthcare. Mr Fischer-Beards has been forced to stay in the country to look after the couple's three children - Elliot, 8, Henry, 7, and Sebastian,4. He said: 'You can't put a price on life. Nowhere else does this kind of procedure because it is so tricky and risky - but I couldn't be prouder of how brave she has been. 'She was awake the whole time while they sliced open her skull and removed the tumour. 'The whole time they asked her to count and recite the boy's birthdays and names, so that they didn't disturb a part of the brain that deals with her memory. 'But she's speaking fine and they said they had removed it OK, so it looks like its been successful. 'Me and the boys just want her back home now.' To meet the steep cost of surgery, Laura's local community has begun a Facebook campaign entitled £onebravemummy to raise awareness of her situation and raise money to help the family. They have helped raise more than £7,000 online in a matter of days as the campaign gains momentum. Any donations to help pay for Laura's treatment can be made via the Justgiving page . When a tumor is near critical speech areas of the brain, it may be important to determine the exact location of these speech-related areas . Although functional MRI (fMRI) can show the various areas of activation during speech functions, it does not pinpoint the most important areas. These critical areas must be located using special speech mapping techniques while the patient is awake in the operating room. Awake speech mapping involves applying mild electrical current to the surface of the exposed brain while the patient performs various tasks, such as reading. If the stimulation hinders the task, then that area of the brain is marked and preserved. How a sleep-awake-sleep craniotomy works . The operation is begun while the patient is deeply asleep under general anesthesia (on a breathing machine). This is for the comfort of the patient and is safer. When the brain is exposed and the neurosurgeon is ready to begin mapping the speech areas, neuroanesthesiologists carefully lighten the sedation, and then remove the breathing tube and allow the patient to talk and interact with the neuropsychologist. Typically, the patients feel minimal or no discomfort while awake . Once the speech mapping is complete, often the tumor is removed while the speech testing continues. The procedure lessens the risk of undercutting the white matter fibers connecting speech areas. When appropriate, the anesthesiologist skillfully places the patient back under general (deep) anesthesia, allowing the neurosurgeon to complete the operation safely with no discomfort to the patient.

"This fully-functioning house is made entirely from recycled materials - including 20,000 toothbrushes which are used to fill cavities in the walls - instead of teeth.

"They are used to diagnose a host of conditions from food poisoning to bowel cancer. But for many people, taking a stool sample is one of their worst nightmares. Now, in a bid to encourage more people to undertake them, a team of experts has prepared a step-by-step guide. The idea behind the information - distributed by Public Health England - is to avoid those embarrassing 'how to' questions. Scroll down for video . Public Health England has released a guide on how to prepare samples to test for a range of diseases . 'Poo is a very important material for doctors as it can be used to test for a wide range of diseases and conditions - including salmonella, E.coli, campylobacter, and bowel cancer, to name a few,' explained Dr Cliodna McNulty, head of the Primary Care Unit at Public Health England. 'Thousands of people every year will be asked by their GP or other healthcare professional to give a sample for testing. 'However a lot of people find the idea of this unpleasant, and have questions such as how to fill the pot, as it's so small.' The team has now produced a leaflet which which shows how the procedure can be done easily and with minimum unpleasantness. Dr McNulty added: 'Although most people think of poo as being disgusting, it does have its uses and is the main way that doctors can test for gastro-intestinal infections and other bowel conditions like cancer. 'Lack of a sample can hinder diagnosis and so we need to encourage people to submit samples when they are asked to do so.' Stools contain bacteria and other substances that are present in the digestive system. By testing the levels of these substances and bacteria, healthcare professionals can work out what’s happening inside a person and diagnose or rule out a host of conditions. Samples can be used to test for a wide range of diseases and conditions - including salmonella, E.coli, and colorectal cancer (pictured) For example, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme offers screening every two years to all men and women aged 60 to 69. People in this age group are sent an invitation followed by a screening kit, so they can do the test at home. It involves wiping a small stool sample onto the testing card, which is then sealed and sent in the post to a lab for testing. The test detects tiny amounts of blood, which people cannot normally see, as polyps and bowel cancers sometimes bleed. Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women, with around 40,000 people diagnosed with the disease each year. Research shows those who performed the test at home and went to subsequent appointments were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage than those diagnosed from their symptoms. When bowel cancer is found at the earliest stage, there is an excellent chance of survival, with more than 90 per cent of people surviving the disease at least five years. However the uptake is worryingly low, particularly among men - most likely due to embarrassment. Dr McNulty said: 'We realise most people find collecting poo an unpleasant thing to do. 'However there are ways that doctors can help patients to feel confident to fill the pot in the easiest way possible. 'Without guidance some people did actually think they had to just go directly into the pot which adds to their distress. 'We want to encourage healthcare staff to take time to explain the importance of the sample in the patient’s treatment and to give our leaflet to help the collection process. 'Together these will help to increase the numbers of samples sent for testing, which will help the patient’s care.' The stool sample should be collected in a clean, dry screw-top container. Your doctor or the hospital will provide you with a plastic (specimen) container to use, although you can use any clean container as long as you can seal it. Try not to collect urine or water (from the toilet) with the stool sample but don’t worry if you do. If you need to urinate, do this first, and then collect the stool sample. To collect a stool sample: . • Label the container with your name, date of birth and the date . • Place something in the toilet to catch the stool, such as a potty or an empty plastic food container, or spread clean newspaper or plastic wrap over the rim of the toilet . • Make sure the sample doesn’t touch the inside of the toilet . • Use the spoon or spatula that comes with the container to place the sample in a clean screw-top container and screw the lid shut . • If you’ve been given a container, aim to fill around a third of it (that’s about the size of a walnut if you’re using your own container) • Put anything you used to collect the sample in a plastic bag, tie it up and put it the bin . • Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm running water .

"They died together in the French Alps, trapped in their car by a mystery gunman as they took a scenic drive. Yesterday, seven weeks after the murders, they finally came home to be buried side by side. In a simple but emotionally-charged Muslim ceremony, design engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave, in a private cemetery secluded by pine trees, in the rain-sodden Surrey countryside. Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave in Surrey . Female relatives wailed loudly and some of the menfolk sobbed as the coffins were opened, one by one, so that the victims’ bodies could be laid to face Mecca before being lowered. Iraqi-born Mr Al-Hilli’s brother Zaid, 53, took up a shovel to help cover their remains. Surrey detectives, who are working with French police, watched the proceedings from a discreet distance. Mr Al-Hilli’s brother Zaid, 53 right, took up a shovel to help cover the remains of his brother Saad, left .

Critical: French police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine during their investigations -  Professor al-Saffar says they are ignoring key evidence . Then, followed by some 30 close relatives, friends and officials, the three plain wooden caskets were driven 40 miles to the Shia Muslim section of Brookwood Cemetery near Woking. They were buried in a quiet corner next to Mr Al-Hilli’s father Kadhim, who died last year. Mr Al-Hilli’s mother, Fahisa, lies nearby. Incense sticks fizzled and a fine . drizzle soaked the huddle of mourners – mainly Iraqis, but including one . or two English friends – as the Imam, Ayatollah Dr Sayyid Al-Milani, . led the graveside prayers.

In accordance with custom, the women covered their heads and stood back from the graveside, sobbing and clutching soggy bouquets. The men, oblivious to the cloying mud ruining their suits, banded together with their shovels to create a huge, dome-shaped tomb. Only one child was present – a boy, believed to be one of Mr and Mrs Al-Hilli’s nephews – but their daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, who both survived the slaughter, were kept away. Dusk had fallen by the time the poignant last act in this terrible episode was played out.

"The party’s over, and for the 10,000 Democrat disciples who frolicked into the wee small hours at Barack Obama’s re-election shindig in his hometown of Chicago, it’s time to call it a day. Yet as the grassroots campaigners began wending their way back to all corners of America, still clutching the flags they had waved till their arms went numb, the mood among them was far from euphoric. Rather, there was a sense of sheer relief. US President Barack Obama, accompanied by wife Michelle and his daughters at the re-election party in Chicago . Relief that Romney’s worrying late surge had been repelled; relief that poll predictions of a Republican upset had proved ill-founded; and relief that the bitter, protracted struggle to spare their Messiah the ignominy of a one-term presidency was finally over. How very different it was, this muted Second Coming, from that November night four years ago, when I stood among 250,000 Americans of every colour, creed and age to watch the nation’s first black president take his place in history. Then, Obama’s nebulous promises of ‘hope and change’ were alone enough to kindle a great outpouring of joy and goodwill that bridged all divisions, but this time round the spontaneity was gone, and the celebrations seemed too triumphal, given the parlous state of the nation; and too schmaltzy and slickly choreographed. For those millions who watched it all on TV, I am told, the victory rally at the McCormick Center – a vast, soulless and windowless steel-and-glass exhibition hall built for trade fairs – looked impressive enough. U.S. President Barack Obama gestures with Vice President Joe Biden after his election night victory speech in Chicago . The left-leaning stars turned out for Obama as usual (a veritable array including Stevie Wonder and the ubiquitous will.i.am); the backdrop of shimmering, red and blue satin curtains was suitably dramatic, and the jukebox selections – from Michael Jackson’s I Want You Back to Neil Sedaka’s Oh What a Night – were a thematic masterstroke. Behind the scenes, however, rather like the US economy, it was all rather shambolic. Only the A-listers had seats; the hoi-poloi were forced to stand for hours without refreshments on a bare linoleum floor as they waited for the so-called people’s president to address them. The acoustics were so awful that you could barely make out what Obama was saying at the back of the hall, and with the world’s press trying to relay their stories, the internet – a tool the Democrats have used to devastating effect – went on the blink. ‘How can he hope to fix the economy when he can’t fix the freaking wi-fi,’ quipped one frustrated American reporter standing near me. Obama's disciples were relieved rather than euphoric after his re-election was confirmed . Supporters cheer at President Obama's election night party where the hoi-poloi were forced to stand for hours without refreshments . How indeed? Since there wasn’t any sound to accompany the news bulletins flickering on six giant screens either, it meant that people watching the night unfold from their armchair had a far better idea what was going on than those of us corralled in the darkened hall. Below us, the Democratic Party throngs were similarly unenlightened, some nervously failing to grasp that – though the electoral college vote showed Romney ahead until 10pm [3am British time] – the projected results meant an Obama victory was then all but assured. History will record that the result was first declared by MSNBC. By my watch it was 10.15pm, [3.15am in Britain] and the hall erupted. ‘Four more years! Four more years!’ the crowd chanted, whooping and waving their little flags. For them it was a cry of deliverance, but for almost half of this divided nation it must have sounded as though they were handing down a sentence. Obama, who was so unsure of the outcome that he had prepared two speeches, one for victory, the other for defeat, expressed his relief – and thanks – by way of a Twitter message. ‘Great headline,’ someone behind me chimed. ‘Victory is tweet!’ Another reporter preferred the more caustic: ‘Obama Bailed Out.’ Left-leaning stars including musician will.i.am turned out at Obama's re-election party . Romney conceded at 11.52pm [4.52am in Britain], and a few minutes later he was making his concession speech, the graciousness of which contrasted sharply with the mocking catcalls and whistles from Obama’s watching supporters. For some unfathomable reason, they were made to suffer for a further 44 minutes – like fans at a rock concert awaiting the top-billing act – before the Messiah and his family finally took to the stage. Four years ago, he had promised to bring a new spirit of unity to America. It was a measure of his failure to achieve that pledge that his tone was conciliatory, almost chastened. He spoke of ‘ending the gridlock’, ‘building consensus’ and making ‘difficult compromises’. His speech, though sprinkled with the usual patriotic and sentimental homilies, was measured and cautionary: worlds apart from the ‘Change Has Come’ mantra that electrified us on that warm night in Grant Park. Only the A-listers, including Josh Hartnett, left, and Justin Long, right, were given seats at the Chicago event . Four years ago, as I walked back to my hotel, awe-stricken, I gladly accepted the hugs of strangers and even stopped to purchase an Obama T-shirt from a street hawker. Yesterday the souvenirs were on offer again – trademarked and only available from official vendors (‘pet apparel’ was going for $10, and golf accessories cost $5). This time my wallet stayed firmly in my pocket. Yet though Obama has proved to be all too mortal, we shouldn’t forget how far he has come – nor how his narrative has inspired millions of less fortunate Americans, not least the black children of Chicago’s appallingly blighted South Side, a few miles from the scene of his latest triumph. For them, he remains a symbol of the dreams that can still be achieved in this great but troubled country. Tomorrow he must strive anew to live up them.","The re-election party is over and it's back to business for Barack Obama .

"Police in the West Midlands have revealed their latest crack team of recruits, brought in to deal with the ever-growing threat of drugs and explosive devices. The new crew - an adorable brood of puppies - will be trained to bring down some of Britain's toughest criminals by sniffing out danger ahead of officers. The seven-week-old Springer-Cocker Spaniel cross puppies, known as Sprockers, are the first to be born into the West Midlands Police's dog breeding programme, based in Balsall Common, Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Crack team: The six cute puppies will be trained as sniffer dogs, helping police to foil some of Britain's most feared criminals . The three boys and three girls were born into the force's 'T-litter' on August 19 and are named Trev, Ted, Tyler, Topsey, Trotter and Turvey. Officers are now looking for members of the public to adopt them until they are 12 months old. After a year they will then be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs - hunting out explosives and drugs. Yesterday, Dave Raymond, breed scheme manager at the force's dog unit, said: 'All the pups are doing really well - they're healthy and Olympia is a fantastic first-time mum. 'What we're trying to achieve in breeding Sprockers is to bring out certain temperaments in each of the breeds. New recruit: The puppy is one of six Springer-Cocker Spaniel cross pups, known as Sprockers, that will be trained by West Midlands Police . Adorable: Police are looking for members of the public to adopt them until they are 12 months old . 'Our Springer Spaniels tend to be a little bit gamey, meaning they like to chase birds, but the Cockers can be quite responsive so we're hoping we can create the ideal search dogs by combining the two. 'We've had Sprockers donated to us before and the ones we've got work very well and have a great nose on them.' Puppy walkers are said to be vital to the training school as they help orientate the dogs for the next 12 months allowing them to experience living in a home, socialising with people and other animals. Criminals beware: The puppies, three girls and three boys, were born on August 19 in Birmingham . Training: When they are one year old they will be trained for eight weeks to become specialist search dogs or sniffer dogs . Mr Raymond added: 'After their time with the puppy walkers, they'll go on an eight-week course to develop their search instincts. 'They'll complete searches in buildings, streets, open spaces and vehicles with a view to becoming either a drugs sniffer dog or specialist search dog, depending on what they show an aptitude for. 'But for now, it's important they're just allowed to be pups and have fun developing in a happy environment, without any fears. Just born: The six cute puppies feed from their mother shortly after their birth . New colleagues: West Midlands Police officers proudly show off their latest canine recruits . 'Anyone over 18, who would normally be at home during the day to look after the pups can apply. 'We're also looking for puppy walkers as we're quite low on numbers at the moment and could really do with some more volunteers.' Anybody interested in adopting one of the puppies can get in touch by tweeting West Midlands Police or emailing breedscheme@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk.","West Midlands Police proudly reveal their latest canine recruits .

"A seven-year-old boy has been left with permanent sight damage after a freak loom band accident. Kyle Lawrence’s brother accidentally flicked one of the popular bands into his eye while they were making a bracelet, leading to him developing a cataract. His family, who had been hoping doctors would be able to restore Kyle's sight, have now been given the devastating news the damage to his eye is permanent. Scroll down for video . Hospital treatment: Kyle Lawrence, of Cleethorpes, whose left eye was injured by a loom band bracelet . Specialists at Sheffield’s Children’s Hospital have said the youngster has lasting muscle damage to his left eye. It has clouding on the lens that causes his pupil to look consistently dilated and all he can see is shadows. Now Kyle, of Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, has been forbidden from participating in any ball games - in case he suffers any further injury. His mother Carlie said: 'Once he had different tests, we were told that he couldn’t have an operation. 'We had been told that they would be able to do something with his cataract and that he’d have full sight but it turns out the damage is permanent.' The mother-of-six is now warning other parents of the dangers posed by loom bands - and says they should carry a safety warning. Kyle's accident happened as he and his brothers and sisters sat using . loom bands with their mother at the family home in Cleethorpes, . Lincolnshire, at the end of May. Injuries: The incident caused a blood clot - . leaving Kyle completely blind in his left eye. His family had hoped he could undergo restorative surgery, but doctors say there is permanent damage to the eye muscle . Damage: Kyle's left eye has clouding on the lens that causes his pupil to look consistently dilated and all he can see is shadows . They were making rainbow loom sandals, which feature a band around the ankle with a strap which hooks around a toe. One . of the bands needed stretching to fit but as his eldest brother pulled . it, it slipped from his fingers and hit Kyle in the eye. Mrs Lawrence, 32, said: ‘He was screaming in pain and I have never heard . him scream before. He started being violently sick. ‘I couldn’t go near Kyle after it happened, my husband had to deal with it. I was so scared. ‘My husband told me to call an ambulance and we had to take Kyle out of the room to try and calm him down.’ Kyle was taken to accident and emergency, where he was examined before being sent home the same night with eye drops. But . after he continued being sick throughout the night his mother took him . back to hospital the next day. An eye expert said he should not have . been sent home and admitted Kyle to hospital for six days, after which . he needed a further week’s bed rest. Craze: Loom bands can be shaped into different objects, like this ball. Despite their popularity, they have been linked with cancer, choking and circulation problems . A doctor . has used a Facebook group to warn parents over the dangers of the . playground craze, in which tiny bands are woven together, either using . fingers or a special plastic loom, to make friendship bracelets. The . GP, from Bristol, posted a picture of a boy who had wound bands so . tightly around two of his fingers before falling asleep that they had . turned blue from lack of blood circulation. Other experts have warned the bands could be a choking hazard for younger children. And last month, the UK's biggest independent toy company removed all loom band charms from its stores after tests found they contained cancerous chemicals. The Entertainer took the measure as it launches a full investigation into the research that detected phthalates in the rubber accessories that are sold with the bracelets. The chemical is used to make plastics more safe and pliable but it is also a known carcinogen and its use is strictly controlled - particularly in toys that could go in the mouth. Now, four months on, the family has been told to return to hospital in eight weeks to see if there has been any change or improvement. Mrs Lawrence said: 'We have no idea what the impact will be on him at school and into the future. 'Kyle finds it hard to focus on . things that are far away and when you are walking with him you need to . hold his hand, otherwise he may walk into a lamp post.' She . added she is frustrated at the length of time it has take for Kyle to . be seen by specialists and says the family will look into private . treatment if necessary. Her husband and Kyle's father Trevor, 37, said: 'We feel it’s been left too long. I can’t help thinking if they had told us sooner, he might have had more of a chance because his eye has got worse as time has gone on. 'It’s going to affect his future, he won’t be able to drive now and he can’t go out to play a game of football with his friends.' In the meantime, Kyle has to continue to adjust to his new life with one eye and has been set a care plan at school. He said: 'I do get upset that I cannot play football at school  - all I can see is lots of blurry stuff.' Mrs Lawrence, a carer, said of the loom bands: ‘I will never have them in the house again. ‘I . emailed the company about changing the labelling to warn people but . they haven’t got back to me. There should be a warning on the packet – . children shouldn’t be doing the stretching. It’s terrible that this has . happened. I’ve had other parents come forward and say that something . similar has happened, but not as bad.’ The loom band craze has been fuelled by their popularity among celebrities – and even royalty. The . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been photographed wearing friendship . bracelets and they have also been spotted on the arms of David Beckham, . presenter Fearne Cotton, Miley Cyrus and One Direction’s Harry Styles. Loom . bands are already the eighth best-selling toy of all time on Amazon. Many parents approve of them as they are more affordable than hi-tech . toys – while a new computer game can cost £40, 1,800 loom bands can be . bought for less than £2.50.

"A rare car that was the first to top 100mph in the UK and bought second-hand for just £115 is now expected to sell for up to £180,000 at auction. Murray Ferguson, 83, was shocked when he found out the 1920 Vauxhall E-type 30-98 which his brother Ian bought in June 1952 was so valuable. There are only around 30 of the early sidevalve 30-98s known to have survived and the car is one of only two with its type of coachwork, made by Grosvenor Carriage Co.Ltd, of Kilburn, London. Classic: The 1920 Vauxhall E-type 30-98 is set to make Murray Ferguson a huge profit when it sells . Mr Ferguson's 30-98 is now set to fetch between £150,000 and £180,000 at a Bonhams auction at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hampshire, on September 6. Mr Ferguson, who is a retired farmer, said: 'My brother died a few years ago now, but I bought the car from him for a couple of hundred pounds long before that, in 1962. The Vauxhall 30-98, one of the greatest sports cars of the twentieth century was the first in the UK to top 100mph in production form. Fitted with a 4,525cc side-valve four-cylinder engine, producing 90bhp, this Vauxhall was made in two basic types, E-type and the more powerful OE-type, built between 1923 and 1927. The Autocar magazine went on to say: ‘Few cars have such graceful lines yet suggest unlimited strength allied to speed… and very, very few can take a corner stiffly with absolute certainty as this one can.’ Source: www.vauxhall.co.uk . 'He got it running pretty well, and I did a bit of restoration, but it is all completely original and kept just as it was. 'I put it up for sale because I thought why not? It's not quite equipped for busy modern roads as much as it used to be. 'I was surprised to hear it was worth so much. It's a great car, a very rare one, which brought me and my brother a lot of happiness."" A spokesman for Auctioneer Bonhams said: 'Although the complete history of this car is not known, it was first registered in Westmorland and it is believed that in its early days it was owned by the Lings family of Bollington, Cheshire.' Around 1930, it was passed to a Mr Jeffreys and served the King and Country in World War Two, being used for service with the Home Guard in its native north country. In 1952, it was bought by Ian Ferguson for £115 from a small garage in Manchester. Since then, it has scarcely travelled outside of Happisburgh, Norfolk, where Murray Ferguson lives.

"The future of the region's biggest and best-preserved Roman site has been thrown into doubt. Binchester Roman Town in County Durham, has been put up for sale by the Church Commissioners and archaeologists fear the historic site could fall into the hands of developers. The Roman settlement was dubbed 'the Pompeii of the North' in July after archaeologists unearthed some of the most exciting historical finds in living memory. Scroll down for video . Gem: The site in county Durham was described as 'the Pompeii of the North' when it was discovered . Rubbish thrown away by the Romans 2,000 years ago had the same effect as the ash of Vesuvius, preserving the world's most intact bath house outside Italy. Excavations at Binchester, near Bishop Auckland, unearthed artefacts including one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring. An inscribed altar dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer, was also discovered. But now the land where the settlement has stood for around 1,800 years is being sold off as part of 10 plots around Bishop Auckland, including two which cover the Binchester site. Offer in: Chris Ferguson, head curator at Auckland Castle, who have met the asking price for the fort, yet are awaiting a response . Discovery: Buried . on the site of a Roman fort in County Durham, archaeologists have made a . series of well-preserved and extraordinary finds. The discoveries date . back 1,800 years and include one of the earliest pieces of evidence for . Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring (pictured) The Auckland Castle Trust, financed by London philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer, has made a £2m bid for the plots. Although . the Roman settlement itself could not be developed, an old hall on one . of the plots could be, affecting access to the site. Selling the plots . off separately could also hamper archaeologists' work, it is feared. The . Trust's head curator, Dr Christopher Ferguson, said Binchester Hall is . one of the plots for sale and has outline planning permission to be . developed into housing or a hotel. If . the land is commercially developed there will be no public access to . the fort,' he said. 'The fort will have to close to the public at least. The many finds at the site include this small carnelian intaglio, which is thought to have been worn as jewellery . The finds, including this bronze bangle, give an insight into the jewellery worn by early Roman settlers to Britain . The Church Commission has defended the sale, saying no work could be carried out on the 'protected' site and public access would have to be maintained. 'This is the largest Roman town in the north, but it is also the least excavated and understood. 'The archaeological excavations currently undertaken by Durham University are also in jeopardy and this sale could knock back their work for generations. 'The bath house is unparalleled in Roman Britain and its future survival if the site is sold to the wrong buyer would be thrown into question.' A church spokesperson said: 'We are disappointed that such an excellent body as the Auckland Castle Trust do not recognise the statutory protections in operation for Binchester Fort. 'Binchester Roman Fort is a scheduled ancient monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. 'As such there are strict statutory protections for the Fort which make it a criminal offence to carry out any works which would demolish, damage, remove, repair, add or alter the monument without permission from the Secretary of State. For sale: Archaeologists are worried as to what the future holds for Binchester Roman Town . Educate yourself: Durham University use the site for excavations . 'In addition Durham County Council retains a Deed of Guardianship for the site which ensures public access. 'These statutory protections will continue to apply to any prospective purchaser of the land. 'Since announcing the sale the Commissioners have received a number of expressions of interest from a number of parties, including from the existing tenants, for single and multiple lots. 'The process for the sale of the Bishop Auckland Estate is transparent and leaves no room for undue influence by any interested party. All offers will be considered without prejudice or preference. 'All parties have been advised that any offers will not be considered until next month.' The Trust is urging members of the public to contact the Church Commissioners expressing their concerns.

"If there's one thing to send a shiver down the spine of a celebrity it's the unveiling of a before-they-were-famous video. The saying goes that everyone has to start somewhere, yet many A-listers would prefer to forget those few early steps on the way to stardom. And in this compilation video, we are treated to soap and showering, cheesy grins outside fast-food restaurants, and Morgan Freeman enjoying his Long and Black (cigarette). Scroll down for video . Sharp: Brad Pitt is full of the joys in his 1980s ad for Pringles . Brad Pitt, actor and director, had 'the fever' back in the 80s when he advertised Pringles, strutting his stuff shirtless. It is a far cry from the tough guy he portrayed in Fight Club, that's for certain. The montage of stars of the screen also includes Bryan Cranston, star of AMC's hit drama Breaking Bad. In that show, Cranston plays a less-than-clean-living Walter White, who becomes Mr Big in the world of drug production and dealing. Yet in this clip from around 1987, Cranston is clean as a whistle after advertising Shield soap, which we are told 'leaves you clean and fresh all day long.' The advert ends with a female telling a cleaned-down Cranston he is a 'changed man' - very different from his latest TV portrayal in Breaking Bad. Not to be outdone, Cranston's Breaking Bad co-star Aaron Paul's drug in his 1999 commercial is the cereal Pops. In a haze, Paul tells us that 'all he wants to do is eat', before his screen father caves in and hands over the box to.

Fast food: Michael J Fox's first date went well as he treated his on-screen flame to a McDonalds for dinner . It's always a struggle to get children to eat their greens, yet Elijah Wood showed how it's done when he starred in an 1990 advert for cheddar cheese. A plate consisting of greens is transformed, perhaps a bit too dramatically, by a deluge of melted cheddar cheese, with Wood finishing by saying 'hooray'. Keanu Reeves got his crunch back in 1987 when he advertised Kellogg's cornflakes. The 49-year-old star of the trilogy of films The Matrix sits at a desk tucking into corn flakes, before recoiling back in ecstasy. In one of the more humorous clips, actor Seth Green tells us all about 'this dream he had' where he changed into the 'guy from the fruit loops box, Toucan Sam in a clip from the early 1990s. But the jokes on him, as it is actually his co-star on the advert, and also an actor today Giovani Ribisi who is 'the toucan' as he rips off his fake human face to reveal a beak. Perhaps not surprising, the fast-food industry was keen to use child actors to publicise their offerings. Suck it up: Morgan Freeman chills back as he enjoys a 'Long & Black' cigarette . Sarah Michelle Gellar is pictured outside a Burger King expressing her love for the fast food chain back in 1981, and we also see Ben Affleck saying that 'you've gotta break the rules' as he too gives in to the BK charm in an ad from 1989. Meg Ryan tells us all about the 'aren't you hungry for a Whopper game' also in publicity for the chain from 1982. Rivals McDonalds get in on the act with Michael J Fox perched on doorstep with a girl back in 1980, who 'thanks' him for dinner after giving him a peck on the cheek, as 'nobody makes a day like McDonalds can.'

"Former footballer turned property guru Gary Neville is set to re-develop an iconic police station in Manchester. Neville and ex-team-mate Ryan Giggs have formed a consortium to build offices, bars, restaurants and a four or five-star hotel around the historic Bootle Street station, off Deansgate, in partnership with the council. Bootle Street itself is being bought up by the town hall for more than £2m as the final piece in the jigsaw - so that detailed plans for the multimillion pound regeneration of the area can be drawn up, including the re-development of the Manchester Reform Synagogue and vacant Sir Ralph Abercombie pub. Outside the bubble: Gary Neville, left, and Ryan Giggs have taken on a new development in Manchester . New owner: Neville has in included Bootle Street Station in his property developments in Manchester . It is the latest in a series of major property ventures by former United defender Neville, who is currently building Hotel Football in partnership with Giggs at Old Trafford. That is due to open later this year. But this could be his biggest project yet - a redevelopment said to be worth £140m. His consortium, the Jacksons Row Development Company, has already bought - or is in the final stages of buying - the other various parts of the 300sq ft parcel of land between Albert Square and Deansgate, including the synagogue on Jackson's Row. Following the end of his playing career, Neville agreed a deal to sign for Sky Sports as a pundit ahead of the 2012/13 season. On May 14, 2012, Neville was appointed to the coaching team by England boss Roy Hodgson. Is part of a group of five ex-Manchester United players, brother Phil, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, who run Salford City FC. They play in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier First Division North. In 2010, Neville announced plans to develop an 'eco-home', but was forced to abandon plans due to 'neighbour unrest' in 2012. Is now pressing on with plans, along with Giggs and Jacksons Row Development Company, to redevelop areas of Deansgate, Manchester. It already has a major luxury hotel operator on board. But the station was the one remaining element of the package and until now was in the hands of Greater Manchester Police. The council has been in purchase negotiations with the police commissioner for months and has now agreed a deal, meaning the whole project can start. The station had been the city's policing HQ for 80 years when it closed earlier this month as part of plans to save money. We revealed in 2010 how the building, once described by former chief constable Michael Todd as 'far better suited as a set for Life on Mars', was due to be axed. Earlier this summer officers finally moved out and into the town hall, where they now have a 24-hour policing post. Currently it is unclear which of the existing buildings on the Jackson's Row site would remain - although Bootle Street's facade may remain even if the main part of the station is demolished. Further details of the development are expected in the autumn. A spokesman for the consortium said: 'This is an exciting regeneration opportunity in a significant location which we believe will add to the vibrancy of Manchester city centre.'

"If someone suggested you spent a well-earned holiday in a garden shed, you'd perhaps politely decline. But now more and more people are opting to spend their precious time off in £2,000 a week luxury 'boltholes' - which are strikingly similar to the humble garden shed. Hundreds of the boltholes have been built in some of the country's most rural areas to cater for the rise in people staying in the UK for their holidays - known as 'staycationers'.

'People are tripping over themselves to book them. 'These romantic boltholes come from the most unlikely of beginnings, from run-down sheds to old beach huts. 'They are turned into luxury hideaways and they are proving a real hit because they offer couples privacy, seclusion, luxury and romance in unique settings.' What started out as a showroom for her interior design company ended up becoming a real money maker for mother-of-two Kerrie Griffin-Rogers. She spent just £10,000 turning a roofless, disused garage at her house in Shropshire into a £3,200 a month retreat. The 46-year-old had found herself struggling to pay the bills and her large mortgage. Idyll: Mrs Griffin-Rogers outside her renovated bolthole in Shropshire - which earns her £3,200 a month . But now the income from the renovated garage, called Turtledove Hideaway in Shropshire, pays the £300,000 mortgage on her 136-acre estate - and more. Speaking outside the bolthole, Mrs Griffin-Rogers said: 'I was using the garage to store products for my interior design company but it didn’t have a roof and birds were making a mess in there. 'I decided to renovate the garage and use it to show off my products. 'I did most of the work myself and didn’t skimp on anything - it is all the best you can get. Neutral decor: Inside the luxurious holiday let - which cost £10,000 to transform . 'The house was featured in a few magazines and they suggested I looked into letting it out through Unique Home Stays. 'It went onto their site in the middle of May and the first booking came in five days later. 'Bookings have been coming in thick and fast since then. 'Each month I’m getting about £3,200 just from letting out the hideaway which is double my mortgage.' It cost Adam Wooler just £6,500 to buy a ramshackle timber shed perched on the top of a 300ft cliff overlooking Whitsand Bay in Cornwall. Adam bought the derelict shack while at university 25 years ago, and it remained unused for long after. But now he and wife Katherine have invested £100,000 into turning it into a luxury, cosy bolthole that has a kitchen, lounge, bedroom, shower room and sun terrace. Before: The Edge stood as a ramshackle blue shed for 25 years before its transformation . The chalet, called The Edge, is booked up until the end of summer and costs up to £1,500 to hire for a week, pictured in its current glory below. Mr Wooler, 47, who runs a marine services business, said: 'I worked as a lifeguard on the beach below and bought the leasehold for the chalet for £6,500. 'I just bought it to live in it while I was at Plymouth University. 'It was nothing more than an wooden shack on a cliff with one room and an outside loo. It was three metres by two metres and nothing more than a shed. Out to sea: The property looks completely different after its £100,000 renovation . 'I lived in it for 18 months and nearly got blown away with it a few times. 'I left it as it was for 25 years and couldn’t really afford to do anything with it. 'It has only been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning permission in place that we could really do something with it. 'We are delighted with how it has turned out and has been designed to make the most of the views. It is really romantic getaway. 'People are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish.' Former TV producer Jan Bright, right, spent £150,000 doing up three decrepit 600-year-old barns on her Cornish farm - and now rakes in £81,000 a year in revenue. Mrs Bright, 61, was among the first to list a property with Unique Home Stays after buying the 2.5 acre Grade II listed Drym Farm near St Ives in 2002. Her three renovated eco-homes - Quillet Cottage, the Apple Store and Lofty - all pictured after and before renovation below, cost up to £900 a week to rent. She is now planning the renovation of two more barns on the site which would take her income from the lettings to £135,000. Mrs Bright said: 'I bought the farm with the pure intention to renovate the barns. 'They were beautiful stone buildings but they were totally derelict. Transformed: Jan Bright's collection of three outbuildings on her Cornish farm that are popular with couples . Before: The outbuildings, pictured before work began, were once dilapidated and unused . 'I was adamant I wanted them to retain their rustic charm and still look like 600-year-old barns. 'It took a lot of work, made harder because the buildings are listed, but it was worth every second.

"This year's mass emergence of mayflies in the Mississippi Valley was one for the record books. The annual swarm rose above La Crosse, Wisconsin from the river on Sunday evening in a dark cloud so dense it caused a three-car roadway collision, blacked out the sun and even lit up area weather radar. The nuisance occurrence always causes headaches but experts say this year's swarm was bigger than normal, though like every year the insects die off just as quickly as they emerge. Scroll down for video . Living blanket: This year's mayfly emergence in the Mississippi Valley focused near La Crosse, Wisconsin was bigger than usual -- but as always became a stomach-turning nuisance . Atmospheric anomaly: The swarm was so thick and dense it appeared much like a rain storm on weather radar . And according to experts, the sizable swarm is a positive sign for water quality and after the many millions of bugs mate and die off within a day or two they'll become a long-awaited feast for famished fish. While millions of protein and fat-filled bugs dying off is great news for fish--and, later, fishermen--the news is not so good for drivers. In addition to the swarm briefly darkening out the sun this year, the less fortunate mayflies that find themselves smashed on the road become a thick, oily sludge that can and does lead to car accidents. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that a Wisconsin road became so slick from the mayflies Sunday evening it caused at least one of the drivers involved in a three-car crash to lose control of her vehicle. They also noted the limited visibility at the time of the crash. Two people were injured in the crash, but only one person was taken to a local hospital. The problem has been so serious in the past that authorities have had to dump sand onto roadways and bridges to improve traction, much like salt and sand are used in the snowy months. One of the most striking things about this year's Mississippi emergence was its marked radar echo. Like a freak rainstorm in reverse, the emergence began to show up as a raucous blue and green around La Crosse at about 8:45 on Sunday. The mayflies quickly moved along with a northerly wind up the Mississippi and appeared on radar screens just as a light-moderate rainfall might, according to NOAA. Over the course of around three hours, the radar faded as the mayflies spread out. By midnight, they were all but gone. And by no later than Tuesday, they were all dead, having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year's hatch. Left . behind, of course, are their millions of gossamer bodies, piled in . heaps along the riverbank, in parking lots and on porches and all over . businesses and homes. Dangerous? This year's emergence of the little bugs took place Sunday evening and quickly enveloped the Mississippi River town, even causing car accidents . Gross: The nuisance bugs cover just about everything once they emerge and nearby residents are warned to cover their mouths and noses . Slick conditions: A car accident involving three vehicles was reported this year after the protein and fat-rich bugs created a greasy mush on the road. No serious injuries were reported, however . Authorities are sometimes forced to use sand on the roads, much as they do during the snowy months, to prevent accidents caused by the greasy bug slicks . Messy: The bugs are a blessing for hungry wildlife but a curse for home and business owners who have to deal with the aftermath . Over the course of around three hours, the radar faded as the mayflies spread out. By midnight, they were all but gone. And by no later than Tuesday, they were all dead, having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year's hatch. Left behind, of course, are their millions of gossamer bodies, piled in heaps along the riverbank, in parking lots and on porches and all over businesses and homes. The mayfly (Ephemera) looks innocent enough...when there's just one . While the bugs are large and can be a nuisance, people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed. Mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species, including a wide variety of fish and birds. They’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair. However, they do not bite humans. The mayfly population goes through cycles, said Don Schloesser, a researcher at the Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Some years they come earlier than others. This year along the Mississippi the emergence came later than usual, possibly due to earlier flooding. Mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying. But the life cycle actually lasts two years. Mayflies begin as eggs on the water’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake. The larvae hatch and burrow into the mud. Later, they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water. Die-off: The bugs die off and pile up in clumps after just a day or so, creating heaps of insect carcasses to clean up . It's a good thing? The mayflies are annoying but indicate a healthy waterway. They also make the environment even more vibrant by feeding hungry fish .","The mayflies were concentrated near La Crosse, Wisconsin, often a focal point for annual swarms .

"Applying liquid eyeliner is a notoriously tricky skill that only the most die-hard fantatics seem to have acquired. But a new product from Benefit promises to make a freehand straight line quite literally fool-proof. The They're Real! Push-Up Liner boasts an italicized wand, the tip of which hugs the lash line, keeping the user on track. The design is patent-pending and claims to make application 'beyond easy.' Scroll down for video . Fool-proof? Benefit's They're Real! Push-Up Liner boasts an italicized wand, the tip of which is designed to hug the lash line, keeping the user on track . And the hype is already in effect. Though the $24 (£18.50) liner doesn't hit stores until June 27, Benefit says it already has a 35,000-strong wait list. Already a liquid eyeliner fan, I usually do a series of small dashes from inner eye to outer eye to achieve an even line, mistakes concealed by a lick of smudgy kohl on top. But could Benefit help me get that perfect 1950s flick? I decided to test it under three of my most typical make-up application conditions: in front of a well-lit mirror at home; using a tiny compact mirror at my desk; and in a moving vehicle en-route to an event. First attempt: The eyeliner tip stayed close to the lash roots, making for a neat-ish line . AT HOME WITH A WELL-LIT MIRROR . This first test scenario allowed me to get to grips with the novel tip shape and eyeliner texture. Instead of a liquid, like most products on the market, it is more of a paste, dispensed by a single twist of the base. I pointed the rubber tip at my lashline, and sure enough, it stayed in place, making for a neat-ish line in a sharp, matte black. Impressive. I then dabbed the tip into the lash line to fill in spaces where the ink wasn't quite close enough to the roots. AT WORK WITH A HAND MIRROR . Next up was using a hand mirror at my desk - I'm often applying make-up in a rush pre-meeting. This time, confidence boosted, I attempted a flick. Using the wand like a Sharpie, I drew a triangle shape at the outer edge, then dragged the tip along the lashline as usual, filling in the space between the two at the end. This attempt was still a little shaky - eyelids not being completely even canvases - but it was easier than the first. I guess practice makes perfect, even with a fool-proof liner. Second attempt: This time a Fifties-style flick was attempted. It was relatively easy, even using a tiny hand mirror, but practice makes perfect, even with a fool-proof liner . Do not attempt on cobblestones: Applying eyeliner in the back of a taxi is a risky business . IN THE BACK OF A MOVING TAXI . I was dreading applying eyeliner in a moving vehicle. As my taxi pulled away down a cobbled street, I wondered if this would end in serious injury. On a smooth road, however, it seemed more feasible - despite the low light. A single, freehand line was not possible with the jerky stop-start movements of the car, so I resorted to my tried and true technique of dashes, and ended up with a just-about-acceptable result. THE PROS: The eyeliner DOES hug the lashline, making a straight line easier to achieve. It has a lovely inky, matte finish (some eyeliners can be a bit chalky), and it truly doesn't budge once it's on. THE CONS: It doesn't budge. I looked like a raccoon when I tried to take it off. An oil-based make-up remover seemed to do the trick. A couple of colleagues who also tried the liner weren't comfortable with the italicized tip or paste-like texture, preferring their traditional liquid liners instead. THE EXPERT'S VERDICT: Celebrity make-up artist Rachel Wood, whose clients include Mariah Carey and Louise Roe, was immediately impressed by the They're Real! Push-Up Liner. 'This is great, because it's like a Sharpie for your eye,' she said. 'This felt tip pen has a nice angled sharp edge. And it stays really nice and black. 'Once it's dry, it really doesn't move,' she added. 'It's a really fantastic product.' Benefit They're Real! Push-Up Liner goes on sale on June 27th in the U.S. and June 28th in the UK. The Benefit boutique in Carnaby Street, London, will be stocking it early, from Thursday 26th June.","The They're Real!

"Frozen merchandise continues to dominate the wish lists of young children, and industry experts have predicted that it will remain hot through the holidays. Two toys based on the wildly popular Disney film appear on Adventure Publishing Group’s Toy Insider Hot 20 list, which was released yesterday. In fact, Frozen is the only entertainment property with more than one item on the list. 'It’s going to be a Frozen Christmas, ice cold,' said Laurie Schacht, president of Adventure Publishing, to Bloomberg News. Hot seller: Snow Glow Elsa was one of two Frozen-inspired items to appear on Adventure Publishing Group’s Toy Insider Hot 20 list, which predicts what will top children's holiday wish lists . 'The appeal is so broad, and it’s such a wonderful story that parents are happy to put merchandise like this in their kids’ hands. 'Disney is on the pulse of the American heartbeat these days,' she added. One of the items on Toy Insider's list is the  Snow Glow Elsa doll, which features a dress that lights up. The doll, which retails for $39.97 at Wal-Mart and at $34.99 at Toys R Us, also plays Let It Go, the hit song from the movie. Let it go: The Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox, a small karaoke machine that features the film's soundtrack, also made the list . Fit for a queen: Elsa, the animated film's heroine, has remained a hit with children since Frozen's release in November 2013 . The other Frozen item on the list is the Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox, a small karaoke machine that features the film's soundtrack and costs about $35. It's not only small children who are snapping up Frozen-themed products. Disney Consumer Products and bridal designer Alfred Angelo just announced plans to release a wedding dress inspired by the movie's heroine, Elsa, the Snow Queen of Arendelle, this January. Since its release in November 2013, Frozen has become the highest-grossing animated film ever. Last week, Disney announced that it had started construction on a Frozen attraction, which will replace the Maelstrom at Epcot's Norway Pavilion, at The Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.","Despite having been released nearly a year ago, Frozen remains a top draw for kids ."
"A survey published last week revealed that women who breastfeed their children beyond the age of 12 months are often made to feel 'uncomfortable' about their decision. The research, published in Maternal & Child Nutrition, revealed extended breastfeeding wasn't seen as 'normal' and less than one per cent of UK mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding a six-month-old. However, in other countries around the world, breastfeeding is commonplace well into a child's time as a toddler. Scroll down for video . Close bond: Mother-of-two Jessica Daniels said she and her daughters have benefited from breastfeeding . In Canada, the government have run campaigns actively encouraging women to carry on breastfeeding with the slogan 'breastfeeding is not just for newborns'. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation recommend mothers carry on breastfeeding until a child is two and beyond (alongside introducing them to other foods). They state: 'Breast milk is an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged six to 23 months. It can provide half or more of a child's energy needs between the ages of six and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months.' The health benefits of breastfeeding include protecting a child from serious illness and setting them up for a bright future - research has shown that children and adolescents that have been breastfed perform better in intelligence tests. British mother, Jessica Daniels, has found extended breastfeeding extremely beneficial for both her and her two daughters. The 24-year-old from Wigan breastfed her first daughter until she was aged three-and-a-half and is still breastfeeding her second daughter at 14 months. She told MailOnline: 'I feel my children have benefited greatly from breastfeeding and from extended breastfeeding. Jessica's eldest daughter breastfed till she was three-and-a-half . 'My first daughter is strongly attached to me and we have a great bond. It also helped with bonding with her sister as they used to feed together. She didn't feel pushed out either because of this.' She added that she takes comfort from the fact women who breastfeed are less likely to get breast and ovarian cancer, while it's often more convenient than bottle feeding. She said: 'People are a little surprised (that I carried on breastfeeding) but mostly because I ""must be exhausted"". Quite the opposite, I find breastfeeding to be the lazy person's choice.' Jane Hodges, 46, of Darlington, Co Durham, also breastfed her children until they were two. She said: 'Both were picky eaters and refused to drink water or cows milk so they were at least getting some nutrition from my breast milk. Also it was wonderful for the bonding side of things. I don't regret it at all.' Another advocate is Hannah Perkins, 30, who is still breastfeeding her son, Dexter, 23 months. She told MailOnline: 'I chose to continue breastfeeding for the many health benefits that it afforded both my son and myself. For example, reduced risks of diabetes, asthma, cancers, the list goes on. That was very important to me. 'But also breastfeeding has taught me to be a considerate and attached mother, it has taught me to listen to what my son wants and to be sensitive to his needs. As such I believe he is not ready to wean and won't force that upon him.' In the Maternal & Child Nutrition study, many women revealed that, at certain times, they had been made to feel ashamed for breastfeeding. Jessica said she was lucky to never experience any animosity when she was breastfeeding her toddlers in public. Jane agreed but she said her actions still attracted ""unsolicited advice"". She explains: 'People would say I was being indulgent and it was more about my needs than the kids. 'One friend even wagged her finger at my toddler while I was nursing her and said: ""you're a big girl now. You're too old for that"" which I found beyond irritating. 'After that, I got a little self-conscious breastfeeding in public once the kids got beyond about 18 months but refused to get pushed into stopping before my children were ready.' Hannah added: 'I can understand why it makes people a bit uncomfortable. It's not an every day sight in the UK and despite being very pro ""natural term breastfeeding"" I have often found it awkward and difficult to talk about with my peers. 'But the benefits my son and I both receive really do outweigh any negativity I've received. It's my personal choice and our personal journey and one that I would try to repeat if I have any other children.' Celebrities including Gwen Stefani and Salma Hayek are among those in the public eye who have continued to breastfeed their children beyond 12 months. But despite such high profile support and the multiple health benefits, some women feel unable to carry on breastfeeding. A campaign poster in Canada encouraged women to keep breastfeeding their toddlers . Dr Ruowei Li an epidemiologist at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, U.S. said women who want to breastfeed should be given more support. She led a study, published this month, which found those who were breastfed as babies were far less likely to have ear, sinus or throat infections later in childhood. She said the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for an infant's first six months, followed by continued breastfeeding until at least 12 months. But she added: 'Mothers need to be supported by health care professionals, their workplaces and communities to follow APP recommendations on breastfeeding.'

"Samantha Cameron dressed to impress as she attended Burberry's London Fashion Week show today. The Prime Minister's wife took her seat on the front row wearing a pretty red sleeveless dress. But as she watched the models strut down the catwalk showcasing the spring/summer collection from Christoper Bailey, she may have realised that her footwear wasn't quite on trend. Scroll down for video . Fashionista: Samantha Cameron on the front row of the Burberry show today sat next to Natalie Massenet and Caroline Rush . While the 43-year-old wore cream sandals with a medium-sized heel, all of the Burberry models on the runway wore flats. The models including Sam Rollinson, Suki Waterhouse, Jourdan Dunn and Charlotte Wiggins all wore their glamorous dresses with trainers or pumps. Also on the front row for the show at Kensington Gardens was model Cara Delevingne - who had got the style memo about casual footwear. She wore a revealing navy suit by Burberry with colourful chunky trainers. Footwear fail: The Prime Minister's wife looked stylish in a red dress - but wasn't on trend by wearing sandals with a heel . Wouldn't miss this show: Samantha, who is as an ambassador for the British Fashion Council, has long been a fan of Burberry designs . But Samantha could rest assured that she wasn't the only fashionistas not in on the flat shoe trend. Kate Moss also wore heeled sandals as she arrived with Cara and watched the stellar show from the front row. The lucky viewers with coveted tickets to the LFW must-see event were treated to a sumptuous selection of layered tulle dresses, cropped denim jackets and classic trenches inspired by the birds and the bees.

Insects of Britain was Bailey's point of reference and he translated this onto the catwalk via butterfly printed satin skirts, bags emblazoned with hand-drawn honey bees and his iconic trench reworked for SS15 in every colour in the rainbox from dragonfly blue to beetle green. Suki Waterhouse showed us how to do organza for spring as she and the other Burberry girls stomped the catwalk in the most beautiful layered tulle dresses in poppy rosehip, which were sometimes teamed with lilac suede cropped jackets.

"A Brazilian designer claims to have the perfect product to brighten up couples' time between the sheets. Aline Darc Piculo dos Santos, 22, has created touch sensitive lingerie that lights up when contact with it is made. The California-based Brazilian said her creation, called Toque, will help people 'connect during intimate moments.' Lighten up: Aline Darc Piculo dos Santos has designed underwear that lights up when touched to help people 'connect during intimate moments' She came up with the idea of putting micro sensors into bras and knickers that will illuminate when touched in the hope it will spice up people's love lives and make them spend more time on foreplay. Explaining her idea, which she said is based on personal experiences, Aline said: 'Sex is one of the most intimate situations and a lot of people are selfish and just want to orgasms, they do not care with their partner. Yet, sex is not just about that. It is about intimacy, closeness, interaction and connection. After all, you do not have sex with someone you do not have at least a connection with, right? 'Thinking about that, Toque was created with the purpose of connecting couples during intimate moments. Toque is a Portuguese word for touch. It is a lingerie with a micro sensor of touch that lights up when someone touches it.' Aline envisions her underwear in different fabrics such as satin, lace and Lycra. The Brazilian designer said her Toque collection would include micro sensors in the bras and knickers . While the concept is currently just that, Aline hopes her design could now become reality after she recently won an award for it. She won the 'fashion and accessories' category in LELO's Global UnDesign Awards, scooping a cash prize of $1000 (£615). The Swedish intimate lifestyle brand launched the competition to challenge global designers to 'tear off the shackles of convention and rethink the meaning of good design by encouraging genuine connections between people.' After receiving more than 500 entries from 55 countries, Aline's illuminating underwear idea was the most popular following a public vote. Accolade: The designer won an award for her idea and now wants to change the world through fashion . Aline said the accolade has strengthened her resolve to make fashion design her career - something she has been doing for the past four years by undertaking a university course. She said: 'Coming to the USA to study and winning a contest means having my work and efforts until now recognised and valued. It confirms that this is the career I am meant to be. 'I feel proud of myself because I never thought I would participate or even win a contest. This means I can change the world as I wanted when I started college.' Whether her Toque designs can change the world is debatable but failing that, Aline said she'll just be happy if her creations can change someone's life. 'I want my designs to make a difference in someone's life, to make it better,' she said.","Aline Darc Piculo dos Santos, 22, has created touch sensitive lingerie .

"A married couple born 32 years apart have proved that when it comes to love, age really is nothing but a number. Norma Harvey, 68, has been married to husband Chris, who is 36, for 15 years. The couple, who live in Brighton, met at a Butlins holiday camp when Chris was just 18 and Norma was 50. Scroll down for video . Generations apart: There are 32 years between Chris and his wife Norma . Recalling the night they met, Chris said: 'I've been out with plenty of girls my own age but I found them immature. I just wanted to date an older woman. 'I don't know where I got the courage to talk to her so I went up to her and asked her for a dance. She said her feet were too tired so I said I would give her a piggy back!' The pair have been inseparable since that night and married three years later. They reveal in Channel 5 documentary Age Gap Love that while their relationship has been a happy one, it has been difficult to gain acceptance from people. It's my life: Norma, 68, said she doesn't care what people think of her having a 36-year-old husband . When they tied the knot, none of Norma's family attended and only a handful of Chris' were there. Norma, who has been married before and has a daughter who is a few months younger than Chris, said: 'It was upsetting not having family guests at the wedding but there was nothing we could do about it.' She added that she doesn't care that some of her friends and family have never approved of her toy boy. She said of when they got together: 'I didn't bother about what people were saying. I didn't doubt it or think this is wrong because I enjoyed it. I thought why shouldn't I do this, it's my life.' Chris said he has no regrets about marrying Norma, even though he admits he was 'just a kid' when they met. But as well as disapproving friends and family, they have also had to deal with hostility from strangers because of their age difference. Stood the test of time: The couple have been married for 15 years . Chris said: 'We still get looked at a lot, we get looks in the street. You know when people have clocked you because you get that second glance. 'One guy spat at us because he saw us holding hands. Someone else told us in a restaurant we couldn't hold hands or kiss in front of his children, I nearly had a fight with him. There's definitely a stigma attached to an age gap relationship.' It's something that Michael, 64, has also had to deal with thanks to his marriage to Tanisha, who at 28, is 36 years his junior. They met in her home country of Sierra Leone when he was on a business trip for his job with the Medical Research Council. He said: 'At the time I wasn't hunting for a wife, I wasn't hunting for a 22 year old partner, it was fate and destiny.' 'I'm a lucky man': Michael, 64, has been married to Tanisha, 28, for four-and-a-half-years . The couple married four-and-a-half years ago and Michael has had to live with assumptions that she's a gold digger and he's her sugar daddy ever since. But he said he doesn't let what other people think get to him. 'That is what we look like - stupid old man who has got a lot of money and a beautiful lady taking him for what she can, in five years time she'll walk out when she's plucked him clean,' he said. But he added: 'I am very fortunate at the age of 64 to have a stunningly attractive wife.' Tanisha, who is trying to establish a career as a model, said she doesn't understand the intrigue into their relationship - in particular their sex life. 'We have sex like normal people,' she said. Facing stereotypes: Michael is often called a sugar daddy . Another couple who take criticism of their age gap relationship in their stride is Joe, 61, from Florida, in the U.S., who is married to Angela, 22. 'We have a lot of fun with it, especially when people think I'm her father,' Joe said. He was married previously and has a son who is two years older than his new wife. The couple met when they were working as actors on a soap opera and their on screen romance continued when the cameras stopped rolling.

"A mother who has overcome agoraphobia after shedding 5st 6lb has celebrated her new-found confidence by posing for pictures in her underwear. Diane Bryan, 49, from Sheffield, decided to show off her size 12 figure in a racy photo shoot for her husband, Stan. It's something she would never have dreamed of doing when she was a size 20. She was so ashamed of her figure then, she developed a fear of leaving the house. Scroll down for video . Body confident: Diane Bryan is happy to pose in her underwear now she's a size 12 . Gift: The mother-of-two posed for the racy shots for her husband to celebrate her 5st weightloss . Diane said: 'I used to be so embarrassed by my weight I wouldn't even let Stan see me getting undressed at night - I'd make him turn the lights off. But now I couldn't be happier with my figure.' The mother-of-two gained weight after she moved from her hometown of Southampton to Sheffield, for husband's job with the Royal Navy. 'When we moved away from my family, I lost my support network and Stan was working away a lot. So I began living like a pig and surviving on massive takeaways,' she said. Weight gain: Diane rose to size 20 after she moved to Sheffield with husband Stan and developed agoraphobia . She dropped to a size 12 after following an extreme diet plan but now eats healthily to maintain her shape . Diane admitted that she struggled to make friends when they moved so she stayed in scoffing ice cream and crisps. She added: 'I used to phone for a takeaway that often my local pizza place knew my order before I'd even told them what I wanted.' Her size 12 ballooned to a size 20 and this made it even more difficult for her to settle in their new area as she became too embarrassed about her size to socialise. She said her shame over her appearance made her feel unable to leave the house and she found talking to strangers a painful and distressing experience. Feeling fab at 49: Diane said she's now full of confidence . BEFORE . Breakfast: Four slices of thick white toast with margarine . Drink: Coffee with milk and sugar . Lunch: Four doorstep sandwiches or six bags of crisps, a tub of Ben and Jerry's, a family bar of chocolate . Dinner: Ten inch spicy pizza and garlic bread with cheese . Snack: An entire packet of biscuits or sharing pack of sweets . AFTER . Breakfast: Shredded wheat, skimmed milk . Drink: Black coffee . Lunch: Ham Salad Sandwich on wholegrain brown bread . Dinner: Spaghetti Bolognese with lean mince and salad or Chicken and lentil vegetable stew . No Snacks . Her weight then began to take its toll on her relationship with Stan, as well as on her health. She felt out of breath going up the stairs and doing day to day chores. It was only when her doctor advised her to sign up for the Cambridge Weight Plan - an extreme diet that consists of only liquid food for the first 12 weeks - that she decided to beat the bulge once and for all. Thanks to her diet she lost three stone in 16 weeks and went from 15st 11lbs to 10st 5lbs. And as the pounds dropped away, so did her agoraphobia. Diane is now recovered enough to go out alone and live an active  life and has swapped the junk food for a healthy diet of veg and lean meat. She even felt confident enough to produce a calendar of underwear snaps for her husband. Diane said: 'Since dropping my extra weight it has been the biggest confidence boost of my life. It's helped me overcome the extreme agoraphobia that I had and I can live a normal life. 'I feel absolutely incredible - who knew you could feel this good at 49!'","Diane Bryan, 49, rose to size 20 when she moved with husband's job .

"A woman has been reunited with her long lost mother decades after she had to give her away in heartbreaking circumstances. Kate Jarrett, 27, from Kent, thought she would never find her biological parent as she had a closed adoption and so received no help from social services in the search. She spent years trawling through social media and family tree websites to try to track her down. In fact all Kate had to go on was a cassette tape given to her by her adoptive parents on her 16th birthday, that had a recording of her mother's voice on. Success: Kate, pictured with her youngest daughter Sophie, has finally found her own biological mother after years of searching . The tape was recorded by Karen Irons, now 46, from Middlesbrough, more than a decade earlier and explained why she had given her up as a baby. Kate said: 'It's a very sad story. She was young and had no support... I always had a gut feeling that she never wanted to give me away.' On the tape Karen confessed she had come home from a night out to collect Kate from a babysitter and dropped her on concrete stairs. Kate was rushed to hospital where police questioned Karen, then 19, about the unexplained bruise - and then took her baby away. Kate was put into foster care and at the age of eight months Paul and Sue Jarrett, from Luton, adopted her. As a teenager, Kate listened to Karen's recording again and again and decided to find her mother. She got in touch with social services - but as it was a closed adoption they were unable to help her. Kate explained: 'I was just fobbed off. So I knew if I was going to get anywhere I was on my own.' Voice from the past: Kate was given this tape on her 16th birthday which her mother had recorded more than a decade before explaining why she had her adopted . Reunited: Kate with her mother, Karen, and her partner, Tony. The mother and daughter were separated for 27 years after Kate was adopted . She spent years searching sites specialising in ancestry, births, deaths and marriages. 'I tried everything, but lead after lead just ran cold,' she said. In the meantime, she started her own family having daughters Fayth, 10, Natalie, nine, and Sophie, two, and moved to Chatham, Kent, with boyfriend Mike Wilcock, 28, a warehouse manager. She remained determined to find her real mother and finally a breakthrough came after she spotted an advert for a private detective who, after hearing her story, waived her charges and took on her case for free. They eventually tracked down Karen, discovering she had married and moved to Middlesborough, where she had another daughter - Suzie Cullen, 22 - a sibling Kate never knew she had. Kate said hearing of the discovery came as a huge shock. Surprise sibling: Kate also discovered she had a sister, Suzie, right . She recalled: 'I had trouble breathing. I just collapsed in tears. It took me two days to summon up the courage to message Suzie. 'We spoke for hours, trying to fill in the blanks, but none of it making much sense.' Kate then met her mother in a tearful reunion when her adoptive father drove her on the five-and-a-half hour journey to visit her in Middlesbrough. Kate said: 'At first it was just like one of our normal days out, but when I saw the sign to Middlesbrough, it all kicked in. I was very nervous. Suzie answered the door and we gave each other a massive hug. 'She led me into the living room and there she was in the flesh - my mum sitting on the sofa. I got down on my knees and we just held each other for about 45 minutes.' She added: 'There was an instant bond, everything just clicked. It was just like the missing piece of a jigsaw had been found.' Kate's real mum Karen is now determined to make up for lost time by moving to Kent to be near Kate and her family. She is wheelchair bound and has been in poor health in recent years but Kate said their reunion has given her a renewed vigor. Kate said: 'I've been told she has improved in health since we met. She has told me she has the fight in her.'","Kate Jarrett, 27, thought she would never find her biological parent .

"A mother has been given a new zest for life after losing 11 stone through diet and exercise. Wendi Huggett, 40, once weighed 21st 1lb and wore size 34 clothing. Her large size made it difficult for her to move around pain free and she felt ashamed that her daughter had a 'fat mum'. Now Wendi, of Llanelli, has completely transformed her lifestyle and her figure - and has never felt better. Scroll down for video . Health kick: Wendi has dropped 11st after taking up Zumba and changing her diet. She used to weight 21st 1lb . She now weighs 9st 11lb and is a size eight and teaches five Zumba classes a week to help other people improve their health and fitness. She said: 'I'm fitter and happier, and I'm much more capable of dealing with the challenges which life throws at me. 'I love teaching classes, and I get a huge amount of satisfaction at being able to provide a service for other women who are keen to become healthier.' Wendi piled on the pounds after having her daughter, daughter Tierney, now 14, as she suffered from severe postnatal depression. Through comfort eating, she gained seven stone in just three years. She said: 'I developed what I consider now to be an addiction to food. In the depths of depression I felt as if I couldn't control anything - but I could control what I ate. So if I wanted to have a bar of chocolate or a round of toast to make me feel better, I didn't hold back.' As the weight piled on, she began experiencing joint and back pain and was so depressed she would avoid leaving the house unless strictly necessary. Comfort eater: Wendi, pictured with her daughter as a toddler, piled on the pounds due to post natal depression . Low confidence: She was concerned that her daughter would be bullied because of her size . She said: 'It became increasingly difficult to move around, which just fed into the cycle. After a while even something as simple as standing up long enough to finish washing the dishes was extremely difficult. 'On the rare occasions when I did venture out of the house, I felt as if I was under scrutiny. Little children would point at me and ask their parents why I was so large. When I went shopping, I was paranoid that people were peering into my shopping basket, looking for sweets and treats which would explain why I was so fat.' When Tierney turned three, Wendi made the decision to lose weight for the sake of her daughter. She said: 'I couldn't bare the thought of Tia being bullied in school. I had been larger than average at school and had experienced some bullying. I didn't want Tia to be made an object of fun because she had a fat mum. Transformed: Wendi was a dress size 34, right, until she stuck to a diet and joined the gym. Now she's a size 8 . 'In the years since her birth I'd tried dieting, but had only managed to yo-yo my weight. I realised I could only make a lasting change if I overhauled my whole attitude to food.' She swapped her toast with butter and cheese for breakfast for porridge. The ham and coleslaw sandwiches she once had for lunch were replaced with a more protein-heavy meal such as chicken with salad. The creamy chicken pasta bake with garlic bread she once devoured as an evening meal was ditched in favour of brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon. And she resisted snacking on a family-sized bar of milk chocolate throughout the day like she used to. Along with her new healthy eating plan, which she still maintains, she joined her local gym where she started doing cardio interval training. She said: 'I hated doing the gym at first, but doing a bit of running, followed by a bit of cross training and rowing, made it more varied and interesting.' Follow my lead: Wendi teaches Zumba to help other people gain the benefits of being fit and healthy . Seven months after changing her diet, she lost eight stone and this encouraged her to keep going with her new, healthy lifestyle. She said: 'A personal instructor at the gym liked to demonstrate how much I was losing by going into the weights room and coming out with the equivalent of what I'd lost between milestones. It was a huge motivator.' Then she discovered Zumba classes - which led to her following a new career path. She explained: 'I decided to investigate Zumba classes. I loved the energy and the music, but at one class the instructor was so bored and listless that I thought, ""I could do better than this"".' BREAKFAST . THEN: Toast with butter and cheese . NOW: Porridge . LUNCH . THEN: Ham and coleslaw sandwiches and family-sized milk chocolate bar . NOW: Chicken with salad . DINNER . THEN: Creamy chicken pasta bake with garlic bread . NOW: Brown rice with steamed vegetables and salmon . She took a training course to become an official instructor and led her first class in June 2011. She said: 'Being up there in front a class is a huge rush. I'm proud of my commitment towards the women in my classes. I'll never let them down - even if there's only three or four people in the class, I'll never call a class off.' Now Wendi says she's glad her daughter has a mother she can feel proud of and she sets her an example of healthy living. She said: 'Tia's enormously proud of me, too. She looks at pictures of the old me and can't quite believe it. 'I'm happy to say that she's fitter and stronger than I was at her age. She's very mindful of nutrition and loves kickboxing. It's satisfying to see that she's managed to avoid some of the traps I fell into at that age.'","Wendi Huggett, 40, once weighed 21st 1lb and wore size 34 clothing .

"It's never too late to get fit says Britain's oldest female Ironman, who is still competitively swimming, cycling and running at the age of 71. Grandmother Eddie Brocklesby, who lives in Vauxhall, London, has taken part in four Ironman events and is currently planning to do another in Lanzarote next year. The Bristol-born retired social worker only started running when she turned 50 and has since completed physical challenges that people half her age would struggle to manage. Scroll down for video . Impressive: Eddie Brocklesby, now 71, has completed four Ironman events since 2009 and is training for another next year . Eddie told MailOnline that exercise has become an essential part of her life, benefitting both her body and her mind. She said: 'It's never too late to get into physical activity. You can swim whatever your age. Strength training you can do at home and build up quickly. 'It can make such a difference as you age - you will be less likely to have a fall and you can be more independent and need less support.' She added: 'It's good for both physical and mental health. I'm often told I don't look 71 or people tell me: ""I wish my mum and dad did that"". I'm toned and in good general health.' Eddie was advised by her doctor to start exercising in her fifties when she started to go through the menopause. Women in this phase of life are more at risk of osteoporosis due to the hormonal changes in their bodies making their bones weaker. Physical activity - in particularly weight training - is one of the best ways for women to increase their bone density and keep their bodies strong. Eddie took up running and strength training for this reason and entered the Nottingham Half Marathon to keep her motivated. Swim, bike, run: An Ironman involves a 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run - and Eddie does it all with a smile on her face . She joked she also had another incentive: 'My husband said I would never be able to run a half marathon so I had to prove him wrong!' After that she went on to run the London Marathon four times, achieving an impressive time of three hours and 56 minutes. However, her running training was then curtailed after she sustained a knee injury when skiing. 'I knew I couldn't keep pounding the pavements so I took up triathlon,' she explained. She was inspired by her sons, who had entered a triathlon, and they took part in the event together. 'It's great to do something like that with my family, even if they beat me!' she said. She hopes her example shows her three children and four grandchildren that it is possible to stay in shape as you age. 'My grandchildren call me Mad Granny,' she joked, 'But I hope I am inspiring to them by showing them that you can keep exercising as you get older.' After successfully completing a number of triathlons and duathlons, Eddie then took on her biggest challenge of all - the Ironman - for the first time at the age of 66. The event involves a 2.4 mile swim, followed by a 112 mile bike ride, rounded off with a marathon run (26.2 miles). Ambassador for a good cause: Eddie has been asked to front a campaign for Remember A Charity Week . Many who line up to take part in the events each year fail to finish. But Eddie made it round in under 16 hours and qualified in her age group for a coveted place in the Ironman World Champs - held in Hawaii every year. She's now planning to do the Lanzarote Ironman again in 2015. Due to her knee problems, she keeps her running to a minimum - averaging around 12 miles a week - swims occasionally and cycles regularly doing long rides, spinning classes and getting on her bike to travel around London. She also does regular strength training exercises such as balancing on one leg. As well improving her health and fitness, training for the event has enhanced her social life. Eddie, pictured behind the scenes of the charity photo shoot, is often told she looks younger than her years . She trains with London-based Serpentine Running Club, where she has made many friends. 'Running clubs are accommodating of all abilities and ages. You don't need to be good to join and you get fit as well as enjoying the social side. I have made many friends of all ages at my running club. You have that common interest,' she said. Taking part in races has also given her the opportunity to raise money for charity. As she has been such a staunch supporter of good causes through her career and sporting achievements, she has now been named a 'Living Legend' as part of Remember A Charity Week. Thanks to her sporting achievements, Eddie has been named a 'Living Legend' for Remember A Charity Week . The week, which began on Monday and runs until 14th September, aims to inspire the nation to think about leaving a charitable gift in their Will. Eddie said: 'It was a privilege to be asked to help promote Remember A Charity Week and I enjoyed filming a video for the campaign in my local park. 'Taking on a challenge, however small, is a good way to raise money for charity but people can also leave money to charities in their Wills.'

"Loose Women returned for its 19th series today with a new look set and anchor presenter. But while the face may have been new to the show, it was a familiar one to TV viewers - as Gloria Hunniford, 74, has taken the helm. The ITV show, which has been running since 1999, also had a new logo and opening credits. But it didn't go down well with all of their viewers. Scroll down for video . New look: Gloria Hunniford made her Loose Women presenting debut today when she was joined by Ruth Langsford, left, Coleen Nolan, second from right, and Janet Street Porter, right . Experienced: Gloria Hunniford has been presenting for decades . Hundreds took to the show's Facebook page to complain that they hated the new set and felt the show had been too 'Americanised'. Zarie Halliday wrote: 'Awwwwful show. Hate set.' Jacqueline Khanum added: 'I did not like the new set...table too small....didn't like the changing colours behind special guest...the tune has changed....unforgivable!!!!!' Meanwhile Ann Edwards, who was a member of the live audience today, wrote: 'Really thought that I would like to see the show live but not after today's show. BRING BACK THE OLD GIRLS they were entertaining.' Revamp: Returning for its 19th series, the show also has a new set and logo . Christine Hooson agreed. She wrote: 'I much prefer the original panel, won't be watching as much... don't see Gloria Hunniford as a Loose Woman sorry.' The 'old girls' include former presenters Carol McGiffin, 54, Denise Welch, 56 and Jane McDonald, 51. While they had a loyal following, they were often accused of 'ranting' on screen. And sometimes their off-screen behaviour was talked about more than the news of the day. In a bid to reviving flagging viewing figures, it seems the show's new editor, Martin Frizell has decided to turn to safe hands in the form of Hunniford. He's also hired former This Morning legend Judy Finnigan, 66. Unlike some of their Loose Women predecessors, they both have wholesome reputations as devoted mothers and epitomise ageing gracefully. Special guest: Joan Collins appeared on today's lunchtime show . Starting as they mean to go on:  It is hoped viewing figures will go up thanks to the new presenter, set and star guests - but not all viewers were impressed with the changes . Tempting Finnegan back to TV is a particular coup after she has been focused on novel writing in recent years and once swore she was finished with presenting. She said last week that she was excited about joining Loose Women. 'I know I said I wouldn't go back on the telly, but actually I'm looking forward to occasionally contributing to lively conversations between a group of outspoken and intelligent women,' she said. When he revealed the new line up last week, Frizell said: 'I'm delighted we have been able to confirm more of Britain's best loved, successful, assertive and, let's face it, downright smart women to join our Loose Women team.' At a time when many TV programmes have been accused of being ageist for ditching older stars, the ITV show has embraced veteran presenters. New additions: Judy Finnigan, left, and Sharon Osbourne are also joining Loose Women . Also on board is former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne, 61, while model Penny Lancaster, 43, represents a younger demographic. Hunniford said that she thinks the age range of the panellists will enhance the debate on the topical show. She said: 'I am a great fan of the show and I'm really thrilled to be joining the team. I love a good debate and it's such a great challenge to be discussing the important issues of the day with women that span different generations - our opinions will certainly be very diverse! 'The show is also very joyful and I'm looking forward to having lots of fun with the Loose Women - a girl couldn't ask for more!' The hosts and panel will rotate based on the presenters availability, so on today's show, Hunniford was joined by Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Janet Street-Porter. The topics up for discussion included MPs' payrises and the plight of Ashya King, while they welcomed special guest Joan Collins, 81.","Gloria Hunniford, 74, has taken the helm of Loose Women .

"Britain has a proud heritage in winning Olympic gold medals in the heptathlon and Katarina Johnson-Thompson hopes she can one day join the roll of honour. At the age of 21, she's already achieved gold medals at junior championships, the World indoors and has a British long jump record. But now her sights are firming set on Rio 2016, where she's keen to emulate the success of Jessica Ennis-Hill, who took gold at the London 2012 Olympics. Role model: Katarina Johnson-Thompson is supporting this weekend's Sainsbury's School Games . No sweat: Katarina with fellow GB heptathletes Jessica Ennis, centre and Louise Hazel, right, at London 2012. She says she doesn't feel under pressure to emulate the Olympic champion . Due to their shared talent over seven athletic events, Katarina is often compared to the Sheffield Olympian. But she told MailOnline she isn't fazed by the comparisons. 'Being compared to Jess Ennis-Hill is a big deal because she's an Olympic gold medallist and British record holder. Being compared to her is a huge compliment because she's such a good athlete,' she said. 'I don't feel any pressure because as an athlete you want to go out there and win medals, especially Olympic medals. That's my goal anyway so there's no pressure because she had already done it.' As Jessica plans to make a comeback after having a baby this year, Katarina would have to beat the champion in order to realise her own Olympic dream in 2016. She said going to Rio has been a life-long target, and her desire to compete there has been heighten after she missed out on this summer's Commonwealth Games and European Championships due to a foot injury, from which she is still recovering. Sidelined: She won a silver in the long jump at this year's World Indoor Games but missed the Commonwealths and European Champs due to injury . Chance to shine: Sainsbury's School Games is a major multi-sport event for some of the most talented young athletes across the UK . 'It was really hard for me to miss out. No athlete wants to be injured at the peak of the summer. It was very hard for me to sit back and watch, especially as I knew I was in such good shape,' she admitted. But rather than wonder that might have been, she is looking to the future and hopes to win a medal at next year's World Championships in Beijing. The Liverpudlian first got into athletics by joining her local running club - Liverpool Harriers - as child and she recommends other people do the same to get fit, whatever their age. She said: 'At my club there are kids to older people who just go along to keep fit. It doesn't cost that much to join and running with other people will help you get through it. I find doing my winter training with a group helps me get fit as you are going through the pain together.' Mentor: Katarina watches on as youngsters take part in the high jump and long jump . As a youngster, Katarina honed her talent competing in the Sainsbury's School Games, where she won the high jump gold in 2008. The games, which are supported by National Lottery funding from Sport England and delivered by the Youth Sport Trust, are a major multi-sport event for some of the most talented young athletes across the UK. Replicating an international championship, 1,600 athletes compete in 12 sports in venues across Manchester and experience a spectacular opening and closing ceremony, an athletes’ village, and a targeted education programme which includes anti-doping advice and guidance. Katarina hasn't forgotten her roots and is supporting this year's event, held this weekend, to inspire young stars of the future who are hoping to emulate her success. She said she's honoured to be seen as a role model to them. 'Girls say to me that they look up to me because I have done stuff at a young age, I try to take it in my stride,' she said. 'I watched reality TV shows growing up but I think sports stars make better role models because they show hard works pays off - they achieve their goals because they have worked for them.' The Sainsbury's 2014 School Games are supported by National Lottery funding from Sport England and delivered by the Youth Sport Trust .","Katarina, 21, has already won medals and achieved a British record .

"Twiggy is back with a new Autumn/Winter collection for Marks and Spencer and the model-turned-fashion-designer says there something for everyone in the range. Speaking to the MailOnline she said: 'I hate it when they put an age to clothes. Obviously I am not going to go around in gold hot pants any more but there are items in the new collection that women of all ages will love. 'I do my collections for all age groups, it's not just meant for someone my age. My daughter wears a lot of my jackets.' Scroll down for video . Brighten up winter: Twiggy in a pink embellished jumper from her new M&S collection, £45 . This season's must-haves: The model shows off some of the coats on offer including this biker jacket with a fold back collar, left, and faux fur winter warmer . The 64-year-old said she took inspiration from her own wardrobe in creating the new range, while also including updated versions of items that have previously been big hits, such as the flattering pink lace dress she wore to her daughter's wedding, which will now be available in jade. She's also been sure to include many dresses and tops with long or short sleeves following demand from women who say they feel more confident covering their upper arms up. Twiggy said: 'There are certain areas which are bothersome for most women and that's top of the arms and the tummy. I feel much more comfortable myself with a little sleeve.' Sneak peek: Twiggy launched the collection this week on the roof top of Ham Yard hotel . For all ages: Animal and floral prints are a feature as Twiggy advises being brave when it comes to style . When it comes to looking good, Twiggy had the following style tips: 'Every women is built differently, the thing is to find your comfort zone, sometimes you have to be brave and try things out but don't go stupid and wear things that won't flatter you. 'It helps if you can go shopping with someone you trust. I take my daughter and she'll be honest with me.' The designer added that her wardrobe staples have evolved rather than changed over the decades. 'My style hasn't really changed that much of the years,' she revealed. 'I still love tailored jackets like the one in my new collection. I would wear it with skinny jeans but if you don't feel comfortable in them you could wear them with a pleated or pencil shirt. 'There's also a navy blue riding jacket I based on one in my wardrobe which I have always loved. I love that I can reinvent things doing my own designs.' Versatile: Twiggy said many of the items can be dress up or down . The new collection, which is exclusively on sale from www.marksandspencer.com/Twiggy from 10th September, includes faux fur coats, animal print jumpers and pretty embellished tops and dresses. Accessories include wearable mid heel courts and classic brogues in vibrant colours, along with statement totes and stylish shoulder bags. Bold colours of pink and jade feature throughout and Twiggy said many of the items can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. 'My comfort zone is skinny jeans and jackets but I also know a lot of women love dresses so we have lots of then', she explained. 'There's a drapey jersey dress and that's the sort you could wear to the office. Then in the evening you can put on a necklace and heels and go straight to a party!' Proud: Twiggy reveals some of her favourite pieces at the launch - including the suede biker jacket she holds . Twiggy looks glowing as she poses for pictures of the collection and she said it's all thanks to her healthy lifestyle. 'I'm a firm believer that you are what you eat,' she said. 'I don't diet but I like to eat healthily. I don't think big diets work. Everyone I know who has been on a diet loses weight but then puts it straight back on again.

"He's known for his sporting prowess on the polo field but Prince Harry also cuts a fine figure in a rugby shirt. The royal pulled on a Wasps shirt as the club have joined support for the Invictus Games. As part of the alliance, Wasps players will wear a limited edition away shirt during their London double header against Saracens on Saturday to raise awareness for the tournament which is being championed by the prince. Scroll down for video . United for a good cause: Wasps captain James Haskell and Prince Harry in the special edition shirts the rugby players will wear to publicise the Invictus Games . Prince Harry, 29, modelled the shirt today alongside Wasps captain James Haskell, who Tweeted a picture of them both on Instagram. He wrote: 'Great to catch up with HRH, and show him Wasps support for the amazing Invictus Games. Go, watch and support these truly inspiring games. We are wearing the kit for the London Double Header, this Saturday.' He jokingly added: 'I have been trying to get him in a Wasps (@waspsrugby) shirt for years, finally found a way! He looks sharp.' The Invictus Games is an international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick service personnel that will take place at the London 2012 Olympic venues from 10-14 September. Getting involved: Prince Harry announced plans for the games earlier this year when he also tried playing hand ball, right . Haskell said: 'It's fantastic that Wasps are supporting such an incredible event and giving Invictus Games another platform on which to boost its profile during their first year. 'Over the past few years it has been brilliant to see the overwhelming support for our Armed Forces and a genuine appreciation of the incredible job they do to protect us. I know there is no prouder moment than to represent your country. These guys do it daily, and their commitment, regardless of the risk to themselves, is inspirational. 'You often hear in rugby about players putting their bodies on the line. It's a tough, physical game, but let's face it, it's incomparable to the dangers Service personnel face, and I have so much respect for what they sacrifice in the line of duty. Ready for battle: Last month the royal revealed the British team, made up from wounded service men and women, who will do their country proud again - this time in a sporting arena . 'These are men and women who have suffered life-changing injuries, but still refuse to be beaten. To watch them compete at the Invictus Games will be inspirational and I'd encourage people to get down to the venues to cheer them on.' The Invictus Games are being organised with the support and backing of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry and the Ministry of Defence. They will feature more than 400 wounded, injured and sick Servicemen and women, both serving and veteran from 14 nations. Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan as a helicopter pilot, has been a driving force in getting the inaugural games off the ground and he hopes it will become an annual event. Landmark event: Tower Bridge was lit up this week to celebrate the games . When he announced the details for the tournament earlier this year he said: 'I have witnessed first-hand how the power of sport can positively impact the lives of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women in their journey of recovery. 'The Invictus Games will focus on what they can achieve post-injury and celebrate their fighting spirit through an inclusive sporting competition that recognises the sacrifice they have made. 'I am extremely proud to be bringing an event like this to the UK for the first time and believe it can have a long-lasting impact on the well-being of those who have served their nations so bravely.'

"One of Tracey Miller's earliest memories was seeing her father being taken away by the police after they stormed into her home to arrest him on rape charges. He was later jailed leaving Tracey with a dysfunctional mother who suffered from nervous breakdowns. But Tracey, now 36, told MailOnline she didn't miss her father as he was a violent man who regularly battered her mother, who once even jumped through a glass window to escape him. Misspent youth: Tracey Miller was part of a gang and was jailed for robbery as a teenager . The teenager then had a step father who she was so scared of, she slept with a knife under her pillow. So it is perhaps no surprise that by the age of 13, Tracey had sought solace by being part of a gang, and she would rather be out with them as they terrorised the streets of Brixton, London, than at home. 'The whole vibe of the gang seemed quite exciting,' she explained.. She joined the notorious 'Younger 28s' becoming involved in robberies, drug dealing and violence. She recalled: 'I used to go along on some of the robberies just for the hell of it. Police called it ""steaming"". They would run in, jump around the counter, grab money from the till and they were gone again.' Reformed: Now the mother-of-two wants to help other young people out of a life of crime . She started to arm herself with the knife she once kept under her pillow, threatening to stab a girl at her school which led to her being expelled. She admits she was an aggressive youngster and would not hesitate in using her knife if she became involved in an altercation. As a result, arguments over the years led to her stabbing her sister in the leg and her boyfriend in the abdomen on different occasions. 'I feel the most remorse for that,' she admits. 'I see these people on a normal day and it hurts me to know what I did to them.' During this time, Tracey was also a victim herself, as she was raped at the age of 15. She shares this horrific experience in her memoir, Sour: My Story, which has been published by Harper Collins and shows how she survived gangland culture to eventually put her troubled past behind her. It was becoming pregnant with her daughter, Montana, now 16, that led Tracey to finally change her ways. Aggressive: In her youth, Tracey once stabbed her sister and her boyfriend. She's written a book telling her story and how she became 'a changed person' She said: 'Trying to live a gang life as a 36-year-old isn't possible. I have children and responsibilities. If you want to step away from gangs you can if you have strength of character.' She added that she has learnt to not lash out, even when provoked. 'I have been in arguments since and I have controlled myself. Unless my life was threatened, I would never harm someone again,' she said. 'I have been slapped in the face and not retaliated which shocked my friends. They said I would never let something like that go in the past. But I tell them, ""I'm a changed person"".' As well as Montana, she also has another, daughter, Molly, three, and she says she's determined to be a good mother to them and keep them on the straight and narrow. She said: 'Montana is a very good kid. By the time I was 16 I had already been to prison. The contrast between us is mind-blowing. She says to me, ""With respect, I would never turn out like you"". She knows I have survived a lot.' She added: 'I was aggressive, my past has shaped who I am now. Now I am a very good mum.' Now Tracey, who still lives in South London, mentors young people, encouraging them to steer clear of gangs. Crime doesn't pay: Tracey hopes young people and parents can learn from her experiences . She explained: 'I mentor children at schools and young offenders' institutes or the children of friends. Sometimes I just approach teenagers on the street and talk to them. I tell them not to hang around but to go home, the devil makes work for idle hands.' She believes she's in a unique position to help troubled young people as she knows what they are going through - and is an example of how you can break the cycle of committing crime. She said: 'There are outlets if you need help. Kids don't like to be dictated to, I listen to them. When they trust you, you can give them alternatives views so they can see something negative in a positive light. I give them steps to work towards. 'I understand what they are going through and they are often surprised when I tell them about my past.' Tracey said she penned her book to illustrate these points but she also hopes it can change the views of parents and politicians if they read it. She said: 'Children are byproducts of their environment. Parents need to think about what their children are doing once they are out of their peripheral view. I want politicians to read my book and see from the inside what life is like for a troubled youngster. 'I also want youngsters to know it's a fallacy to think that badness is good and that it pays. I haven't got anything to show for what I did then. Don't follow that path.' 'Sour: My story. A troubled girl from a broken home. The Brixton gang she nearly died for. The baby she fought to live for' is out now published by Harper Collins .","Tracey Miller, 36, used to be a member of a gang in Brixton .

"Hate your tubby tummy? Then chances are you live in the North, according to new research. A survey by outdoor fitness club British Military Fitness found the North/South divide is clear when it comes to body image. It found that Northern women are most hung up on their stomachs, with 87 per cent keen to tone up their tummies. Regional body hang ups: In the North, women are most bothered about firming up their tummies, while in the South, toned arms are more desired . In comparison, those in the South were more bothered about banishing their bingo wings, with 71 per cent saying this was their area of biggest concern. Other results from the nationwide survey, where more than 1,000 women were questioned, revealed that four times the amount of women in the North wanted to improve their bust compared to women in the South, who are more confident with their cleavage. A regional break down in the results found that women in Manchester were the most unhappy with their tummies, followed by those in Leeds and Edinburgh. When it comes to bingo wings, those in Brighton had the highest concerns followed by Londoners. Southerners were also more concerned about toning up their bottoms when asked which area of their bodies they would most like to improve, while for Northerners another area of concern was their thighs. Get a flat stomach: British Military Fitness trainers recommend sit ups and core stability exercises . Tone up: Push ups are a simple way to get stronger, toned arms . But whatever the body part stressed over, British Military Fitness Instructor, Gary Kerr says there are targeted exercises that can help. He recommends doing the exercises outlined in the box outs below three times a week to notice a difference in your figure. For the women up North who want firmer stomachs, he suggests doing 'the plank' to improve the core muscles so the tummy becomes flatter. He also said the trusty sit up is another way to ensure a toned tummy. Meanwhile for the women in the South who want their bingo wings to fly away, he says push ups and bench dips three times a week will help. To tone up the legs and bottom, he suggests squats and lunges. Such exercises can be done in the comfort of your own home but for those who need some extra motivation and encouragement, they are also part of the workouts operated by British Military Fitness, who offer 400 sessions a week in more than 140 parks nationwide. Fitness guru Nell McAndrew is a fan of the outdoor workouts and has regularly attended her local BMF group. She Tweeted earlier this year: 'Just did @BritMilFit loved it! Managed (only just) to make it through green session! Blew few cobwebs away! #highlyrecommend #keeponrunning' For more information about British Military Fitness, visit:www.britishmilitaryfitness.com or to try a free session, please visit:https://www.britmilfit.com/try-bmf-for-free. THE PLANK . Adopt a stand similar to a press up but keep your forearms on the ground and shoulder width apart beneath your chest. Pull your stomach in, keep your body straight and your feet together and balance on your toes. Hold still in this position for 20-60 seconds - repeating three to five times. PLANK SUPERMAN . From the normal plank, lift your left foot off the ground slowly. Then slowly extend your right arm in front of you so you should now be balancing on your left forearm and right foot. Hold for 10–30 seconds and repeat two to three times on each side. DIAMOND PUSH UPS . Place palms on the ground and touch thumbs and forefingers together to create a diamond. Perform the press-ups by slowly lowering the chest to your hands and push back up. Put your knees on the ground if you struggle to do 10-12 reps. BENCH DIP . You'll need a chair or a bench about knee height. Place hands on the bench directly under the shoulders. Legs are straight out away from the bench so it is behind you, lower your body slowly until bum nearly touches the ground and push back up. .","North/South divide was clear following body image survey .

"A friend of the Kings has spoken out in support of their decision to take their sick son, Ashya, to Spain. Ricky De Sousa appeared on today's This Morning to defend Brett and Nagmeh King and called for them to be released from prison. Mr De Sousa said the Kings were 'a normal family' who he met on the wards of Southampton General Hospital, where his own son was being treated for cancer. Shared ordeal: Ricky De Sousa said he told Brett King about proton beam therapy when he met him on the wards of Southampton General Hospital where his own son was being treated for cancer . He said he's appalled at how they have been treated and they should not be separated from their son. 'The best interests for the child is for the parents to be next to him. At the moment he is in hospital without his parents,' he said. The father revealed that he was the one who told the Kings about proton beam therapy, the treatment they sought abroad because it wasn't available to them on the NHS. 'I would take my child anywhere to save him': Mr De Sousa said he thinks the Kings were right to take Ashya, pictured here with his father, Brett, to Spain for treatment . Needs his parents: Thousands have signed a petition calling for Nagmeh, pictured with her son, and Brett to be released from prison and reunited with Ashya, who is in a hospital in Malaga . He explained to presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'Like every parent there, between us we discussed treatments. 'When we found out our son had cancer, we were looking everywhere for treatments and therapies like proton beam therapy. 'In our son's case, he didn't need it but I did mention to Mr King about proton beam therapy and then he must have started researching it himself.' Mr De Sousa said he had no idea how far the couple who go to gain the treatment and only became aware that they had left Southampton General Hospital after he saw it on the news. But he confessed in their position, he would have done exactly the same. He said: 'You will do whatever it takes if you have a sick child. If we didn't have the treatment we needed for our son, we would have done the same. I would take my child anywhere to save him.' Video courtesy of ITV / This Morning . Ashya's parents took him to Spain without consent last Thursday in the hope they could sell their holiday home on the Costa del Sol to raise money for specialist treatment. Following their departure, they were arrested and jailed pending extradition for alleged 'cruelty to a person under the age of 16 years'. Their son, who is suffering from a stage four brain tumour, is now being cared for at the Materno-Infantil hospital in Malaga. Free them: Mr De Sousa said the parents should be allowed to see their son . Since Saturday night, the five-year-old has been separated form his family and only his older brother Danny, 23, has been able to see him at Málaga's Hospital Materno-Infanti, where the brain cancer patient is being guarded by armed police. So far today, more than 140,000 people have signed a petition demanding the jailed parents be released and allowed to visit their son. Supporters went to Downing Street this morning to call on David Cameron to intervene and ensure the Kings are granted bail and allowed to leave a Madrid high security prison. Mr De Sousa joined the calls for the parents to be released for their son's sake. He said: 'If I went home when my son was he hospital, he would ring and say ""Daddy, where are you?"" It will have a big impact Ashya.' To sign the petition click HERE .","Ricky De Sousa met Brett and Nagmeh King at Southampton hospital .

"A couple who are raising two sons will one day have to sit their children down and tell them that it was their father who gave birth to them. And the surprises won't stop there for the two boys - they'll also learn that their mother is really their biological father. The unconventional family set up is due to the parents, Bianca and Nick Bowser, both changing gender - but using their original sex organs in order to have children of their own. Scroll down for video . Transgender romance: Bianca and Nick Bowser both changed sex before starting a family together . Bianca, 32, was born as a boy called Jason, while her husband, Nick, 27, was once a girl named Nicole. The couple from Kentucky, in the U.S., who married in 2011, say they have no intentions of hiding their pasts from their sons, Kai, three, and Pax, one. Bianca explained to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on today's This Morning: 'It's always something that I have looked forward to, telling our children. 'It's nothing we are ashamed of so I have no dread telling our children where we came from or how we previously lived our lives.' Nick added: 'We will tell them when they are ready, when they start asking questions about me being pregnant and about the old family pictures they may see of me dressed as a girl and Bianca as a boy. Conflicting time: Nick said being pregnant was difficult because his body was 'the ultimate version of female' while his mind was telling him he's male . Happy family: The couple will be open with Kai, right, and Pax about their pasts . 'As they get older they will understand more. We feel being honest with them from an early age will preserve the relationship we currently have with them.' The pair both grew up feeling different and eventually realised it was because they were living as the wrong gender. Bianca said: 'At five, there was a moment when I was playing with other classmates that I felt different. I didn't fit in with other boys. I didn't like sports or masculine games. I had a really hard time growing up.' She transitioned to live as a woman more than a decade ago, having breast augmentation in 2003, as well as laser hair-removal. But she has not yet had reconstructive surgery and so was able to father their two sons. Meanwhile, Nick started living as a man after he turned 20. He also had a difficult time growing up as he felt conflicted over who he was. He explained: 'I first came out as a lesbian at 17 and I thought that solved my problems. As a child I wanted to dress as a boy and do boys things but I wasn't able to. I thought all lesbians thought the same as I did. Didn't fit in: Bianca said she had a difficult time growing up as a boy called Jason, left, and is much happier now she lives as a woman . 'It wasn't until I was 20 that I discovered I could change my sex and be comfortable with who I was. I met transgender people and I finally figured out what would make me happy, which was not being a lesbian but being a guy.' As he is also yet to have surgery to fully complete the sex change, Nick was able to become pregnant with their sons after he met Bianca in 2009 and they decided to start a family. While he said the process was completely worth it, he also admits it was a difficult time when his body and mind were in constant conflict. 'Being pregnant was extremely difficult for me,' he said. 'I don't regret the decision to carry the children but at the same time, my brain and body were fighting. 'My body had turned into the ultimate version of female and my brain was telling me, ""you're not female, you're male"". When I looked in the mirror, it was a constant battle for the nine months I was pregnant each time.' Always wanted to be a boy: Nick was never comfortable as a girl, Nicole, left, and has lived as a man since he turned 20. When they can afford it, he will have a full sex change operation . Both Bianca and Nick intend to have surgery in the future and it is currently only the cost that is holding them back. In the U.S, male to female surgery can range from £4,000 to £15,000, while female to male surgery can exceed £30,000. Nick said at the moment, they can't afford such an expense as they would rather spend what money have have on their sons. He said: 'When it comes to surgery in the U.S, most of the time you have to pay out of pocket. As we both need surgery, it's a lot of money and we have two children.' No secrets: Nick and Bianca married in 2011 and are looking forward to telling their children about their pasts . The couple have been happy to share their story with world media in the hope of banishing prejudices towards transgender people. Nick said: 'We do everything any other parent would do. We went through the same process and preparations except I was at the one who carried the two children.' However, he said not everyone has been fully supportive of their choices, especially in their home country. 'The U.S. is behind with equality for people like us,' Nick said. 'We still have a large amount of people who are against who we are and the two of us having children together. We have received some pretty hateful comments from people in the U.S.'","Bianca and Nick Bowser have two sons aged three and one .
Nick gave birth to the boys as he was born a girl called Nicole .

"Rob Edwards has been sacked as manager of Tranmere. Rovers were relegated last season and had hoped to make an immediate return to Sky Bet League One but have made a poor start to life in the bottom division under Edwards, who replaced John McMahon at the end of May. Saturday's home defeat to Plymouth was Tranmere's seventh league loss of the campaign and their fourth on the spin in a seven-game winless run that has left the Wirral club bottom of the Football League. Rob Edwards has been sacked by Tranmere Rovers after less than five months in charge of the club . Rovers chairman Mark Palios told the club's official website, tranmererovers.co.uk: 'Rob is a decent man who has worked very hard over the past few months for the football club. 'However, with the club currently sitting at the bottom of League 2 for the first time in 32 years it was decided this was the right time to make the break. 'I remain committed to the vision, that Rob shared, of playing free-flowing and skilful football. 'And while we have shown in some of our periods of play that we are not far off being able to achieve that - we have not been able to do it consistently. 'We have also not been sufficiently pragmatic when circumstances demanded that we close out a game to secure a win. 'If we are to achieve the required results in future it is clear that we need to strengthen the squad further.' Plymouth's Reuben Reid (third from left) scores his side's winner against Tranmere to keep them bottom . Palios went on to highlight the need for the next manager to have good contacts to help with the recruitment of new players. He added: 'Our recruitment department, which has been depleted by years of under-investment, is being supplemented and strengthened. 'But in the short term our ability to find new players to cover injuries and to supplement the existing line up will also depend on having in place a manager with an extensive network of contacts in the game. 'This will therefore be one of the key attributes that I will be looking for in a replacement for Rob.' Tranmere have won just two matches this season. Both victories - away at Wycombe and at home to Morecambe - came in August.","Rob Edwards only took charge of Tranmere at the end of May .

"Grant Hanley has withdrawn from the Scotland squad for the 2016 European Championship qualifier against Poland on Tuesday night, the Scottish FA have confirmed. The Blackburn Rovers defender picked up a knee injury in the 1-0 Group D win over Georgia at Ibrox on Saturday. Hanley has struck up a partnership with Norwich City's Russell Martin under manager Gordon Strachan who has Brighton's Gordon Greer, Christophe Berra of Ipswich and Aberdeen's Mark Reynolds as possible replacements. Grant Hanley has withdrawn from the Scotland squad with a knee injury ahead of the clash with Poland . Hanley played in Scotland's 1-0 win against Georgia in Group D at Ibrox on Saturday . Poland sit top of the section with six points from two matches following their shock 2-0 home win over world champions Germany on Saturday. Martin, though, is armed with research on Bayern Munich danger man Robert Lewandowski and confidence from Scotland's recent performances on the road. 'We will watch all the videos on him before Tuesday,' said the 28-year-old. 'He is a fantastic player but the staff here prepare us for everything. 'But I'm sure we have seen enough of him in the Bundesliga with the goals he has scored to know how dangerous he is. So we will be ready.' Martin partnered Greer in the 1-0 friendly win over Poland in Warsaw in March which Lewandowski missed through injury.

'We have had a lot of matches like the one we will get on Tuesday over the last 18 months and the way we have dealt with them has been brilliant,' he said. 'If we can keep that level up I'm confident we can get a result. 'Mentally it is a boost that we have already been to Poland this year and won. We know we can go there and do it. 'They had a couple of players missing on that night, but the way we are playing at the minute, we can be confident of going anywhere and putting in a performance that we can be proud of. 'The manager is always on to us that he wants us to put in a showing that we can be proud of. We did that against Georgia and we have to do the same against Poland on Tuesday.'

"Uruguay have booked their place at the 2015 World Cup after a second-half salvo saw them beat Russia 36-27 in their play-off at Charrua Stadium in Montevideo. The South Americans will now line up in Pool A alongside hosts England, Wales, Australia and Fiji next year after tries from Joaquin Prada, Alejo Corral and Agustin Ormaechea and a 21-point haul from Felipe Berchesi took them to victory. It will be the third time Uruguay have played at a World Cup after appearances in 1999 and 2003, but they had to come back from 17-12 down at half-time to get there. Uruguay players celebrate their triumph after beating Russia to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup . It is their first appearance at the tournament since 2003 and they will line up alongside England in Pool A . Russia crossed the whitewash twice themselves, through Alexander Ianushkin and Vasily Artemyev, while Yuri Kushnarev kicked 17 points, but they fell just short. After the first leg, which Russia edged 22-21 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, last week, early indications were this was going to be another tense affair as Berchesi and Kushnarev fought an intense kicking duel. They split the posts with four penalties apiece before Russia, who are coached by Raphael Saint-Andre - brother of France boss Philippe, struck the first body blow in first-half stoppage time. Kushnarev made in incisive break on the left and put his half-back partner Ianushkin over in the corner, before missing the conversion in the 42nd minute. It was a score that was against the run of play, with Uruguay time after time failing to make the most of their supremacy up front. Their pack had the edge at both the scrum and breakdown, but their failure to turn that pressure into tries was the difference as Russia took a 17-12 lead at half-time - with Berchesi missing a chance to cut the deficit to two points just before the interval. Kushnarev added another penalty for the visitors, before there was finally some joy for Uruguay with ball in hand in the 47th minute. Russia's centre Mikhail Babaev is tackled by two Uruguayan forwards . Uruguay's Felipe Berchesi kicks the ball to score against the Russians . Uruguay's centre Joaquin Prada runs to score a try against the opposition defence . Centre Prada picked it up from just outside the Russian 22 and his mazy sprint beat three players - including a delightful step inside past Kushnarev - on his way over the whitewash, although questions have to be asked about the sloppy tackling from Russia. Berchesi added the conversion to cut the visitors' lead to a single point. Two tries in nine minutes then put Uruguay in front, with prop Corral finally making the hosts' advantage up front count by crashing over off a maul in the 56th minute, before scrum-half Ormaechea (65) exposed more pitiful Russian tackling. The reliable Berchesi kicked both conversions to give Uruguay a 33-20 lead going into the final 15 minutes. But Russia, down to 14 men after Denis Simplikevich was sent to the sin-bin for a late aerial tackle, set up a thrilling finish when full back Artemyev found a way over in the corner with just three minutes remaining. Kushnarev kicked the conversion to cut the deficit to six points, but Berchesi had the final word with another penalty late on to give Uruguay an aggregate score of 57-49 over the two legs.","Uruguay defeat Russia 36-27 in Montevideo to claim 2015 World Cup spot .

"Eight days is a long time in rugby and Saracens showed on Saturday that they had put last Friday’s crushing defeat by Bath behind them with a performance which occasionally hinted at a return to their best. Mark McCall’s men were slow out of the blocks before hitting their straps midway through the second half to ease home with something to spare. Tom Savage’s 80th-minute try for the visitors put some gloss on the scoreboard and secured a losing bonus-point, but Saracens had this match wrapped up from the moment Chris Ashton powered over for a try midway through the second half. Chris Ashton (R) glides past Gloucester's Billy Twelvetree to score a try for Saracens . Alistair Hargreaves of Saracens scores a try during their 28-21 victory over Gloucester . ‘I thought we bounced back really well,’ said Saracens director of rugby McCall. ‘When you lose like that to Bath the important thing to understand is why you were beaten and why you didn’t get the performance you wanted. ‘It’s important not to overreact or under-react and get to the nub of the problem. I think we’ve been ok at doing that over the past couple of seasons.’ The game was always engaging and, with the artificial Allianz Park pitch set to stand up to whatever the English winter throws at it, Saracens fans can expect more good-quality rugby as the season progresses. In the week that Wasps confirmed their intention to move to Coventry, last season’s beaten Premiership finalists attracted more than 9,000 fans to a ground they purchased just two years ago. As the only remaining Premiership club with a London postcode, Saracens’ marketing men are already licking their lips at the prospect of luring in a tranche of disillusioned Wasps fans ready to consume regular top-flight rugby but unwilling to travel a 150-mile round trip in order to do so. For the time being, Saracens will refrain from making overtures towards the disaffected but the intention is to move in on their rival’s former territory. ‘How long do you have to wait after someone has died until you can ask to buy the contents of their wardrobe?’ one source asked before kick-off. Gloucester's Tom Savage dives in vain as Richard Wigglesworth (L) of Saracens breaks through . England international Twelvetrees missed with two long range kicks . Saracens Charlie Hodgson (L) gave an assured kicking display with three penalties and two conversions . Hargreaves (R) of Saracens kicks to touch past Henry Purdy of Gloucester . But while Wasps’ London future may be terminal, there remains plenty of life in Saracens. With the deepest pockets in the league and one of the biggest squads, the men in black have reason to be optimistic as they head towards Europe with centre Brad Barritt fit and firing again and Owen Farrell also set to return against Clermont next Saturday. Barritt was outstanding yesterday. The No12 got the better of his opposite number Billy Twelvetrees — who started strongly before fading like the rest of his team — and McCall was full of praise. ‘Brad was a real pillar with the ball and was outstanding,’ said McCall. ‘People underestimate Brad. They think he’s a one trick pony and just defends. But there’s much more to his game. Without question he’s the most competitive person I have come across. I’d have him in my international team every day of the week.’ Captain Alistair Hargreaves, one of three Saracens’ try scorers along with Ashton and Chris Wyles, also impressed, while Charlie Hodgson kicked two conversions and two penalties as the home side overturned a 13-3 deficit to win at a canter. Greig Laidlaw kicked 11 points for Gloucester while Rob Cook scored a try before Savage’s late effort. But the visitors were off the pace in the second half and deservedly lost prop Nick Wood to the sin bin after 57 minutes. ‘Saracens showed why they’re a champion team,’ said Gloucester boss David Humphreys.

"Gareth Steenson kicked 19 points and Exeter ran in five tries to bounce back from last weekend's defeat by Newcastle to overrun London Irish in a 44-24 win at Sandy Park. Exeter dominated the opening 40 minutes to lead 30-3 at the break with tries from Carl Rimmer, Henry Slade and Damian Welch. Steenson added three conversions and three penalties with Irish replying with a Shane Geraghty penalty. It took 15 minutes for Exeter to add to their score and then crossed for two tries in as many minutes through Welch and Don Armand, both converted by Steenson. Irish scored three late tries thanks to Blair Cowan (two) and Andrew Fenby, with Geraghty adding the extras. Damian Welch dives over for one of Exeter Chiefs' five tries against London Irish . Chiefs' Gareth Steenson is stopped in his tracks by the visitors' Jebb Sinclair . Don Armand breaks clear past Shane Geraghy to score Exeter's fifth try of a productive afternoon . Exeter made four changes with Mitch Lees returning in the second row, Rimmer started at loosehead prop, Sam Hill at centre and Jack Nowell on the wing plus Armand switched to back row. The visitors also made four changes from the side beaten 19-12 at home to Northampton with Tom Guest returning in the back row, Scott Steele at scrum half, Eamonn Sheridan at outside centre and Topsy Ojo on the left wing. The Chiefs wasted an early opportunity to take the lead when they were awarded a 10-metre penalty almost in front of the posts. Scrum-half Will Chudley took a quick tap penalty but he was stopped on the line and Irish won a turnover ball. But the visitors were awarded a second chance a couple of minutes later from a further five metres out and this time, with Chudley holding the ball on the kicking tee, fly-half Steenson put three points on the board. Henry Slade crosses the line for his side's second try at Sandy Park . It was smiles all around for the Chiefs' players as they bounced back from defeat by Newcastle . London Irish's misery is compounded as David Paice is sent to the sin bin by referee Ian Tempest . Exeter's fly-half Gareth Steenson kicks two of his 19 points in Saturday's rout . Irish responded immediately using the bulk of their pack but the Chiefs defence stood firm against the battering until they conceded a penalty which Geraghty slotted between the uprights to level the scores. The Chiefs scored the opening try when Chudley's pass was knocked into the arms of Rimmer, who powered his way to the line. Referee Ian Tempest, in his first Aviva Premiership match, checked with TMO David Grashoff, before Steenson could add the extras. The Irish defence was caught napping when Chudley found Steenson who provided a slip pass to centre Slade and he found a gap to score a try for the third match in a row with Steenson adding the conversion. Chudley intercepted a stray pass before kicking the ball up field which Matt Jess chased, but full-back Fenby was first to the ball. The visitors conceded another penalty, though, which Steenson drilled between the uprights. London Irish's Andrew Fenby tries to keep on his toes during a disappointing afternoon for his side . Carl Rimmer of Exeter dives over for his side's opening try at Sandy Park . Damian Welch just about crosses the line for another try on Saturday afternoon . David Paice grabs for the ball under pressure from Exeter opponent Phil Dollman . Steenson turned provider for the next try as he fed Nowell; the England wing shrugged off soft tackles and slipped the ball to lock Welch who stormed over the whitewash for the Chiefs' third try converted by Steenson. Irish started the second half brightly but when the Chiefs regained control, 15 minutes after the restart, they secured a try-scoring bonus point with Welch crossing for his second touchdown with Steenson converting from the touchline. The Chiefs wasted little time adding to their scoreline with Nowell side-stepping a couple of players before offloading to Armand who raced in from 25 metres to score his side's fifth try which Steenson duly converted to keep a clean sheet. Frustration crept into the Irish play when replacement scrum half Hayden Thomas attempted to take a quick tap penalty only to be pushed to the ground by hooker David Paice who was duly sent to the sin-bin. With 10 minutes remaining and a man down, Irish crossed for three late tries with two from replacement flanker Cowan and one from Fenby, all converted by Geraghty, as the Exiles succumbed to their first defeat on the road this season.

"Caretaker boss Andy Dawson gave incoming Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins a welcome boost as the Iron romped to a 3-0 victory at Gillingham in League One. Russ Wilcox paid the price for a poor run of results earlier this week, but United responded to the news that Robins will take over on Monday with a resounding success. Aided by the dismissal of Doug Loft, Scunthorpe ended a run of four straight defeats with goals from Paddy Madden, Neal Bishop and Gary McSheffrey, the latter deep in stoppage time. Scunthorpe's Rory Fallon (top) is challenged by Gillingham's John Egan during the Iron's 3-0 win on Saturday . Basement dwellers Crewe also enjoyed a change of fortune when beating Coventry 2-1, with Febian Brandy and George Cooper putting Alex in control before an Anthony Grant own goal gave City hope, only for Jack Finch to see red and the fightback fade. Meanwhile, Bristol City moved five points clear at the top of the table after a Wes Burns strike three minutes into stoppage time earned them a 3-2 win over Chesterfield at Ashton Gate. The leaders twice went ahead through an Ian Evatt own goal and a Derrick Williams effort, but were pegged back by an Eoin Doyle double, the first from the penalty spot, until substitute Burns secured the victory. Crewe's George Cooper (left) celebrates scoring with Adam Turton in his side's 2-1 win against Coventry . With Swindon not in action, Peterborough were promoted to second thanks to a 4-1 triumph at Crawley, where Michael Smith, Christian Burgess, Marcus Maddison and Conor Washington netted for Posh after they had fallen behind early on to an Izale McLeod opener. There was late drama at Bramall Lane as Sheffield United scored in the 90th minute and then in the first minute of stoppage time through Marc McNulty and Paddy McCarthy to take the lead against 10-man Leyton Orient, but Romain Vincelot leveled it up at 2-2 when netting for the visitors nine minutes into time added on. Jay Simpson had earlier put the O's in front in the first half, but caretaker boss Kevin Nugent then saw Jobi McAnuff sent off before the action-packed closing stages.

"Samu Manoa scored his first ever hat-trick as Aviva Premiership champions Northampton powered to a comfortable 43-10 victory over Sale at Franklin's Gardens. Brothers George and Ken Pisi and fellow Samoan Kahn Fotuali'i also crossed as Saints registered six tries in total, while Stephen Myler kicked 13 points in a dominant display. Mark Jennings grabbed a consolation try for a spirited but over-run Sale, who have now lost four of their opening six matches. Samu Manoa (left) celebrates scoring his first ever Premership hat-trick for Northampton . Manoa dives over for his second try of the afternoon . Sale started with intent, twice kicking penalties into the corner, but despite Marc Jones coming within a metre of making that bold statement even louder, it failed to bring them any points. Courtney Lawes got over the ball to stop Jones and then had a hand - or two - in the first points of the game as he charged down Jennings' kick and the resulting pressure brought an easy penalty for Myler to make it 3-0 after seven minutes. Some fantastic footwork from Ken Pisi then saw him score the opening try after 16 minutes. With seemingly nothing on 20 metres out, he danced around a static Jonny Leota, handed off another tackle and dotted down. Myler missed the conversion to leave the home side 8-0 in front. Four minutes later Northampton had their second try when Jones' throw overshot the lineout on his five metre line. Manoa gladly collected the throw to roll over and the extras made it 15-0. Ken Pisi runs through to score the opening try for Northampton . His brother George Pisi dives through to score a try for Saints against Sale . Sale responded with a penalty from Danny Cipriani but any jubilation was short-lived as Saints crossed again. Ken Pisi was on his right wing when Myler pinged a cross-kick to him, and the winger won the aerial tussle with Tom Arscott before sending older brother George over in the corner. Myler was again successful from the touchline to make it 22-3 seven minutes before the break. Sale ended the half as they had begun it, pressurising Northampton's try-line from a five metre lineout, but they again failed to convert it and had only Cipriani's penalty to take show for their efforts at half-time. Lawes had a try scrubbed off by the TMO for a foot in touch three minutes after the break, but the bonus point did eventually come from a lineout drive. This time Manoa was on the back of it for his second try, which Myler converted on 54 minutes. Stephen Myler kicked 13 points for the Saints in a dominant display . Northampton pressed the repeat button four minutes later as Manoa hung on the back of another five metre lineout drive for his hat-trick. Sale had the consolation of not only scoring a try but running in the best one of the match, as a sweeping move from inside their half saw Jennings dive under the posts. Joe Ford's conversion made it 36-10. But the Saints forwards, with their replacement front-row including England hooker Dylan Hartley, reasserted their dominance by shunting backwards a Sale scrum on the visitors' five metre line. The ball squirted out for Fotuali'i to pick up and complete the rout.","Manoa runs over hat-trick in comfortable win for Northampton .

"London Welsh fell to their sixth consecutive defeat in the Aviva Premiership as they were convincingly beaten 23-3 by Newcastle at the Kassam Stadium. Newcastle dominated and showed more invention with Scott Lawson and Mark Wilson lively in the forwards and Juan Pablo Socino orchestrating matters from fly-half and giving three-quarters Adam Powell and Sinoti Sinoti space to illustrate their attacking flair. Powell, Wilson and Ruki Tipuna were the visitors' try-scorers with Socino kicking two penalties and Rory Clegg a conversion. A penalty from Olly Barkley was Welsh's sole response as they slipped eight points behind the Falcons. Newcastle Falcons centre Adam Powell crosses for his side's first try in their 23-3 win at Kassam Stadium . Powell celebrates his try as the Falcons inflict a sixth consecutive defeat on London Welsh in Oxford . Following last week's heavy defeat at Harlequins, London Welsh made five changes to their starting line-up. Recent loan signing Chris Hala'ufia was introduced at No 8, while Pablo Henn, Nathan Morris, Richard Thorpe and Matt Corker were all recalled as Welsh sought their first win of the season. Newcastle were unchanged after they picked up their first Premiership win of the season against Exeter last Sunday and they were ahead after only two minutes when Socino fired over an excellent penalty from the touchline. Welsh soon responded with a penalty from Barkley but the visitors had much the better of the opening 15 minutes and deservedly scored the opening try of the game. Socino's pass to Dom Barrow breached the home defence, before Barrow fed Mark Wilson, who in turn sent Powell in for the try, with Socino missing the simple conversion. Ruki Tipuna, one of the Falcons' three try-scorers clears his lines during the Aviva Premiership clash . Welsh were dealt a further blow when prop, Taione Vea, limped off to be replaced by Jack Gilding before they nearly conceded another try. A Welsh movement broke down on half-way allowing Socino to punt long into the home in-goal area. There was a race for the touchdown which was narrowly won by Welsh hooker, Morris, whose fingertips deprived visitors wing, Sinoti, of the score. Elementary errors were preventing Welsh from building up any momentum and after 28 minutes they fell further behind when Socino kicked his second penalty. Halau'fia then produced a shuddering tackle on Falcons' prop, Scott Wilson which caused referee, Wayne Barnes, to view the replay of the incident several times. Eventually he awarded a penalty to the visitors but Socino's routine penalty attempt rebounded back off a post. Mark Wilson (centre) was instrumental in a lively Newcastle forward pack in their convincing victory . Newcastle lost their impressive centre, Gonzalo Tiesi, to injury and he was replaced by Clegg but it did not impede their progress as they scored their second try with the final play of the first half. Powell and Sinoti combined well to gain their side a platform in the opposition 22 before Mark Wilson crashed over for the try to give the Falcons a 16-3 half-time lead. The first ten minutes of the second half saw Welsh have their best period of the match. Inspired by Hala'ufia they battered the Falcons' line but could not break down their stubborn defence and Newcastle immediately made them pay by breaking away to score the decisive try. Gonzalo Tiesi (right) skips through the Welsh defence as Falcons claim their second win on the trot . Sinotti and Wilson again combined to give Tipuna an easy run-in for the try which Clegg converted. Newcastle made a raft of substitutions, which allowed the home side to dominate the final quarter. With 11 minutes to go, Wilson was yellow carded as the Falcons struggled to stem the tide but even against 14 men, Welsh still could not make a breakthrough.","London Welsh fell to a sixth consecutive Premiership defeat .

"An historic Grade Two-listed county hall has been subjected to 'shocking' damage after being wrecked by drug addicts and homeless people. The imposing County Hall in Ipswich, for decades the centre of local government in Suffolk, has fallen into disrepair and been systematically destroyed by junkies, yobs and vandals. The revered 176-year-old structure, built the year before Queen Victoria came to the throne, has seen its fireplaces ripped out and wooden panelling stripped, while there is a tree growing through a smashed window. Torn apart: A hallway in hallway in County Hall has smashed windows and floorboards removed after falling into disrepair . Disrepair: Loose wiring litters the floor of the hall, while parts of the wall have been torn down or are falling off . Neglected: An upper landing in County Hall shows the bad condition of the historic building . Photographers who specialise in charting urban building damage have revealed how the hall is completely unsecure, with mattresses inside indicating that drug addicts and tramps have taken up residence inside. The Ipswich building was Suffolk's County Hall until 2004. Built at the start of the Victorian era in 1836, the grand hall functioned as Ipswich's courthouse in its early days, and became County Hall in 1906. After being renovated in the 1980s, it was closed in 2004 when Ipswich Borough Council moved to Endeavour House, a new building in a different part of the town. Ipswich Borough Council are said to have met the building's owners earlier this year to try to ensure it was secured. One photographer who took images inside the building said: 'Inside the whole place has been trashed. Broken windows are a common feature inside the hall, which was last occupied in 2004 . Wrecked: Ceiling panels litter the floor in County Hall, now thought to be occupied by drug addicts and homeless people . A smashed window shows the imposing view from the building, pictured right in its heyday . 'It is totally unsecured and there was no problem getting in at all. Once inside it was shocking to see. 'There are mattresses inside so it is clear that people are living there and there are signs of people using it to take drugs.' The council was so concerned that it was placed on its 'Buildings at Risk' register earlier this year. Councillor with responsibility for planning and development at the borough, Carole Jones, was horrified to hear how the once glorious county hall has been torn apart. Cllr Jones said: 'We had thought it had been secured. 'This is dreadful news and we shall have to see what can be done. Imposing: County Hall in Ipswich was last used by the town's borough council in 2004 . 'I know the police are concerned about the building as well.' There are no immediate plans to redevelop County Hall, which was sold by the council shortly after it moved out of the building. Labour's Bryony Rudkin was county council leader at the time of its move to Endeavour House eight years ago. Outraged by the attacks on the building, she said: 'It's never been a beautiful building but it is very imposing and it has a great deal of history there.'","Imposing County Hall, Ipswich was last used by local authority in 2004 .

"Rolf Harris abused at least 19 women and children, including a celebrity, it can now be revealed. Many were prepared to testify, but prosecutors decided to concentrate on the strongest cases. Police mugshot: 84-year-old Rolf Harris is facing a lengthy jail term after he was found guilty of using his fame to abuse four victims, including two children, over 18 years . HIS DAUGHTER’S BEST FRIEND: She was just three years old when she first met Rolf Harris after becoming best friends with his daughter Bindi. Within a decade he was molesting the ‘excruciatingly shy’ teenager, using her ‘like a toy’ in a sickening abuse of trust that continued for 16 years. The victim said she ‘felt dead’ after being repeatedly assaulted by the entertainer, who used her for his sexual gratification as if she was a ‘blow-up doll’. Her nightmare started when she was 13 after being invited on a five-week holiday in Hawaii with the Harris family. Harris pounced on her in a hotel suite, touching the ‘shocked and panicked’ girl intimately as she came out of a shower wearing just a towel. Days later, he molested her again – just yards from his sunbathing wife and daughter – after handing her a towel as she emerged from the sea. The abuse continued after they returned from holiday, with the teen saying she ‘felt disgusted’ for letting him do it but was afraid to speak out. On one occasion he even performed a sex act on her in Bindi’s bedroom while his daughter slept close by. She said: ‘He didn’t feel inhibited. I think he got a thrill out of it. From the look on his face – he was looking over at Bindi and then just carried on.’ Harris regularly abused the youngster in her own bedroom on visits to her home, before returning downstairs to make jokes with her parents. Unable to cope, she was binge-drinking by the age of 14. The abuse continued into adulthood, by which time she had been ‘psychologically destroyed and trained to perform like a pet’, the court heard. He touched her intimately in his dressing room at Wimbledon Theatre just before he was due to perform in Cinderella. The woman finally confronted him when she was in her early 30s, prompting him to apologise and write a letter to her father pleading for forgiveness for his behaviour – but insisting it had been an affair which began after she was 18. She finally resolved to report him to police after watching him perform his hit Two Little Boys at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. She said: ‘The TV was on and Rolf Harris was on and I thought, “I just can’t get away from this bloody man”. ‘I just burst into tears... it was like he was invading my home. That’s when I decided that I wasn’t going to have any more of it.’ Asked why she had taken so long to go to the authorities, she replied: ‘I was just so scared of him. He was this big man on the telly and I thought no one would believe me.’ VERDICT: Guilty on all seven counts . Disgraced: After the verdicts were read Harris raised his eyebrows to his wife Alwen, who was sat watching in the public gallery with his daughter Bindi . THE YOUNG FAN: Harris’s youngest victim was just seven when he groped her at a community centre in Portsmouth after she asked for his autograph in 1969. When she got on stage, he plunged his ‘big hairy hands’ between her legs ‘aggressively’, fondling her twice. VERDICT: Guilty on one count . THE WAITRESS: A 13-year-old girl was groped by Harris after watching him entertain a crowd of people in Cambridge by crouching on all fours like a dog. The woman, who is now in her 50s, told how Harris slipped his arm around her, rubbing his hands down from her shoulders to her bottom as she froze in shock. Harris claimed that she was lying and said he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago. But the jury later saw footage of him taking part in a TV show in the town in 1978. VERDICT: Guilty on one count . AND OTHER VICTIMS  WHO CAME FORWARD . THE CELEBRITY: A familiar face on our screens for decades, the TV presenter was interviewing Harris live on air almost 20 years ago when she suddenly felt his hand ‘worming’ its way under her skirt, gripping her thigh and grasping at her knickers. Recoiling in horror, she stopped the interview, calling out for a commercial break. Guilty: Rolf Harris, 84, was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault today, pictured leaving court with his daughter Bindi (left), wife Alwen(right) and niece Jenny Harris (far right) Lies: Harris had claimed that he was the victim of malicious lies, and was being punished for his infidelity, but the jury believed the women who said he abused them . Scrum: Harris scrambles into a waiting limousine and will return to court on Friday where he will be sentenced for his sex crimes . ‘You can see the look of astonishment on her face when she feels his indecent assault,’ Sasha Wass, QC, prosecuting, told a pre-trial hearing. The household name came forward at the start of the trial, but she was not allowed to testify after Harris’s lawyers said it would be impossible to investigate her claims before the close of the case. THE MICHAEL PARKINSON PARTY: Harris grabbed a young waitress during a party for TV star Michael Parkinson at a Berkshire pub about ten years ago, kissing her neck in front of his wife Alwen. THE HOLIDAYMAKER: A vulnerable 24-year-old woman was attacked after meeting Harris while on holiday with friends in 1999. He pounced on the victim – who suffered from psychiatric problems – in a garden before later climbing into bed with her and sexually assaulting her while she was sleeping. THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTER: A teenage girl was attacked at a fete in Harris’s home town of Bray after approaching him for an autograph around 1996. Harris was posing for photographs when he told her he liked her jumper ‘and wanted to see what was underneath it’. THE YOUNG ARTIST: Harris was posing for photographs at an art competition in London in 2001 when he pinched the bottom of a 20-year-old. THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTERS: During the trial, two Australian broadcasters waived their right to anonymity to tell how he sexually assaulted them. Perth radio show host Jane Marwick, 45, said he grabbed her breast while posing for a photograph with her in 2001. Verity James, also from Perth, said after a pre-recorded interview Harris leant in for a hug and ‘felt her up’ in the late 1990s or early 2000s.","The 84-year-old Australian abused four women between 1968 and 1986 .

"Scientists in Siberia have found the first ever well-preserved sample of blood from a . woolly mammoth, which could be used to recreate the extinct . species. The 10,000-year-old blood was sealed inside ice beneath the carcass of a female mammoth. Preserved muscle tissue was also found from the creature, aged between 50 and 60 when she died, according to the Russian team who made the . discovery on islands off the northern coast of Siberia. A researcher from the Museum of Mammoths of the Institute of Applied Ecology at the North-Eastern Federal University, pictured, working near a carcass of the female mammoth found on a remote island off the coast of Siberia in May . A researcher from the North-Eastern Federal University in Siberia holds a test tube with a sample of  well-preserved blood found in a carcass of a female woolly mammoth. The sample was discovered on a remote island in the Arctic Ocean and is thought to be the first discovery of its kind . In the hit 1993 film, Richard . Attenborough hires scientists who use dinosaur DNA taken from a mosquito . preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park. The resulting chaos showed that man and dinosaur should not co-exist. Last year a controversial Australian billionaire was believed to be drawing up secret plans for a real life Jurassic Park. Mining . magnate Clive Palmer, who has already embarked on a project to rebuild . the Titanic, was rumoured to be working with the team who created Dolly . the sheep. It was said the park would be based at Palmer's super resort in Coolum. But . the research has shown the dinosaurs may have to stay on the big screen . - as their DNA is just too old to be able to use for de-extinction. However, Korean scientists are hoping that the samples found on the Siberian woolly mammoth aren't too old. They plan to take the DNA samples and reassemble them into a full genome. This could then be injected into embryonic cells which have had their own DNA . taken out, and a suitable living surrogate would be found. According to The Siberian Times, the blood will now be made available to South Korean scientists seeking to use . mammoth DNA to bring creatures back to life. The find - said to be the first time mammoth blood has been discovered - . comes amid a hotly contested debate over the morality of Jurassic . Park-style projects to restore extinct creatures to the planet, with . some scientists insisting it will be impossible to get exactly the same . mammoths as once roamed Siberia. Semyon Grigoriev, head of the Museum of Mammoths of the Institute of . Applied Ecology of the North at the North Eastern Federal University . told The Siberian Times: 'We were really surprised to find mammoth blood . and muscle tissue.' He hailed it as 'the best preserved mammoth in the history of paleontology'. 'It is the first time we managed to obtain mammoth blood. No-one has ever seen before how the mammoth's blood flows.' The mammoth was found in an ice tomb in the New Siberian Islands, or . Novosibirsk Islands, and parts of the carcass are especially well . preserved because they remained entirely frozen for 10,000 years. 'The approximate age of this animal is about 10,000 years old,' said Dr Grigoriev. 'It has been preserved thanks to the special conditions, due to the fact that it did not defrost and then freeze again. As well as a sample of blood, Russian scientists also discovered a well-preserved sample of muscle tissue from the woolly mammoth carcass. The blood and tissue were preserved because they were buried in an ice tomb on the Novosibirsk islands for what's thought to have been 10,000 years . 'We suppose that the mammoth fell into water or got bogged down in a swamp, could not free herself and died. 'Due to this fact the lower part of the body, including the lower jaw, and tongue tissue, was preserved very well. 'The upper torso and two legs, which were in the soil, were gnawed by . prehistoric and modern predators and almost did not survive.' The hope now is that at least one living cell of the mammoth was preserved 'although even with such well-preserved remains, this may not be the case.' 'It is great luck that the blood preserved and we plan to study it carefully,"" Dr Grigoriev continued. 'For now our suspicion is that  mammoth blood contains a kind of natural anti-freeze.' Samples taken from the mammoth include 'blood, blood vessels, glands, soft tissue, in a word - everything that we could. The Woolly Mammoth, related to the elephant, lived on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago. Scientists are hoping to use well-preserved DNA from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass to bring the species back from the dead . 'Luckily we had taken with us on our expedition a special preservative agent for blood.' The samples have been taken for study to Yakutsk, capital of the Republic of . Sakha, also known as Yakutia, the largest region in the Russian . Federation. The carcass weighing around one tonne has been moved to the Siberian mainland and is being kept in a ice storage. The blood and other samples will then be available to South . Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk's private bioengineering laboratory, . which has confirmed it is working with other mammoth DNA samples in a . bid to return the extinct Siberian mammoth to the planet. The eventual plan is to plant an implanted egg into a live elephant for a 22-month pregnancy. Earlier this year a group of scientists from around the world met for TEDx conference in Washington, sponsored by National Geographic. The Dodo evolved without any natural predators, but it was forced into extinction by humans who killed them all for food. It is one of 24 creatures  recently discussed during a TEDx conference on bringing animals back from extinction - also known as 'de-extinction' Another animal considered for 'de-extinction' at the TEDx conference was the Quagga - a species of plains Zebra that once lived in South Africa. The last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 . The group were discussing the possibility of bringing 24 animals back from extinction, also known as 'de-extinction'. The animals included the dodo bird, the Carolina Parakeet, last . seen in 1904 in Florida, and the Quagga, a plains zebra which once lived . in South Africa but died out in 1883. However, a real life Jurassic Park is not an option, it is said, because dinosaur DNA is just too old. Earlier this month, scientists from University of Cincinnati claimed that a giant meteor was probably responsible for wiping out the woolly mammoth, and not hunting, which researchers previously thought was the reason. They believe a huge meteor smashing through the Earth's atmosphere broke up into ten million tonnes of fiery fragments, scattering over four continents. These fragments are thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun, causing temperatures to plummet, plants to die and landscapes to alter forever. The woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the Earth, not by overhunting as previously believed . Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that this caused the extinction, countering previous theories that the spread of human settlements and aggressive hunting was to blame. After the impact, some animal species, like humans, adapted by either moving away, downsizing to adapt to the resources around them, or simply changed their way of life to cope. But other species, including the woolly mammoth which roamed throughout Europe, parts of Asia and North America in vast numbers, did not adapt and were wiped out in a generation. The research says the impact changed the course of the Earth's history forever. According to anthropologist and geology professor Kenneth Tankersley, the change from booming population to total extinction happened 'within a lifetime'. The University of Cincinnati professor said: ‘Imagine living in a time when you look outside and there are elephants walking around Cincinnati. ‘But by the time you are at the end of your years there are no more elephants. It happens within your lifetime.’ Working with scientists all over the world, the team found evidence of burnt out fragments of carbon - called spherules - in sites on four continents, and all dating back 12,800 years. A meteor is thought to have stuck the Earth 12,800 years ago releasing toxic gases into the air and temporarily blocking out the sun causing temperatures to plummet . They examined the bedrock dating back to the ice age in 20 archaeological sites in the world which date back to this formative period in the Earth's history. The timing matches the known dates of the last woolly mammoths to roam the planet, along with other ice age creatures like the sabre tooth tiger. A meteorite hitting the Earth's surface or simply breaking up as it passed through the atmosphere, would cause a sudden and drastic change in the weather. Professor Tankersley said: ‘This likely cause climate change and climate change forced this scenario. You can move, downsize or you can go extinct. ‘Humans at the time were just as resourceful and intelligent as we are today. With mammoth off the dinner table, humans were forced to adapt which they did to great success.’ He added that the lessons learned from that time could apply to today as the Earth again goes through a period of ‘rapid and profound’ climate change. He said: ‘It's a reminder of how fragile we are. Imagine an explosion that happened today that went across four continents. ‘The human species would go on. But it would be different. It would be a game changer.’","Russian scientists found the blood and muscle tissue samples buried in an ice tomb on the Novosibirsk Islands off the northern coast of Siberia .

"England goalkeeper Joe Hart has opened talks with Manchester City about a new four-year contract after receiving assurances that he is seen as the club's long-term No 1. Hart, 27, has returned to top form after a shaky start to the season and is keen to extend his stay at The Etihad before his current deal runs out in 2016. City's Director of Football Txiki Begiristain is currently trying to structure a deal that would mean a pay rise for the £80,000-a-week goalkeeper while allowing the club to stay within Financial Fair Play regulations. Joe Hart will be rewarded for his fine Manchester City form with a new long-term contract . The England stopper (right) has come under pressure from new signing Willy Caballero this season . Hart will view the final offer as evidence of whether City regard him as one of their main players, having already sorted out long-term deals with David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Vincent Kompany. The 6ft 4in stopper has admitted feeling unhappy when left out by City manager Manuel Pellegrini with the manager saying he had two first-choice goalkeepers in Hart and £6million summer signing Willy Caballero. But having won two Premier League titles and the FA Cup and become City's longest-serving player since the departure of Micah Richards, Hart would like to stay and challenge for more trophies. Hart is No 1 for club and country, seeing some rare action in England's comfortable San Marino win . The goalkeeper makes a flying stop to deny Aston Villa's Charles N'Zogbia in the club's last game . Initial discussions with Begiristain have been amicable with Hart left feeling he is part of the club's long-term future, though he is still awaiting the precise financial terms of a deal that would keep him at the club until the summer of 2018. Hart was dropped for two months last season after a high-profile error against Chelsea but reclaimed his place to lead City to their second title in three seasons. He acknowledged his disappointment at Caballero facing Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City last month, declaring at a press conference with Pellegrini sat next to him: 'Of course I want to play every game. That’s my nature, my professionalism. I always want to play but I’m not the manager. 'I live by the decisions of our manager. I think he knows that I’d love to play but he has to make decisions.' Hart will face Estonia on Sunday in England's latest Euro 2016 qualifier. He was cheekily voted man-of-the-match by England fans against San Marino on Thursday despite having virtually nothing to do.

"Once tipped for greatness like his Everton Academy team-mate Ross Barkley, Gerard Kinsella hit rock bottom with a telephone call from his club Fleetwood Town in February 2013. Kinsella was ordered in and it was confirmed he had failed a drugs test. The anabolic steroid nandrolone had been discovered in his system and once the wheels of justice had turned, he was hit with a two-year ban — the longest punishment for any current professional player in England. But behind the bald facts of a so-called ‘drugs cheat’ is a tragic story of a young player driven to depression and despair by the difficulties he faced trying to achieve his dream. VIDEO Scroll down to watch former team-mate  Barkley score a beauty in England training . Gerard Kinsella is on the road to recovery after a series of setbacks . The former Everton youngster had a string of injury problems and was hit with a drugs ban last year . Encouragingly, the major powers in English football have also shown a human side and Kinsella has revealed in an exclusive interview with The Mail On Sunday that he has just been given the green light by the FA to resume training again with a football club — the first step in what he hopes will be a successful comeback. Kinsella always maintained he never deliberately took performance-enhancing drugs. He was in constant agony caused by a chronic shoulder injury that saw it come out of its socket every day in training. When his cousin Neil Kinsella offered pain relief with an injection, Gerard agreed out of desperation, not suspecting he might be contravening anti-doping regulations. That summer of 2013 when the ban was imposed passed in a blur for Kinsella, who was 21 at the time. ‘I thought, that’s me finished,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t be bothered with football any more. My head was gone. ‘I kept playing it over in my mind. I was sure my chance in football was over and all I’d ever be remembered for was failing a drugs test.’ It seemed a devastating end to a once promising career. Having first joined Everton at the tender age of seven, Kinsella was held in high regard at the club during his teenage years. But the FA has given him the green light to find a new club and start training again . He had been on the books at Everton since the age of just seven . Experienced coaches there including Kevin Sheedy, a league championship and European trophy winner with the club, and academy director Ray Hall thought he would make it along with another emerging youngster, Barkley. But the downward spiral began when he suffered the first dislocation of his shoulder. What happened next would fill a medical journal. Two operations on his shoulder, a fractured metatarsal, broken collar bone, torn cartilage, viral meningitis and four separate ankle ligament injuries, the worst after chipping an ankle with the Republic of Ireland Under-16s. Everton manager David Moyes reluctantly let him go at 19. But spells at Plymouth Argyle and Fleetwood, punctuated by a loan spell at Conference club Telford, saw the curse continue. So when Neil offered him a cure for the pain, Kinsella foolishly took it. He said: ‘Looking back, I was just desperate. I was going to training and my shoulder was popping out all the time. Sometimes, it wouldn’t even be a tackle. I’d just be running and it happened. ‘I felt a fraud. I couldn’t call myself a footballer because I couldn’t train or play properly. I hadn’t had a full season since I was 16.’ Fleetwood, then in League Two, ripped up his contract when the ban was confirmed. At Kinsella’s lowest ebb, an unlikely saviour stepped forward. His brother Michael, a former junior goalkeeper with Liverpool, had been in prison for drug smuggling when Gerard went through his injury hell. Kinsella for Everton during the Premier Academy League Final match against Fulham in 2011 . Kinsella was a former team-mate of current Everton and England star Ross Barkley . Former Everton boss David Moyes reluctantly let Kinsella leave the club when he was 19 . Now back out and clean, Michael decided to make up for lost time and help his younger sibling. He arranged for the shoulder injury to be cleared up properly, with one of the country’s leading surgeons operating on Gerard for five hours. Michael also persuaded the leading stakeholders in football that his brother was a victim of circumstance rather than a deliberate drugs cheat. The players’ union, the PFA, arranged for Gerard to use the facilities used by England players at St George’s Park because his ban prevented him from training with football clubs. Most importantly, the FA’s disciplinary committee decided to allow him to train again with a football club from November 5, ahead of the complete lifting of his playing ban on February 4, 2015. The midfielder will take advantage by training with his local club AFC Liverpool from the North West Counties Football League, though the longer-term hope would be to play higher up the pyramid. ‘This will be like starting all over again,’ he says. A fortnight ago, Kinsella was shopping in Liverpool town centre and by chance bumped into his pal Barkley, now an England international. ‘Of course we stopped and chatted to each other, we played together for years didn’t we,’ said Kinsella. ‘Funnily enough, the conversation wasn’t about football, more about how we’re doing and everything else. Ross was a talent even at 14, it’s no surprise to me he’s flying now.’ The pair could not have travelled in more opposite directions since their youth-team days. But training with AFC Liverpool next month is a huge date in Kinsella’s diary. The dream is still alive.","Kinsella was once tipped for greatness at Everton's Academy .

"Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling was given a private pep talk by England manager Roy Hodgson in Tallinn on Saturday night as the Three Lions were told 'No excuses' against a Estonia team ranked 81st in the world. Hodgson noticeably pulled Sterling to one side as the other England players made a close inspection of the pitch they will be playing on at Le Coq Arena. The 19-year-old has struggled to make an impact in recent games and was taken off at half-time in the 5-0 victory against San Marino on Thursday night, with Hodgson saying afterwards he could always learn from Wayne Rooney how to handle pressure as a young player. VIDEO Scroll down to see Hodgon's view from the dugout on Sunday night . England manager Roy Hodgson will announce the team on Saturday night to the players at their Tallinn hotel .

Sterling and England manager Roy Hodgson chat ahead of the Three Lions press conference on Saturday . Hodgson gives Sterling bits of advice as they inspect the pitch on Saturday before training at the stadium . Hodgson refused to give details of his one-on-one with Sterling, saying: 'I am not to disclose what Raheem and I were talking about. I don't go around telling people what I've been talking about. 'It is not unusual to chat with players. Of course with everyone watching there will be speculation. I will allow the speculation to run wild but I don't intend to fuel it in any way.' Hodgson has admitted that he would have liked more time to prepare for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifer even though England will be hot favourites to maintain their 100 per cent record in the group, just 72 hours after beating San Marino 5-0 in a one-sided contest at Wembley. The performance of substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (pictured) has given Hodgson food for thought . Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka board the plane on Saturday ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier . Strangely, Hodgson said there was a 'little bit of tiredness' among his players because they had so much of the ball against San Marino and Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph may in line for a recall at the expense of James Milner. Delph was one of England's key players in their impressive opening group game victory away to Switzerland. But the England manager also warned Wayne Rooney and his team-mates the quick turnaround between matches is not a reason to take their foot off the pedal against opponents who were beaten 1-0 in Lithuania on the same night. Hodgson said: 'It is the same for both teams. Estonia have had two days to recover like us and they had to return from an away match. This qualifying campaign is a new format, in the past it was every team playing at the same time, now the games are spread. England goalkeeper Joe Hart will look to have another quiet night like he did in the win against San Marino . Danny Welbeck will hope to have an influence on England's attacking line-up on Sunday against Estonia . 'We have to come to terms with that but I am confident we will be fresh. But if you asked me if I would prefer more time, I would. Maybe we will in future qualifiers. 'We have a lot of respect for Estonia, they have come a long way since I faced them in 1992 shortly after they became independent. 'We have had two scouts studying every Estonia game since the draw was made so I've got no excuses about how they play. I can't say I didn't realise what they were good at. We know it will be different kettle of fish to San Marino.' Unusually, England decided not train at the matchday venue, Le Coq Arena, because of their schedule caused by two games in quick succession, but they did take a stroll to check on the surface, which captain Rooney declared as 'excellent'. Rooney, sat alongisde Hodgson, was asked if England could win all 10 group games and go to France 2016 with the perfect record. 'We would like to do that but the most important thing is to qualify and be in the draw for the European Championship,' he said.","England take on Estonia on Sunday in Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Gareth Barry was just 18 when he first played at Old Trafford in 1999. Manchester United had won the Treble five months earlier and his Aston Villa side never had a chance. Sure enough, United won 3-0 with goals from a trio of all-time club greats Paul Scholes, Andy Cole and Roy Keane. But visits to the so-called Theatre of Dreams no longer cause fear and dread in the away dressing-room. Indeed, when Barry arrives with Everton on Sunday, he will be chasing his fourth win in three years at Old Trafford, after triumphing twice with Manchester City (6-1 and 2-1) and last season with Everton (1-0), their first in 21 years.

Barry has enjoyed some good times at Old Trafford, pictured celebrating a win for his Manchester City side . Despite a £150million spending spree in the summer, United do not have the same aura about them as the old days, says Barry. Asked if the fear factor has gone, the 53-cap ex-England midfielder pulls no punches. ‘It took me 12 years to win a Premier League game there but now I have won the last three times. That is just my experience but it sort of shows you that maybe it’s not what it once was,’ he said. ‘Our manager (Roberto Martinez) has drummed into the players that we are good enough and this club is big enough to be going to places like Old Trafford and get results.’ While United can boast world stars Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, an injury and suspension crisis at the back may require Paddy McNair to continue at centre-half. Then Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry (centre) chases Danny Welbeck (right) in 2011 . Barry's first experience of playing at Old Trafford was with Aston Villa, shown challenging Phil Neville in 2002 . Even so, it is also Barry’s job as one of his team’s most experienced players to caution team-mates that even without suspended captain Wayne Rooney, United are still dangerous. ‘We need to show them the respect they deserve. They have got loads of talent, and if they put it together on the day they can probably beat anybody so it’s down to us to produce a good performance. ‘I am sure it was a new experience for the players here last season to win away to United. It was fantastic to win there last season and a significant result. ‘Everton hadn’t won there for many years and there was a great feeling in the dressing room afterwards to break that duck and put in a great performance. ‘That was a big focal point last season for the confidence of the club, to come away from there with three points. And I am sure we will be trying to do it again.’ Martinez has his expectations high. ‘We don’t want to be going to places looking at damage limitation or merely hoping for a result,’ he said.","Gareth Barry was just 18 when he first visited Old Trafford as a player .

"Saido Berahino is the leading English goalscorer in this season's Premier League – a remarkable story for the boy from Burundi who escaped to this country at the age of 10 to avoid a bloody civil war. Berahino scored his sixth goal of the season, fifth in the league, with a well-struck penalty that he earned in West Brom's 2-1 defeat against Liverpool at Anfield and manager Alan Irvine – who coached a young Wayne Rooney – knows he has another special talent on his hands. 'Everyone is talking about Saido and understandably so,' said Irvine. 'He is very professional in the way he works and I have no doubt he will improve because of that.

But having been given it, for Saido to step up and taki it with such conviction was great. 'He practises and got the benefit of all that practise.

"England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino has revealed how religion helped him cope with last season’s despair at West Brom under former manager Pepe Mel. Berahino’s promising career dramatically hit the rocks when he was involved in a bust-up with team-mate James Morrison and then pictured taking laughing gas. With Mel dropping him from the team, Berahino, who came to England as a refugee from war-torn Burundi at the age of 10, admitted to feeling isolated and going off the rails. West Brom striker Saido Berahino scored in the Capital One cup in midweek against Hull . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike against Hull as he hopes to continue impressing manager Alan Irvine . ‘I felt alone, there was no one I could go to and get advice from at the club,’ said the 21-year-old striker, who had burst on the scene with a hat-trick on his full Albion debut and the winner against Manchester United at Old Trafford. ‘I was thrown into a Premier League environment I didn’t know much about. I was learning as I was going and losing Steve Clarke [the West Brom manager sacked to make way for Mel] touched me. I kind of lost myself.’ He believes that Christianity — and his family — proved his saviour in tough times. The striker has been in brilliant form for England's U21 side, who have qualified for Euro 2015 next June . ‘God has been a big influence in my life and I think that faith helped me through,’ he said. ‘I’ve prayed for forgiveness because we’re all sinners at the end of the day.’ Berahino hit rock-bottom when he was allegedly punched by Morrison in a dressing-room row last March when the team were facing the drop. Mel felt he could not trust the striker and the youngster blotted his copybook in April, when he inhaled nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, from a balloon while sitting in his Range Rover. The arrival of Alan Irvine as the club’s new manager in the summer looks to have reversed his fortunes. Berahino burst onto the scene a year ago, scoring the winner at Manchester United for West Brom . Irvine was a surprise choice but his record developing young players, including Wayne Rooney at Everton, is admirable and Berahino has responded with three goals already this season. ‘Everyone in the building gets on well with him [Irvine], from the staff in the kitchen to the players. We needed someone like that to bring us all together,’ said Berahino, who will hope to add to his goal tally against Burnley today. Berahino has already played over 70 first-team games, more than Daniel Sturridge or Danny Welbeck at the same age, and would like to follow them into the England team and the Champions League. ‘That’s definitely my ambition. If they’ve done it, why can’t I?’ he said. ‘Playing for England means so much to me because this country gave me a second chance.’","21-year-old claims religion helped him through last season's despair .

"Everton striker Samuel Eto’o is so famous even his team-mates were a little bit starstruck when he first arrived at Goodison Park. Eto’o, 33, has only made two substitutes appearances ahead of Sunday's clash with Crystal Palace but it hasn’t stopped the former Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Chelsea superstar making his mark. ‘I must say when he first signed and came into training, it was a bit “That’s Samuel Eto’o there!” admitted forward Steven Naismith. Steven Naismith has been impressed with Samuel Eto'o since the Cameroonian sealed a move to the Toffees . Eto'o joined Everton on a free transfer after being deemed surplus to requirements by former side Chelsea . The Everton striker will be hoping to get on the scoresheet against Crystal Palace on Sunday . ‘He’s won a fair few things in his career, it’s surreal when you list them all.

He is a fantastic signing for us and a massive asset.’ The Cameroon striker won two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles with Barca before landing the Treble for Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan in 2010. He will also prove his worth with Everton who are now in a run of seven matches in three weeks.

"England goalkeeper Joe Hart has revealed that nobody at Manchester City has contacted him about a new contract — prompting fears the club might try to sell him next summer. Hart has spent the last few weeks watching team-mates David Silva, Vincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero sign lucrative new deals. But the 27-year-old international, whose current contract has less than two years to run, has heard nothing from the club’s hierarchy. Joe Hart says Manchester City have yet to approach him about a new deal at the club . Hart is in direct competition with new goalkeeper Willy Caballero but impressed against Bayern Munich . Hart confirmed ahead of Sunday's big Premier League clash against Chelsea: ‘Anything about a new contract is news to me. I’ve heard nothing. I’ve got a year, nearly two years, left on my deal. That is all I am aware of.’ Negotiations between clubs and their most important players would normally be underway entering the last two years of an existing contract. Privately, Hart is worried about what might be causing the delay even though there would be no shortage of suitors — including Liverpool — if he were to become available. Hart was dropped by manager Manuel Pellegrini for two months last season after a mistake cost City a defeat at Chelsea. Vincent Komapny (above), Sergio Aguero (below, L) and David Silva (below, R) have all signed new deals . Manuel Pellegrini has attempted to put Hart's fears to rest by saying: 'I'm sure everything will be sorted out' He bounced back to win his second Premier League title in three seasons and play for England in the World Cup but Pellegrini spent £6 million on goalkeeper Willy Caballero last summer and made no promises to Hart about remaining first-choice. Hart was outstanding against Bayern Munich on Wednesday night but accepts he has to keep playing out of his skin to have a future at the club. Asked about having a rival in Caballero, he said: ‘I can’t moan about it and I can’t be too happy about it. It is the situation and if I want to stay at this club it’s going to be the reality forever. Hart may fear being sold on by Pellegrini if his new contract isn't sorted out soon . ‘I appreciate it more than anyone that we now have at least two quality players for every single position and the goalkeeping department is no different. ‘I’m sure he’ll get chances to play games, just as I will, and we’ve got to get on with it.’ Pellegrini tried to give assurances over a contract on Saturday night by saying: ‘I am sure something will be sorted out with Joe.’ VIDEO We must support Toure - Pellegrini .","Joe Hart is privately worried that Man City could sell him .

"Premier League champions are rarely motivated by revenge but Manchester City have more than one reason for wanting payback against Chelsea on Sunday . For City goalkeeper Joe Hart there is the memory of a costly mistake at Stamford Bridge last October that led to him being dropped and the feeling that he is still not fully trusted by Manuel Pellegrini. For Pellegrini, there is the irritation that after two League defeats by Chelsea last season, people consider Jose Mourinho to be tactically superior. Manchester City keeper Joe Hart and defender Matija Nastasic collide during the clash at Chelsea last season . Joe Hart looks on in despair as his error results in Manchester City losing at Chelsea . When two men dislike each other as much as they do, that has to hurt. It helps to build a rivalry fast approaching Liverpool-Manchester United in the grudge stakes. Both sides were touted as title contenders before a ball had been kicked — but City already trail by five points. Then there is the personal stuff. It is 11 months since Hart gifted a late goal to Fernando Torres in Chelsea’s 2-1 victory. Furious Pellegrini dropped his keeper for three months and only now, after an outstanding display against Bayern Munich, has Hart proved himself to be back to his best. ‘I love playing football, whether it’s against Bayern, Chelsea or Hull. 'But I have to play well to get the opportunity to keep on loving it,’ admits Hart, who acknowledges his side cannot allow Chelsea to win if City want to retain their crown. ‘Last year’s results against Chelsea were really tough pills and nearly cost us dearly. 'We did end up as champions but we’re not champions this year so we need a result. ‘We’re obviously expecting a tough game — Chelsea are a good side, very powerful. Joe Hart has revenge on his mind when Manchester City entertain title rivals Chelsea on Sunday . Manuel Pellegrini dropped Joe Hart after his clanger at Chelsea last season but the England No1 has recovered well from the setback and gone on to impress for club and country ever since . 'They have improved since last year, but so have we. I’d say we’re a better team. We’ve had a good year under the manager, we understand. him a lot more and we’ve in bought a few good players.’ Hart, who is waiting for a contract offer indicating Pellegrini really wants to keep him, does not have the luxury of being undisputed No 1. Pellegrini has signed Willy Caballero and Hart has no option but to fight for his place. ‘There is no malice or back-stabbing between the goalkeepers. We both want to catch the manager’s eye,’ said the England keeper. ‘It is the reality of the situation, I can’t moan about it and I can’t be too happy about it, and if I want to stay it’s going to be the reality. I’ve got players challenging and I have to enjoy it every day.’ Pellegrini, on the other hand, has sounded off against referees and Uefa after an indifferent start and is surprised people remember Chelsea’s wins against City but forget he got the better of Mourinho, who mocked the Chilean for not winning the league at Real Madrid, with a 2-0 fifth-round FA Cup win. Despite Chelsea’s 15 goals in four games, Pellegrini still sees Mourinho as a defensive coach. ‘We know exactly the way Chelsea play and they do it very well because they are used to doing it that way,’ he said. ‘And we must continue playing our way. We won’t change because we lost 1-0 in February to a goal from Branislav Ivanovic.’ Chelsea’s threat could come from in-form Diego Costa, but City boss Pellegrini has Sergio Aguero in his ranks. Pellegrini seems resigned to the fact that Mourinho has had as much credit for masterminding a win at the Etihad as the Chilean did for winning the title. ‘I am not annoyed or surprised about anything,’ he mutters unconvincingly. It seems that revenge is definitely in the air.","Chelsea visit Manchester City on Sunday at the Etihad Stadium .

"Slaven Bilic never won against Arsene Wenger as a player. His record of one draw and two defeats at West Ham and Everton included a 4-0 beating at Highbury in 1998 that secured the Frenchman’s first Premier League title. ‘One of the worst matches of my career,’ he says with a grimace. ‘Howard Kendall put me in midfield, it was only the second time I’d played there and Petit and Vieira were on to me every time, “Bam!” ‘After six minutes Tony Adams cuffed me on the back of my neck and I scored an own goal. 1-0. We never had a chance after that.’ In demand: Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic says he has been offered seven management jobs in England . Bad memories: Bilic scored an own goal against Arsenal as a player that handed the Gunners the titl . On Tuesday night, 76,000 partisan Besiktas fans will be screaming for their manager to gain his revenge in Istanbul’s Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where Liverpool memorably won the Champions League in 2005. A lucrative Champions League spot is up for grabs and Bilic, now sporting a rugged beard, is up for the fight. ‘Arsenal were the last team we wanted,’ he says. ‘I’ve watched Wenger’s teams for nearly 20 years and they are always quick, lively and play football. ‘But it’s not my philosophy to think we have nothing to lose because they are the favourites. **** that. It’s an alibi. I am also under pressure as manager of a massive club. ‘They say Besiktas have 15 million fans in Turkey, and they expect. Our fans stop and tell me: “Arsenal finished”. I worship the pressure. We are as close to them to qualifying for the Champions League.’ Fighting talk: The Croatian is confident his Besiktas team can cause an upset in Istanbul on Tuesday night . Bilic has experience at overturning the odds. He famously led his Croatia team to a 3-2 win at rainy Wembley in 2007, a result that cost England a place at Euro 2008 and brolly-clutching England manager Steve McClaren his job. ‘England were favourites that night, they needed the result and had 80,000 fans at home. ‘But we know underdogs can win in football. If we beat Arsenal, it wouldn’t be a miracle that would get shown on CNN,’ he says. Wally with a brolly: Bilic was responsible for stopping England from getting to Euro 2008 . The last few years have seen Bilic enjoy both success and a hard-luck story or two. He was seconds away from the semi-final of Euro 2008 until a late Turkey equaliser. He qualified for Euro 2012 but drew Italy and Spain in the group stage. His first club job with Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia ended in the sack. His reputation in England has always remained high. Asked directly if he has ever been approached to manage here, he replies quietly: ‘Seven times.’ He will not name the clubs but is regularly linked with a return to West Ham, where he was a popular player and forged friendships with Harry Redknapp and Rio Ferdinand that still exist today. There is no doubt he is a confirmed Anglophile. ‘I am really connected to England, I lived a very important part of my life there and I feel they like me there,’ he says. ‘I love the English attitude to football. We played a pre-season friendly this summer against Hereford United and they showed an unbelievable spirit.’ He added: ‘If you asked me which country I’d want to work in next, there is a big gap between England and the rest of the countries. But that is for the future, not now. Istanbul suits me as a city. I love it.’ Victory against Arsenal would propel the 45-year-old Bilic back among the A-list of wanted managers. He has identified Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey as his major obstacles. ‘Arsenal were good last year but I never felt they were going to win the title because something was missing: the top quality, the leaders. ‘But when I heard during the World Cup they were signing Alexis Sanchez, I thought “perfect for Arsenal”.’ He added: ‘Mentally, Arsenal should be ready to challenge for the title after winning the FA Cup but for me the likes of Chelsea are still first. They can play football or fight, Chelsea can do whatever. They can park the bus, or can force the other team to park the bus.’ Danger man: The Besiktas coach says Sanchez is exactly the kind of player that can thrive at Arsenal . Ramsey fan: Bilic thinks Aaron Ramsey, centre, is Arsenal's best and most important player . He is a huge fan of Ramsey. ‘He is Arsenal’s best player. Their most important player. There is a lot more fuss on a daily basis about Jack Wilshere but so far on the pitch, it’s Ramsey,’ he said. ‘Most top players have one quality that stands out. You can’t tell with Ramsey, he is not that quick, he is not Scholes for his football brain, or Roy Keane for his fight. But he is nine out of 10 in everything. ‘But overall I’d say the Arsenal team I played against was more British than this one. But most clubs are losing that kind of identity now, not just in England.’ Cheap deal: Besiktas signed one-time Arsenal target Demba Ba, left, from Chelsea this summer . Instant impact: The Senegalese forward scored a hat-trick in the last qualification round against Feyenoord . There is a financial chasm between the two clubs. While Arsenal splashed out £35million on Sanchez, Besiktas signed Demba Ba from Chelsea for less than one-seventh of the price. Interest in Fulham’s Costa Rica player Bryan Ruiz has so far stalled because Besiktas can’t afford the £5m asking price. Ba, who nearly joined Arsenal a year ago, scored a hat-trick in the previous round against Feyenoord and will be the Turkish club’s main threat. Riling: In 2007 Arsene Wenger said Turkish clubs were not good enough for latter stages of Champions League . Bilic dismisses however the idea Arsenal will be cowed by the atmosphere in Istanbul. ‘They went to Fenerbahce last year and won 3-0 with a cigar,’ he said. ‘The reputation of Turkish fans is prejudiced. Hostile and intimidating? Yes. Do they want to eat you? No.’ Even so, Wenger might get some special stick from fans with long memories. The Arsenal manager stirred the pot after Liverpool beat Besiktas 8-0 in 2007 by suggesting Turkish clubs weren’t good enough to be allowed into the latter stages of the Champions League. Caring approach: While in charge of Croatia, Bilic gave Luka Modric, right, money for coffee on away trips . Bilic’s warmth towards his players is his personal trademark. In his first job as Croatia youth coach, he once gave pocket money to a young Luka Modric and Vedran Corluka because they had no spending money, not even for a cup of coffee, on away trips. He may be the boss, but he’s also their friend. That might be the biggest threat of all to Wenger come Tuesday night.","The first leg of the Champions League qualifier is on Tuesday in Istanbul .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes England's players are 'stricken with fear' at big tournaments. Rodgers will start the season with seven members of Roy Hodgson's squad who flopped in Brazil. But he is confident there will be no hangover at Anfield because the players will feel confident playing in a system they know. Liverpool leader: Steven Gerrard captained England during their disappointing World Cup campaign . 'Stricken with fear': Raheem Sterling, left, and Jordan Henderson, centre, were also part of England set-up . Rodgers was not blaming Hodgson, a former Liverpool boss, but says there are deep-lying reasons about why England don't succeed – problems which could get worse. He said: 'I don't think what happened to England is a Steven Gerrard problem or a Jordan Henderson problem, or even a Frank Lampard problem. 'It's an England problem that has been around for many years. Brazil, South Africa, tournament after tournament. 'The game in England needs a radical change so that they can identify a way of playing and then pursue that way of playing. 'England's players are as good as any players in the world, but they are stricken with fear when it comes to playing at big tournaments.' Shrugging it off: Sturridge is one of the England players Rodgers is confident will hit top form in the league . Early flight home: New signing Rickie Lambert, left, and Liverpool stalwart Glen Johnson, right were also part of Roy Hodgson's squad that faltered in Brazil at the World Cup . Arrival: Like Lambert, Adam Lallana, pictured, is an England player that has recently moved to Anfield . Five of the players who helped Liverpool finish second in the Premier League last season were in Engalnd's World Cup squad; Glen Johnson, Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge. Since then, Rodgers has signed two more from Southampton, Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana. He added: 'They have to find a way to remove that fear and they can only do that by developing a system of playing that everyone is comfortable with. If you play without fear, you have a chance. 'Roy Hodgson is doing a very difficult job and he needs help from the FA. They have got to come up with some solutions now, because the worrying thing is that it could go the other way and get even worse.'","Rodgers will start the new season with seven of Roy Hodgson's squad .

"For the purists and the patriots, there can be only one winner when the race for the Premier League crown reaches its climax just before 5pm on Sunday. And it will not be Manchester City. City’s players suspect that respect for them and their football is the one quality that is in short supply as they sit just 90 minutes away from their second title in three seasons. And their concern can only be heightened by the admission from FA chairman Greg Dyke that he finds it ‘depressing’ that a team can challenge for the biggest prize in the English game with so few Englishmen among their ranks. So close: City will win their second league title in three years if they don't lose to West Ham . Dyke, who has drawn up controversial proposals that have now been published following an investigation into the dearth of top-quality English players, used the occasion to again voice his fears that top clubs are paying scant regard to the needs of the national side. ‘It’s been a brilliant league this year,’ said Dyke. ‘But there are only two regular England players at City, and two or three at Chelsea, and that’s pretty depressing.’ Although City seem destined to be champions, plenty of neutrals would prefer to see Liverpool win the title. And Dyke acknowledges the part played in the Anfield club’s challenge by their English contingent. ‘It’s good news for Roy Hodgson and good news for the campaign in  Brazil,’ he said. The statistics tell their own story. While six English players have featured in more than 20 matches in Liverpool’s challenge, only Joe Hart and James Milner at City have played in more than 10. And while Liverpool have had  Englishmen on the field for more than 40 per cent of the total time played, that figure is an alarmingly low 14 per cent at City. Quota: Liverpool have had six English players play more than 20 matches in their title challenge . Even City’s achievement in scoring 100 League goals has gone largely unnoticed while the Merseysiders have hogged the limelight thanks to the scoring exploits of Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge. Homegrown: James Milner is one of two Englishmen to play over 10 games this season in the league for City . With City needing just a point at home to West Ham today to be champions — Liverpool must beat Newcastle in case Manuel Pellegrini’s men slip up — nobody feels the lack of respect more deeply than City defender Martin Demichelis. After savage criticism, it is personal. Written off as a slow, pony-tailed buffoon as City were beaten by Chelsea and Barcelona, the former Bayern Munich and Argentina defender has come to symbolise the club’s great comeback. From being regarded as a joke by City fans and lambasted in TV studios, he is fast-emerging a popular cult figure and his remarkable renaissance has vindicated Pellegrini’s decision to bring the 33-year-old over from La Liga where they had worked together at Malaga. ‘The people who criticised me needed to be more respectful of me and what I’ve done during my career,’ said Demichelis. ‘I’ve now played nearly 11 years in Europe, including eight at Bayern Munich and I’ve won many trophies. That is not by chance. But I’m very grateful to Manuel for the support he has shown me.’ Demichelis also scored for Argentina at the last World Cup but that pedigree was ignored when he was sent off in the Champions League for bringing down Lionel Messi. It was only when he became the team’s leader after Vincent  Kompany was sent off at Hull on March 15 that his and City’s season was transformed. 32 per cent of players who featured in the Premier League  this season were qualified for England — the lowest ever. 169 of the 532 players who appeared in the top flight are available to England boss Roy Hodgson. 103 of those have played more than 900 minutes, the equivalent of 10 games or more, and just 75 have played more than half the minutes possible. 23 per cent of the total minutes possible were played by English players at the top four clubs. 14 per cent of those total minutes played by English players at Manchester City. 16 per cent by English players at Arsenal. 24 per cent by English players at Chelsea. 40 per cent of total minutes by English players at Liverpool. 5 English players aged 18-21 played more than half the possible minutes. 13 countries at this World Cup have stars who’ve had more time per player in the Premier League than English players this season. Solid: City petered off after a fine winter period, but have come back strong . ‘I didn’t read and I try not to listen to too much of the criticism, but there was too much of it,’ he said. ‘The penalty against Messi and  Barcelona was one incident in a match where I actually thought I was playing really well. Represent: Joe Hart is the only other English City player to play more than 10 league games . ‘I started the season with an injury and I needed time to adjust physically. But as time has gone on, I have found my rhythm and been on an upward curve. And since that Barcelona game, I feel I’ve played at a high level for the last three months. ‘I’ve been through a lot of this through my career. But at no point did I stop believing in my own  ability. I always thought I could do this and I’m now where I want to be. I was well-respected in Germany who won many titles. There were no problems in Munich but I was a newly-arrived foreign player here.’ What was damaging when  Demichelis struggled was that it reflected badly on Pellegrini’s  judgment. While Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was lauded for his attacking philosophy and Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho hailed as a master of  tactics, City lost their way after  Sergio Aguero’s injury problems began in late January and the old doubts over Pellegrini — he has never won a major trophy in Europe — resurfaced. Defeats against Barca and Wigan in the FA Cup destroyed a tilt at a unique Quadruple although City did win the Capital One Cup. Yet when Chelsea and Liverpool slipped recently, City took advantage. Chelsea lost at Crystal Palace, Liverpool only drew there but City won 2-0 at Selhurst Park. Having failed to lift La Liga with Real Madrid, Pellegrini is about to become a major winner. And he thinks the Premier League would be a bigger achievement. ‘The Premier League is the hardest to win. It’s the most competitive,’ he said. ‘Barcelona and Real Madrid have important players, so do  Bayern, but here there are five or six teams with a lot of potential in their squad. The intensity makes it different to anywhere else — every game is a final.’ He is taking nothing for granted today even though West Ham are safe and have nothing to play for. ‘We’ve planned for West Ham. We always consider the other team and their characteristics,’ he said. National man: Dyke says it would be depressing for City to win the title with such little English representation . ‘Andy Carroll is a very important player. West Ham play a lot to his strengths and we must be worried about that, pay attention and  concentrate with our defending.’ City nearly slipped up two years ago in the final game against QPR before Aguero’s late winner, so there will be no complacency today. Demichelis is amused at the prospect of a duel with another ‘pony-tail’ in this title decider. ‘Carroll’s hair is more tied up in a bun really,’ he said, smiling ‘I’ve never played against him before but he’s not the only big striker in the Premier League. I trust in my experience and know how to deal with him.’ If ‘Aguerooooo’ was the hero in 2012, there are no shortage of candidates this time around. Edin Dzeko, Yaya Toure and Alvaro Negredo have each scored more than 20 goals this season and David Silva is the best player in the League on current form. TITLE . If Manchester City win today, they will win the title whatever happens elsewhere.If City draw, then Liverpool can win the title by beating Newcastle by a 13-goal margin.If City lose, any win for Liverpool will be good enough to take the title. A draw won’t be. EUROPE . City, Liverpool, and Chelsea will go into the Champions League group stage directly, and Arsenal into the play-off round.Everton will go into the Europa League, and be joined by Tottenham unless Spurs lose at home to Villa and Manchester United win at Southampton, in which case United not Spurs will go into Europa League qualifying. Hull are guaranteedEuropa League football via being FA Cup finalists. RELEGATION . Cardiff and Fulham are down and Will be joined by Norwich barring an impossibly freakish win over Arsenal at the same time as a home defeat for West Brom by Stoke in which Norwich overturn a 17-goal goal difference between themselves and West Brom. Success: Man City are on the verge of winning their second league title in three years . Fernandinho, newly picked for the Brazil World Cup party, thinks City’s squad have given them the advantage. ‘We have a lot of options. We can change the games with substitutions and the manager has made a lot of good decisions on that.’ If City win today, their fans will hope it ushers in a new era of domination, similar to Liverpool and Manchester United. Financial fair play restrictions might be their biggest obstacle in the long term but Fernandinho said: ‘What happens tomorrow, nobody can know. But the club has built a team to win trophies. It’s our target. ‘We’ve won one title this year already and now we have the chance to win a second one. And the next years we’re going to try to do the same thing.’","Manuel Pellegrini's side have used just two Englishmen for more than 10 league games this term - James Milner and Joe Hart .

"Louis van Gaal is preparing to take over as manager at Manchester United next season - even though United say that they have yet to make a final decision. After detailed talks last week, the current Holland manager believes he has a verbal agreement to take over from David Moyes and is planning to ask Patrick Kluivert and current stand-in manager Ryan Giggs to be his assistants. United insist that talk of an agreement is premature and no contracts have yet been signed. And after Giggs masterminded a 4-0 win over Norwich in his first game as caretaker manager, Wayne Rooney insisted the United legend had ‘all the credentials’ to take the job on a permanent basis. Ready: Louis van Gaal is preparing to take over as manager at Manchester United next season . Assistants: Van Gaal is planning to ask Patrick Kluivert (right) and Ryan Giggs to be his No 2's at Old Trafford . Keeping quiet: Van Gaal refused to give Sportsmail an answer when asked whether he would be joining United . In the water: Van Gaal fishes for his ball during a round of golf at the Vale Do Lobo resort in Portugal on Friday . But though United do not wish to be rushed into making an announcement, Van Gaal is ahead of other candidates in that he is able to negotiate freely. Kluivert knows Van Gaal well having played under him at Ajax, Barcelona and Holland and is currently one of his assistants for the Dutch national side. In an interview with Talksport the former striker said Van Gaal has the mentality and experience to take United back among the elite having managed at the top before. 'He would be absolutely the first pick of any club, especially top teams everywhere in the world,' Kluivert said. 'He likes to let young players make their debut if ready for it. The most important thing at the moment is I'm personally enjoying working with him and with the Dutch national team. We're going to the World Cup and hope to do well. 'After that we'll see what happens and with me as well. 'Sure I would [do the job] wherever in the world because I love working with him. It doesn't matter what club it will be if he asks me to join him, I would be absolutely honoured to be on his side.' The boss: Giggs guided United to a 4-0 win over Norwich just his first match in charge as interim manager . Good relationship: Van Gaal shares a joke with coach Kluivert during a Holland friendly match in 2013 . Carlo Ancelotti is coming to the climax of the season with Real Madrid and it is unclear whether Real president Florentino Perez would be prepared to let him go. Van Gaal wants to bring goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek, physiotherapist Jos van Dijk and analyst Max Reekers as well as former Holland striker Kluivert but also wants Giggs on his team - and would be happy to work with the likes of Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. Giggs was given a standing ovation on Saturday as he took charge of United for the first time, just five days after Moyes was fired. And he couldn’t have asked for a better start to his caretaker reign, with Rooney and Juan Mata each scoring twice. New beginning: Giggs arrives on the touchline at Old Trafford before the game against Norwich . Club legend: Giggs was given a standing ovation as his caretaker reign got off to the perfect start . The new breed: Van Gaal would be happy to work with Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Giggs . FOUND HIM! Louis gets away from all the fuss with a quiet round of golf . While, as Manchester United were casting their net wide to find the next manager at Old Trafford, Van Gaal, was fishing his golf ball out of the water, seemingly without a care in the world. Van Gaal has been hiding at his holiday home at Vale Do Lobo, a 500-hectare luxury resort on Portugal’s Algarve coast, with hundreds of villas, 15 restaurants, two golf courses, a supermarket and a nightclub. The 61-year-old has a villa here. It is, as you might expect, at the top end of the price scale, having large balconies with sea views. It also overlooks the first green of the Ocean Golf Course, where he plays as often as he can. Hideaway: Van Gaal has been staying in his holiday home, a 500-hectare luxury resort on the Algarve coast . Relaxing: Van Gaal plays at the Ocean Golf Course as often as he can when holidaying in Portugal . Van Gaal does not take kindly to people showing up on his doorstep unannounced, although presumably United’s representatives would have been more than welcome. After two days searching for the most coveted manager in English football, I finally find him when a silver 4x4 pulls up on one of the plushest streets in the resort, where properties cost upwards of €2million. Van Gaal appears from the rear seats together with his wife, Truus. Wearing a pale pink shirt, smart trousers and oversized sunglasses, he turns to say goodbye to the English couple who have dropped them off and reluctantly shakes my hand. The house on the sprawling plot next to Van Gaal’s has been knocked down and a new one is being built. Van Gaal has red cement dust blowing in his face and my introductions are muffled by the noise of a digger. Can I have a quick word, Louis? ‘No!’ he scowls. But can we expect to see you in England next season? No response. Do you think you’ll go to United? ‘I’m sorry I can’t talk about it.’ Why not, Louis? ‘I can’t say anything because everything I say will be interpreted as what they want. The Press are here and it’s not nice because I’m here for holidays and it’s my last week before the World Cup.’ And with that, Van Gaal disappears behind the iron gates of his property. Without a care in the world: Van Gaal  concentrates as he lines up a putt on the golf course . Nice people: One waiter said Van Gaal is very serious but 'not too picky, not too demanding' He is well known around the resort. He is regarded as a ‘good tipper’ at the Breeze Cafe and he and his family are also popular customers at the Teahouse Oriental Restaurant. In the summer months, he requests a table overlooking the sea and orders his favourite dish, crispy aromatic duck, at a slightly pricey €19.50. ‘He is very serious,’ said a waiter, ‘but they’re very nice people, not too picky, not too demanding.’ Whether United’s squad find him quite so undemanding, should he get the Old Trafford job, remains to be seen.","Louis van Gaal preparing to take over Manchester United next season .

"Wayne Rooney is being lined up as the next captain of Manchester United — with a reminder from manager David Moyes that whoever picks up the armband from Nemanja Vidic must convince him that their off-the-field behaviour will not bring the coveted role into disrepute. With Vidic leaving United at the end of the season, Rooney is in prime position to take over as  captain, providing  he signs the five-year £300,000-a-week deal on offer to him. Moyes has made it clear ahead of the Premier League game against bottom-of-the-table Fulham — one that United must win to keep their fading Champions League prospects alive — that he sees the United captaincy as having a huge ambassadorial element to it, as well as leading the other players during matches. Certainly, any repeat of scandals that have dogged Rooney in the past would count against him. Successor: Manchester United boss David Moyes (right) is lining up Wayne Rooney to be the club's next captain . Exit: Current captain Nemanja Vidic (right) announced he will leave at the end of the season . Adnan Januzaj is set to commit his international future to England after he turned down the chance to play for Belgium in this summer’s World Cup. The 19-year-old Manchester United winger is the most wanted teenager in Europe, with England, Belgium, Albania, Serbia, Turkey and Kosovo trying to persuade him to commit his international future to them. Januzaj will not make an official announcement until next year but sources close to the player believe England is his favoured option. Talking about his search for a new skipper, Moyes said: ‘We want people to show leadership qualities, not just on the pitch but off the pitch. It is a big standing to be captain of Manchester United. ‘The person who takes over has to understand what it means for the club, the responsibility it carries, what is required of you as well. I think we have a lot of leaders in the dressing room and they will all get a chance to stake their claim.’ Asked specifically about Rooney’s prospects, the United manager added: ‘Like everyone else, I’ll give everyone that opportunity to stand up and show what they can do in the coming months.’ Rooney hinted that what he really wants is to stay at United and beat Sir Bobby Charlton’s club goalscoring record. And the prospect of him being given the United captaincy — one of the most prestigious roles in English football and  previously held by Old Trafford greats Charlton, Bryan Robson and Roy Keane —  has been discussed during Rooney’s contract talks. Record breaker: Rooney has hinted he wants to stay at the club and break Sir Bobby Charlton's (below) goalscoring record . Part of United’s pitch to Rooney has been that he would be guaranteed a place in the club’s history if he signs his new deal. He has already had 10 years at the club and, were he to sign for another five, barring injury he would be certain to become the all-time top scorer at the club. He is currently fourth on that list with 208 goals – behind Jack Rowley, with 211, Denis Law with 237 and Charlton with 249. The thought of handing Rooney the captaincy is an indication of  how important both the club and manager David Moyes consider him to their future — though it is a remarkable turnaround from last summer, when the club’s former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, said that Rooney had asked to leave. Rooney has always denied that claim, although the acrimony it  generated made a departure seem the most likely outcome. Rooney as a captain would have seemed an unlikely outcome in his early career, when his private life was featuring on the front pages of newspapers and his discipline on the pitch was erratic — he has been sent off five times in his career. Improvement: Rooney's disciplinary record has got better - his last red card came against Montenegro in 2011 . But while he was fortunate to avoid red earlier this season when he kicked out at Jordon Mutch in the 2-2 draw at Cardiff, his disciplinary record has improved considerably in recent years. The last red card he received was while playing for England against Montenegro in October 2011. He has twice been sent off for Manchester United, the last time occurring  during a 2-0 defeat at Fulham in March 2009. Darren Fletcher, who has been at United for 13 years and has recently returned following treatment for ulcerative colitis, is another serious candidate for the captaincy, while Phil Jones has an outside chance if Moyes decides he wants a skipper for the next 10 years. Other candidates, including Patrice Evra, Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand, are expected to follow Vidic out of the club at the end of the season. Exodus: Rio Ferdinand (left) and Ryan Giggs would be candidates for the captaincy but are expected to follow Vidic out of Old Trafford at the end of the season . More pressingly, Moyes is ready to take a selection gamble for the must-win game at Old Trafford with Wednesday’s trip to Arsenal in mind. United have already lost at home against West Bromwich, Newcastle, Tottenham, Everton and Swansea this season but Moyes would prefer not to play all three of his star triumvirate — Robin van Persie, Rooney and Juan Mata — for a game against Fulham that they should win comfortably anyway. The United manager admitted: ‘We’ve got two big games coming up, a big one on Wednesday, too, and have to take that into consideration. I must say I thought we played quite well last week [in a 2-1 defeat at Stoke] and I hope it continues. ‘Juan has played well in the games so far and has contributed well. It was the first time we had Robin and Wayne playing together since the start of the season and if we see more of that between now and the end of the season, it will hopefully lead to better performances and more points.’ Return: Former first team coach Rene Meulensteen is set to return to Old Trafford with Fulham on Sunday . Coming up against Ferguson’s former head coach, Fulham boss Rene Meulensteen, adds spice to the fixture and Moyes will be happy to take the three points rather than insist on a bagful of goals. ‘Like any manager, I’d take any win but if we win in style, great. Our form at Old Trafford hasn’t given us that. I hope it does between now and the end of the season. I would never be so presumptuous to think that would be the way. ‘We never looked like losing in our last home game against Cardiff [a 2-0 win] but I actually think we played better against Stoke in a match we lost than we did against Cardiff. ‘That may not be the way you see it but that is how I felt. We can improve a lot on both performances.’ Rested: David Moyes could rest one of Rooney, Juan Mata (left) or Robin van Perise against Fulham as his team play Arsenal on Wednesday . United traditionally come strong in the last third of the season and they will need to this time, with a gap between them and top-four rivals Liverpool, Everton and Spurs. ‘We have to just win our games and hope other teams slip up. That’s what has to happen if we are to get into the position we want,’ said Moyes. ‘We’ve always felt capable of doing it and getting our players back and fit will put us in a position to do so.’ Meulensteen has claimed Moyes did not offer him a role after succeeding Ferguson last summer, a stance at odds with the United boss. Trusted: Meulensteen had a close working relationship under Sir Alex Ferguson . It appears now both men agreed to part ways and Moyes said: ‘I could turn it around and say Rene didn’t keep any of the backroom staff when he went to Fulham. Rene got the opportunity to stay but I think the decision he took was right. ‘He made the right decision and I believe I made the right decision  as well. It was the right time for  everybody. I knew it was going to be a big job and it has proved just that. I have the chance to build things up.’ Vidic is expected to return to United’s line-up against Fulham after serving a suspension for his dismissal against Chelsea a fortnight ago.","Wayne Rooney is David Moyes' preferred choice to take the Manchester United captaincy next season .

"The last time Tottenham won at the Emirates, Rihanna’s ‘Only Girl in the World’ was No 1, WikiLeaks were in the process of releasing 250,000 American diplomatic cables and Roy Hodgson was wreaking the sort of havoc at Liverpool that wasn't rectified for years. It was also around that period that a certain Gareth Bale began to make good on his early promise and become a driving force for Spurs. His goal, at 2-0 down, proved the catalyst to three precious points. Rafael Van der Vaart equalised before Younes Kaboul notched a late winner. Since then, however, Tottenham have stagnated. They’re on a third manager since Harry Redknapp departed and don’t appear to be capable of touching the top four just yet. As we embark on the first north London derby of this season, Sportsmail picks a composite XI of Arsenal and Spurs ahead of the clash. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Arsenal v Tottenham preview . Rafael van der Vaart (left) celebrates his goal with Gareth Bale on the last occasion Tottenham beat Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium back in November 2010 . Younes Kaboul celebrates his winning goal in the 3-2 success with Bale (left) and Jermaine Jenas (right) It was an afternoon to forget for Arsene Wenger but results since have been favourable at the Emirates . Goalkeeper: Hugo Lloris . While Wojciech Szczesny has become a more imposing figure between the sticks in the last 12 months, Lloris is a complete goalkeeper. Both are exemplary shot stoppers, but the Frenchman’s savvy reading of the game in acting as a sweeper pips it. France international Hugo Lloris trumps Wojciech Szczesny to take the gloves in our composite XI . Right-back: Calum Chambers . Isn’t a right-back, but neither club are blessed with genuine quality in that area. Chambers is very impressive when play is ahead of him – already an astute reader of the game – and he’s no slouch going the other way. Summer signing Calum Chambers has made an impressive start to his Arsenal career . Central defender: Per Mertesacker . Carries on surprising people. The poster boy for Arsenal’s failings during his first season, Mertesacker has relished the opportunity to go and dominate Premier League defenders after Arsene Wenger’s decision to drop his back four a touch deeper. There is a strong argument for Jan Vertonghen’s inclusion but the German is more consistent. Per Mertesacker is a commanding presence at the heart of Arsenal's defence . Central defender: Laurent Koscielny . Still has a mistake in his locker every now and then but Koscielny’s pace and bravery make him quite the asset. On his day one of the best in the division. It is a shame from an Arsenal point of view that his day isn’t every week. Laurent Koscielny also makes our composite team and will play alongside Mertesacker . Left-back: Kieran Gibbs . Take away the injuries and here we have England’s best left-back. This is judged merely on ability – not taking into account fitness problems – and Gibbs is able to join in while also an intelligent defender, rarely committing before his winger. Kieran Gibbs gets the nod at left-back and is an accomplished and intelligent player . Central midfielder: Etienne Capoue . Might not be everybody’s cup of tea in midfield, but is powerful enough to make an impact on the Premier League. When you consider his main rival from a Gunners perspective is the passive Mikel Arteta, there is definitely room for the £9million summer signing from Toulouse. Brings much-needed steel to the side. Etienne Capoue brings steel to the centre of Tottenham's midfield . Central midfielder: Jack Wilshere . Has enjoyed a decent start to the season, despite his ludicrously harsh critics. Off the field problems are admittedly Wilshere’s own fault, but his performances are steadily improving. There’s still much to do if he is to become the blockbuster midfielder once tipped. Jack Wilshere has made a decent start to the season for Arsenal but still attracts criticism . Attacking midfielder: Christian Eriksen . A close call between the Dane and Mesut Ozil, but Eriksen pips him purely because he positively affects more games. The 22-year-old’s vision around the box is a joy to watch, while you always believe there is a purpose to his play. Ozil, even though he has started brightly this term, can flit in and out. Christian Eriksen gets the pick ahead of Mesut Ozil in the attacking midfield slot . Attacking midfielder: Aaron Ramsey . Simply put: a superstar. Ramsey is Arsenal’s proper game-changing midfielder, popping up with vital goals and capable of driving the Gunners forward. Head and shoulders above the rest on either side. Aaron Ramsey has turned in consistently brilliant performances for Arsenal over the last couple of seasons . Attacking midfielder: Alexis Sanchez . Clearly needs time to settle into English football, but showing signs that he is the match-winner Wenger thought he was buying after the World Cup. Free-kick in midweek was stunning but it is nose for goal in the box that should shine through. Given the opportunity to play more central Sanchez’s pace and clever running could see him fire Arsenal to more trophies. Alexis Sanchez has made a storming start to his Arsenal career and scored a cracking free-kick in midweek . Striker: Danny Welbeck . Wanted by Tottenham in the close season, Welbeck would get into either of these teams. Is forever a willing runner and - if he spends extra time finessing his finishing at London Colney - could prove to be a snip at £16million. Roberto Soldado doesn’t make the bench.

"Andy Carroll fully admits that he is not yet in a position to fully trust his body after a latest injury setback – but believes he is ahead of schedule and confident of retaining match fitness in December. The £15million man, who has endured a spate of fitness problems during his time at Upton Park, turned an ankle in pre-season training and missed the Hammers’ impressive start to the Premier League season. And Carroll revealed three separate specialists in the capital saw nothing wrong with the ankle before he sought more advice in America. It was there where they ordered an immediate operation. Andy Carroll was rushed back into the West Ham team last season to cover for a lack of striker . Carroll has had a frustrating time since joining West Ham with injuries limiting his playing time . ‘Nothing was said, everything was all right. Then I was still thinking of the start of the season, there was no issue,’ he said. ‘I’ve seen three specialists in London and everything was fine, so I continued training. Then I knew myself and my physios knew something wasn’t right. ‘I had that [the operation] immediately and he gave us a four-month timeframe. It's only been two months since so everything is going well. Running at this stage is earlier than expected. ‘At the minute I'm not 100 per cent so it's in the back of my mind when I'm running.’ The former Newcastle and Liverpool striker hopes to be fit enough to play again by December . Carroll has begun running again but says he still does not feel comfortable enough with his body to play . Carroll – who was speaking at West Ham’s launch of their new members’ initiative ‘Club London’ - was rushed back into the first team last year because of manager Sam Allardyce’s lack of options up front, but believes he can be afforded more time now because of the signings made in the summer. ‘It’s harder being injured when it’s just come after the last injury. It’s a lot harder. I just try to focus on the positives,’ he added. ‘There was a lot of talk about when I was going to be back and I probably rushed it a bit quicker than I should have. This time has been a lot better and the lads are doing well. I just need to take my time, really. The West Ham striker hopes to repay the £15million that the club paid to sign him from Liverpool . ‘They have put a lot of faith in me, paying a lot of money. I don’t feel I’ve let them down because obviously it’s an injury that I couldn’t have helped. I’ve done it in training and in a game. It’s an injury that I don’t want and obviously no-one at the club wants.’ West Ham have designs on establishing themselves as a top-six club when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016. That, Carroll asserts, is a picture Allardyce painted when he signed from Liverpool last year. An overground view of West Ham's  new stadium located in the heart of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park . West Ham showed off the newly-decorated Olympic Stadium on their official website on Tuesday . West Ham fans may get a decent view out of the East Stand 'Kop' window from the Arnold Hills . ‘The way we are going the players we have signed and in future with the stadium, I don’t see why we can’t do that. ‘Before I signed I spoke to Sam and obviously he was telling me about the plans going forward.’ Carroll was talking at the launch of West Ham's new members' club - 'Club London' which offers fans the chance to experience what vice-chairman Karren Brady labelled as an 'unrivalled hospitality experience'. Season ticket holders and members will soon be able to visit the new Reservation Centre at Westfield Stratford City to hand-pick their new seats at the Olympic Stadium.","Andy Carroll is recovering from surgery on his ankle .

"UEFA have had to reshuffle their refereeing pack for Chelsea’s opening Champions League game because of visa issues. Serbian official Milorad Mazic was set to take charge of the clash against Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, but an administration error means he and his team can’t fulfil the fixture. They have been swiftly replaced by a Croatian outfit led by Ivan Bebek, whose most high profile game in the competition to date was Barcelona’s win at Spartak Moscow two years ago. Milorad Mazic and his team will not be in charge of Chelsea's game on Wednesday due to visa problems . Croatian referee Ivan Bebek will now take charge of Chelsea's game with Schalke on Wednesday . UEFA confirmed the switch was down to visa problems to Sportsmail on Tuesday afternoon. Bebek was the referee for Celtic’s 2-1 win against Ajax in the group stages last season as well as Bayer Leverkusen’s defeat at Paris St Germain. He will be aided by Tomislav Petrovic, Miro Grgic, Anto Vucemilovic and Goran Gabril. Jose Mourinho's side will be looking to continue their good start to the season at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday when they face a Schalke side that are out of sorts. The Germans lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach on the weekend and arrive in England with two teenagers - Kaan Ayhan (19) and Marvin Friedrich (18) - in defence after an injury crisis.

"Jack Harper is a name that may well be cropping up weekly in the coming years. If you don't know him already, you soon will. The 18-year-old Scot is rapidly emerging as someone who could well have an impact on the Real Madrid sooner rather than later. Need convincing? Harper was at the hub of Real's youth 2-0 win against Basle on Tuesday - scoring once, hitting the bar, smacking a post and forcing the away goalkeeper into two stunning saves. Remember the name of Jack Harper, the 18-year-old Scot starring for Real Madrid's youth team . Harper in action for the Real Madrid Academy during a UEFA Youth League match against Basle on Tuesday . Harper starred for Real's young guns as he scored a goal, rattled the woodwork and forced a numer of saves . The forward is all-action, his overhead kick to cannon off the woodwork bearing resemblance to a certain No 7 at the Bernabeu. Any sort of comparison is premature at this stage, but Harper is going about things the right way. Born in February 1996, the youngster has been at the club since he was 13 and signed a long-term deal two years ago; he doesn't appear to be looking back. Harper is a tricky No 10 with the poise and guile to run games in the final third . Harper with a pre-season trophy (left) and in Madrid's away kit (right) Portugal legend Luis Figo poses with Harper at the club's training ground . Harper has similar qualities to Cristiano Ronaldo cutting off the left winger . Iker Casillas is said to have lent Harper a helping hand during his formative years at the Bernabeu . His family - originally from Barrhead, East Renfrewshire - have lived in Spain for the best part of the last 18 years and Harper, to all intent and purpose, is a Spanish footballer. He has the poise and guile to cut in from wide and dictate play, running beyond the front man from deep, but with an eye for goal that sets him apart from other No 10s. Harper - who was spotted playing for a local side in Malaga, Los Boliches - has enjoyed a footballing education at one of Europe's more prestigious academies. Gordon Strachan could be tempted to throw Harper into the deep end in Euro 2016 qualifying . Real Madrid spotted the Scotland Under 17 international when he was just 13 . It's now five years since Real comfortably beat off Sevilla for his signature - there was never any contest - and it's showing. All the indications are that Harper can become a star for club and country. SFA performance director Mark Wotte has visited Madrid on numerous occasions to keep tabs on him, spending time at the Ciudad Real Madrid complex and keeping in contact with the youth chief Ramon Martinez. Scotland have high hopes. If he continues to kick on, it may well be that Harper is thrown in at the Euro 2016 deep end.

"When Nouha Dicko clambered off the bench at the break, he clearly had a point to prove. Not starting for the first time in the league this season, the young striker was the driving force behind Wolves coming away from the Valley with a point. Kenny Jackett’s side struggled with the intensity of the hosts - drilled by the charismatic Bob Peeters - until the 22-year-old’s half-time inclusion. Dicko was pushed up alongside lone target man Leon Clarke - his pace frightening Charlton and tenacity yielding the corner from which Danny Batth equalised after Andre Bikey’s 25th minute opener. Danny Batth leaps highest to head in his goal which earned Wolves a point against Charlton at The Valley . Andrey Bikey jumps in celebration after giving Charlton a deserved lead after 25 minutes . The Addicks were rattled by Dicko’s ability to run in behind and Wanderers went back to the Midlands with more than had earlier looked likely. Talking of the change, Jackett said: ‘It really helped us. Dicko gave us a little bit of pace in behind their back four. We tried to get him in the game and it raised the fans. ‘I am disappointed for the players, they played very well. There was a great tempo to us. There is promise going forward and their goalkeeper has made three fantastic saves.’ Peeters, on the other hand, has already galvanised Charlton and they sat top of the Championship for a portion of the night. They press high and attempt to force mistakes in front of vociferous support. Andrey Bikey is mobbed by his teammates after putting his side in front in a first half they controlled . Charlton manager Bob Peeters has given his side a new sense of urgency and is getting positive results . Charlton: Henderson, Gomez, Ben Haim, Bikey, Wiggins, Wilson (Bulot 75), Buyens, Jackson, Cousins, Tucudean (Moussa 61), Vetokele. Subs: Morrison,  Harriott, Church, Fox, Pope. Wolves: Ikeme, Doherty, Batth, Stearman, Golbourne, McDonald, Evans, Henry (Jacobs 87), Saville (Dicko), Sako, Clarke (Edwards 81). Subs: , McCarey, Rowe, van La Parra, Ricketts. Referee: Pat Miller (Bedfordshire) It does mean the football is helter-skelter at times, but they are being entertained on a weekly basis. Results have been consistently positive and there is a manager who is changing the club’s ethos. August’s mantra of mere survival will not do. ‘Every time we broke I felt we could score,’ Peeters said. ‘They brought on Dicko and he caused us a lot of problems.’ It had looked very promising indeed earlier. Igor Vetokole - a revelation since joining from FC Copenhagen - won himself a corner he had no right to, with Jordan Cousins’ resulting centre helped beyond Carl Ikeme at his near post by Bikey. The trademark somersaults ensued, and they should have been celebrating again seconds later. Almost straight from the kick-off, Vetokole - who trapped a nerve in his arm late on and has been assessed by club doctors - picked Lee Evans’ pocket in midfield before sliding in George Tucudean, but the Romanian skewed his shot wide. It was a very presentable opportunity and one in which he ought to have finished, much like earlier in the half when the striker could only send a free header wide from eight yards. Wolves manager Kenny Jackett turned the game on its head when he brought on Nouha Dicko at half time . Charlton had plenty of men in their own box when Danny Batth headed his goal but couldn't prevent him scoring . Danny Batth celebrates his goal which drew Wolves level at The Valley midway through the second half . They were almost made to pay for those misses by George Saville, but the Wolves midfielder could only find Stephen Henderson’s right-hand post from the edge of the box. It served as a warning sign for the Addicks, who saw Evans twice flash long-range efforts just wide. Wolves passed the ball competently but lacked real endeavour in the final third. Saville, Evans and Kevin McDonald are imposing in midfield but weren’t able to manufacture the ball wide to James Henry or Bakary Sako nearly enough. They improved significantly after the inclusion of Dicko. Clarke twice swept efforts wide before Sako’s fierce strike was brilliantly tipped over by Henderson. Jackett’s switch at the break had worked, if only Clarke could find the net. He again couldn’t hit the target, this time missing his kick after Dicko’s intelligent pullback. But the equaliser wasn’t far away and it was all down to Dicko’s tireless work. He chased down a lost cause, winning a corner, and central defender Danny Batth bundled home. The healthy travelling contingent in the Jimmy Seed Stand went wild, and it was just reward for their team’s efforts after the break. The manager looked fired up on the touchline, so too his players. James Henry rattled a post and they weren’t able to force a winner - even when Dicko was put clear in the stoppage time. On this basis, neither side will fall away from their lofty Championship positions anytime soon.","Andrey Bikey puts Charlton ahead with a flick in first half .

"Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has accepted responsibility for most of his past misdemeanours but is still 'upset' over his punishment for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. The 27-year-old is set to make his competitive comeback from a four-month worldwide ban next week in El Clasico against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, which was imposed after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup. While he accepts his current suspension, and the 10-game ban imposed for a similar incident involving Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic were his own fault, he is still unhappy over how his argument with Evra in October 2011 was dealt with. Luis Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 and says it still upsets him . Evra celebrated in front of Suarez when Manchester United won that season's return fixture at Old Trafford . 'It is good to accept that you have made a mistake and that's what I did,' he told his club's official website fcbarcelona.com in reference to the Chiellini bite. 'I left it a few days because you have to remember that I'm only human and sometimes it's hard to face the truth. 'I found it hard to take in and to realise what I had done. Those were days when I didn't want to know about it. 'I just wanted to be with my wife and children, who supported me through that time. 'I didn't want to listen to anybody, or speak to anybody. I didn't want to accept it. When I say I'm sorry it's because I regret something. Being sorry implies regret. Suarez refused to shake hands with Evra the next time the two players met, after refusing to apologise . The Uruguayan's snub angered Evra, but Suarez insists he did nothing wrong and was wrongly found guilty . Suarez and Evra have since shaken hands, but the Barca star insists he was 'accused without evidence' 'But they have also sometimes judged me on things that aren't true, such as the racism thing. I was accused without evidence and that's what grieved me the most. 'The others were actions when it was me who did wrong. I accepted that and begged forgiveness, but the racism thing, when I was accused without evidence, that did upset me.' Suarez has admitted he was in the wrong when he bit Giorgio Chiellini at last summer's World Cup . The striker says it is good to admit that he has made a mistake, ahead of hm the ban next week . Suarez had previously been found guilty of biting Branislav Ivanovic, for which he was banned for 10 games . Manchester United faced Liverpool in a Premier League match. In the 57th minute Suarez fouled Evra and tempers flared at the next corner. They squared up to each other and Evra asked why Suarez kicked him. Suarez said he should forget about it, these things happen. Evra claims Suarez then became racially abusive, using the word 'negro'. Suarez denies using the word in that clash. Evra is clearly wound up, but nearby players do not seem particularly bothered. A few minutes later Marriner calls the pair together. Suarez apologises and tries to pat Evra on the head. It is alleged Evra said: 'Don't touch me, you South American,' to which Suarez replies: 'Porque, negro?' Evra catches Kuyt two minutes later and is booked. He allegedly shouts at Marriner: 'You're only booking me because I'm black.' Suarez is bemused, saying: 'I called him something his team-mates call him and even they were surprised by his reaction.' Suarez has been allowed to play in friendlies during his ban after successfully appealing against an original ruling which prevented him from being involved in any football-related activity. On Monday he scored twice for Uruguay in a 3-0 win over Oman but admits he cannot wait to end his competitive exile. 'The first two months were the hardest because I didn't feel like a footballer. That was the worst part,' he added. 'It is always good to accept your mistakes but what angered me most was not feeling like a professional, not feeling like another worker, like other footballers do. That's what hurt me the most.'","Luis Suarez still denies he did anything wrong in Evra incident .

"England continued their impressive start to Euro 2016 qualification with a 5-0 thumping win against San Marino on Thursday night. Only 55,990 fans attended England's emphatic victory against their opponents though, making it the lowest-ever crowd for a Three Lions' match since the opening of the new Wembley in 2007. Sportsmail's Rob Draper provides his match zone analysis. England ran out comfortable 5-0 winners against San Marino in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Thursday night . England players have now started to embrace each other, arms around each other’ s shoulders, when singing the national anthem. It’s taking a bit of time to catch on, however. Captain Wayne Rooney led the way and players followed suit down the line. But for a while Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson were left, cut adrift at the end of the line – not quite the intended message of unity and togetherness – until they finally noticed and join in the team bonding. Wayne Rooney (left), Joe Hart (centre) and Calum Chambers (right)  embrace during the national anthem . Goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini wasn’t doing San Marino’s credibility at this level an awful lot of good when almost his first intervention was to give away a free kick inside his own penalty area for handling the ball twice – an error more akin to Sunday League. His desperate fling at Phil Jagielka, which ended with him head butting the Everton defender’s back-side as England opened the scoring, didn’t help matters. The accountant at last partially redeemed himself with a fine save from Danny Welbeck on 42 minutes. San Marino goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini endured a torrid evening against England at Wembley . ‘Four Arsenal players in the England’s starting line-up,’ tweeted Gary LIneker. ‘Never thought I’d utter those words.’ (Strictly speaking he didn’t utter them: he wrote them). Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs and Calum Chambers were the men on Thursday night and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made a fifth when he came on at half time. Back in February, 1999, David Seaman, Martin Keown, Tony Adams and Lee Dixon started against world champions France at Wembley. It didn’t do any good mind you. England were played off the park and lost 2-0. Jack Wilshere (right) was one of four Arsenal players in England's starting line-up against San Marino . Wilshere was joined by club team-mate Danny Welbeck (left) who scored his country's third on Thursday night . Scrap the commission, end all those Bundesliga love-ins: possibly the most significant results on Thursday night came in the Netherlands  where England’s Under 20 side beat Germany 1-0, thanks to a Nicolas Sule own goal. Ironically FA chairman Greg Dyke is expected to attempt to mirror some of the grass roots reforms in country’s such as Germany later on Friday when his commission unveils its second tranche of reforms that it wishes to see in the game. But maybe we have some good youngsters already. The most-eagerly anticipated figure of the night was not the number of goals but the attendance – 55,990. That made it officially the worst-attended competitive England match since the new Wembley was opened, beating the previous lowest, of 57,897 against Andorra in June 2009 on the night of a tube strike. That said, after a dismal World Cup and in the least-interesting qualification process ever devised, it still represents something of a triumph that so many will still turn out for England. England's attendance against San Marino was 55,990 - the lowest since the new Wembley was opened . There was a pregnant pause when the Wembley PA came to announce the man of the match. Joe Hart was leading the online vote with 53 per cent but the PA suddenly went quiet mid sentence, presumably suddenly realising the irony of the vote. A few minutes later he re-emerged to announce that Jack Wilshere was in fact man of the match, a scandalous suppression of the popular vote. Perhaps FIFA could investigate?

"Against the odds, Southampton are flying high in the Premier League and shocked Arsenal in the Capital One Cup. Ronald Koeman's side were written off after a less-than-ideal summer, so what has got the Saints marching on this season? Sportsmail looks at five reasons. Southampton have won five in a row, including a 2-1 win against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup . Humility . Not a trait obviously associated with superstar Dutch footballers and Koeman isn't meek. However, he has learned his trade along the way. He had looked like another star name jobbing his way around Europe on the basis of his playing reputation. His stints at Ajax, Valencia, Benfica and AZ Alkmaar endly badly. But at Feyenoord he took a struggling club with limited resources and restored them to their place in Holland's top three. Even during his troubled spells there were indications of talent: an impressive Copa del Rey win with Valencia and a Champions League quarter final with Benfica. Along the way, unlike many footballing celebrities, he seemed to have continued learning and improved. Ronald Koeman was a fine player, but he's learnt the ropes as a manager and is now experienced . Tactical Continuity . At first glance there doesn't seem that much in common between Koeman and Maurico Pochettino. The clue is in Marcelo Bielsa, however. Koeman of course was schooled in the Johan Cruyff school at Ajax and Barcelona at the same time as Pochettino was coming under the influence of Bielsa in Argentina. And Bielsa and Cruyff are the two most important mentors to Pep Guardiola. On separate continents in Holland and Argentina, a common style was emerging of rampaging full backs, splitting centre halves and intense pressing. Koeman and Pochettino come from same broad tradition, even if their mentors developed far apart. Mauricio Pochettino (above) and Koeman share the same link to management as Pep Guardiola (below) Good signings . With close on £100million incoming over the summer, it must have been tempting for club and newly-installed manager to go a little crazy. Instead they have made what look like steady and sensible signings, using their new-found financial muscle responsibly. Koeman knows all about Graziano Pelle, having managed him at Feyenoord; in Dusan Tadic, he simply went for the best young emerging star in Eredivisie, who was destined for one of the Dutch big three, and took him straight to Premier League; Fraser Forster was an obvious and solid addition; Ryan Bertrand likewise; Florin Gardos and Toby Alderweireld have added depth to the squad and seemingly quality as well. Graziano Pelle scored plenty of goals for Feyenoord under Koeman and is continuing that in the Premier League . Southampton bought the finest young talent in the Eredivisie in Dusan Tadic . The world-renowned academy . They haven't quite come up with Leo Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi on the south coast. But Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Gareth Bale, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers isn't a bad list of alumini. The club is repaing the benefits of ten years of the right kind of work. Not only financially are the club secure (see above) but Koeman still has the likes of James Ward-Prowse at his disposal, as well as fellow Englishmen Jack Cork and Nathaniel Clyne. Adam Lallana and Co may have left, but the Saints still have players coming through their ranks . And a little dose of good luck.... Liverpool aside and nowithstanding that superb win at Arsenal last night in the Capital One Cup, . Koeman has had a gentle introduction to the Premier League. The run of winnable fixtures continues, though there is a delicious clash with Pochettino's Tottenham forthcoming. The comeuppance is from November 30th to December 28th, with a run of games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea. Still, nothing like momentum to get help settle you in. And given the respective form of some of those teams and The Saints, who's to say they should fear them? Southampton have had a relatively easy start... so, will it last?","Southampton have won five in a row in all competitions .

"If anyone tells you that international football is in decline and dying a slow death it would be worth showing them this video below. Euphoria: Argentina players celebrated wildly in the changing room after beating Belgium in the World Cup . Dance: Sergio Aguero (centre) jumps around in celebration in the changing room after the match in Brazil . That's Sergio Aguero you can see skipping - and skipping really is the only word for it - around the dressing room as Argentina players celebrate after beating Belgium in the World Cup. The song they are singing is their fans' anthem, 'Brasil, decirme que sientes?/Brazil tell me how it feels?' This is it how it feels to be a successful national team, something an entire generation of England players know nothing about. When was the last tournament match involving England that could have merited such a celebration? Possibly in Euro 2004, when Croatia were beaten 4-2 and England went into a quarter final full of confidence. That means anyone 20 or under has only fuzzy memories of an England side inspiring the nation. So that includes Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and John Stones; Phil Jones may have a distant memory of those times; Danny Welbeck and Jordan Henderson could probably recall it; only Wayne Rooney has actually played in a team that made the country feel good about itself, albeit briefly. All as one: England celebrate as a team after Danny Welbeck's opening goal in the 2-0 win over Switzerland . Double trouble: Danny Welbeck slots home his, and England's, second goal as they saw off Switzerland . Joy: Argentina players celebrate after Gonzalo Higuain's goal against Belgium in the World Cup quarter-final . Celebration: Gonzalo Higuain runs off in joy after his goal against Belgium in the World Cup quarter-final . To reach back to times when English players surprised the nation by captivating them this current team would have to ask coach Gary Neville to tell them his war stories from Euro 96 or quiz celebrities such as Gary Lineker, only known to them as TV presenters, about Italia 90. And that is why Monday night's 2-0 win in Basel was so important. It's not going to prompt celebrations to match Argentina's, nor should it. There won't be a bus-top parade around London just yet. But perhaps we caught a glimpse of something on and off the pitch. It was there in the sight of Joe Hart leaping into the arms of Jordan Henderson at the end and in the way the team all went over to applaud the travelling fans after the match. Perhaps it was even present in the way in which the team embraced, arms round shoulders, for the national anthem. It is a a tantalising glimpse of a generation beginning to understand what a successful national team could look like; more importantly what it could feel like. Reminiscing: England players may need to ask Gary Lineker what it feels like to be adored by a nation . Success: Paul Gascoigne (pictured) was part of the England side who reached the semi-finals at Italia 90 . In front: Welbeck peels away after putting his country ahead in their first Euro 2016 qualifier in Basle . The narrative about the decline of international football is a peculiarly English obsession. It's not a debate flagged up in Spain, even after last summer's World Cup debacle; nor in Germany. And that video clip shows some of the best players in the world celebrating in a manner which suggests that international football may have an awful lot of life left in it yet. The reason why this debate has traction in England is that our national team has been so bad for so long whilst, at the same time, the Premier League has become steadily better. It's essentially an Anglo-centric view of the world. But I would hazard a guess that winning with your national team surpasses anything you achieve with your club. Perhaps it's because the shared cultural background with your team-mates can make you seem a closer-knit group: the jokes, the songs, the reference points you all have in common cannot be shared as easily in a multi-national dressing room. Pointing the way: England coach Gary Neville (right) can also talk of England's success at Euro 96 . Adoration: England were embraced and loved by supporters for their successes during Euro 96 . Bright spark: Raheem Sterling (pictured) and England's youngsters must deliver on the international stage . Conversely, as the world becomes more global and diverse, national identities become even more important. But probably it is because no matter how well you do with Manchester United or Barcelona or Bayern Munich you will never experience the gratitude of an entire nation. Young players in Germany, Spain and Holland know that from experience; at another level, so do those from Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile, Algeria, Uruguay, USA and Belgium. England's will have to learn it from the history books. But they too should look at that video clip of Sergio Aguero skipping around his dressing room singing. There can't be a much better feeling than that for a professional footballer. Altogether now: England perform a huddle before kick-off, showing what it means to play for your country .","Argentina's players, including Sergio Aguero, celebrated World Cup quarter-final win over Belgium by dancing in changing rooms .

"We can’t say we weren’t warned. Roy Hodgson went out of his way before the game to insist that this wouldn’t be the start of a new era and he was right. Hodgson is always wary of the easy sound-bite so he can’t be blamed for refusing to play the media’s game. He probably suspected, rightly, that to bill this game as a new dawn would have been trite – and it would. More to the point, he probably also feared his team could easily be mediocre again. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson: I'm happy with Danny Welbeck and Raheem Sterling . From the spot: Wayne Rooney (right) celebrates putting England ahead with a second half penalty . There was never going to be a sudden upturn in fortunes and a surge of fresh excitement as there is no golden generation waiting to step up. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard have retired, but the latter hardly played, so it’s not as though there have been a raft of thirty something players blocking the progress of the youngsters. With England, you get what we have; what we have is shallow seam of talent. It was clear to all - certainly to the paying public, who recorded the lowest international crowd at the new Wembley - that the World Cup was a reflection on England’s real status. Tricky: Raheem Sterling wins a penalty in the second half which was despatched by Rooney . Dastardly foreigners didn’t conspire to undo us, there was no hand of God on which to place the blame; England simply couldn’t match good teams tactically or psychologically. All of which means the road to Euro 2016 is going to be slow and steady for this current generation entrusted with representing the national team. If you wished to be optimistic you would point to Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling’s link ups and Danny Welbeck’s enthusiasm when he came on. Silver lining: Daniel Sturridge (left) and Raheem Sterling were lively during England's win against Norway . In fact, principally you would look to Sterling, especially when he was moved behind the front two for the last 20 minutes, and you might even feel hopeful about the future, though that thought in itself is a little scary; that a nineteen year old carries our hopes. If you wanted a reality check you would turn to the back four. Phil Jagielka is being eased out after a World Cup which exposed his talents, but not because there is anyone better, simply because you might as well bet on Phil Jones at 22 potentially getting better. In a first half in which Norway declined to participate meaningfully, it was difficult to judge the defenders. In the second, when presumably their manager Per-Mathias Hogmo had reminded them quite how ordinary England are, the shortcomings were painfully familiar. In his defence: John Stones was steady at right back but looks to be a more natural centre back . Hard to handle: Joshua King (right) caused Gary Cahill and Phil Jones problems . Joshua King is no Luis Suarez but he forced Joe Hart into two good saves, with Cahill and Jones error prone and static. With a Nemanja Vidic or a John Terry alongside them, they can look good but neither looks capable of assuming that dominant role without a mentor. John Stones may graduate into the centre. He looks more comfortable there than at right back, where he was merely steady enough. Leighton Baines was presumably grateful for a quiet night opposite Mats Moller Daehl after his travails in Brazil. In the next two years we will discover whether these players, along with Luke Shaw, Kyle Walker, Calum Chambers and perhaps some outliers such as Eric Dier can develop into defenders of international quality. For now, they remain what they were in Brazil: fragile. Step up: The likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (above) and Jack Wilshere must establish a grip on games . We saw a little of Fabian Delph and he was clearly determined to impress, which on a night which was presaged by exceedingly low expectations and delivered on them, was at least encouraging. But it is Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlian who need to establish their grip on games. They have reached a stage in their careers where they must prove they are more than youthful promise. Jordan Henderson was assured and looks to be slowly getting the hang of his role for England. No-one but a fool would say England are about to rise to great heights. We would settle for: ‘England could be better.’ They could. But it will require an awful lot of players to grow up quickly and grasp responsibility and young English players have not been in the habit of doing that in recent years. Your country needs you: England's young players must grasp responsibility and grow up quickly .","England's young lions must prove they are more than youthful promise .

"Charged: Daniel Dobson (pictured), who is accused of a betting scam at the Australian Open, is the son of Detective Inspector Tim Dobson, a member of the Met police team reviewing the Maddie McCann case . The British tourist at the centre of an alleged tennis betting scam is the son of a senior Met Police murder detective investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, it emerged today. Daniel Dobson, 22, has been charged with illegal gambling by allegedly sending information about play at the Australian Open to an international betting ring, using a device sewn into his shorts. His father is Detective Inspector Tim Dobson, a member of the Metropolitan Police’s 'Gold Group' dealing with the cold case review of missing Madeleine. Daniel Dobson, currently being held in Melbourne, is one of six men accused of helping gambling associates beat the time TV time lag. He is set to fly back to Britain on Monday, after paying his bail bond and agreeing to return to Australia later this year for further court dates. Dobson, of New Malden in south-west London,  was arrested after a match where he allegedly used a device to wirelessly send points information to an international betting agency before the action reached TV screens. Dobson was said to have used the advantage of the 10-second delay between action and live TV to send the data and affect the betting odds. Melbourne Magistrates Court was told that Dobson had . allegedly had the device built into his shorts and linked to his mobile . phone. Police are searching . for two other Britons in relation to the alleged offence, known as . 'courtsiding', following Dobson's appearance in court earlier this month.

"Arsenal and Manchester City will be asked to pay a £20m loan fee for Monaco’s Radamel Falcao but both clubs have baulked at the price and will wait to see if Monaco will do business on Sunday. The 28-year-old Colombian striker wants to leave Monaco after a year and hopes to join Real Madrid - but the Spanish club have thus far been reluctant to commit anymore of their summer transfer budget. If Falcao can’t move to Madrid he wants a loan move to keep open the option of moving to the current Champions League holders.

"Alan Pardew was rewarded with a straightforward win at Gillingham after selecting as strong line-up against the League One side – and saw 18-year-old Rolando Aarons impress on his full debut. Without impressing, Newcastle were rarely troubled by Peter Taylor’s side and they at least registered their first goal of the season even if none of their own players scored it. They were the beneficiaries of an own goal courtesy of Gillingham defender John Egan, after Gabriel Obertan broke down the right and delivered a dangerously-placed cross which caused the Irishman to miscue and put through his own net on 25 minutes.

Subs not used: Anita, Gouffran, Ferreya, Perez, Cabella, Elliot, Dummett. Manager: Alan Pardew 7 . Referee: Oliver Langford (West Mids) 6 . It was a curiously un-spirited display by Gillingham who tried to out-wit Newcastle rather than out-fight them, with their back three formation. But their wing backs were constantly pinned back by the pace of Obertan and Aarons, which ruined their hopes of having extra men in midfield. Aarons, the Jamaican-born 18-year-old who grew up in London, looked especially sharp on his full debut having come on as a substitute on the opening day of the season against Manchester City. He was consistently inventive until he went off injured on the hour and went close on 36 minutes when Stephen Bywater saved. Newcastle were dominant without being threatening having started with seven of the players who featured against Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. However, two of those, Emmanuel Riviere and Siem De Jong, looked anonymous as they struggled to link up with their team-mates, with most of Newcastle’s threats coming from the wing. Impressed: Rolando Aarons, 18, was a stand-out for Newcastle on his full debut as Newcastle eased to victory . Going hard: The Gills' Bradley Dack tackles United's Mehdi Abeid at Priestfield Stadium . Nevertheless, Newcastle were quite clearly a class above their opponents throughout and kept possession excellently. Gillingham’s attacking input was extremely limited. Cody McDonald did manage to get away on 12 minutes and run into space but Fabricio Coloccini shepherded him effectively away and won the ball with a crunching challenge which prompted an ambitious penalty appeal from Gillingham, which referee Oliver Langford declined. And wing back Matt Fish almost beat Tim Krul with a curling shot from the edge of the box on 36 minutes but otherwise it was quite first half for Newcastle’s defenders.

Newcastle started the second half in much the same fashion an almost went further ahead in 53 minutes when Massadio Heidara hit a superb 35-yard strike that bounced off the cross bars. Colocinni then forced a save from Bywater on 62 minutes from 20 yards. But Gillingham seemed curiously uninspired, standing off Newcastle and allowing their Premier League colleagues all the time and space they required. Only with the introduction of Luke Norris on 65 minutes did Gillingham finally register a shot on goal, the 21-year-old cutting across goal, beating Colocinni and then forcing Krul into a sharp save with his shot from just inside the box on 70 minutes.

"Real Madrid will sell Sami Khedira in January unless there is a breakthrough in contract negotiations. The Germany international was poised to leave in the summer with Arsenal and Chelsea keen to take him while Bayern Munich also wanted the midfielder. However, Bayern’s surprise move for Xabi Alonso instead meant Madrid put the blocks on his departure. Sami Khedira will be sold by Real Madrid in January if he does not extend his contract at the club . Midfielder Khedira (above) won the World Cup with Germany in Brazil during the summer . Now Khedira and his representatives are no closer to committing to Madrid and with the player out of contract in the summer, the European champions are looking to sell rather than lose him for nothing in the summer. They will contact Europe’s top clubs to test the market with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United among those they will look to. Madrid have a good relationship with United following summer business involving Angel di Maria and Javier Hernandez, however, the lack of Champions League football will affect the player’s decision. Khedira has a good relationship with Jose Mourinho from his time at Madrid while he is a fan of Arsenal’s footballing style but they may struggle to match his £200,000-a-week wages. Further talks are planned with his representatives but if no progress is made, Madrid will look to sell for around £10million.

"Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has re-iterated his innocence after being accused by his former employers and former Leeds owners GFH Capital of falsifying invoices and diverting money into accounts controlled by him. The figures that have been reported amount to around £3million. Haigh, who is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities in Dubai despite having shared a cell with other prisoners at the Bur Dubai Police Station Jail since May 18, has enlisted the services of forensic investigators at Price Waterhouse Coopers in a bid to clear his name. David Haigh (centre) has issued an explosive statement protesting his innocence . In May GFH released a statement confirming 36-year-old Haigh had been arrested ‘on suspicion of fraud, embezzlement and money-laundering while he was employed at the bank.’ A spokesman for Haigh said: ‘David continues to maintain his complete innocence of any wrongdoing. He denies all the civil claims made against him. ‘Independent handwriting tests carried out on his behalf have established that the forged signatures on the invoices were not his. ‘At the same time a report by Price Waterhouse Cooper says that the dossier containing the basis for GFH’s allegations provides no evidence that David either created false invoices or diverted GFH money into accounts controlled by him. ‘After 136 days of incarceration, David has neither been questioned about criminal wrongdoing nor charged with any criminal offence. Haigh has spent 130 days in a Dubai jail cell and is still waiting to be questioned by the authorities . ‘He believes his continued detention in these circumstances is in clear breach of his human rights. ‘Notwithstanding the desire of his former employers to keep him in jail, David remains confident that the Dubai legal system will uphold his innocence thus freeing him to pursue his own wide-ranging claims against GFH.’ Haigh, who has now served over four months in prison, has consistently denied he used false invoices to embezzle almost £3m from GFH Capital, the former owners of the football club, while head of their private equity arm. In a statement, GFH Capital said: ‘Mr Haigh and his team have made repeated claims in the media that he has been denied the most basic amenities of life during his period of detention by the Dubai authorities, asserting that his living conditions have made it impossible for him to concentrate and effectively defend himself. However, a hearing in the DIFC Court on September 15 before Mr Justice Sir David Steel revealed a very different story.’ Haigh (right) has enlisted the services of forensic investigators in a bid to clear his name . Court documents revealed by GFH showed Justice Steel rejected a claim by the defence that Haigh needed another $500 a week to have food, water and toiletries sent into him in prison. GFH Capital said the hearing was also told that Haigh claims current monthly outgoings in the United Kingdom of some £26,000 ($42,090) per month, including £1,000 a month for gym membership, £1,000 on telephone calls and £3,000 a month to a partner. ‘Mr Haigh has frequently claimed that he is unable to communicate by telephone to instruct his legal team. However, he claims to spend in excess of $500 a week on phone calls from the detention centre,’ it added in the statement. ‘Despite his claims that it was difficult to receive medical treatment, he has had access to an on-site doctor and has been permitted trips from his cell to receive private, specialist outside medical treatment. In addition, he claimed to be spending $500 per week on medicines in the form of protein, vitamins and supplements,’ GFH Capital said. In answer to his claims that he has no funds to pay his legal team, GFH Capital said it has agreed that £200,000 be held on account by Haigh’s lawyers to pay his legal costs.

"Mauricio Pochettino has defended Christian Eriksen after Denmark manager Morten Olsen tore into the Tottenham midfielder for his contribution in their Euro 2016 qualifying defeat by Portugal. Olsen singled out Eriksen for scathing criticism after Denmark’s 1-0 loss on Tuesday, claiming he failed to take control of the game and indicating that he has not developed since leaving Ajax 14 months ago. But Tottenham manager Pochettino insisted Eriksen is still improving, saying: ‘It’s not my problem. It’s his (Olsen’s) problem. My problem is to look after my player Christian Eriksen. I am very happy with his performance and commitment. Mauricio Pochettino has leapt to the defence of Tottenham playmaker Christian Eriksen . The Argentine boss says the midfielder is still improving and is doing his job for his club . Eriksen was told by his Denmark coach that his performance against Portugal was sloppy . Ajax (2010-2013) Games 162 Goals 32 . Tottenham (2013-present) Games 43 Goals 12 . Denmark (2010-present) Games 47 Goals 5 . ‘I can only say we are happy with Christian. He is a very good professional and his commitment with the team and the club is good.’ Eriksen scored 10 goals in his first season at Spurs following an £11million move from Ajax in 2013 and netted the winner against Southampton before the international break. Pochettino added: ‘He is a very good player, important for Tottenham. I am very happy for his performance and impact on the club and team. ‘He is still young. He knows he needs to improve but we are very happy with him. We expect that Christian is happy with us and can still improve.’ Olsen was furious with Eriksen after Cristiano Ronaldo’s stoppage time winner. He said: ‘It is a brutal world, otherwise you have to play at another level. It is not Ajax any more, this is not development. After so many matches he could pick up the ball and help to control the game. He has not been able to. Therefore, we blame him.’ Olsen slammed Eriksen, saying: 'It is not Ajax any more, this is not development' Cristiano Ronaldo scored a last gasp winner for Portugal against Denmark in Copenhagen . Pochettino will find out on Friday whether Hugo Lloris will be fit for this weekend's clash against Manchester City — the side that put 11 goals past him last season. The France goalkeeper pulled out of his country’s 3-0 friendly win over Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem, with Michel Vorm primed to step in to face City.

Head coach John Peacock said: ‘Phil has come in to shadow me for the first two games. He’s just finished playing not so long ago and is starting off in his coaching career. ‘He’s an ex-England international and it’s great to have him around the place, good experience for the boys to learn from someone like Phil and more importantly it gives him an insight into what we’re trying to achieve with the future development of these players.’ Coach: Phil Neville has had coaching roles at England Under 21s, Everton and Manchester United . Chris Ramsey, who was most recently assistant manager to Tim Sherwood when he was in charge of Tottenham last season, is also assistant coach for this tournament. Peacock added: ‘It’s good to have Chris back on board for these games, he’s a very experienced coach and worked for the FA a number of years ago.

"Southampton's superb start to the season continued as they saw off the challenge of QPR on Saturday. Click here for his stats and all the players' heat maps in our brilliant Match Zone. Ronald Koeman admitted even he is shocked by the scintillating start to Southampton's season after a win against Queens Park Rangers kept them second in the table. How the scoreline was not greater was miraculous after twice the woodwork and busy QPR goalkeeper Rob Green kept them at bay until two well-worked moves ended with him beaten. Thirteen points from their first six league games is their best ever start to the Barclays Premier League and leaves them just three of first-place Chelsea. Graziano Pelle makes the perfect connection from a cross to score in spectacular fashion as Southampton go 2-1 ahead against QPR . Southampton (4-2-3-1): Forster 5; Clyne 5.5, Fonte 5, Alderweireld 5.5, Bertrand 6.5; Wanyama 5.5 (Cork 69 5), Schneiderlin 5; Mané 7.5 (Long 67 5), S Davis 5.5, Tadić 7 (Targett 90); Pellè 7.

Subs not used: McCarthy, Hill, Onuoha, Dunne. Manager: Harry Redknapp 5 . Booked: Henry . Koeman said: 'I'm a little bit surprised, normally you have to wait after a lot of changes in the team. We had some difficult moments in the club, a lot of people were a little afraid and there questions about relegation. But we know what our qualities are. 'We like to enjoy our offence. Football is to be enjoyed. I believe in a way of playing that will bring points and that is our ambition. It's going well.' Graziano Pelle's overhead kick in the 68th-minute was a strike worthy of winning any game. Substitute Shane Long crossed from the right, Dusan Tadic nodded the ball back to Pelle who took a touch to flick the ball in the air then sent it into the far top right corner with an acrobatic effort. It was the striker's fifth goal in eight games since his £8million summer move from Feyenoord. Just two minutes before it had seemed that Charlie Austin's equaliser would be the best goal seen at St Mary's yesterday [SAT]. The QPR striker produced a sublime moment when he plucked a firm ball by Eduardo Vargas out of the air with his back to goal, spun around and beat Fraser Forster with a low shot. That they were level was a surprise. The home side were relentless going forward, but had to wait until the 55th minute to finally break the deadlock. Tadic switched the ball from right to left, Sadio Mane was on to it in a flash and played a deft back-heel into the path of Ryan Bertrand, the left-back on loan from Chelsea, who fired in first-time under Green. Their first effort off the upright came in the 19th minute. The bright Mane, making his first Premier League appearance, crossed from the right, Pelle cushioned a header back to Tadic who controlled the ball with his chest before hitting a shot which beat Green via a deflection off Steven Caulker but came back off the left post.

And Green was sharp again on 79 minutes to rush from goal to block Long's effort when Davies played him through on goal with an audacious first-time ball curved into his path. Niko Kranjkar struck a 20-yard free kick off the underside of the bar in the final 10 minutes, but the equaliser would have been unfair on Southampton.

"Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul will be fit to face Leicester City on Saturday. There had been fears that the 26-year-old was set for a spell on the sidelines after the club confirmed ligament damage in an elbow injury picked up while on international duty with Holland. But the Magpies are confident he will be okay to take his place in the side against the Foxes. Tim Krul (left) injured his elbow on international duty with Holland . The injury was not as bad as first feared and Krul will be fit to face Leicester on Saturday . The news will come as a relief to manager Alan Pardew, whose side need to win to avoid setting a new club record of eight games without victory from the start of a Premier League season. A club statement read: 'Tim Krul has been further assessed today by the club's medical staff and the club can confirm that he has nothing more than a very minor elbow injury. The club will continue to monitor the situation but are confident that he will be available for the game against Leicester City on Saturday.' United are unable to recall Nottingham Forest loanee Karl Darlow – who they signed during the summer – meaning Rob Elliot was set to deputise if Krul was ruled out.

"Jack Wilshere has always possessed the skill and technique to be an international footballer. The question marks only ever concerned whether he would be studious enough to read the game at the highest level and whether his body would stand up to the physical strain. All the signs are that the 22-year-old is maturing into a player who could yet develop into an established talent at the top of the game. Firstly there are those injury issues. Wilshere’s ankles appeared to be the major impediment to his development over recent years but with a good pre-season behind him, Wilshere has been almost ever present for Arsenal and has started all three England games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Wilshere discuss learning from Andrea Pirlo earlier this season . England midfielder Jack Wilshere is showing all the signs of maturing into a top talent . Then there is his game intelligence. He is at heart an instinctive player but in conversation with Wilshere at England’s hotel in Watford on Friday afternoon, his willingness to study the game is evident. Roy Hodgson and the England coaches have been encouraging him to watch the best holding midfielders in the world as part of his education and it seems he has been assiduous in doing his homework. ‘I have been watching Xabi Alonso on video in the past couple of weeks,’ said Wilshere. ‘He had a record number of passes in one game, nearly 200 in one match, which is ridiculous. Watching players like him and Andrea Pirlo, you learn how clever they are how intelligent they are on the ball. Roy Hodgson has encouraging Wilshere to watch the best holding midfielders in the world . ‘In that role it’s important you have to understand that if you lose the ball, the opposition are in a dangerous position to counter-attack. Whereas if I was playing a little bit higher, on the edge of the box, you can lose it and you have players around who can get the ball back. You learn how they use the ball and you learn when it’s a good time to dribble or sometimes pass. I enjoy playing that role. I enjoy getting on the ball and starting attacks.’ Wilshere may have to get used to it. Against San Marino, he thrived in the second half in the holding role and England lack a natural midfielder to play there. Wilshere is being encouraged to make the position his own. ‘I get the clips through on my iPad. The analyst guys here send them to me and they highlight some of his key points, his key strengths. It’s only 20-25 minutes. That’s part and parcel of learning. Even when I watch my games back, I think: “What am I doing now? I should have done that!” It was my second game in that position against San Marino and I thought: “I’ve already improved.” So there’s a lot more to come from me in that position, but the more I watch players like that, the quicker I’ll learn.’ Wilshere boards the plane to Tallinn at Luton Airport on Saturday . Wilshere conveys a degree of humility which, for English football, is encouraging. It will be some time before a collection of England players inspire a nation burnt by a decade of failures but, after the dismal World Cup, the win in Switzerland was at least a building block for this group. ‘As players now, we don’t have to worry about the past,’ said Wilshere. ‘Basically all the players from that golden generation have now stopped playing at international level, so there’s a space for us to come in and write some history ourselves, if you like. We’re young, we’re eager, we want to learn, and we want to win something with England. At the end of the day, that’s the main thing. We want to get through this qualification and go to the Euros and really do something. ‘We are not worried about what you call England’s poor record. All we can do is concentrate on the games ahead and what we can do. We are on a good run and we want to continue the good form from the Switzerland game. ‘I thought we did that against San Marino. The captain [Wayne Rooney] wants that togetherness; he wants us to come together at the beginning of the game.’ No one will ever be foolish enough to tag a generation of England players with exorbitant expectations again, the scars of the golden generation’s failures still raw. But there is something fresh and vibrant about this group of players. Like all young people, they have a healthy disrespect for what’s gone before, intent on forging their own futures . Xabi Alonso set a Bundesliga record with 204 touches of the ball . ‘There are a lot of players who have come through the England Under 21s together, who are now in the seniors,’ said Wilshere. ‘We are good friends off the pitch and we are of a similar age. We have really worked on team spirit and I think you can see that in matches. Win or lose, we always stick together. ‘I played with Jordan Henderson for a number of years. He’s a close mate of mine. And I grew up with Jonjo Shelvey at Arsenal [Shelvey started his youth career at Arsenal]. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were fantastic for England — and I looked up to them even from when I was a young kid, and to play with them in an England game was a dream come true for me — but now they’ve moved on. ‘Before the Switzerland game people were questioning: “Are they ready?” I think we prove every game that we’re learning. As young English players at the top level, there’s no better place to learn. As each game goes on, I think we’re getting closer and better as a team and I think there’s a lot more to come.’ Wilshere wants to emulate Andrea Pirlo's cleverness on the ball . Talking to Wilshere, it’s hard to accept that idea that younger players have no enthusiasm for their international careers. The Arsenal player’s eyes light up a little when he is asked whether he can imagine winning 100 caps for his country —he has 23 at present — as Rooney will next month. ‘Yes, of course. Even when I was growing up I looked up to people like that. I remember growing up watching the Euros in 2004 and Rooney was there, Gerrard was there, Lampard was there and all of a sudden I was involved with them when I was 18. ‘They’ve been great role models for me. Wayne’s fantastic. He’s only 28. He’s a great leader, he’s always talking to us. He deserves 100 caps. He’s been fantastic. His goal-scoring record is fantastic and his love for the game — everyone can see it. He’s such a great role model. ‘He’s the only one now who has been playing for England for 10 years, with the likes of Gerrard. He’s been through that generation. Now he really feels like, he’s the dad figure if you like. He puts his arm around us, brings us together and gets us going.’ It may take some time before anyone gets over-excited about England again. But if Wilshere and his team-mates keep up their homework, perhaps we can expect a graduation ceremony sooner rather later. Jack Wilshere won glowing praise for his role as England’s holding midfielder against San Marino, but he admits he’s still got plenty to learn if he wants to eclipse the master of the art, Xabi Alonso. Wilshere described as 'ridiculous' a recent match in which Bayern Munich star Alonso completed an astonishing 204 passes against Cologne — that’s 117 more than Wilshere managed during his man-of-the-match display at Wembley. Listed are the two midfielders’ stats from those two matches, figures which reveal the ex-Liverpool schemer is in a class of his own.","Jack Wilshere has been almost ever present for Arsenal and has started all three England games .

"For a manager who is clearly something of an innovator, Sean Dyche is doing his best to sound old school. He is discussing management theory and the different ways in which he attempts to get an alternative view on improving performance at Burnley, when suddenly he changes tack. 'Sometimes it is what it is, by the way,' he says. 'When I came here the team was conceding 2.6 goals a game. It wasn't rocket science. It wasn't like I had to find some radical thing of making it work better, other than just shoring up the defence. Things like that were obvious.' Dyche is football management's latest miracle man, though he would take umbrage at the characterisation even if it is hard to avoid when he took Burnley up on a wage bill that was the 15th biggest in the Championship and after selling his star striker, Charlie Austin, to QPR. Sean Dyche took time out to talk to Sportsmail's Rob Draper ahead of Burnley's trip to West Brom on Sunday . Dyche looks up to the skies as he prays for his newly-promoted Burnley side to turn around their fortunes after a disappointing start to life in the Premier League . Clearly there is something about Dyche, as even he will concede. 'Before Christmas last season it was: 'Oh, they can't do it with just two strikers'. Then it was: 'Oh, they've been lucky with injuries'. No planning, of course. Just luck.' Now he has to do it again, only this time against Premier League clubs with wage bills 10 times his own and with a team who have scored one goal all season and have their two first-choice strikers, Danny Ings and Sam Vokes, injured. Burnley are joint bottom, have not scored in nearly nine hours and could do with a win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. Again, the problem staring him in the face does not require much analysis. 'At the minute we haven't scored the goals we wanted. Are we close? Yes. Do the stats suggest we're close? Yes. But now it's about looking at what kind of goals. What kind of goals do we want to score? How can we score those goals? So there's a detail within each detail.' Dyche expresses his frustration during Burnley's home clash with Sunderland last weekend . Scott Arnfield's brilliant effort against Chelsea is the only goal Burnley have to date  this season . Arnfield expresses his delight after giving the Clarets a shock lead against Jose Mourinho's side . Burnley players join Arnfield for the celebrations as he points towards the Burnley faithful after scoring . Dyche embraces with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho after their meeting at Turf Moor in their opening game . Still, a measure of how far Burnley have come is that US Network NBC are waiting to talk to him. Dyche makes himself at home in the Fifties bungalow that represents Burnley's media centre. It previously belonged to former Burnley forward and latterly groundsman, Arthur Bellamy, in perpetuity until his death last January. Now it is the hub of globalised media activity. Dyche, 43, stands at the centre of it. His positivity is unquenchable. A member of staff tells him the three 0-0 draws against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Sunderland represents the first time Burnley have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the top flight since 1968. Dyche loves that; a positive angle to be gleaned from three games without a goal. Conversely, he is perplexed by any cynicism. He is exasperated as to why some people were annoyed last week when U2's new album automatically downloaded free into iTunes: 'Why would you not want a U2 album? Dyche is a massive fan of Irish rock band U2 after revealing how much he rated their new album . 'Even if you don't like it, why would you not want it? Maybe my glass is always half full. But I can't see a negative when someone like U2 drop an album in your inbox. It's worth a listen. I like Dr Dre and all that. If Dr Dre wants to drop me a new album, happy days.' Kasabian are his ultimate band of choice and he has seen them so many times — 'I am partial to a gig' — that he launches into an explanation of the best venues at which to see them. 'When I came out of work at Watford, they had a gig at Brixton Academy, so the band sorted for me and the staff to go. Oh, it was brilliant. Brixton is fantastic. 'That's the real deal. Because I was bit more under the radar then, I could enjoy myself.' No more sessions in the mosh pit as a respectable manager? 'It's not so easy now.' Dyche brings something different to management. People have pointed to the fact that his dad, Alan, was a management consultant for British Steel. 'My dad worked in India and Egypt and we had three months in Mexico when we were kids,' he says. 'Snakes in the garden, iguanas in the loft and holidays in Zihuatanejo, which my assistant, Ian Woan, thought was a mythical place. Dyche applauds the Burnley fans, whom he holds a close relationship with, after the game against Chelsea . 'At the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Tim Robbins' character says: 'I'm going to a place called Zihuatanejo'. Woany said: 'I thought you'd made that up'. He didn't believe that we used to go to there when I was seven, jumping off my dad's shoulders into the water. 'My dad and I didn't sit there talking about management when I was a kid. But there were little key fundamentals. In the good old days, everyone would sit round a table and have a meal and converse. That's getting harder to do. We do it at home. I insist upon it as a family. 'Across that table we'd be talking about work and, as a kid, you don't get it at the time. And you don't know what box it lives in, that information. But as you get older you reflect on it and think: 'Oh, actually, yeah I remember that.' You're subliminally being educated about life.' Not that he would have you think he has hit on anything special. 'There's not a magic switch. I haven't found a magic solution to football management, no one has. I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel. I'm just trying to make the best wheel I can. The game has been going since the 1800s but the pitch is roughly the same size — the ball is lighter but it's roughly the same size — there's still 11 v 11. Of course there's technology but the fundamentals haven't changed. Dyche is confident Burnley will add the missing elements to their game and pick up some much needed wins . 'People talk about this tactical 4-1-4-1 or 4-3-3. But I played at Nottingham Forest in 1987. The keeper had to play out from the back, that was his instruction and get it out to centre-halves who would split to play and the right-back and left-back would go higher. Brian Rice on the one wing was coming inside rather than running on, allowing Stuart Pearce to go on the outside. 'Neil Webb was coming short to be the playmaker: now, of course, we call it the quarterback. Nigel Clough was coming in on the front line: now we call it the false No 9. And Lee Chapman was running off the shoulders, to stretch the pitch to allow all these things to happen. That sounds pretty modern to me. 'If I started saying: 'My deep-lying midfield, my screener, my false wingers and the false No 9…' I don't want to be on trend, I want things to work. I want a group that is beyond me. I don't wish to pontificate, I don't wish to brand myself up to the eyeballs. I'm just giving you an honest, authentic opinion.' Dyche is just trying to keep Burnley up. If he manages that though, he will be uber-fashionable.","Sean Dyche remains hugely optimistic about his side Burnley despite their frustrating start to the season .

"Ahead of Chelsea's trip to Manchester City on Sunday afternoon Sportsmail's  Rob Draper gives his thoughts on the big game at the Etihad Stadium. Frank’s Etihad blues . The last time City’s ex-Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard won a match at The Etihad Stadium, Robinho was making his debut for the home side. Lampard scored in a 3-1 Chelsea win in September 2008 but was an unused substitute when Chelsea twice played there last season. Now, he’s a City player, albeit temporarily, and if he plays on Sunday it will be his home debut for the club. Frank Lampard, in action against Arsenal last week, could make his Manchester City home debut against his former side Chelsea on Saturday . Diego the difference . Diego Costa has already scored seven Premier League goals, Fernando Torres managed only five in the whole of last season. Chelsea are going goal crazy in general at the moment. They have scored 15 in their four League games — last season the tally was four. Diego Costa celebrates scoring for Chelsea against Swansea earlier this season . City’s fair Sheik? Roman Abramovich supports the rules on financial fairplay, Sheik Mansour doesn’t. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is sympathetic to his boss, who has been ordered to rein in spending even though the club have no debts. ‘I understand if you have a big unpaid debt, you should be punished. But this is a club that doesn’t have a debt of one pound to anyone,’ said Pellegrini. Manuel Pellegrini believes clubs like Manchester City shouldn't face FFP punishment if they have no debt . Compatriot games . Some World Cup colleagues will be sworn enemies. City’s Belgium captain Vincent Kompany will be out to stop compatriot Eden Hazard. Chelsea’s Oscar and City’s Fernandinho shared the shame of losing 7-1 to Germany with Brazil. Vincent Kompany will be keen to get one over Belgian compatriot Eden Hazard and title rivals Chelsea . England misses out . How many Englishmen will start the biggest match of the Premier League season so far? Probably only three — Joe Hart (Man City), John Terry and Gary Cahill (both Chelsea). Though City duo James Milner and Lampard will hope to see action at some point. Manchester City keeper Joe Hart will be one of the only English players on show at the Etihad on Sunday .","Frank Lampard could make his home debut for the champions Manchester City against former side Chelsea .

"Not since Jurgen Klinsmann swallow-dived his way into Premier League history 20 years ago has a foreign striker made quite such an impressive entrance into English football as Diego Costa. It is not just the goal record, which is extraordinary — with a hat-trick and seven goals in four games. As with Klinsmann, whose scored seven in his first six games, it is the sheer force of personality of the player that has enthralled English audiences. Klinsmann's charisma became evident with that self-parodying celebration, diving to mock his reputation for going to ground easily. With Diego Costa, who faces the biggest test of his short Premier League career on Saturday against champions Manchester City, it is his clear relish for the physical battle that has made such an impact. Diego Costa scores his side's second goal during Chelsea's Premier League match against Swansea . Costa scores Chelsea's sixth goal against Everton at Goodison Park earlier this season . Jurgan Klinsman after scoring for Tottenham against Newcastle with one of his trademark celebrations . Klinsmann holds off Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira during a meeting between the sides in 1997 . Klinsmann heads home spectacularly for Tottenham against Coventry during a Premier League game in 1998 . Plenty of wonderful players have needed time to adjust to the confrontational ways of English football before demonstrating their best; Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry and Robert Pires would all fit into that category. By contrast, Costa, originally Brazilian but a naturalised Spaniard, looks like he was born to play in England. Defenders might look to be provoke or unsettle him — he has already been involved in spats with Everton's Seamus Coleman and Tim Howard — but Costa genuinely doesn't seem to care or even notice. 'The reality is, for the moment, I haven't had any really physical battles,' he said, when asked about that side of the League. 'Things have been going well. So far, I'm enjoying it.' The provocations? 'That happens here, it happened in Spain. 'Wherever I play, it'll always be like that. It's a perception people have of my character and people will look for any way to try to take advantage of it. 'They go looking for it. You've got to know how to manage these situations. The truth is I'm fairly relaxed. If they provoke me, I'll score against them!' Clearly Saturday's test against Vincent Kompany will be the severest yet, with Costa's manager Jose Mourinho conceding that playing him with a hamstring problem is a risk. Costa celebrates scoring his third goal during Chelsea's 4-2 over Swansea at Stamford Bridge . Costa used his power and strength to hold of Schalke duo Kevin Prince-Boateng and Chinedu Obasi . But Costa seems to be a fighter by nature. You suspected as much when he took on John Terry in the first leg of Atletico's Champions League semi-final clash last season, simply staring straight back at him as they squared up. Then, in the return leg, he gave as good as he got to Ramires and Branislav Ivanovic as they reprimanded him for taking an age to place the ball for his penalty, which he duly scored, effectively ending Chelsea's participation in the competition. All this at a time when it was fairly clear he would be moving to Stamford Bridge. Even his friends say he is a little crazy. 'Well, I don't like to lose, I think that gets noticed,' said Costa. 'It's something that many times goes well but other times goes badly for me. 'I'm just like that, I just always try to win, to get better, do my best and it always annoys me to lose. 'I think anyone in life, everyone in the world, no matter what work they do, should think of wanting to get on, to win, to improve. 'I don't think I am the type of person who thinks: 'Things are getting on top of me.' But it's not that I think I'm any different to most people. I always fight with all my strength, make the best of a situation.' Hard to believe now, but Costa was ignored by Brazilian clubs and was playing street football without a team until he was 16. Costa celebrates his strike for Atletico Madrid with his then team-mate Aguero back in 2010 . Costa has emerged from Aguero's shadow, and will line up against the Man City striker at the Etihad on Sunday . He was briefly at Barcelona Esportivo Capela, a club in the local reaches of Sao Paulo semi-pro football, before being brought to Braga in Portugal by agents. There his transfer value was eventually part-owned by Quality Sports Investment, the company which has Jorge Mendes, Mourinho's agent, as a key player and investor. They moved him to Atletico Madrid, where he sat behind Sergio Aguero, his City rival today, then Radamel Falcao in the Atletico pecking order. He was farmed out on loan to Celta Vigo, Albacete and Real Valladolid before eventually getting his chance. The transformation from being Aguero's back-up to becoming his direct rival today is fascinating. Costa said: 'I loved watching him. He is, for me, the best I saw play, the best as a teammate. He's one of the absolutely top-level forwards around. I knew when he was there, Sergio was God. You knew what a great player he was. The truth was I learned a lot with him. I hope things keep going well. Now, we'll see who comes out on top in this game.' Another Brazilian, Filipe Luis, has followed Costa to Chelsea from Atletico Madrid and knew him through the leaner years. 'I played with Diego five years ago and his growth has been huge,' said Filipe Luis. 'Every year he gets better and more confident. If you go back in his career and look where he started and how he suffered, he has never needed time to adapt in any place. Chelsea fans will be praying that the striker can continue his rich vein of goalscoring form at Manchester City . 'He always goes to a club and scores. For some players, like me, it is not easy when you get a new club, new team-mates and everything is new, especially the physicality. But for Diego it's never difficult.' The Chelsea left-back also sees a clear comparison between their manager and his star signing. 'Diego always wants to win and if he doesn't he gets crazy, he gets mad. He's that sort of person. Jose is also likes this. 'People with ambition, they always want to win and if you don't, it gets you mad. They try to get better and these sort of people really have to succeed in life. So even when he spent the early part of his career as second best and sent on loan, Costa didn't despair, according to Filipe Luis. 'He wanted to go. He wanted to prove first to himself and then to other clubs that he was a good player and that he deserved his place at Atletico. He is a simple person with a big heart. Sometimes on the field he looks like he is crazy and he has one of the purest hearts I've ever known so I am proud to be his friend.'

"They roared their team on in expectation of the win. The Emirates is rarely a placed for fiery passions but the home fans make an exception here for north London derbies. And those Arsenal fans knew the victory should be theirs. Arsenal had largely dominated against their neighbours. They had by far the best of the attacking play. They had a sprinkling of delightful offensive options in Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla, a trio that would grace almost any team in the world. Only Younes Kaboul and Hugo Lloris, giants in the Tottenham defence, stood between them and three points. Surely those points would come? Surely such an array of talent should be enough to overpower teams such as Spurs? Arsenal forward Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) scores the equaliser against Tottenham . Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates scoring the equaliser against Tottenham at the Emirates . Arsenal: Szczesny, Chambers, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Arteta (Flamini 28), Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey (Cazorla 45), Wilshere (Sanchez 63), Ozil, Welbeck. Subs Not Used: Rosicky, Podolski, Ospina, Coquelin. Booked: Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere, Chambers. Goals: Oxlade-Chamberlain 74. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Naughton, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Rose (Dier 83), Mason, Capoue, Lamela, Eriksen (Lennon 62), Chadli (Bentaleb 80), Adebayor. Subs Not Used: Soldado, Vorm, Townsend, Fazio. Booked: Lamela, Chadli, Adebayor, Lennon, Mason, Rose. Goals: Chadli 56. Att: 59,900 . Ref: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). And yet it was not to be. Arsenal’s infamous brittleness had cost them again. Games they should win, they draw; games in which they ought to be competitive, they end up being comprehensively beaten. It is almost pointless to single out the individuals — last night it was Mathieu Flamini, losing the ball in front of his own penalty area — as almost all the team are serial offenders. Spurs will be grateful for their draw. But until Arsene Wenger can address the vulnerabilities he has in shielding his defence — and he shows no sign of wishing to do so — there will be many more Groundhog Days like this. There was much speculation as to whether Ozil would feature in his favoured central role — or be shunted out to the left. As it was, he started out wide, but swapped the position regularly with Jack Wilshere, the two of them undertaking the wide left duties as though it were an undesirable job-share. And this derby felt a very Anglo-Saxon affair early on. Certainly the tackling was of a certain vintage. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere received yellow cards, all too keen to make their impression — literally — on Tottenham, before Erik Lamela added his own Latin mark, cautioned for a late challenge on Kieran Gibbs. And the football was of variable quality in that first half. What there was, was mainly created by Arsenal. Danny Welbeck was the first to inject some class into the game with a lovely flick past Jan Vertonghen and, leaving the Belgian in his wake, he was only denied by the assiduous covering run of Kaboul. Welbeck shot unconvincingly at Lloris on 22 minutes but it wasn’t until 28 minutes that Arsenal conjured another clear chance. Aaron Ramsey raced down the right and released Welbeck, who touched the ball back to Wilshere, who in turn struck the ball ferociously from the edge of the box with Lloris well positioned to save. Wilshere attacked Tottenham’s penalty area on 32 minutes, eventually falling under a challenge from Danny Rose and apparently twisting his ankle badly. Whether he was tripped or stumbled was a moot point, but referee Michael Oliver opted for the latter interpretation. Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli scores the opening goal against Arsenal on Saturday . Tottenham celebrate Nacer Chadli opening the scoring against Arsenal at the Emirates .

Ryan Mason                90      11.6          7.2 . Etienne Capoue          90      11.4          7.1 . Yet Arsenal remain a delight for positive-minded opponents. If Tottenham had more confidence or incision in their attacking positions they would surely have made more of the wide spaces in around Arsenal’s defensive line. Time after time players mis-controlled, stumbled over the ball or lost possession. Typical of their first half was the opening for Emmanuel Adebayor on 38 minutes. Set up nicely by Lamela, he simply prodded the ball too far in front of him. Similarly, from a tight angle but with a clear sight of goal, Nacer Chadli pulled his shot lamely wide on 45 minutes. Shortly before that Chadli chance, Arsenal created the best move of the match, Ramsey executing a lovely dummy before feeding Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose strike from outside the box tested Lloris to the full on 44 minutes. Sadly it was Ramsey’s last significant contribution, the Welshman limping off before half-time, joining Mikel Arteta, who had been withdrawn injured on 30 minutes. Ryan Mason was doing his utmost on his Premier League debut, having impressed against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup in midweek. But though he pressed forward, troubled Arsenal with driving runs on occasion, it was a big ask to pit against one of the finest midfields. Both he and Chadli were struggling to impose themselves. And Arsenal started the second half with similar attacking intent to the first. Substitute Cazorla ghosted past his man and forced Kaboul to divert his cross-shot for a corner. Then Wilshere found Ozil, with the German forcing a good save from Lloris from 12 yards. Yet Arsenal’s fragility when in possession is almost the defining feature of their football in the later Wenger years. So it would prove again. Flamini was caught by Christian Eriksen on the ball just outside his own area on 56 minutes. The Dane found Lamela, who played in Chadli. With Szczesny to beat, the Belgian didn’t disappoint, pulling the ball confidently past the keeper before turning to celebrate directly with a cupped ear in front of the Arsenal fans in a glorious breach of the usual etiquette, which earned him a booking. Arsenal, stirred, almost responded immediately, Per Mertesacker rising ever upwards to head a free-kick goalwards. For a moment it appeared he had scored before Lloris scrambled the ball away off the line. Arsenal, though, had dominated the attacking play and it seemed unlikely they would be denied for 90 minutes. So it proved on 75 minutes, when Lamela scuffed a clearance, which fell to Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean dragged the ball back to Cazorla but his shot was deflected and the chance seemed to end in calamity, when Welbeck hit an embarrassing air shot just yards from goals. But amid the confusion caused, Oxlade-Chamberlain was following up and smashed the ball high into the net from six yards.

"Gareth Southgate could field this England U21 line up . Gary Neville has insisted that the new generation of young England players have taken ownership of a new attacking style that Roy Hodgson is attempting to introduce to the team. With Hodgson’s job security receiving a massive boost in a 2-0 victory in Switzerland, England coach Neville has claimed that England are beginning to reap the benefits of Hodgson’s youth policy and his tactical flexibility. Wayne Rooney revealed he had led players’ only tactical meetings during the recent international break and Neville said: ‘Behind the scenes things are changing. In Basle the players put their arms around each other for the national anthem. 'They went into a huddle after the game. These young lads have to engage publicly, not just privately, their passion for representing their country. ‘The homework some of the players have mentioned encourages them to think about being an England player all year round, rather than turning up and thinking: “Here we go again, it’s international week”. ‘There needs to be a club spirit and club unity on and off the pitch. Asking them to look at videos, offer feedback and think how they might improve keeps England in their thoughts all year round. It is about the players finding answers for themselves.’ Wayne Rooney led players' only meetings during the international break with England and their youngsters . Gary Neville says England manager Roy Hodgson's tactical flexibility is being helped by his youth policy . Gary Neville says youngsters must 'engage publicly, not just privately, their passion for representing' England . Gary Neville on England's youngsters: ‘There needs to be a club spirit and club unity on and off the pitch' Neville also says Hodgson has deliberately blooded young players early, though the manager is considering pulling some of the younger players out of the senior side to play them in this summer’s European Under-21 Championships. ‘It will just be a question of Gareth [Southgate, the Under-21 coach] and I deciding which ones are the right ones to send.’ Hodgson said. ‘I am not putting any riders on it at all at the moment. ‘What I am saying is: “Let’s look at players who could play, let’s see what they have been doing club-wise, international-wise and let’s make a good decision — one that Gareth is happy with and one that I think is a wise decision too”. It will be a real discussion point between Gareth and I and we get on very well in that respect. England beat Switzerland 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday with goals from Danny Welbeck . Gary Neville says Roy Hodgson has deliberately blooded young players (eligible for the U21 side) early . ‘I am certain there will be players who will have made an appearance with us or will have certainly been with us and we are going to say: “Look, just because you have been with us for a while that doesn’t make you a 100 per cent bona fide senior that never plays anywhere else. It just makes you an England player and we are going to use you where we think best”.’ If England Under-21s win their qualification play-off against Croatia next month, a full-strength side at Euro 2015 could theoretically see Jon Flanagan, Calum Chambers, John Stones, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw, all of whom have England senior caps, selected. Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones are also eligible to play for the Under-21s but, given their roles in the senior side, are likely to be kept fresh, with a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 coming before another Euro 2016 qualifier away in Slovenia on June 14.

"Manuel Pellegrini hit out at the performance of England’s most senior referee, Mark Clattenburg, claiming that his performance cost Manchester City a win over Arsenal, saying that he had missed two fouls from which Arsenal scored and a clear penalty for City. The City manager also implied it would be difficult to retain the title given the hurdles that were being put in front of the team and drew attention to the fact that Clattenburg had also missed a City penalty in the 3-2 defeat against Liverpool last April, a game which at the time looked as if it would cost City the title. The clash between the Premier League’s leading referee and the manager of the title holders is sure to become a theme of the season, with Clattenburg likely to referee many of the showpiece games. Jack Wilshere appeared to handle the ball inside the area but no penalty was awarded to Manchester City . Danny Welbeck's 'foul' on Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany also enraged Manuel Pellegrini . Laurent Koscieln, according to Manuel Pellegrini, fouled in the build up to Jack Wilshere's equaliser . Manchester City's Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini gestures during Saturday's match . Pellegrini claimed that Clattenburg had missed a foul on Sergio Aguero for Arsenal’s first goal, a push on Vincent Kompany for the second and a handball in the area by Jack Wilshere with the score at 2-1 to Arsenal, though all three decisions appeared marginal calls. Pellegrini said: ‘I’m very satisfied with the point. It’s a good point when they scored two illegal goals. The first goal was unbelievable. The referee didn’t want to whistle [for the foul on Aguero] and the second goal was a clear push by Welbeck on Kompany when he cleared the ball with the head. ‘We finished with a clear penalty, both hands, twice handled by Wilshere inside the box in front of the linesman. It was as clear as last season against Liverpool, with Skrtel’s fist inside the box. It was with the same referee.’ Pellegrini was referring to a punch Martin Skrtel made at the end of Liverpool’s win last season but insisted he did not have a personal agenda against Clattenburg. ‘I don’t have a problem with him,’ he said. ‘He had a very bad day against Liverpool and today he had a very bad day. Arsenal scored both goals with fouls so he cost us our victory. Manchester City's Frank Lampard is booked by referee Mark Clattenburg at the Emirates Stadium .

Szczesny had to make two very good saves at the end.’ Pellegrini added he felt forced to substitute Sergio Aguero after 67 minutes because he had already received a yellow card and feared with the referee his striker would get sent off. Arsene Wenger said: ‘There were situations where there was a real fight for the ball and we made a foul and they made a foul and the referee decided to let it go. I don’t think that explains why we scored after, because there was a lot to do after that!’ Alexis Sanchez shoots on the volley to beat Manchester City keeper Joe Hart and give Arsenal the lead .
